						   Terry was telling me that he did an interview on Wednesday with  urlLink Mix 96 , and they repeated the inteview yesterday every hour, on the hour. He's also been interviewed by Stoke Mandeville hospital radio, and plans also to be interviewed by 3 counties radio. It's nice to see his books are starting to sell now.

						   Well, me and Jeff have just come back from a certain pub in a certain nearby village. We had a meal and discussed our forthcoming itinery in Canada. While we were waiting for the food to arrive, the waitress noticed all our books on Canada spread across the table, a scale model of the CN tower*, posters advertising Niagara Falls, Pots of Maple Syrup*, Maps of Toronto opened up, T-shirts saying I'm going to Canada*-not to mention overhearing every sentence uttered by the two of us, that began with the not-so-cryptic words, 'When we're in Canada...,' and she hovvered by our table and said, 'Hmm..yo' going to Canada then?'   So what will we be doing then? Welllllll, aside from the trip on the  maid of the mist  under Niagara Falls which is already paid for, we've established that we're going to go up the CN Tower and possibly have a meal up there-that way they waive the entrance fee. We'll go on a guided tour of Toronto on the Monday complete with picture stops. That way anything we see on the tour that interests us sufficiently we'll explore later in the week. We've decided to also go on a ferry that tours the islands around Toronto-the views from the sea are incredible. I want to photograph the building where Earnest Hemingway started off his career in Yonge Street(The largest street in the world), and also the church where the Cowboy Junkies recorded one of their sessions. Perhaps we'll also visit the comedy club where Dan Akroyd and Jim Carey started there career. I think we're going to have to visit one of the ice hockey stadiums, or the baseball stadium also while we're there. I sent an Email to&nbsp;friend in Toronto and asked for help in finding the nearest Hall to our hotel, and he very helpfully obliged, so hopefully on the Tuesday we'll be able to go to a meeting. On the Thursday we'll be in another hotel-this time in Niagara, so I've still got to find out where the nearest meeting place is there. But, I'm working on it.... Just 38 days to go now!   *=Not actually true.

						   Recently, I've been helping out a friend put together their website. He's a writer of finance books, and has just set up his own publishing company called TwigBooks. The website can be found at  urlLink twigbooks.com . Anyway, Terry has very generously offered to pay me 2% of whatever profits are made for helping him(after he's broken even) so please buy!!!!

						   At Milton Keynes yesterday afternoon, I went to see Oscar Wilde's,  'The importance of being Earnest ' starring Wendy Craig.  urlLink Picture.  From an actors perspective, it has to be one of the most charming plays ever created in the English Language. Because the play has such distinctive, well-rounded and extremely well known-parts, each actor is seriously limited in the liberties which they can take with regards to stretching their role. For instance, how many different ways can Lady Bracknell cry out with indignation, 'A handbag! You was found in a handbag!' without triggering the audience into mass revolt? With that in mind, Christopher Luscombe could probably of directed the performance using semaphore from a holiday home on the south coast of Australia, and none of the audience would of been any the wiser. Despite there being an auto-pilot element about the performances, you could tell the whole cast still enjoyed acting out their polished-to-perfection roles. The scenery and props did not overly clutter the stage, but remained tasteful, and simple through each of the three different acts. I didn't quite understand the lighting. The 1st act set in Algernon Moncreff's flat was fairly dark which was understandable since it WAS inside. The 2nd Act, which was in the garden at Manor House, Woolton, was only slighly brighter, despite being supposedly set outside in brilliant sunshine, but it was the 3rd Act that really threw me-it was INSIDE the Manor House yet the lighting was dazzlingly bright:even brighter then the garden outside. Even with all my lights on, the interior of my house can not compete with direct sunlight. Surely, it would of been even more unlikely in 1912, when the play was set? Was there some strange curvature of light through space and time, or something on the Milton Keynes stage? Yes, it's just a silly observation, but nevertheless I still could not allow it to escape my mind. I liked Josephine Tewson.  urlLink Picture . (who is best known for her role as Liz in  Keeping up appearances ). She played her part earnestly-excuse the pun, with a resonance that stuck all the right chords. The only actor who failed to display any stage presence at all was a certain Frank Middlemass. He may have have made his name by proving very competant in the past, but in this piece, he struggled to project his voice to the audience, and there was a number of times, where frankly Frank Middlemass seemed to fluff his lines! But overall a wonderfull production of a wonderful play. 8/10

						   Finally, got the chance to see Willy Russell's musical, 'Blood Brothers,' performed at the Milton Keynes theatre. I must of seen a dozen shows at this venue. It's a good location. MK is an attractive, large capacity (1400 seats) modern built theatre. Blood brothers was an enjoyable musical with a very capable cast headed by Linda Nolan. The play was a mixture of surprizingly good music(given that Willy Russel also wrote the score), well-acted drama, and laugh-out-loud comedy. The character known as Mickey played by Sean Jones especially stood out. The range of his acting was so diverse-seeing him extract every last drop of humour from the childhood he so effectvely portrayed (riding around on imaginary horses and firing imaginary guns into imaginary Indians) right through to the true depth of inner turmoil he displayed once the deep insecurities of his poverty-stricken life had surfaced, and the dark shadows of memory and consequence had taken its toll. I only had two problems with the play itself. Firstly, the outcome and ending of the play is revealed in the opening 1st few minutes. I realise that most writers only undertake such an operation because it allows us the audience to gain that sense of 'completeness' having watched the show and seen the slowly developed tension resolved through returning to the same visual motiff we saw at the beginning. It works very effectively in some scripts, however in BB, in some respects it killed the play, reducing at once, any potential of the script having an emotional impact upon us, because as an audience we always knew what was coming. Secondly, I had a problem with the soap-box politics of the script. The two brothers were seperated at birth and both went on to live radically different lives unaware of one another, and the script went to great lengths to explain this was entirely as a result of their different circumstances and surroundings. Not only was this message implied, it was explicitly stated by at least two of the characters - that if you grow up in a poor environment, and get none of the chances that others automatically get, then you'll almost certainly fail in life. This is simply not true. Often those who grow up in harsh, oppresive conditions brought about through poverty, grow up to be VERY successful achievers. Such ones often have a stronger desire to achieve, perhaps because they have so much more to prove, whereas those who are priviledged by having everything handed to them on a plate, often lack the required motivation. The play itself proves my point. Liverpool from where Willy Russel originates and from where the play itself is set, has always had one of the highest levels of unemployment in the developed world, at times in the past having levels that have approached 25%-certainly by Russel's own left-wing agenda, not exactly an ideal climate for success-yet from this same city, there has been an explosion of talent; the poets Adrian Henri, Roger McGough and Brian Patten, the dramatists Alan Bleasdale, Phil Redmond(Brookside), Chris Bernard(Letter to Brezhnev), and Willy Russel himself - not to mention the whole mereseybeat scene, the numerous comedians; Alexie Sayle, Arthur Askey, Leonard Rossiter, Jimmy Tarbuck, Kenny Everett... well, the list goes on. Overall however, these criticisms were minor, and as such, probably reveal more about me, then the play itself. I did very much enjoy the show. It's well, worth seeing.   8/10

						   Hmmm...I'm assuming you've heard about my forthcoming adventure to the ever-so small metropolis of Toronto? No? But how can that be? - It's my 1st trip abroad, and oi thought I'd told EVERYONE! Ah, well...in May, I'm flying to Canada for a week. We'll be visiting Niagara Falls, and we've booked a trip on the world famous, 'Maid of the Mist' in which you get ABSOLUTELY soaked, and all for nothing. Apparently, as an extra they've thrown in a deal, where you can climb into an old barrel of your choice, and they'll also push you over the edge. Again, no charge. Wow! Land of the free, eh? Perhaps, that generosity will extend to other things as well. Like taxi cabs giving me a 'free' tour of the city, when I just wanted to cross to the other side of the road! As far as going up the CN tower(The world's tallest unsupported structure) is concerned, that particular issue is still being hotly, and rather anxiously debated.) I'm not sure I like that word 'unsupported' - It's a tad too descriptive. It makes the rapid ascent up into the stratosphere sound a little uncertain! Since, I'm only staying in Toronto a week, I realize I'm going to have to make every day count. With that in mind I've ordered a 'Lonely Planet' guide to Toronto, so that I can plan my trip in a bit more detail, before I actually get there. Everything's paid for except the food, but since food is extremely cheap in N.America and they stack everything up on your plate, I'm not really expecting too much expense beyond the standard bargain bucket basement price already outlayed. However.....given that the deal is sooo cheap, I'm expecting to be flying in some old Russian, demilitarized troop carrier, decked out with...well deck chairs. The plane will climb, and we'll all crash to the back of the plane in a heap, sitting on top of one another. Ah, well...it will keep us warm! Since, I don't imagine there'll be heating either! Or alternatively, maybe they'll just push us out the back of the plane with a parachute, 'There you are, Toronto's down there!' they'll say, 'Mind the CN tower.' 'And if you get blown off course, whatever you do, just don't land on Niagara falls. They've got mad people there. Just as you land, you might be bashed over the head by someone doing a double-back somersault, spinning round in their barrel as they tumble freestyle off the edge of the Falls, shouting, 'I'm mad me!' Anyway, just-a-60 days to go now.... (My Email address is richard@hp20.com)

						   I heard a story that apparently was true on the radio the other day concerning the explorer Captain Cook, and I wanted to write it down.   "Capt. James Cook had a problem with his men. They kept getting scurvy. Having invested so much money into his voyages, obviously seeing his crew getting sick was not something he wanted. It was brought to his attention that German sailors however didn't get scurvy. The reason he put this down to was, that German sailors took barrels of sauerkraut on board with them when they went to sea. So Capt. Cook bought some barrels of sauerkraut himself and placed them on board his ship. Given that it is rather an acquired taste he knew that his sailors wouldn't touch the stuff, so the question is, how did he get them to eat it?"   "It was quite ingenious. What he did was, he instructed that the words, 'For officers only,' be written on each of the barrels. Why did he do this? As soon as his sailors saw the signs, they naturally took offence. So in the middle of the night, the men crept down to where the barrels were being kept, and helped themselves. "If it's good enough for the officers,' they thought, 'it's good enough for us." The plan worked. The scurvy stopped, and Cook no doubt sat in his cabin laughing at just how clever he was."   The only reason Capt.Cook's plan worked was he knew that his men would immediately feel a deep sense of injustice, as soon as they saw those barrels. He knew human nature. The fact that to most English people sauerkraut probably tastes disgusting-well, that didn't matter. It was the principle. Once the men had been deluded into thinking they were being cheated, he knew they would eat it, whatever it tasted like.   We're all surrounded by injustice and we each experience that injustice every day of our lives. For most of us, the way we react to that injustice is just as predictable as the sailors course of action.

						   Much of the morning today was spent thinking about a man you just could not meet every day. Bill was not even his real name. For some reason he just seemed to look like a 'Bill,' so that's what everyone called him. When I met him on W High street about 10 years ago, he was about 74 years of age, and he was kneeling down outside his home pumping up a flat tyre on his bicycle. I can still picture him now. About 5 foot 2, with grey hair and glasses. He looked at me, and I looked at him and there was this silent moment of recognition. Then he said the most fantastic opening sentence, 'Oh, I'm just pumping up my tyre!' and he slowly nodded to me as he said it, just in case there was any doubt. I was caught off guard by his simplistic and patently obvious statement. Now,  that  was the way to start a conversation. Draw people in with intrigue. Why did he say something that I already knew? I could see he was pumping up his tyre. But, that's what Bill was like. He'd never go the predictable generic route when you talk to people-Oh, talk about the weather, or ask the person how they are. He always liked to throw you a ball you couldn't catch. 'What do you think about this?' he'd say, as he pulled out a newspaper cutting. Everyday, that I saw him I felt more and more of an affinity with him. He didn't do, 'small talk.' Bill would always be pottering about in his back garden when I called. I'd open the gate to access the small block of flats he lived in, and hear the sound of his footsteps, and immediately it would make me smile, because I knew he was there and we could talk. He'd just say, 'Richard...,' and then launch into whatever he had been thinking about. Gradually, he allowed me more and more insight into his fascinating life. He often talked about the war. He'd worked in Royal Ordinance and had built bombs. However, he never talked like many war veterans, bandying phrases like, 'Fight for your country,' or 'bring back national service,' he saw war for what it was-a terrible and evil cloud that discoloured humanity. The thing that I remember most about him though was his complete disregard for following any specific pattern or formula when it came to conversation. That's how conversation between friends should be. No falseness, or formula. Whatever entered into Bill's head, he just went with it. We'd talk for about half an hour every day on subjects like friendship, history, family, village life - all sorts of things. Anything he learnt from a book, he wanted everyone else to share in that knowledge, so he told them, whether they liked it or not! I wanted to believe that Bill enjoyed our conversations as much as I always did. If I ever arrived early or late, he'd never be there, which made me suspect he was lonely and deliberately found something to do in his garden when I called. When I left, I asked my replacement about 6 months later how Bill was doing, and I explained where Bill lived, and all my replacement could say was, 'Who's Bill?' They'd never even met...  For me, he was quite simply a man who you did not meet everyday. I still wish I could talk in that pure, undiluted, straight from the mind manner that was his specialty; unrestrained and unburdened from the custom and social expectation of tedious conversation. He died several years ago, and I miss him. I think it must of been my colleague Heather Cartwright's sudden death last weekend that got me thinking about the past and the people that I've known.  urlLink Heather's website.  I've known some wonderful people.

						   There is nothing I like better then to see a well-crafted script from a writer who has truly learnt his trade -where as soon as you see the actors march onto the stage from the wings, as an audience you just know that this is going to be something different. You settle down into your chair, as the lights dim and you can almost feel that dynamic energy in the air. You can see the expectancy and the excitement in the way the actors walk, the way they breath, they way they look at each other. They know. That this is something new, and something daring. As soon as the actors stepped onto the stage at Milton Keynes this afternoon to perform 'Full Circle' I knew from their expressions, the play itself was not going to stretch anyone. And it didn't.   That's not to say, the show didn't have it's moments. I liked the scene where the writer Denise Darvel (Collins) introduces her 3 children to their respective fathers who they've never met before. Each father is told what a wonderful child they have. The children are too shy at 1st to emerge from their bedrooms to meet their fathers, so Denise shouts upstairs, 'Come on darlings, it's okay. You can come down.' And out onto the landing instead of the children steps Darvel's best friend who has heard them talking and opens the door to investigate. Darvel's friend is a 50-ish Dr, named Edward. The fathers look at each other in horror below. They themselves are about the same age as Edward! Finally, Sir Michael Anstruther cries out, '-Well, he's NOT mine!' It was the look on his face that did it. You couldn't help but laugh.   It was a unique experience for me being on the front row. I'm usually 2/3 rows from the front. This time my feet were actually touching the stage. I was that close, I could hear the actors breath! John Quayle stole the show with his catalogue of quintessential English mannerisms. The nervous laughter filtered through every set dialogue. His eyes rolled and he cringed at just about everything he came into contact with. Here was a man who would go bright red if a woman just pointed the merest hint of a smile in his direction. It's his trademark, and he's built a whole career upon it. But it was Joan Collins everyone came to see. ( urlLink Picture of Joan & Biography ) Star of over 50 films. She's worked with just about everyone; Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Gregory Peck, John Gielgud, Gene Kelly, Bette Davis....the list goes on forever.   This is the kind of thing Joan Collins could do in her sleep. At one point, she stood right in front of me and I was only 5/6 foot away from her. She's certainly looked after herself over the years and she's aged well. However, there was a dullness in her eyes-probably from the lack-luster script and knowing about the oh-so predictable ending that was still to come. Joan Collins, I would have to say is probably better then this.   Overall, I would say the play contained some excellent acting, but it was let down with an uninspired script. 6/10

						   At Psalms 108:2 it says, ' ....I will awaken the dawn .' That's quite a poetic sentence really if you think about it. It reminds me of  Nessan Dorma  which translated means,  'None shall sleep .' That's probably what goes through the minds of all my neighbours every morning at 4.30 am, after I've been up and down the stairs several times, run the bath, had my bath, got dressed, fed the cat, got my breakfast, turned my computer on, and cleaned my teeth! None shall sleep-Aha, well not if you have the misfortune of living next to me, that is.   Here's a bit of free advice. If you're ever in a foreign country and there isn't a clock in the room and it's dark and you desperately need to know the time, all you have to do is start banging on a drum, and sing out loudly in the most disturbingly tuneless, raucous style you can manage, because someone will open their window immediately and shout out, 'WHO'S MAKING ALL THAT NOISE? DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS? IT'S......' and then you'll have your answer. -See, that was a bit of practical, useful information that was. You think this is all trivia, don't you? THIS is important stuff! In fact, it's an education. You go away thinking, 'Well, that's taught me!!'

						   I was just thinking about my PC and the worrying amount of things attached to it. I've got a scanner, a printer, a joystick, a web cam, a broadband modem, a digital camera and a separate stand alone microphone. On top of that in this room there's also a stereo, a guitar amplifier, a ceiling light, a table lamp, and an effects processor. When I leave the room, and I shut the door, I swear the street lamp outside burns that much brighter, trains start to run faster, and the traffic lights start getting back into sequence again! With all my electric gagetry switched off, and all that electricity suddenly restored to the national grid, I wouldn't be surprised....

						   I was recently sent the transcription (Thank you Melissa) of the will of one of my ancestors that lived in Sussex. I don't really expect you to read through this extremely convoluted text in its entirety - I almost fell asleep and I'm related to the man in question, but scan through it if you will and notice how the legal writer puts the document together. I could probably compress the entire document into about 20 sentences. But, that would be too easy. Why use one word, when you can use one hundred and sixty three thousand to say the exact same thing? -Okay, it WAS written in 1768, but still, is legal writing any less convoluted today? *Warning do not read if you have a heart condition. Ideally, you should be connected up to a heart monitor, and a Dr should be in the room with you if you do choose to read it-such is the mindnumbing danger of flatlining and being placed in a coma.

						   Terry's book, 'Get Out of Debt' has now been accepted within the hallowed pages of the Amazon catalogue, which he was pleased about. The image of the cover is rather small though. When I scanned the cover, unfortunately because it's mostly white, under Amazon's entry criteria you're not allowed to put a border around the frame, there was always going to be empty space around the image, but it does look pitifully small.  urlLink Amazon Page showing image.

						   I think I went a bit overboard with my online purchases over the last few days. As a result of my extensive spending spree, I'm fully expecting the financial times to publish details of how certain online company shares prices sky-rocketed upwards especially on the morning of the 9th April, 2004! 'There was euphoria in the city, as stockbrokers-normally safe, unexciting individuals, surprised many by taking all their clothes off and streaking through Trafalgar Square! They took to the streets in their hundreds. They took everything from their desk, and took early retirement on the strength of this sudden surge on the FTSE index.' -That sort of thing. And, as I watch the news in the evening, I'll see a mass of crowds surrounding Buckingham Palace, complete strangers kissing one another, hats being thrown up into the sky - people simply unable to restrain their collective joy from this unexpected turnaround of national prosperity. No doubt, I'll see people crying in front of the TV cameras thanking the anonymous benefactor for keeping their workplaces in business and their children from being placed in orphanages, and as I listen to their emotionally charged voices, I will nod like a wise old sage, wiping a few tears away from my own face, and allow myself a slow, satisfied smile, knowing it was all down to ME! Maybe, they'll call it Good Friday or something, to reflect the event, instead of the numerous other days such as Black Monday, when instead of shares spiralling upwards they went downwards. So what did I buy? Well....amongst other things, that are now winging their way to me, via Royal Mail (You know, they're sooooo dedicated; overworked, and underpaid. They really are!)   1) urlLink A travel clock  (How else am I going to know when to catch the plane back? Exactly!)  2) urlLink A leather passport wallet  (You'd have to see it. It's luvverly! A nylon sleeve. The passport slides in and out so easily. Wooooosh!).  3) urlLink Some ear plugs .(Well...it could be noisy on the plane.).  4) urlLink A K.J hardback New testament bible  from the everyman's library series. Looks good on a bookcase. Could also prove useful during the long flight.'  5+6) urlLink 2 DVD's .  7.A currency converter.  8.A UK/US plug.  9.A security coded luggage strap and baggage tags.   ...the day's not over yet!   10.A suitcase.  11.2 pairs of flight/travel socks to combat DVT.

						   The following text I submitted to Friends Reunited on the 12th August, 2003, under the heading, 'Last Day At Brookmead School.'   "I distinctly remember walking over to the foolball pitch where two or three of my classmates stood waiting. They were just idly kicking a football backwards and forwards, which if you think about it, surely has to rank as one of the dumbest activities of them all - it's right up there with catch. What's that all about? The football kept bouncing around in this very small circle from one foot to the next. The bizarre thing is I don't truly remember even who was with me that day. But, what I do remember is the silence. Apart from the occasional giggle, or laugh, it was as if we were so intensely aware of what was about to happen, ( that as each of us slipped through that front gate for the very last time, some of us literally would never see each other again, ) none of us appeared willing to affect the moment by actually speaking. Each of us were deeply caught up in our own thoughts. I remember our teacher Lee Marsh seeing us in the distance, and walking right over to the other side of the field to be with us. He immediately and intuitively tapped into this unspoken code, and he too hardly said anything. He just joined in, occasionally giggling or laughing, if the ball went too far, or not far enough. Yes, maybe, it is a peculiarly male thing: this macho desire to retain and conceal emotion. But, that silence is what I remember more then anything else. There was something noble and unique about it. It seems to me, more was expressed during that particular silence, then many of the vast number of conversations I've had since. "

						   A few years ago I heard a story of an interesting examination that took place. The exam consisted of just one question, and that was, "What is confidence?" An intriguing question for anyone under test conditions. Most people who sat that exam rapidly started to write down as much information as they could in the allotted time. However, one student was different from the rest, and did something quite unexpected. While everybody was busy writing down pages and pages of information, this one student calmly wrote down just two words. Underneath the question, "What is confidence?" he just wrote, "This is, " and then left the rest of the page totally blank. In effect, he was saying, "I'm so confident I'm going to pass, I'm not even going to write out an essay. That's how confident I am. Perhaps as the examiners read those two small words on that very large piece of paper, there was a curious smile at first, followed immediately by the inevitable second smile - the realisation they had come face to face with genious. Ever since my brother first told me that story I've never succeeded in coming up with a more perfect answer to that question. Certainly, I've tried.

						   We left Toronto at about 1pm (Canadian time) The flight took 6 hours, which meant that we would land in England at about 7pm(or 12pm London time). I saw an iceberg on the journey home. Wahoo!! Right in the middle of the Atlantic with hundreds of miles of water all around it. -Though, I think we was quite safe from being struck at 35,000 feet!  Even though it was the middle of the night and cloudy, we could still see the bright lights of London on the approach as we touched down at Gatwick Monday morning. Amazingly, the nice, kind staff at Gatwick long stay car park were very accommodating once we told them our initial flight had been cancelled, so they waived the surcharge for staying an extra day. Arriving back in A at about 3am, most of the morning was spent recovering from the flight with a much needed 7 hours sleep.  The thing that I remember most about the trip was not Niagara Falls, however impressive they were, or the ride to the top of the CN tower, or even my first ever flight. The thing that I remember most was a solitary statue of a soldier in uniform standing on a podium, in the gardens approaching the Falls. The statue might just as well have been invisible, cloaked against the backdrop of the bright lights, neon signs, and garish commercialism that is imprinted upon the street that is called Clifton Hill. The plaque at the foot of the statue reminded those who paused as they rushed forward, of the Men Of Niagara, who gave up their lives during the war serving their country. It was just the thought that these men who had grown up listening to the roar of the water crashing into the river below, who had stared up at the blue sky and felt the mist settle upon their face, who had witnessed its tremendous boulder-crushing power-perhaps even seen some of the rocks fall-these men had seen this force of nature 1st hand. They had lived their short lives in an area of such outstanding beauty, but had gone off to fight an incredibly ugly, distant war on a distant continent. Maybe, they didn't even fully understand what they were fighting for. Of course, there are memorials all over the world in just about every country, in each city, town and even village, but in Niagara it seemed to have an almost overwhelming impact upon me.  The complete waste of almost an entire generation, who no doubt were filled with excitement just like anyone else who had their whole lives still ahead of them, who should have been showing their grandchildren around the falls today, recounting deep abiding memories of the place where they had once learnt about life. This was the place where all their dreams originated and spun from, but everything that had once lived so vibrantly, had now turned to stone. All that was left to remember the Men From Niagara was a few engravings etched into a piece of rock.   ( urlLink To see holiday photographs, click here! )

						   Funds were running a bit low by this stage so we elected to find the cheapest breakfast bar we could find. After a few minutes walking we came across a breakfast bar that sold as much as you could eat for just $6.99(£3) which seemed about as cheap as we were going to find. The food was okay. Perhaps it could of been a little warmer. The trouble with how cheap food is in North America, I think me and Jeff both during the week developed a taste for rich food which was not good. I think we had pretty much the same thing that day; Bacon, sausages, mushrooms, scrambled egg, toast, pancakes with maple syrup, and 2 or 3 cups of coffee. Well....we were representing England!  The rest of the morning was spent walking around Niagara one last time, buying the last remaining gifts, and packing in preperation for the long trip home.  Our plane was due to take off this evening at about 8.50pm, (Canadian time)but announcements kept being made on the tannoy that there was a 'small, minor problem' and the plane would not be allowed to take off until it was fixed. Eventually after numerous delays, we were allowed to board the plane, and then there was a further delay because the newly fitted component failed again. Finally after 2 hours of waiting, trying to fix the 'small, minor' mechanical fault, at 30 mins past midnight the pilot requested that we get off, and a new flight would be scheduled the next day for us. So each of us were dispatched to different hotels in the city. Me and Jeff got the Park Plaza, which is located in Carlson Court, and was actually posher then the 2 hotels we had paid for.  What annoyed me most, was just how rude some passengers were, and I'm embarrassed to say it was mostly the English. It's desperately sad that you can travel halfway around the world, and yet there's always the loud-mouthed Englishman complaining. The only ones worse then the English were the Americans. One American woman who obviously had all inhibitions stripped from her at birth, and had grown up on a diet of Oprah Winfrey public spectacles, and felt absolutely no shame in making a scene, went straight to the front of the queue and demanded loudly that Air Transat immediately get her home, and she wasn't moving until they did! Unfortunately, once she was told that they couldn't accommodate that request because the airport had closed down for the night, none of the aircrew could work any longer because of shift guidelines and all would have to exceed their hours even if another plane could be found, this created a stand-off that went on for a clear half hour and as a consequence everyone suffered. What did she expect? Would she rather another plane had been chartered and we had crashed into the Atlantic because the pilot fell asleep? Or perhaps we should of used the plane with the mechanical fault, and again crashed into the Atlantic. Would that have been more to her liking? Oh, I almost forgot to mention the French Canadian rock band on their 1st tour of England. Each member insisted on a separate room!! People, eh? We were all tired and simply wanted our hotel passes so we could go off and get some sleep. But we had to wait so much longer because of various passengers unreasonable rantings. What has happened to this world? Nowadays people convince themselves that they must assert themselves. If they don't exercise that right then it's a sign of weakness. That we all have this inbuilt, and invariable RIGHT to complain. What about the Air Transat staff? Do they not also have rights? The right not to be bullied and verbally abused, for something that ultimately was not their fault. Did the American woman feel the Air Transat staff had deliberately sabotaged their own plane just so that they could receive the 'privilege' of listening to her nasty verbal rants?? If you went out to your car in the morning and found that it wouldn't start, would you instantly sue the car dealership for selling you the car? You have to be reasonable in these things. Mechanical things do breakdown.... Personally, I thought Air Transat treated us well. They paid for our rooms, and our breakfast. They also gave us $150 of travel vouchers for us to use with Air Transat again, to compensate us for our inconvenience. We finally touched down at Gatwick at about 1am UK time Monday morning, almost 12 hrs late. It had been a tiring, but enjoyable week.

						   In the morning we got up very early to avoid the crowds, because we had booked to go on the good ship, 'Maid of the Mist.' I say that in a singular sense, but in actual fact there was  three: one of them set off from the US side of the Falls and the other two from the Canadian side(Our jetty). So, did we get soaked on the Maid of the Mist? Well, they do give you bright blue waterproofs (very fetching) as part of the package, which mostly keeps you dry, however the sheer force of hundreds of tons of water crashing down to the river below creates much more then a mere mist, more a sideways downpour as you get closer to the foot of the falls. This particular 'mist' drenches you from the neck up. At times it's difficult even to see anything because of all the water in your eyes. Perhaps, I should of brought some goggles! It's a very well organized tour, but having been running for 150 years it should be. As soon as the boats sets off, a pre-recorded tape starts to play, which mentions among other things, different ones who have gone over the falls and survived, a description of how much erosion of the rocks there has been down the years, famous people who have been on the boat, etc. It was a very enjoyable trip, and a chance to see the Falls from a completely different angle.  In the evening, we walked around Niagara looking for a good restaurant to eat in. It's such a small town it doesn't take long to spot them all. One thing I noticed was that outside most restaurants there's a, 'greeter' whose whole job is simply to persuade you to come in. Since this is something that doesn't happen in England, it can be a bit off-putting at first, until you get used to it. A typical exchange was outside an Italian restaurant.   Greeter: Where do you come from lads? Jeff: England. Greeter: Oh, my aunt came from England. Manchester. Me: Really. Greeter: Yes, she did. It's a wonderful place. Greeter: So what food are you looking for this evening? This place behind me is the best restaurant in the town. Very cheap as well....(and so it went on.)  One wonders whether these greeters get employed purely on the basis of their international connections so that they can start up such a conversation with at least a degree of conviction. I should of thrown him by pretending to be a right wing extremist. I could picture the greeter replying 'But,how very interesting! Did you know my uncle served under Mussolini. Of course they eat Italian food over there-well you would if you was Italian HeHe! (laughing at his own joke) Did I mention this place behind me is the best Italian restaurant in the town. Yes, it is Sir! Very cheap as well. Mussolini himself would of eaten here....'  In the end we had a pint of Molson's Canadian beer (which by this stage I was really starting to like)in the bar at Kelseys while we waited to be seated. It was quite a noisy place. A little bit rowdy but the food was okay.  ( urlLink To see holiday photographs, click here !)

						   After waiting around for ages, finally at about 11.30am me and Jeff were picked up for our transfer to our Niagara hotel. The journey took about an hour and a half. As soon as we booked in, we almost sprinted down Clifton Hill to get to the falls, where we spent the next few hours hypnotically transfixed by the power of the images we were busy processing. ( urlLink Live Webcam stream of the Falls .) The truth is, none of the 36 photographs I took that day adequately did the falls justice.  Later in the evening, about 8:50pm, as soon as all the onlookers were submerged in sufficient darkness, the spotlights were then switched on, everyone cheered, and the falls were then illuminated in a variety of colours; red, and yellow and pink and green, orange, and purple and blue....sorry! Couldn't help myself. You'd think seeing 'coloured' water crashing into the river below would truly crush the wonder of the falls, but it didn't. Actually, it gave it a magical quality. Far above the 'coloured' water, the illuminated neon signs, the distant bursts of music and fanfare from the various amusements -way above the seemingly endless series of couples riding up and down on their horse-drawn carriages, the tacky souvenir shops, and the 'idiots' perched precariously on the walls above the falls, was one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen in my entire life. Millions of tons of water tumbling to the river below every single minute, creating a cloud of mist that at times seemed to rise 70/80 feet up in the air.

						   Our last full day in Toronto. In the morning we caught the ferry to Central Island which is the largest of several Islands very close to the city, where you can see some fantastic views of the city skyline. All of the islands are connected to one another by a series of bridges and roads. There's five ferrys that service the islands, one of which is a class 2 Russian ice-breaking vessel which is the only one that is used throughout the year. Once we were on Central Island we hired a bike each to get around, which was very reasonable priced - only $8 an hour(about  £3). During the summer months, the islands prove extremely popular and millions of visitors are received by the islands. One of the islands has an extensive beach and there are literally hundreds of wooden tables for families to picnic.  Hamlin Island, was named after Sir John Hamlin who once owned it. Now it seemed nothing more then a wilderness, with extremely long grass, and thick foliage that was so dense, (a bit like my garden)you'd probably of required a bulldozer to hack your way through - yet during it's heyday, Hamlin had built a number of casinos and bars there, and during prohibition thousands of people would visit the island. The lights could be seen from miles around. Hamlin had built up his own little empire by rather astutely operating a free ferry service from New York, which is only about 70 miles away, and by doing so had created quite legitimately one of the few places where Americans could legally get drunk. Even the famous baseball player Babe Ruth visited regularly. Of course, when prohibition ended, Hamlin lost all his customers, and consequently his capital, and eventually he went bankrupt. Later, there was a fire, and most of the buildings were destroyed.   There are several marinas and one yacht club on the Islands. One of the boats you can see is owned by a gynecologist and a psychologist. The name of the boat?   "Heads and Tails!"     One thing that became apparent on my holiday was just how tolerant Toronto is of Films being made in the city. During our stay, there was at least 2 films being made. One film that was being made had the working title of Cinderella, starring Russell Crowe, and was being directed by Ron Howard, in a building next to our hotel. (We kept expecting to meet up with him!) Another film, was a costume drama, being filmed next to Casa Loma. The tolerance for all things cinematic extended even to the islands. A few years ago, one of the islands was made to look like the Florida Everglades, and mock alligators were even added to make it look more authentic so that they could film one of the police academy films. However, we were told that if you freeze-framed the film you could still see briefly the CN tower in the background of one of the scenes, which kind of gave it away!  After returning from the ferry to Toronto, we walked back up to Dundas street where we had to wait for the 1st batch of my photographs to be processed. Having just passed the Royal Ontario Museum and being full of artistic enthusiasm we found ourselves sitting on a bench pondering on the particular esoteric merits of a Henry Moore sculpture that was located only a few feet away from us, and our conversation went something like this...   Jeff : Don't you think, the green rust suggests the decay of post-modernist society?  Me :I suppose so. The unusual feel of Moore's piece I think you'll find is typical of his black/green period. He expresses the inner rage of what essentially is beyond comprehension...the way he tends to focus on the more ambiguous elements of human relationships...  Jeff :Yes(nodding his head)...the gaping hole of course is central to the piece and suggests his disillusionment with art as a means to empower the individual....and of course the pidgin droppings essentially reveal the publics discontent regarding his latter work.  After our foolish banter and obvious luddite comprehension regarding modern art, we picked up my film and headed back to our hotel.  Extremely tired and with aching feet, we barely spent any time at all before immediately heading off to our friend Margaret and Tony's house. The journey itself should of been fairly straight forward, but was it? 1st Jeff got on a packed train, and the train door shut before I could get on. Since, I didn't know the way to our hosts house, Jeff had to come back before we could start our journey again. Next, we got on a train, which was heading in the wrong direction. Then after getting on the right train, we got off at the wrong stop. After getting back on, and getting off this time at the right stop, we then proceeded to get on the wrong bus! About four stops down the road we got off the bus and then walked all the way to Margaret's house. (It seemed safer.) Ah, good job, no one had been watching. They'd think we were a right couple of tourists!!!  The journey on the bus itself wasn't entirely without incident either. The Toronto ice hockey team, the Maple Leafs had lost an important play off  in the NHL, the previous night, and on the bus was a man who wore a jacket that advertised the Philadelphia Flyers-a team that had beaten the Maple Leafs. Another man took offence to this. He was ranting and raving in a loud voice about how idiotic the Philadelphia fan was to wear a jacket in Toronto emblazoned with the name of the team who had just beaten the Maple leafs, and during this mega-rant he looked at me for some support, (Very surprised I was mistaken for a native but there you are) and he said, with an earnest and serious expression, 'That man's cruising for a bruising...' The quaintness of the phrase kept making me laugh all week. Imagine, if it had been 2 English football supporters in a similar position. Everyone would have got off the bus! The Philadelphia fan looked uncomfortable. He kept his head down and got off at the next stop, seriously intimidated by the Canadian's terrifying threats.   We spent a wonderful evening at Margaret and Tony's house. They were everything that the Canadian customs officers were not. They were extremely warm, friendly, and welcoming. Margaret cooked a lovely meal, while Tony helped out by cooking the steaks on the barbeque. We talked about England and Canada, friends and family, jobs, places, and identity. Listening to Tony's tales from his extensive traveling in his job, and Margaret's slight Scottish accent recalling her Scottish past, the evening flew past. It was a lovely evening. Margaret said one of the things she missed about Scotland was the rain. When we went home on the Monday, it did rain and I couldn't help thinking about Margaret and Tony inside their house listening to the rain as it tapped lightly on the roof of their house. I pictured the two of them  hearing the rain and looking out the window, and it made me smile.  ( urlLink To see holiday photographs, click here !)

						   In the morning we went on a guided tour of the city. At each stop we were allowed to get off the bus and visit the attraction to take photo's, but the only problem with that particular arrangement was it was fine in theory. In reality, if you impulsively got off to take a closer peek at something that  seemed  particularly interesting, and found out that it was in medical terms a placebo, you still had to wait until the next bus came along to pick you up again an hour later. I have to be honest, as far as I was concerned, the banter from the driver was lacking somewhat. Most guides do a little homework and try to inspire you with their enthusiasm for the city. I think he'd been doing the tour for so long, he didn't seem to bothered whether or not he  even completed half the sentences he started, and what did at least appear to start out interesting was invariably drowned out by the noise of the engine. In the end we only elected to get off once and that was at the castle, Casa Loma. Casa Loma was an amazing place. It was the former estate of Sir Henry Pellatt, who was an industrialist, a financier and a military man. His dream home was started in 1911, and the construction of that home, took 300 men nearly 3 years to complete. Once completed Henry and his wife were only able to enjoy their home for 10 years before financial ruin forced them to sell everything at a great loss. The castle has secret passageways, knight's armour in the hallway, large dining table that could sit countless people, towers and turrets, everything that you expect to see in a castle. Located on a hill overlooking Toronto the views are impressive. In the garden we found a sculpture called the dragon tree sculpture. Underneath the sculpture there was a sign that explained that if you rung the bell and had a pure heart then six dragons would arrive to provide you with hope, true love, peace, health, wisdom and happiness. Of course, Jeff had to ring the bell! As expected, no dragons arrived. Now, if  I  had tried to ring the bell it might have been a different story! After we had had enough of the dingy lighting, and had been in all of the rooms and listened to the tape machines with the audio commentary, rather then get back on the bus, and face the driver again we decided to walk back home.

						   I woke at 5.40 am, with the sunlight filtering in through the small gap in the curtains. Looking out the window, Toronto was already starting to come to life. Aside from people already walking along the street, you could also see squirrels climbing the trees below. In fact the squirrels are everwhere in Toronto. Unlike European squirrels however, most of these were black. When we asked someone why this was, he replied it's so the Canadians can see the squirrels better in the snow! I love a scientific explanation!  After breakfast, (Eggs Benedict & English muffins in the hotel restaurant which I think was called Windows for those that like to know these things!)we went on the underground, and took a ride to the harbour, where we had arranged to go on a guided tour around the Islands that lay just off Toronto. The boat was entirely shielded with a clear plastic cover, except for a small gap at the side where we boarded the boat. This was obviously the one place that we had to all queue up to take our photographs from, because anywhere else and the light from the flash bounced off the plastic and ruined the photograph. The tour was well arranged, and the information given was both interesting and funny. We learnt a number of things. The harbour itself has for a number of years been getting cleaner, because it was made a national urban area of protection and as a consequence all industry was gradually moved out, excluding a sugar refinery which was allowed to stay because it's impact on the environment was minimal. As the harbour became more healthy, more people moved in, and in just 10 years condominium prices went through the roof, rising as much as ten times their value.  Along the harbour there is a venue where free concerts are performed. They range widely in music styles. Some evenings you can hear Jazz, Blues, Rock-one week they even held a Karaoke opera evening. The Karaoke opera apparently got so many complaints, they were asked never to do it again!!!!  From the boat the Skydome was pointed out to us by our tour guide. While it doesn't seem that imposing from a distance, it does extend 7 stories below ground as well. It was built in 1929 and is the home of the Blue Jays. The crowd capacity of the stadium is 55,000. The roof to the dome only takes 20 minutes to open, and is so cost effective it can be opened using just $10 of electricity (£4).  We were told a story about the hotel that is inside the dome. The rooms initially were fitted with one way glass so that you could watch the game from the comfort of your hotel. Unfortunately, when the lights were on the spectators in the stadium could also see inside the room. Apparently, one year a honeymooning couple had booked a room in this hotel, and they were involved in a passionate 'embrace' during a live match, when a TV cameraman noticed them and pointed his camera up at their room. The director flicked a switch and their very animated 'embrace' was instantly transferred to a big video screen that the whole stadium could see! The match stopped, because the players also became distracted by the screen, and everyone started to clap. Apparently, the only time in the SkyDome's history where there has been a standing ovation!  In the afternoon we walked along the skywalk which is a connecting walkway to the CN tower. Bypassing the long queue because we had had the foresight to buy our tickets in advance we were allowed straight up the tower. We had the lift all to ourselves. The glass sided lift ascends the 400 meters to the top in just 58 seconds. In fact, the speed is such, your ears pop because of the air pressure. It's a very enjoyable ride. The CN tower is the tallest unsupported structure in the world. It was built in 1974. One of the amazing facts that we learnt was that the concrete that the tower is built from, is actually one giant piece!!! It was built on site using a special process, and the concrete extend so far under the ground there is actually more below the surface then there is above it. It's design can withstand an earthquake 6.5 on the Richter scale. It's struck 50 times on average each year by lightening. The famous glass floor which people stand on to look below is called lexxon glass and is used on the Space Shuttle. It is so tough it can withstand the weight of 8 African elephants. We had been told earlier in the day on the guided boat tour that the interesting thing about the glass that very few people seem to know is that while some people are too scared to stand on the glass, only venturing one toe on the edge because they imagine themselves falling through the glass to the ground below, actually it's glass  under  the carpet surrounded the viewing area as well, so for those who said they didn't have the nerve to stand on the glass and look down, they already had! On a clear day you can see 40 miles from the viewing platform. The only thing that made me a little homesick was a sign at the top stating that the CN tower is 5,728 KM or 3,559 miles from London.

						   We left London Gatwick airport today on flight 623 on an Air Transat Airbus A303 bound for Toronto's Pearson airport. Due to air currents, the journey there (8 hrs), is much longer then the journey back (6 hrs). Our seats were located right at the back of the plane: numbers 31A and 31B. It was my first ever flight and all I can say the take-off was truly exhilarating. How anything that weighs hundreds of tons can take off in the first place I still find difficult to comprehend. Yes, I know about the uniquely shaped wing-that the underside is flatter then the curved topside, so it creates less resistance and therefore the plane is propelled upwards. Yes, I know that. But, the plane STILL weighs hundreds of tons!!! Besides, it still had Jeff's suitcase on board, weighing in at a whopping 19.5 kilos! If anything was going to make us fly lop-sided over the Atlantic it was that. (Mine was a more modest 11.5 kilos.)  We climbed steeply, and very soon the plane was traveling at approximately 550 mph and had leveled out at 35,000 feet. Outside the window the temperature was -93C. It was quite emotional leaving the English mainland behind. As we flew over Avon, Devon & Cornwall, you could see so many boats around the coastline-people enjoying their weekend. Down below us, as our plane burnt a trail of kerosene across the sky, tiny people were busy getting on with their lives, riding around in tiny toy cars, and living in tiny matchbox houses. My ears popped rapidly. At one stage not only did I lose all hearing, but I found I couldn't speak either because of the air pressure. Eventually, the air pressure equalized and everything returned to normal.  During the long flight, we watched with varying degrees of interest an episode of, 'Friends,' the films, 'Mona Lisa's Smile,' and 'Legally blonde II' and another film I cannot recall the title of starring Steve Martin. We were served with an in-flight meal of pasta and red and green pesto. For desert we had profiteroles.  While taking off was exciting, landing in Toronto was terrifying. Toronto was covered with thick fog, and we literally couldn't see anything out of the windows until we were as low as 350 feet!!! Getting slower and slower, I kept imagining the plane would stall and we'd end up crashing into some car park, or worse still, Lake Ontario. Apparently, such fears are common. Everyone goes quite during landing. Even those that have flown many times. You can see them pressing their feet hard into the ground as if they're operating some kind of invisible breaking system. It's the fact that the pilot has  total  control. You can see the apprehension in peoples faces. But, once it's all over you can see the relief in eyes. They start to breath normally again, and even allow themselves a smile.  Customs was a nightmare. As far as we could tell, me and Jeff were the only ones to be pulled out of the queue for further Gestapo-like questioning. One officer asked me what my job was, and because there was a slight delay in my response, he snapped, 'I was talking to you. Did you not here?' When I explained I had just been in a plane for 8 hours and because of the air pressure I couldn't hear so well, he didn't want to know. He asked me, 'Who do you know in Toronto?' To which the answer, 'Do I need to know someone in Toronto just to come here??' was not particularly welcome. 2 minutes later he asked us again what we did for a living, just to check that our stories were consistent, and we didn't just make up our occupations. The truth is, I think if we were going to make up an occupation, I think we'd at least invent a couple of jobs more glamourous or interesting then the ones we had. Once my suitcase had gone through the X-ray machine for a 2nd time, I was then challenged with, 'Is that a needle in your suitcase?' to which I replied, 'No, that's a pen.' After that, they let us go.  Our package holiday rep ticked against our names on his checklist. The others apparently had waited ages for us to emerge from the custom officers side room. We then boarded the waiting bus, and was dropped off outside our hotel the Days Inn, in Downtown Toronto.   ( urlLink To see holiday photographs, click here. )

						   If you've ever unsuccessfully spent hours trying to download a piece of software from the web, only to find that the incredibly attractive and well-designed icon that you expected to find on your desktop wasn't actually there, but was lost in the  vast 'undiscovered country' of cyberspace, then I have a few tips for you...  When uploading/downloading, the time you choose to do so is critical. Make sure the whole of the US is in bed. If in doubt ring random numbers in the U.S, and if anyone answers DON'T attempt it. It's a tricky operation at the best of times. Close all other applications, don't touch the keyboard, set the room temperature to 20', don't speak to anyone, go and stand outside in the rain(apparently being in the room causes an atmospheric disturbance that could prove fatal to our very sensitive, emotional, 'let's all have a group hug. You never give me the attention I deserve' P.C's) Actually, scrub all that, when attempting to download it's probably better to move to another country (Spain sounds good at this time of the year)-just to be on the safe side and try and hold your breath for the entire download. That should work. Apparently.

						   A Japanese proverb I heard recently was; "One kind word can warm three winter months." How true! It's always the small things you remember, isn't it? One act of kindness when you really needed it. Sometimes, it can be just a simple word.  I don't particularly want to go into details but briefly when I was a teenager, my family was going through a particularly difficult time. One morning my mum heard a sound at the front of the house, went to the front door, and to her surprise found a food hamper left on the doorstep. She looked up and down the road, and there was no one in the vicinity. She looked down at the hamper and could see a card tucked inside, but the card failed to reveal the identity of the sender. We talked about the incident as a family many times. It was the perfect act of kindness. Anonymous. No potential of reward. A sacrifice had been made - not only money of course, but time also would of had to have been sacrificed purchasing the various items in the hamper.  'The best portion of a good man's life' wrote William Wordsworth was, 'his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love.'   I found a quote on a website concerning this subject which went, "When a person does a good deed when he or she did not have to, God looks down and smiles and says, "For this moment alone, it was worth creating the world."  Right, here's a question for you! What is the most memorable act of kindness anyone's ever shown you? It's quite a difficult question to answer-one that most people have to think about, so I don't really expect any answers, but if you do have an answer, click on the 'comments' link at the bottom of this paragraph, and then on the 'post a comment' and I'd love to hear it.

						   Recently, I got a new mobile phone, the Sagem V-65 and because it has a camera attachment, it has resulted in a new found enthusiastic zeal for the subject. ( urlLink Picture .)Men and their gadgets, eh? Yes, the picture size is small, as are all mobile phone cameras, but because the lens is also small, you can take pictures in almost complete darkness because it desn't need to capture much light. Over the last couple of days, I've taken a photo of the village stocks in the village where I work, my car, a work colleague, myself, an image of Niagara falls from my recent holiday snaps, 1 of a friend from Norway, and 3 of Sophie. In fact, I think my cat especially is getting fed up of my camera following her around everywhere she goes. Her eyes appear to roll heavenward whenever she sees me approach, then she yawns and stretches her body to ridiculous lengths-which pretty much reveals how interesting  she  finds the subject! Ah, how hard must it be, to be sooo photogenic. ( urlLink Picture of my cat .) Okay, okay...yes you're right, this is not really my cat! But, she's very similar!  Mobile phones fascinate me. Cellular phones operate by sending and transmitting radio waves, and radio waves travel at the speed of light which according to Einstein was the fastest speed possible. It's the speed limit of the Universe. In his theory E=mc2, while all the other variables could change, the speed of light was the one constant.  Nothing could travel faster. The speed of light was represented in the equation by the 'C' and it stood for 'celeritas', which is the latin word for swift, which certainly was appropriate, because a light beam rather  swiftly  travels along at 186,000 miles per second. Think about that the next time you send a text message!  An interesting side aspect to the speed of radio waves is, if you was to sit in a restaurant, and could overhear some fellow diner irritatingly talking in a loud voice on their cellular phone, it would appear as if you could hear their words before they had even left the persons mouth, such would be your irritation, but in reality air can only carry sound at a positively pedestrian speed of about 700 mph(depending on the air pressure)-whereas the person on the recieving end of the call would likely be hearing that irritating fellow customers voice,  before  it had even trundelled the few feet to get to your table, even if the caller was hundreds of miles away!!!! The reason being  the voice being spoken into the cellular phone is being catapulted into space and consequently is hitting the ear drum of the person they're talking to at over 100's of times the speed of sound!!! True fact. Amazing, huh?

						   If like me you was brought up to be extremely honest, and as a result any sick notes that you presented to your teacher on the 1st day back at school were perhaps a tad repetitive and dare I say it, lacking in imagination, take a ganders at the following&nbsp;to see&nbsp;just how some parents  really  could&nbsp;&nbsp;'push the envelope!' albeit sometimes unintentionally.&nbsp; Incidentally, they're all genuine excuses compiled by the Office of Educational Assessment at the University of Washington, complete with original spelling....    My son is under a doctor's care and should not take P.E. today. Please execute him.     Please excuse Lisa for being absent. She was sick and I had her shot.     Dear School: Please ekscuse John being absent on Jan. 28, 29, 30, 31,32, and also 33.     Please excuse Gloria from Jim today. She is administrating.     Please excuse Roland from P.E. for a few days. Yesterday he fell out of a tree and misplaced his hip.   Carlos was absent yesterday because he was playing football. He was hurt in the growing part.     Please excuse Ray Friday from school. He has very loose vowels.    My personal favourite and least credible excuse has to be surely;&nbsp; " Please excuse Jennifer for missing school yesterday. We forgot to get the Sunday paper off the porch, and when we found it on Monday, we thought it was Sunday ."&nbsp; Hmmmm....right.    Sally won't be in school a week from Friday. We have to attend her funeral.     &nbsp;   Please excuse Tommy for being absent yesterday. He had diarrhea and his boots leaked.    Imagine as a child having to hand&nbsp;any of the previous excuses &nbsp; to your teacher. Ahhh, no!&nbsp;The embarrassment!&nbsp; Walking up to the desk, with hot, clammy hands, feeling that dizzy sensation when&nbsp;you're so nervous, time itself appears to &nbsp;stand still - knowing full well that you was about to be laughed at, but at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;realising that while it was beyond despute your parents were quite mad, you shared the same genes, so where did that leave you???&nbsp;&nbsp;     The award for the most chatty excuse ever given surely has to go to the following; " Maryann was absent December 11-16, because she had a fever, sore throat, headache and upset stomach. Her sister was also sick, fever and sore throat, her brother had a low grade fever and ached all over. I wasn't the best either, sore throat and fever. There must be something going around, her father even got hot last night ."&nbsp;

						   On the Johnathan Ross show last Saturday on radio 2, Johnathan said that he had recently ordered some pyjamas off the internet,&nbsp;but when they arrived he found to his dismay that the&nbsp;sleeves were slightly shorter then his arms. So this started him off on one of his highly imaginitive-monologues, where he concluded that if he was a superhero, he would have to be known as &nbsp;Slightly-longer-arm, since it was the one attribute that set him apart from others!&nbsp; Johnathan and his side-kick Andy then discussed how this attribute could perhaps be used in a practical way to catch the bad guys&nbsp;in some in some real-life scenario.&nbsp; If for instance a robber was on the run with some loot and he came across Slightly-longer-arm man, he may have been so distracted by the freakish sight of a man with slightly longer arms, he may well of dropped the bag of loot, allowing Slightly-longer-arm man&nbsp;of course&nbsp;slightly longer time to arrest the villain and call the police. Or alternatively, Andy made the sensible suggestion that&nbsp;all Slightly-longer-arm man&nbsp;would have to do, would be simply to hold onto a villain at arms length with his slightly longer arms and then the&nbsp;robber couldn't fight back because even if the robber swung a punch at Slightly-longer-arm&nbsp; man he wouldn't have been able to reach!  &nbsp;  With the release of Spiderman 2 last week, it got&nbsp;me intrigued as to&nbsp;what would you be called if you was a fictional superhero?&nbsp; But, it has to be based on an attribute that is true, however ridiculous....and how would it help you to foil crimes?&nbsp; Oh, and what costume would you wear?

						   As you can see I've changed the title of the web log from, 'Reflections from a Traveling Willbery,' which was always a mouthful, to the much shorter and much less taxing on the tongue, 'hp20.com' which for those who actually live in England will realize is a postal code. This particular postal code is to be found in one of the home counties.   So, why did I spend £10 on a new domain name? Obvious really. I was thinking of you and your poor tired, weary fingers...now there's sooo little to type in.&nbsp; How thoughtful I am!   Not only that, think of the MASSIVE savings to the environment. How could that possibly save the environment you may ask? Good question, and thank you for asking! Well, now it occupies less space on paper when I write it down - which means less trees need cutting down whenever I  do  want to write it down. Also with a smaller name to print out, there's less ink used in the printer cartridge, and consequently of course less electricity necessary for the printer cartridge to complete its task, which inevitably means reduced radioactive waste from the supplying nuclear power plant that provided that electricity-Aha! Don't say I don't do anything for the environment. Now, whenever I watch documentaries on the depleted ozone layer and how pretty much the entire populace has selfishly disregarded all the warnings, I can 'tut' to myself, give my very best disdainful look, and hold my held up high, knowing that in no way did I contribute to the problem. ;-) Hmmm. The real reason? Actually, 'hp20' sounds better, don't you think?

						   I went to an assembly today and had to get up at 6am in the morning and didn't get home until 10:30 at night. A 16 and a half hour day!!! I can hardly move. The seats at the assembly were so tightly packed together I should have worn my deep-vein-thrombosis, long haul flight socks. It's a 3 day assembly, so a lot of the time is wasted driving there and back each day. After spending 8 hours in a chair where you simply can't move, you then spend a further 6 hours in a car where you also can't move. Tired? You're telling me!  Maybe an idea would be to compact all three days into one mega session. That would save time, don't you think? No more wasted travel. Perhaps I could cut out lunch also. That would save me even more time. What would I want that for? Lunch is for wimps anyway. That's what they would have said in the high-powered eighties. Maybe, I could have arranged to have an intravenous drip feed providing all the nutrients direct to my chair. Then there's trips to the toilet. Is that really necessary? Isn't that a bit of a luxury? Just think of how much shorter the day would be if I was connected up to a kidney dialysis machine. Even more time saved. Yes. One tube going in, one tube going out. I really feel that this is the way forward.  Don't you just hate it when people tell you about their hard childhood, and that modern people today just don't know they're born. It always starts off with the same immortal words, 'When I were t' lad...' They'll probably tell about how they worked down a coal mine for 18 hours a day, singing merrily with their friends despite lungs full of coal dust. How it gave them character. Then for fun they'd spend the rest of the time up a chimney. Emerging from the claustrophobic brickwork with their runny noses, blinking at the burning sun with their soot-stained faces like moles. Oh, but they were happy. All they'd get for wages would be a single segment of orange....and they'd have to make it last all week.....and share it between 7 brothers and sisters. And if they were good and worked especially hard, as a bonus, every few years they'd receive a lump of coal - to keep all for themselves. Ahhh! And how they treasured that lump of coal!  Okay. Okay. Maybe I should revise my clearly selfish, priviledged attitude to modern life. Personally, I think there was way tooo much leg room at the assembly. Our knees should have been under our chins like trussed chickens. Ah yes, that would of taught us about sacrifice!!!  I'm just joking! For certain Americans who read this, this is called English irony.  Actually, the assembly was very good. But, yes it was very tiring. Did I mention that? Yes, it was extremely tiring.

						   It's been a good day! I just felt like going to the theatre this afternoon. I needed my theatre fix! I hardly expected to get any good tickets at such a late hour, but would you believe it, once I logged onto the MK site I was given 2nd row seats in the stalls, which meant I was only about 10 foot away from the stage. How lucky am I? Now, I'm assuming the only way this was possible, (given it was pretty much sold out), was that Ticketmaster had been allocated some of the good seats by the theatre in advance to handle their online sales, but given that most of the audience were OAP's, which is common for matinee performances, most wouldn't of had access to the internet to obtain those 'good' tickets, and the younger audience who wanted to see the show, I'm sure would have preferred an evening performance.  So at 2:00pm I entered into the theatre at Milton Keynes clutching my undeservedly good ticket and sat down in my seat to watch Neil Simon's, 'London Suite,' starring John Challis and Sue Holderness (from TV's, 'Only Fools & Horses', Sara Crowe who we may know from 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' or the 'Philadelphia cheese' advert, and Mark Curry.  As the title of the play suggested, it was set in an expensive hotel in London and unusually consisted of four mini-plays. It was the theatre in bite-sized portions. Neil Simon the writer has compiled numerous successes such as, 'Biloxi Blues,' 'Barefoot in the Park' and 'The Odd Couple,' and has built up a track record second to none.  Sara Crowe surprised me the most, especially in the first act. ( urlLink Pic &amp; sample of voice .) In the past she has always tended to fall back upon her safe trademark character of silly blonde with silly, quirky voice, and it  is  funny undoubtedly, which is why she is so good in comedy. But, in the first act, she played it straight as the daughter of Sue Holderness's character Mrs Semple. Her portrayal of Lauren was one of the most natural, comfortable, performances I have seen in years. Gone was the blonde hair and the accented comic face-pulling. She metamorphosed into a theatrical force of nature in front of me! It was the eye contact with her mother that really impressed, and the understated awareness of their relationship reflected through the subtle shades of expression and touch. Here was a character who was born to be loved. Mrs Semple (Holderness) had lived on her own for a number of years and was clearly suffering from loneliness and dealt with this through retail therapy, so Lauren tried to set her up on a date with an eccentric, Scottish gentleman. Later at 2am, Lauren was awoken by her mother who then proceeded to relate an increasingly bizarre account of a very memorable date. It was such a funny, intimate moment between two fine actresses.  8 out of 10.  On the way home in my new car (Thanks Susan!) I listened to my favorite CD, the sun was shining, I had no talks to prepare, or stressful assignments and everything just seemed so wonderful. Yes, today was a good day.
