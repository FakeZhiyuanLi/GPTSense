						   Our mailman is a dick, at least one of the three mailmen that the post office rotates through my neighborhood.  My house has no garage, so we have to park our cars on the street in front of our house.  This is a very intricate arrangement because we, according to the damn flyer that the mailman keeps putting underneath our windshield, must allow enough room for the mailman to pull in and pull out without having to back up or do any real "driving".  We have two cars that we have to park in front of our house and if we want to get mail as opposed to a windshield flyer we cannot be in the way.  Also, we have to try to allow for enough room for our neighbors to get their mail delivered - meaning we can't be close to their mailbox - so we have to park between two mailboxes and allow enough room for essentially a semi truck on either end.  When it is all said and done, we have about 25 feet to park 2 cars.  This was very aggravating when we first moved into our house for a few reasons: 1)  We were never told about this rule so we found out by flyer and out neighbors didn't get their mail because of us. 2) 2 houses down there is a mailbox on the porch of the house and the mailman gets out and delivers the mail to the porch.  WHAT THE HELL??  You can't back up your crappy ass van, but you can get out and walk 50 feet?  I swear to god I want to drive off with his mail truck next time I see him do that.  Not really, but I feel like taking a joy ride when I see that - mail flying out the back of the van.  One time after he left us a flyer he looked down the street at me and smiled while he was doing his special delivery.   I asked him about it a few days later and he gave me some B.S. line about that house being grandfathered in.  The reason this is all on my mind is because today was garbage day (and all of the garbage cans have to be 4 feet apart in order to be picked up - another thing that pisses me off but I'll talk about that later), meaning that our normal 25 feet is about 15.  You can't park 2 cars in 15 feet, so my act of defiance is to put them right in front of the mailboxes so the mailman has to get out and deliver OUR mail for a change.  What's he going to do, tell me I have to put my garbage somewhere else?  Take it up with the city, punk, I'm entitled to my utilities so why don't you eat my... never mind.  So today he delivered our mail and then apparently intentionally backed into our garbage cans (according to my wife).  I have to think of something else to do to make his life harder.  This will become a silent war and most likely the defining event in my life.  Does anyone have any suggestions to make his life harder?  One thing that I am going to do to make my life easier and hopefully his a little harder is to move the mailboxes to the very corner of the lot so that in order to deliver the mail he would have to stop and be in perfect T-Bone position with the alleyway to the west of my house.   Hopefully this will add stress to his life - thereby reducing his health significantly to the point where he has a stroke and retires.  I'm in this for the long haul.

						   For those of you without the benefit of ever having kids, one of the most gratifying things is getting them to say things, clearly, that no ordinary child would say. Nothing bad, but things that will get strangers to do a double take and do a "What tha'? Did that kid just say that?"  My oldest daughter just turned two and she has been at that parrott-esque mimicking stage for quite a while now. I think the first thing I taught her to say was "'Sup Daddy!" followed by "Bling Bling" and "On the double!" (in the direction of my wife when I am tired of waiting for her). Most recently we were late for dinner on our way back from the grocery store with a container of strawberries open so my daughter wouldn't go into a diabetic shock (she's not really diabetic, but a child’s volatility potential seriously increases when they go too far beyond their normal eating times). So my daughter was in the back seat eating huge strawberries in about 4 bites, they were disappearing so fast that I had to keep my peripheral vision on her just to make sure she wasn't chucking them into the back of the car half-eaten and then asking for more. After each strawberry she would demand: "More strawberry!” We are at the stage that we are trying to teach her how to ask politely for things, so we would respond: "More strawberries, please?" and she would repeat it so we would give her another strawberry.  This lasted about 5 minutes until I got bored and started prompting her to say other things. It evolved from "More strawberries, please." to "More strawberries, NOW" to "More strawberries, I COMMAND YOU" to "More strawberries, I AM GOD." There were a few more permutations, but all in all to deify a 2 year old and hear those commands in a tiny voice and with all the girly intonations, it was hilarious. I probably wasn't setting the best example but hey, in this day and age, who does?

						   I am not going to come across well in this-or-any blog.  Much of my demeaner and interpersonal communications stem from sarcasm which never comes across well when there isn't a facial expression or voice tone to go with it.  Also, I can't read your reaction and therefore perform a diving "just kidding" catch is out of the question.  But anyway, here goes:  Today I worked from home.  The company I work for allows this as long as you follow the guidelines.  This means that you have to have broadband internet access, telephone access, child care and you have to have a good ergonomic working space.   Also, you have to work or at least appear to be working.  That's where my fine balancing act really turns to art.  I am the king of watching the olympics/playing video games/walking my dog/napping - and answering emails.  If I ever own a company I am outlawing this kind of work because it is too easy to to not work, or what I call "slork" (slack and work, genius).  The acronym for working from home is oddly "WFH" but I think that "WTF" is also very appropriate.  I don't want to go into too much detail about what I do at work, but it is for one of the larger tech companies and I can work all day without having to talk to anyone.  If I were to actually compare what I got done today with what I get done at a full day of work in the office, I would say that it was about 1/10th.  It's ok though because I am faster than most of the people that I work with so my boss sees the same from me as he does from everyone else.  It just takes me less time to do it so I have the slorking luxury.  After slork, my wife and I went to Toys R' Us and emptied out the gift cards that were sent to us for the birth of our newest daughter.  My wife talked to one of our friends with a newborn and they recommended a Sea Sounds Baby Rocker, or something like that.  It looks like a lawn chair for a baby except that it is a little more reclined, has an attachment that vibrates the chair and a fake plastic bubbling and music playing aquarium that sits right in front of the baby's face.  This is all an amazing invention and it seems to be working well.  My baby is fast asleep in her vibrating lawnchair listening to the soothing bong sound of the bubbling aquarium.  It's all about conditioning at that age.  "JUST KIDDING"
