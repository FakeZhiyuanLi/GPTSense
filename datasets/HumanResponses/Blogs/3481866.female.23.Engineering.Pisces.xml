      I'm listening to the new wilco CD (streamed) from their website [wilcoworld.net]. You should check it out, too.  I'm going to see them at Bonnaroo in about what, 14 days or something?  I can't wait.  In fact, I can't wait to just go to Bonnaroo anyway!  Camping out for three days with nothing to do but unmentionables and listen to music.  Fucking amazing.  I already kick-started the Cara Mutha Fuckin (Dant) Roellgen's Summer Concert Series with some David Bowie.  That was an alright experience, but I have a feeling that Bonnaroo will set things off, like they are meant to be set off.  Let me know if you'll be attending.

      Okay, so I got really bored sittin' here at home.  The Indy 500 happened today, down the street from my apartment.  The Pacers game is happening down a different street from my apartment.  Some tornadoes came down a few more streets down.  And what do I have to show for all of this excitement?  A half-full bottle of wine and a new blog documenting my FAVORITE part of our honeymoon.  Check it out at kalalauhoneymoon.blogspot.com.  I'm too lazy to make a link, so use some of your finger muscles and copy/paste that string of characters into that address box right up theah.

       urlLink GeorgeWBush.com :: The Official Re-election Site for President George W. Bush   Check out the web ad that the Bush Campaign has put up on their website.  Basically, they have put in clips of an entry to the MoveOn.Org commercial contest interspersed between clips of Al Gore, John Kerry, Al Gore and maybe a few others showing them screaming about how the war in Iraq sucks and G-Dub fucked up.  It's sort of scary.  If I wasn't on the Bush website, I wouldn't have known it was a Bush promo.  Not only that, but why do the Bush Team think it is okay to cut up someone's personal work (the contest entry) and turn it into their own propaganda?  OH YEAH! AND DID I FORGET TO MENTION, THE BUSH TEAM DECIDED TO PUT HITLER IN THIS ONE!  This is weird.

      My dad died when I was eight (8) years old - two years after going into a coma after a motorcycle accident.  So, as you can imagine, I don't really have many memories of him other than the ones that I have of him being in a hospital bed (and I try to block those out).  The manifestation of these golf clubs is very important for that very reason.    When I went to Vincennes yesterday I was just planning on hanging out with my sister and checking out my brother's new apartment (which, unbeknownst (sp?) to me held the Almighty Golf Clubs). So, Riley (my bro.), told me to take the golf clubs since the only thing holding me back from REALLY learning how to play golf is having to borrow golf clubs from friends all the time.    So, I'm going through the golf bag last night (which is really bad ass, as you can see in the picture below - it has fucking ALLIGATOR SKIN! it has 4 fucking DRIVERS!) and I find a golf ball that has been used.  That golf ball was used by my Dad.  That's the closest contact I can remember ever having with him since I was six (6) years old.  I am NEVER going to lose that golf ball.

      So, I get home today from work.  And it sort of sucked, just like every other day in that windowless dungeon.  Until! I heard some music from the computer that Joel-pie-lot was listening to.  Turns out it was Bonnaroo radio {www.bonnaroo.com}.  There was some bad ass shit on there.  And we're STILL listening to it.  Then we got all excited, dancing around and around, until mr. joel told me about PHISH's last concert EVER!  COVENTRY.  We're going.  Got the tickets   ready to take that road trip to Vermont.  So, there.  I have tickets to go to Bonnaroo, which is gonna rock, tickets to see Phish not once, not twice, but quice days this summer!  Most ever for me.  I need to find out how to set up a calendar up here on this blog to document the days I will be listening to fine music somewhere.  I also think that we are going to try out Lollapalooza.  Wilco and Flaming Lips are going to be there but the days to see it are few and far between geographically and numerically and I have to pretend like I want to be a professional at work.  We'll see how this all pans out.  Out.

      So, I went out tonight with some people after work.  Which always ends up in an akward yet rewarding experience.  Jesus.  Rock.  Roll.  Del McCoury.  Blues.  Beer.  Food.  Spiderman 2. ?  Maybe it wasn't such a rewarding experience.  But, I know now that I'm home it feels pretty good.    numb mouth. food. please.
