      The second first post in the history of The Asylum.  I want you all to welcome to Anders Sørensen, the new co-owner of The Asylum.  There's still space if you want to join us. Just send me an e-mail and we'll talk.

      While I was sitting in my permanently dark gamer cave, enjoying the freedom known as not having to go to school for three months and reading entire webcomic archives just to have something´(Slightly) amusing to do, and the last page of MacHall appeared on my screen, I received a call from Anders who apparently had decided to save me from the clutches of boredom; Yes, a LAN party. And a long one it is. Here I am, on my last day, with bloodshot eyes and (Even more?) greasy hair from being completely depraved of sleep for the last 48 hours (twice) and this 5-day Jedi-academy/Battlefield Vietnam marathon is coming to an end. I was just about to plan my return to said Den without getting shot by the RIAA sniper that I'm pretty sure I can see on a rooftop across the street, when I thought of the Asylum. Lacking ideas for my escape, and anything better to do - I decided to fill the few of you who actually come here every once in a while in with a few of the cooler details.  My hard drive is humming tiredly, as my share is repeatedly raped (almost literally) by my two dear friends who apparently have discovered the beauty of Ren'ai (dating sim/visual novels which somehow incorporate romance and/or hentai) games and Love Hina episodes, whilst I harvest mp3 after mp3 from 11 of the thirteen Neon Genesis Evangelion CDs in existence... Ahh the sweet smell of burned plastic... Oh, crap... That's my hard drive...   Battlefield Vietnam, I've found, is an incredible game. It manages to be fun, but keeps the possibility killing 10 Vietnamese soldiers with nothing but a revolver (or the 'Clint', as we call it ^_-) - which is a feature I'd like to see in a few other decently fun games. Although Counter-Strike probably wouldn't make that much sense with Vietnamese people running around.  Joke aside; I'd say that this has been an incredible party, and apart from being bragged repeatedly at the Halflife Dragonball mod Earth's Special Forces (quite fun, actually. Especially counting the fact that DBZ is one of the most tedious and slow-progressing series in the history of mankind, only surpassed by "days of our lives". No comment needed. Yuck.) nothing has really been a problem. And that's quite rare in LAN parties. In fact, I don't believe it's ever happened to me before ^.^  I must bid you Sayonara for now, as the sounds my stomach is making clearly indicates that I might not have eaten enough toast yet. That, or I'll O.D. on bread and ham.

      Hmmm isn't that great? But you know what? That's a bad title cuz this entry has nothing to do with socks?   Then whyyyy did you title it like that? Are we really that blonde?  I dunno, I hate the world...  Oh there's a new day, tomorrow  Yes, and it will suck just like this one!  How do you know? It only sucks because your attitude sucks!  My attitude is the truth, no fault in that  Your attitude is just faithless, and you know it  Yes, I know it, but you know what? I just don't give a fuck about anyone or anything  I think you do...you're just a little down right now  Well if I'm down, YOU'RE DOWN, smartass...  Maaybe this should be titled: "Self-sontridiction...HEY LOOK! I'm skitzo!....MAN SHUT THE FUCK UP!"

      Ok, so I wrote this song awhile ago and I think it needs a little bit of work. I still want to keep it, though. It goes for almost everyone in the world, including me:  ***You tell me you hate/everything about me/you tell me I can't be wrong/you say I think I know it all/I think I'm stupid/I'm ugly inside/you're taking me down/when I've lost all my pride  Does it make you feel good/critisizing me/does it annoy you so much/I'm not exactly what you want me to be  Do you think you're perfect/everyone should be just like you/Do you think I should change/wake up and see/you have your faults too/nothing's that easy  Does it make you feel good/critisizing me/does it annoy you so much/I'm not exactly what you want me to be  We're so caught up in our hypocracy/who are we to judge/Can't you just let me be***   So for further news, I blame everything going wrong on this thing in my head. It has brought WAY too much negativety to my world. I've got problems with basically all of my friends sept. Andie.  And "I think I'm drifting away from the people I really need"-Trapt  Cori: *Pissed, she barely knows/cares that I exist anymore cuz she's little miss "happy go lucky, oh look at me 'I lie to myself'" and I'm not..so she found a new best friend who is just like her. Mandy: *Pissed, Mandy is a little poser now, who calls herself punk and claims she listens to all of this music that's she's never even heard...and she dresses like a prep, is a little goody-goody, but claims that she dresses like Avril Lavigne....lol. Rachael: *Annoyed, as we all know, Ray is lil wannabe-me... Brittany: *Weird, We do not bond anymore because I'm always depressed and she doesn't know how to deal with it..she's too perverted so we don't talk much lol. Ashley: *Annoyed, I love Ashley and the only prob. with her is she can be annoying Andie: *Sad, I miss her too much... Sam P:, *Hatred, hates me bc. she's cori's "little miss positive" and I think she needs to be slapped... Sam W., *Major Hate, Always talking shit behind my back, but yet, has no problem using me to make new friends Kay: *Uknown, actually, I don't really have a problem with Kay, sept. half of the reason that she hangs with me is so she can burn my cd's and do stupid shit with me...no prob here lol. Cheeto: *Guilt, I feel totally guilty about all the shit that I said to her, and I feel like shit...I just don't know anymore  News cont... I talked my parents into letting me keep the stray cat in the garage, he's pure white and beautiful..he has to stay in the garage most of the time but we feed him and take care of him. I felt like he was just looking for love, so I shall love him and we shall find other love together.  Phrase of the day: "Though shall not judge until the is perfect.."-Oh yeah, that was totally me Song Of The Day: Outside-Staind Event of the day: Eating like 1/4 of the gallon of Mint Chocolate Chip in the freezer with a spoon (although there is no spoon)...and seeing the bear in the tree outside of my window

      Love is destuction people...I tried to warn you but "nobody's listening." People who are loved and love people shall argue this statement to the death of it, but deep down inside we all know it is true. You're probably right (Not naming any names), the way I think will leave me dead by the time I am 15. W/e, you can't blame me for saying everything that you all are thinking deep down inside. I hate you all now, everyone..."and sooner or later you know I'll be dead"  Phrase of the day: (obviously) Love Is Destruction  Song Of The Day: Loser-3 Doors Down  Event of the day: Giving my dog a bath....haaaah

      Ok, so this weblog has not been very important so far but trust me it will become updated more when school is out. I went for a bike-ride today to clear my mind and rode right passed a snake. Holy shit I was scared. M'kay so approximitely 3.5 days left of school and I am only going to 2.5 of them. The Parade Of States was a total bore. One good thing about high school being 'we go from The Parade Of States to Battle Of The Bands.' Oh yeah.   Phrase of the day: "So, basically punks are like theifs of style?" -Ashley replied to my point about punks  Song Of The Day: Emotionless By Good Charlotte  Even Of The Day: The whole snake thing

      I HATE the end of school! Wait, I didn't come out that right.  I love the end of school, but I hate the work that comes with it. So, let's just say I hate the world and we all need to die...a lot. All of these jocks and preps need to die a very painful death. I'm in the middle of trying not to talk shit about people or judge anyone, none the less. It's not easy and no fun at all. Aaaand my math teacher is about to lean over my shoulder so bbs.

      Right so I haven't posted in quite awhile. Hmmm what has been up? Lots of swimming, drinking, flirting...yeah. So I've found that I need a hobbie, the only thing I really do is hang out with my friends, and I can no longer stand to be at home unless it is just for the night. I most likely have a job at a bar...the call will come in tomorrow if I get it. We can't afford shampoo right now if you want to know why I need one. I've been feeling what it's like to be happy again instead of depressed 24/7. It felt so good I have to do something to make myself happy. I, also, have to do something to make every day worth living. I'm okay with doing nothing, as long as I'm not doing 'nothing' at home or I'm doing 'nothing' with someone.  Phrase Of The Day: Hey Look! I can be a fishyyyy! Song Of The Day: Timberwolves In New Jersey -Taking Back Sunday Event Of The Day: Shane teaching me how to play pool at the bar I'm about to work at...
