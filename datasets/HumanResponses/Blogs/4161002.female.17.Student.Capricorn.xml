       Today, TP held their JC 1 CIP day.. Erm.. Our class did a fishing game stall... Well basically, all you have to do is hook up the styrofoam shapes from the basin of water... Very easy to win prizes.. No wonder so many children want to play and play again juz to get more prizes.. (herm.. So tan xin- haa haa..)      Just now went to Diana's blog:   urlLink  www.snowycool.blogspot.com    and read her posts (August one)... But hor I got one thing I really need to comment.. She worte too many "Hee hee" and "haa haa" in her post le.. Like every sentence also have.. (Diana, if you are reading this post right now, I hope you wouln't mind my comments although it might be too straight forward) Sorry ah...      Ok.. Know that Hui Ying's &amp; Hui Xian's Birthday coming soon... One more month.. I guess I wouldn't have time to celebrate for both of you on the actual day.. So sorry.. but I will think of really nice presents for both of you.. Maybe give you at the end of the year...      Ok.. Its time I study for my Promos... Good nite... Muack...

       Haiz...i am going to fail my CA!!! how??? too long never take exam liao and i felt that the environment there is so tense up, very stress. Strange thing is i am not stress before the test. it's during the paper tt i felt so stress up. Suddenly cannot remember things!!! sian lohz... After CA, went out with Diana, Melissa, Amber and li zhen.have lunch and some window shopping. Ha...ha... i got two friends who love ban mian too, Melissa especially. she can eat that everyday without getting sick of it!!! IMPREESSED. Melissa's dad franchise sell very nice chicken wings. bu ji bu jue de ate three. haiz...i thought i want to jian fei??!! actually thought of going to Orchard. but the MRT service down. We are TRAP!!! i was puzzled. wondering what happen. just then a man say " you si ren" and my friend also said that her friend said a 10 years old girl jump down. i was shocked. life is so unpredictable. we were enjoying ourselves in the mall and such terrible thing happen outside. after watching the news then i know tt a accident happen, a man was knocked down and the train was down for around 46 minutes. so my friend lied abt the girl lah... haiz... wo liao i was so scared tt i didn't take train. so i took 61 from bukit batdok to my house. wo lao 1.5hrs leh. so long... but quite enjoyable lah. diana and i like mad wan loh. she always molest me, pull my shirt!!! ha...ha... then i started to punch her again. aiyoyo, she so scared of pian. After i punch her, she would just start laughing, non stop. so so funny. hey... my birthday coming le leh. one more month hor...  yoru...

       Yoz...honestly i am very glad that you miss us so much. This shows that you truely believe and treasure your friendship. I understands this feeling, very much... Surprisingly, i don't really miss BNSS. I won't think abt our classroom, the toiltes tt we frequent, the canteen, the music room, the ava room or any other rooms. Because it is just a place. It is the ppl, the feeling tt we have which makes those places meaningful. Right? However so sad, "Time is God's way to keep everything from happening at once" so let's keep this happy memory forever.      A Friend That's Always There   If I could catch a rainbow I would do it just for you And share with you it's beauty on the days you're feeling blue If I could build a mountain you could call your very own A place to find serenity A place to be alone........... If I could take your troubles I would toss them in the sea But all these things I'm finding are impossible for me I cannot build a mountain or catch a rainbow fair But let me be what I know best A friend that's always there.

       东西如果不好好保存, 很容易就会从你的手中溜走... 反正, 美好的东西永远都不能永久... 失去的往往都是最美的… 到最后, 美好的东西也只剩回忆陪着你… 就算你从回当时的地点, 把当时的情景演出来, 也不能得回过去原本的感觉… 总之, 珍惜现在所拥有的, 把美好的回忆当做是自己曾经拥有的幸福…   Natsu

       Hermm... Just now went to Hui Xian's blog to take a look (  urlLink  www.placeinmyheart.blogspot.com   )   From her words, can see that she really enjoy her school life... Like very fun... Very happy for her...      Just now met Yoru downstairs... She wants to seek my opinion- if I would like to go K-box with her friends... Actually, on second thoughts, don't mind lah but I wouldn't be veri comfortable coz I don't even know her friends... HOWEVER, from Yoru words, can see that she starts to enjoy school life very much... Very happy for her also...      Actually... I know you guys wouldn't forget me... (maybe for your entire life) coz we actually spent quite some quality time together in BN... But don't know why.. Just can't stop thinking about my sec sch.. I don't miss it as much as I do during April (When I started JC) but.. still can't bear to "fang kai".. Can't stop thinking of the classroom...       Yoru.. maybe at this point of time, you might feel that I am toooo obsess with BNSS... Haiz.. its a funny feeling... don't know how to describe.. Friends in TP are good.. but can't stop thinking of you gers... haiz.. don't know lah.. (Write till here, start to feel a bit down coz begun to miss sec 4 even more) haa haa...      Wah.. I like writing compo.. Yoru.. hope that you can just read this post.. I think you don't have to like "an wei" wo (don't know if you intend to a not.. haa haa) coz actually what I have written here is not exactly how I feel too.. I juz can't describe my feelings in words... haiz... At this point, can only say.....      I miss the very fun time we had at BN... Anyway, really happy that all of you guys are fitting well in your schs... Very glad to see that (this is my zhen xin hua)... Forget me Not!!!! Good Nite... Muack...      Natsu

      Yoz...sorching sun, so sleepy (ZZZ), no mood to study. sian lohz... Yesterday hui xian, diana and i went for the year book briefing, photography. They even order pizza loh (ha...ha... can ask me make mah, no need waste money buying) as though a small party. Well didn't quite enjoy it. A bit sian... okay, their club are considering to merge the two department, the photography and the designing as one. (it's fine with me loh cause i am interested in both) Quite interesting to go around school of business and take event pictures. (erm...a bit like mrs fong like tt loh) BUT the sian part is, they only give 1 cca points per semester (tt's no matter how active you are in the club, die die also 1 point unless you are the committee lah then get 2). tt's very little. The extra module, business chinese tt i join, one semester already got 4 cca points lohz... hence i decided to try the changi youth ambassador. must go through interview. hope choosen loh.  yoru...
