      I am a Japanese ex-investment banker, living in Hong Kong for 14 years. I have a wonderful family: my beautiful, supportive, and motivated wife, healthy 7-year son, and adorable almost-3-year daugther.   I lost my job in April, and since then have been looking for oppourtunites in the line of business I know very well - I was responsible for originating/executing securitisation in my last position. I am very much rooted in Hong Kong now, so I have been trying to find a position in Hong Kong.   Well, I was very optimistic - at first. Economy in Hong Kong as well the rest of the world, including even Japan has been booming. Somehow, however, I do not even get interviews.   Though I am 44 years old, I look much younger (most people think I am in mid-thirties), and have enough energies to get the things done.&nbsp;I wonder why I am left from the rest of the world...and all the financial resouces are just running out.   Maybe by reading the above you think I look downbeated. Opposite. One may definitely think when he/she sees me that I am wealthy, successful person. Not only I am good at projecting such good image, but also I beleive from the bottom of my heart that I am gifted and protected by the God, or whatever the devine existence.   In the last one month or so, I am very busy, reading at the library, pondering over the future, and also fire-fighting against financial crisies as they emerges.   This morning, I was reading an article in the Far Eastern Economic Review about the KM (Knoweldge Management). There is a case about one company firing the guy called Kelvin, because he was spending too much time in the water-cooler. After that, the performance of the company&nbsp;went down and&nbsp;it found what Kelvin was doing was effectively sharing of his expertiese.&nbsp; The message was that what appeared waste-of-time was the time for creating the foundation of the more productivitiy.   I now cherish my FREE time, becuase somewhere in my heart I also feel that this is the time to re-energize myself.&nbsp;   What about my financial health? Well, I  know  that I win the lottery very soon. I had been loose on money matters before, but this financial difficulty (which in fact started three-four years ago) taught me the importance of money. Despite my profession, I was not sensitive to the value of the money. Now I am different: I adore every single penny I have and I know that I can handle a sudden wealth very wisely.   Anyway, I am very positive in the environment many people would percieve the hell.   This is my first blogging. This helps me to put the things into perspective. I get my thought well organized.   Cheers !
