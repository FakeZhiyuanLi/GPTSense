      Well, we are almost finished with the first bathroom upstairs. We put in a new floor, using vinyl tiles, installed wainscotting and new trim, and started the painting on the upper half of the walls. I'm going to put venetian plaster on the top half, but we haven't gotten that far. We also installed a new light fixture and new hardware on the vanity. I've gone through about three shower curtains already that haven't met with my satisfaction, but I'm hoping that my luck will change, and I'll find the perfect shower curtain soon...how exciting is this? My life revolves around the perfect shower curtain! :) My dad is probably pretty sick of looking at this room, as he's done most of the work. Karl's been in Washington, my mom is out of commission due to a nasty fall onto a shelf (really gross...and painful I'm sure), and I don't really know what I'm doing :) I suck with measurements too. Apparently none of the walls in that room are square, and the floor is basically uneven. I did paint the trim though, and patched some holes. I'm quite the Bob Vila, aren't I? :) That's all for now...on to other parts of the house soon!

      When we closed on the house (5/21/04), we came over and started to prepare it for our move. We certainly didn't know what we were in for...What a mess!!! These people must have never cleaned anything in three years. Yuck! The kitchen was scrubbed...then scrubbed again. We tore down all the lovely (hideous) wallpaper and painted everything white. We also found that the kitchen sink had had a major leak, and somebody had stuck a piece of carpet (yes, carpet) under the sink to hide the water damage. So my dad tore out the cabinet and patched up the walls, then he and Karl installed a new faucet. The fun has only just begun!!!
