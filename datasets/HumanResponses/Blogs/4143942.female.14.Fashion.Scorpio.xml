       I'm just an emo girl.. Stuck in my own cruel world.. A tough outer shell.. With a deep inner hell.. I'm waiting for my savoir to come.. I think I have a good beat.. Just like every one I meet.. Another stand-out face in the crowd.. That’ll shout it out loud.. I'm waiting for my savoir to come.. The stereotypical picture.. Of a rock-punk golden mixture.. My attitude it never dies.. But still inside I cry and cry.. I'm waiting for my savior to come.. I think that everybody knows.. The pain inside that I withhold.. With all the anger, hurt, and sin.. That I do not keep within.. I'm just an emo girl.. Stuck in my own cruel world.. A tough outer shell.. With a deep inner hell.. I'm  waiting for my savoir to come..

      Baby won´t you tell me why.. there is sadness in your eyes.. I don´t wanna say goodbye to you.. Love is one big illusion.. I should try to forget.. But there is something left in my head.. You´re the one who set it up.. now you´re the one to make it stop.. I´m the one who´s feeling lost right now.. Now you want me to forget every little thing you said.. But there is something left in my head.. I won´t forget the way you´re kissing.. The feeling´s so strong.. were lasting for so long.. But I´m not the "girl" your heart is missing.. That´s why you go away.. i know.. You were never satisfied.. no matter how I tried.. Now you wanna say goodbye to me.. Love is one big illusion.. I should try to forget.. But there is something left in my head.. I won´t forget the way you´re kissing.. The feeling´s so strong..  were lasting for so long.. But I´m not the "girl" your heart is missing.. That´s why you go away.. i know.. Sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere.. Don´t know which way to go.. There ain´t so much to say now between us.. There ain´t so much for you.. There aint´t so much for me.. anymore..

       I'm not a perfect person.. As many things I wish I didn't do.. But I continue learning.. I never meant to do those things to you.. And so I have to say before I go.. That I just want you to know.. I've found a reason for me.. To change who I used to be.. A reason to start over new.. and the reason is you.. I'm sorry that I hurt you.. It's something I must live with everyday.. And all the pain I put you through.. I wish that I could take it all away.. And be the one who catches all your tears.. Thats why i need you to hear.. I've found a resaon for me.. To change who I used to be.. A reason to start over new.. and the reason is You.. I'm not a perfect person.. I never meant to do those things to you.. And so I have to say before I go.. That I just want you to know.. I've found a reason for me.. To change who I used to be.. A reason to start over new.. and the reason is you.. I've found a reason to show.. A side of me you didn't know.. A reason for all that I do.. And the reason is you..

       This heart is not the the 1st heart broken.. my eyes are not the first to cry.. i'm not the first to know.. there's just no getting over u..i know im just a fool who's willing.. to sit around and wait 4 u.. But baby cant u c? there's nothing left 4 me 2 do.. I'm hopelessly devoted 2 u..  but now there's nowhere 2 hide.. since u pushed my love aside.. i'm outta my head.. Hopeleesly devoted to u.. My head is saying "fool forget him" my heart is saying "dont let go".. hold on till the end and that's what i intend to do.. I'm hopelessly devoted to u..   come Notice me, and take my hand.. Why are we strangers when Our love is strong.. Why carry on without me.. Everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small.. I guess I need you, baby.. And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you, baby.. I make believe that you are here.. It's the only way I see clear.. What have I done.. You seem to move on easy.. And everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, baby.. And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, its haunting me.. I guess I need you, baby.. I may have made it rain.. Please forgive me.. My weakness caused you pain.. And this song's my sorry.. At night I pray That soon your face will fade away..   princessP sings it all..bwobwoy!!
