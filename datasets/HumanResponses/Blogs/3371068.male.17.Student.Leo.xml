      So myself, Kyle, Matt and my friend Melissa camped out in the park near my house with a lot of booze and drank ourselves silly. Long story short, Kyle thought that Eric Lindros was trying to kill us and that only he could protect us, Melissa started crying because she thought that noone loved her (she's just getting over this creep who dumped her after 11 months by saying that he didn't love her), I was trying to calm Kyle down so that he didn't kill everyone, and Matt was laughing. Isn't life grand?

      Howdy. i haven't been on here for a while. Not much happened in the world of Brynn. I had another freak out with one of my personas, went to Matts cottage and got to hear about him beating the crap out of his brother for shooting shit at him in the early morn, and got unusually giddy about slipknots new C.D which is kickass, and two of my friends finally sharing their feelings (emenates giddiness) And no im not totally gay just giddy. Ok im kinda gay. But i have a girlfriend! haha nice save. Anyways, im supposed to do stuff with my friend Melissa on saturday. And im also going to be doing stuff tommorow with corporate steve for a project. Why am I telling people this? As far as my freakout goes, someone refer to chelsea cause im not too aware of the details.             - she seemed dressed in all of me, stretched across my shame all the torment and the pain                                      -slipknots new cd!!! so good!!

      So anyway, tommorow there's no school because this cop got killed by a seriously fucked up kid. I mean the kid cut his throat! So im supposed to do stuff with my girlfriend and my friends tommorow. I should feel bad that im benifitting from this guys death with a day off but lukily i lost the ability to give a shit about alot of things in the past few years. My parents are stupid drunks and my brother's an egotistical fuck up with a single digit I.Q. I got in late last night and my parents went naturally balistic. I would have too. But they know how to push something until it's too far. They sit me there and yell at me about random mistakes i've made in my entire life for an hour and by the end of it i succesfully managed to teach myself to say entire sentences backwards in my head. Shows i was paying attention eh? I am still kinda iffy about this whole sharing my feelings on the blog thingy. I have alot of shit im not sure im willing to share where my friends can read it. Only two people in the entire world know this shit about me. Aw well. I'll try to improve my ability to randomly spit out thoughts without considering consequences. later.

      the campfire was cool. I guess. Beats the shit out of doing nothing. Well my life has kinda fallen back together. I haven't talked to Chelsea in a few weeks and I kinda like it that way. I still care for her but..... Im starting to sound like a broken record. Aw well. In happier news, Im going out with a girl I've loved since I was a kid. Melissa. She's like the ultimate complete package of goodness. She's pretty, really fucking smart, hard working, funny as hell and for some strange reason loves me back. What is it that some girls who are way out of my league see in me?

      I have poison ivy on my face (among other places), I have a sadistic bitch of a mother who has no remorse for the fact that I have not slept due to said poison ivy, and she is deliberately being a total bitch to me just to make me mad so she can get me in trouble. I fucking hate my life. Oh yeah and did we mention that we cant go to work at Mickey's on Thursday because once again poison ivy.

      Today I had my religion exam. Fun. I got all worked up on an essay about my feelings about Religions and the human soul that it was basically a rant about how jealous I am of people of faith. Same old. Walked around with Kyle, Steve, Mike and Andrew for a few hours, ate pizza and here I am. At home. Im supposed to go to a job interview at a burger place tonight. I guess it's about time I decided to upgrade the amount of money I take in a month from zero to something in the hundred area. Should be cool. I have a math exam tommorow and I am gonna fail. No fucking hope.Aw well.... should study......bleh.

      Huh. Well that was odd.           This friday, i went to the movies with matt melissa and little amanda. I tried to get a hold of Chelsea to go but I only had her old cell number ( and she has no home phone). So we went to the movies only to find that the movie we were going to see wasn't in. That sucked so we wandered around for a few hours. Saturday morning, Chelsea calls me and bitches me out for not going to her house and grabbing her despite the fact that I tried to call her and we were in a rush to go to the early show and couldn't make a detour. After making me feel like a piece of shit for a while she proceeds to tell me that she wants to do something on Sunday. Ok. Im good for that. That night I went to my friends house in Bowmanville and got plastered as well as saw Chronicles of Riddick.Good fucking movie. Sunday rolls around and Chelsea said she would call Matts at 11 because she was at her sisters house (?). She doesn't call so Matt myself and lil' Amanda hang out all day. You can bet im gonna get bitched out over this event though it's not my fault. Im gonna just stop giving a shit. She isn't my girlfriend anymore and as mean as it sounds, I dont have to answer to her anymore.    I can see you but you cant see me. I could touch you and you couldn't even feel me.

       I've engaged depression mode. I think there might be something horribly wrong with me. I mean whats not to be happy about? I broke up with a girl I love, I've come to the conclusion that despite the fact that people ( teachers parents and peers) are always telling me how intelligent I am, I will amount to nothing. I've reverted back to my nothings wrong with me (insert dry whit) mode. Nothing at all to be horribly depressed about. And I'm serious. I've fucked things up worse than this without getting all depressed before. I wonder why I cant deal with something that earlier in life I would have been able to shrug off? It's days like this I wish I had a religion to fall back on. I envy people who have faith despite my making fun of them on a fairly regular basis. It's just a pang of jealousy I fear. Aw well too late to change who I am now. It really is. Bleh.

      Haven't posted for a while so I figured I might as well. In reference to my crisis, most people probably know. I broke it off with Chelsea. Im kinda pissed off at myself for hurting her but there was no other way. It was either hurt her now or hurt her even worse later. I think I made the logical choice. I cant be involved in relationships. I get too scared and run away. Im too imature.... aw well. Thats all that happened in my life recently of any import.

      I lost my fucking job because some stupid wiseass bitch complained to my boss about me not getting her meal ready in five minutes when I was working the cash and making food myself with four other customers trying to order. She came in and demanded free food and went overboard. She got me fired and if I ever meet her she will pay. I also got a new cd by a band called Deicide and let me tell you they really hate God. GRRRR!

      Today is my birthday. It is also the opening day of Catwoman. Which I realize is probably going to be a terrible movie. My birthday will be that movies anniversary. From now on we celebrate not my birth but the making of a movie that catwoman fans everywhere hate with a passion that consumes them. It's raining outside today, as it does on all of my birthdays as far back as I can remember. Which is good because I love the rain. It's mother natures little birthday present to me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was on this planetrip this one time when the captain comes on the intercom. He goes through all the technical mumbo jumbo, we'll be flying at 35000 feet, shit like that. Anyway, he sets down the little speaker thingy but forgets to turn it off.&nbsp;He turns to the co-pilot and says; "All I need right now is a blowjob and a cup of coffee." Just like that. The flight attendent goes wide eyed and runs to the front of&nbsp;the plane to tell the captain he left the mike on. Some wiseass in the back of the plane yells after her "Don't forget the coffee"."

      I got me some new boots. Big angry boots with big angry buckles. I also got a pin saying "I'd rather be worshipping Satan". Which I would. Satanism is apparently the most pro- happiness religion out there. If you are disilussioned with all those sissy relgions about self sacrifice and long days of prayer and beggin forgiveness, i suggest you look into it. I haven't spoke to Mandy or Emily or Becca face to face in a long time and I'm hoping that I get to see Mandy and Emily before they both leave. Unless I did something to make them dislike me. In which case I guess I'd better just put them to the back of my mind. I do that with alot of dissapointing situations. Forget. &nbsp; Look away *giggles*

      Theres something about being capable of putting all of your feelings on a computer screen that makes the feelings feel less real. Leave it to technology to dull expression. Now that I find I can open up to people more and more I really dont want to. I sometimes feel like pissing all of my friends off and then having them never talk to me again. There's no reason for it. I love my friends. I guess in some ways I just view it as an inevitable end. I suppose I just want to get it over with.

      Hello peoples. I'm not really angry I just cant think of a title for a post where I rant about nothing...... Anyways, I haven't been paid for the long weekend yet where I worked all the fucking weekend. They have only paid me for 8 hours. I have worked 26 since I got this job. Fucking assholes. I finally saw butterfly effect last night. I was impressed. Just goes to show if you take a great story, even the worst of actors (the Kutcher guy) can actually do well. Huh. Anyways, I miss talking to Becca and want to hang out with her. I also have to make time to hang out with Emily and Mandy before they go (sob). Aw well, ciao.

      We got trashed last night. By we I mean myself, Matt, Mandy, Kyle and Emily. Melissa and Arthur were supposed to come but there were complications. Emily and I got so drunk that we required help walking. I still dont know if Mandy and Emily got home alright. Matt got me home and we both passed out the second we entered my house sometime in between 2 and 4. I cant recall. My mom knows that I was drunk and shows a typical disregard for it. Kyle, by the way, stumbled home, almost got into a fight with a drunk, and broke the window in his basement in order to get into his house. Hells ya.
