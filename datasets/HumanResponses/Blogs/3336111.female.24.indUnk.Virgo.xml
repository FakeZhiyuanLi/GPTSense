      Renee' and I went to see  urlLink The Molly Ringwalds  at The Varsity.  I have to say that while there performances are always enjoyable, they have really come a long way since the last time I saw them.  Its been a couple years and they have used them well.  I liked their costumes better (especially pee-wee herman) and they seemed to have more fun together than they used to.  All in all, both Renee' and I enjoyed the show.    The best moment of the evening was from the opening act.  Lets just say that the lead singer of Lazy K learned a very valuable lesson tonight...if you are going to do a Michael Jackson dance on stage, make sure your pants will allow you to do it.  If they will not allow you to do the dance, make sure that you are wearing underwear.  Wardrobe misfunction??? We'll never know.

      The first week of my internship went well.  I spent the week getting familiar with the company, how the audit department works and how the company is handling SOX.  All in all, I spent the majority of the week sending emails to the audit intern in New Orleans just so that both of us could look busy when we couldn't handle reading the current audit workpapers any longer.    Both Pascagoula and Gautier have turned out to be (surpise, surprise) a bit slow.  The highlight of my town experience so far has been the Treasure Hunt in Gautier.  Treasure Hunt is like a Tuesday's Morning, only with clothes and cans of peas instead of 1,000 different varieties of cheese straw mixes.  There were some interesting things there.  There were some down right scary things (read cans of peas) there.

      Okay, So last week was my week from hell.  It was the fun kinda hell though.  I laughed more during that week than I have in a LONG time.  I will probably never look at flowcharting without seeing Curtis getting drunk in a canoe with a beer he was hiding from Dana or see a clip from "The Ladies Man" without thinking of Robert Lay. And I still have that damn Aicha song stuck in my head.  In case I haven't told you anything about that class, it is called Case Studies, but is really a class that focuses on presentation skills.  I had 9 presentations due in 5 days.  I worked nonstop from about 7 in the morning until around 11:30 at night.  I'm still dreaming about powerpoint and hand gestures.    I made the move to Pascagoula on Saturday.  I will be calling room 128 at the Suburban Lodge "home" for the next 3 months.  So far I've visited both Biloxi and the mall in Mobile, both of which are about 30 minutes away.    Work starts tommorrow and I'm pretty sure my dreams will quickly turn from presentations to SOX (sarbanes-oxley is the legislation that came about after the fall of Enron and Worldcom and the scandles with Tyco and is the main focus of internal auditing this year).  I'm looking forward to it but I am a bit nervous.    However, I plan on loosing myself in The Princess Bride (on AMC) in the meantime.

      I went to see the movie Troy yesterday.  It has been a long time since I've read Homer's Iliad, so I was fuzzy on the plot.  This was nice because I found myself hoping the trogans would win and Achilles would come and live in Troy (happily ever after) and the mean king would give up and go home.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a war drama.   All I can say is Wow! Men in skirts!   Yea! Men in skirts!

      Something was brought to my attention today and I would like to get ya'lls opinion on it.    Do you think romance is dead?  Some people believe that single women, when on a first date, have a bit of a chip on their shoulder.  If their date shows up with flowers, takes them to a really nice restaurant and treats them like a queen for the night, they wonder what he wants in return.    I will argue that the women's movement has changed society to the point that women don't need a man in their life to make them complete.  While this doesn't mean that they don't want a man in their life, they don't have the same ideals as they did before the women's movement.  They can (and for the most part do) have a direction in life that does not include "earning their MRS. degree" after high school.    Do you think that it is women's change in attitude (self-sufficient, self-aware) or do you think men have a tendency to "push" a little harder thinking that today's women will give them something in return for flowers and a candlelight dinner?  Am I completely off target here?  Is there something that I'm missing?

      So, this is the first time i've blogged...obvious, i know...so bear with me.  I'm pleasantly unemployeed at the moment.  Good times, good times.  I have less than 72 hours before my next class starts.  It will last one hellish week (although i've been told it is a great class) and then I'm off to Pascagoula.  Gautier to be exact, but since Pascagoula is the most recognizable city near Gautier and I'll actually be working in the big P, I'm going to call Pacagoula "home" this summer.    Enough for now, will write more later.

      I had the opporunity to go on board the  urlLink USS Chung Hoon  Yesterday.  This ship has already been turned over to the Navy, but has not left the Ship Yard yet.  It heads for Hawaii in 3 weeks.    I have to say that this was one of the coolest experiences I've had here so far.  We actually had to hijack a sailor to get us on board.  After him leading us around for about 10 minutes, one of the deck officers spotted us and took over the tour.  We got to see everything from the engines, rudders and pistons to the command center (Restricted area: where they fire all the big guns) and the Steer House (i think that's what it is called...its where they steer the ship). We also walked down in the area where the men and women were killed in the terrorist attack on the  urlLink USS Cole   While it was an awe inspiring experience and I truely do respect the men and women in the Navy (and armed forces, in general), I don't think I could ever live on a ship.  My legs hurt and I know I have 15 new bruises today.  Thank God I was wearing a hard hat!  I almost knocked myself out going up a set of stairs in that ship.  I think I'd be one giant bruise if I stayed on the ship!

      I have seen 2 movies in the last week....Dodgeball which was just downright hilarious and Saved! which was extremely funny in a "Drop Dead Gorgeous" kind of way.  I highly recommend either of them.  I'd pay the full $8 to see Dodgeball, but if you are looking for a good matinee, definitely check out Saved!.

      Part 2  The trip to Palm Springs failed miserably the first go round and the next day did not go exactly as planned. We arrived at the airport in Gulfport at 4:30am.  We were told to arrive at that time by the Continental counter people the night before b/c the airport has a tendency to get crowded on Monday mornings.  So, we arrived a 4:30am, checked in quickly (no line) and proceed up to security....which is closed until 5am.  The continental people really won a lot of our love back by asking us to arrive at a time in which we wouldn't be able to even go through security to the gate. BOO!  HISS!  The 6am flight we caught that morning was delayed 45 minutes, but we did manage to not only taxi away from the gate, but we actually took off on that try.  We arrived at Houston in plenty of time to catch our connection, but once we got there, one of the guys realized that he was booked on a flight to Palm Springs that didn't leave until 5pm.  He was able to get it changed to the flight we were on to San Diego and that flight took off at the scheduled time.    We get to San Diego as scheduled, but we still need to collect our luggage, pick up the rental car and drive the 2 or so hours to Palm Springs.  Eric's luggage didn't show up on that flight b/c although they had changed his flight to match ours, they never got the luggage to the right place to get it on our flight.  It came into Palm Springs late that night.    We head to the car rental place and find out that they have lost our reservations.  Fortunately, they had a SUV that we could use and we headed to Palm Springs.  If any of ya'll have traveled near San Bernidido, you may have seen the thousands of windmills that they have out there.  It proved to be rather distracting b/c we managed to completely miss some item (we think it was a muffler) laying in the middle of the road. When we hit the thing, it ripped apart under the car and knocked the back bumper partially off the car and punctured a hole in the bumper.    Part 3  We finally got to Palm Springs and I had enough time to check in, take the golf cart to my room (out in East Hell) and run back to the main hall to attend a new hire orientation.    Needless to say, we all slept well that night.    The resort was really nice and we all enjoyed the conference.  Dan and I gave our presentation on Wednesday and it went really well.  Everyone seemed really impressed with us and we got a lot of compliments on it.  Dan and I also got grief the entire week about our age. Both of us and the other intern (Andrew) were the youngest people there and there were a lot of jokes about carding us.    The trip was a lot of fun, but I'm glad to be back home (or hotel) in Gautier.  Our trip back started a little rocky (some tickets were messed up and they had my manager on a flight to Washington) but didn't get really rough until the flight from Houston to Gulfport.  I had a guy sitting behind me that NEVER stopped talking. Since we were on a puddle jumper, he had to talk VERY loud to get his voice over the sound of the engines....I was tired, grumpy and ready to scream by the time we started our approach to Gulfport.  For some reason, it seemed like it was taking a really long time to make the approach. Then the captain came on and told us that due to bad weather sitting over the airport, we were going to have to circle for a little while....20 minutes later, he told us that we were going to head to Mobile to re-fuel.    AHHHH!  We de-planed and asked for our luggage, deciding to rent a car and drive the 40 minutes to Gulfport from Mobile.  We get to the car rental counters at the airport and are told that there are no cars for us to rent unless we have a reservation.    AHHHH!!!  So, we took a taxi back to Gulfport, picked up our cars and drove back to our respective towns.  It is SOOO good to be back.

      Today we arrived at the Gulfport airport to catch a flight to Houston with a connecting flight to Palm Springs.  We boarded the plane, taxied to the runway and was then told that due to weather, we were going to be delayed.  We sat on the runway for 45 minutes before they told us that there was still no word on weather conditions in Houston.  So, we taxied back to the gate.  3 hours later, after a trip to the bar, we were allowed to reboard the plane with clearance to land in Houston.  We taxi back out to the run way, sit there for a minute and then slowly start taxing back to the gate.  Hmmm. This is odd...my co-workers and I are very confused as to what possible reason we could have for going back to the terminal.  Our confusion was soon answered by the captain announcing that the flight crew had run out of working hours and could not complete the flight.  They tried to get us another flight crew, but were unsucessful, so we "de-planed".  I am writing this from the Holiday Inn in Gulfport.  I have about 4 hours to sleep, then we are catching a 6am flight to Houston.    I have no doubts the weather that kept us from Houston will be here tomorrow morning, just in time to keep us from leaving at 6am.   So far, Palm Springs is a BLAST.  Yeah. (sarcasm)

      I recieved next week's weather forcast for my trip to Palm Springs, CA. Wow. It sure is nice of the weather to jump from the mid 90's to an average of 105 for the week.  From what I understand, 105 will still be an improvement over the temps during last years off-site convention.  I plan on staying inside in the hospitality room as much as possible and I'm damn glad I chose to get the massage/facial instead of golf (i mean, come on). I think that I am still going to claim a finger injury as the reason for my bad bowling game (team building excerises, I'm on the VP's bowling team).    Mary and  urlLink Richard  made me very jealous with their purchase of ACL Fest tickets.  I wanna go.  I have a feeling that if they do end up going, I will also end up in Austin that weekend. I miss Austin.  It's such a great city.  I really want to take some time a go back to explore all the things that I didn't do when I lived there.

      Ok. So. The water in Pascagoula has a slight yellowish tint to it.  In order to avoid ingesting whatever chemical/property that makes the water this color, most people in this area drink a lot of bottled water.  Every office at Northrop Grumman has a water cooler.  Yesterday, ours was empty.  Being an enterprising intern, I decided that I could change the water bottle myself...afterall, the big burly men who deliver the water don't seem to struggle to do this (and we all know that I have just as much upper body strength as they do).  I did pretty well until the suction took the 5 gallon bottle and slammed it down on my finger.  I'm going to be wearing a lot of purple nail polish in next few months.  I'm trying to make a trip to shipyard hospital to get the finger looked at.   Unrelated to this, but equally as interesting (at least to me) is the club at LSU that I just joined.   urlLink The Mean Team.   Wow.

      I'm sick. Booo. I have a cold and can't breathe through my nose.  The upside is that Melissa has come to visit me this weekend.  The downside is that I will probably get her sick. Then she will turn into someone else (who shall not be named) and start blaming me for all of her illnesses even though we live several hundreds of miles apart.  Damn you Melissa!  I'm very happy that she came to visit me becuase it is giving me the opportunity to explore the area.  We ate at a restaurant called Phonecia's last night.  It is a Greak/Lebanese restaurant in Ocean Springs.  Everything we had (Coconut Shrimp, Crab & Artichoke soup, Kafta Kabobs) was VERY good.  Next time, we are going to have to listen to what people tell us and bring our own wine.  The restaurant apparently doesn't have a liquor license but encourages you to byob.    The most surprising thing about the restaurant (or I guess Ocean Springs in general) is that it is surrounded by this little street of unique shops and restaurants.  It reminded me of Austin's Duval near 45th.   We have every intention of checking out those shops today before we go to the Casino's and (more importantly) to see Harry Potter.

      I went to Biloxi to see  urlLink Better Than Ezra  play the Z Club at  urlLink The Palace .  It has been several years since I've been to one of their concerts and I haven't really heard their more recent releases.  I'm happy to say that they still put on a good show.   They played a lot of the music from their first couple of CDs and even played "Hold That Tiger" for the LSU fans in the audience (much to the dismay of all the Ole Miss fans).  The Z Club is pretty small and we were able to get right up to the stage (a foot and a half from the band).  I have to say all of those highschool crush on a rockstar feelings came back when Kevin Griffin  did the "bad-ass guitar rockstar" pose right in front of me.  I also felt this when I had to brush by Travis McNabb as I was leaving the club later that night.  It was a good night.

      Today, since I'm SO busy at work, I went on HBO's website to see what movies will be playing this weekend and spotted the movie Ladybugs playing tommorrow morning.&nbsp; That movie came out when I was 11, and I immediately became a huge fan of Jonathan Brandis.&nbsp; I was part of the reason Seaquest DSV stayed on the air so long....  So, out of curiosity, I looked him up on IMDB and found out that he committed suicide last Novemeber.&nbsp;  Man, that was the last thing I expected.&nbsp; How did I miss that?

      Hey Austinites -  I'm coming for a visit in a couple of weeks.&nbsp; My last day of the internship is Friday the 13th (i'm sure I will end up in the hospital needing stiches for something so that I can go out with a bang). On the 14th, I plan on driving to Houston and spend the evening with Gretchen and Jeb and then heading to Austin on the 15th.&nbsp;   Consider this your warning.   :)

       Well, it has taken me just over 2 months to do so, but I'd like to comment on some of the styles I've seen during my stay in South Mississippi.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   P. Kyle, you may find this too painful to read.     &nbsp;   In general, Mississippi residents aren't all that different from Louisiana residents in fashion sense.&nbsp; I am, of course, not talking about Baton Rouge and LSU...it's a very attractive, fashion foward city.&nbsp; I haven't come across anyplace like that yet, but I suspect there are some (Oxford is rather preppy, isn't it?)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I do have to say that some of the employees (in particular the female staff) at NG have truly unique taste in fashion...     &nbsp;   (insert dun, duh, dunnnnh)     &nbsp;   Lots of loose, light weight knit pants on people who really shouldn't be wearing them and lots of shoulder pads.&nbsp; This company hasn't exactly moved forward from the late 80's, early 90's.&nbsp; My absolute favorite has to be the woman I saw the other day.     &nbsp;   Imagine this:    Black and White Shirt    Black Skirt    Black Panty Hose    WHITE OPEN TOED SANDALS     &nbsp;   (insert screams and shrieks of agony)     &nbsp;   On&nbsp;a different note, Happy Belated Anniversary to Mary and  urlLink Richard  and Happy (early) B-day to Mary!

       Mary and Richard - I hope you made it home safe. It was great seeing you this weekend.    &nbsp;  The LSU bookstore's website has really progressed in the last couple of years.&nbsp; You can now order your textbooks online, instead of fighting the crowds during the first few days of school.&nbsp; Out of curiousity, I checked out what it would cost for my books this semester.&nbsp; I'm only taking 4 classes. &nbsp;  Thank God!&nbsp; I've already purchased the review manuals I need for one of the classes, spending $100.&nbsp; The other 3 classes will run me about $700.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  No, that's not a mis-type.&nbsp; 7-0-0.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Man.

      One of the men that I work with has a wife who, as it turns out, is more accident prone than even I am.&nbsp; I'm sure you're asking how this can be with stories such as "falling out the car with a sleeping 2 year old in my arms", " urlLink changing the water cooler "&nbsp;and, for those of you who've heard the story, The Infamous Cop Car Incident... but it is true.&nbsp;   Last night, Lori, while on a business trip in New Orleans, was having a nice dinner at Mr. B's.&nbsp; A waiter was passing behind her with a serving tray full of plates, lost his balance and dropped the whole thing on her head.&nbsp; Plates shattered as they hit her.&nbsp; She ended up in the hospital having to get CAT scans and everything.&nbsp;   Makes me realize&nbsp;how&nbsp;fortunate I actually am. &nbsp;

      Have you ever watched a movie from your childhood and seen a current popular actor in a bit part?&nbsp; Its kinda like when Lani and I were watching Anne of Avonlea in college and noticed that Bruce McCollouch and Dave Foley were in it in bit parts.&nbsp; Kinda makes you wonder if that movie was were it all started for them....did they know each other before then?  &nbsp;  Last night, while at Target Boutique, I spotted a DVD copy of Flight of the Navigator.&nbsp; This is one of the movies that I remember fondly from the 80's along with other such movies as  urlLink Poison Ivy  and  urlLink Space Camp .&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't seen a VHS version of this movie and was quite excited to see it on DVD, so I bought it.&nbsp; I HAD to have it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  While watching it this morning, I noticed that there was a guy that looked and sounded exactly like Matthew McConaughey.&nbsp; It was a small part with only one or two lines, so he wasn't on the screen long enough for me to be sure.&nbsp; Also, he's not listed on IMDB's website for the  urlLink movie .&nbsp; Whether or not it was him, it made me laugh.

      Yesterday, several people in my office got cravings for Chinese food.  Since I'm always up for Chinese food, and the people in my office don't normally eat out at lunch, this was rather exciting.  On our way through the Big P, while driving through an intersection, the car in front of us slammed on their brakes.  We promptly slammed on our brakes and managed to avoid hitting that car.  Unfortunately for us, the car behind us didn't have such fast reflexes...30 minutes later, after the motorcycle cop (fancy for the Big P) wrote up the accident report, took down all of our names, addresses, ages and made sure we weren't injured, we were once again on our way to eat Chinese food.   When we got back to the office, we called our manager (he and our director are out of town all week) and told him that his entire IA staff was out on medical leave due to the car accident.   They not only didn't believe us, but they thought we were making the car accident up!  Please!  I spent the majority of yesterday finally composing the complaint letter to Continental for our  urlLink trip from hell .  I have only written about the majority of the things that happened to us while flying Continental and have not been overly elaborate.  So far, I'm up to 11 pages.  I forgot how much fun writing a good complaint letter can be!  Either it will get us 11 free first class tickets to anywhere in the US, or Northrop Grumman will be contacted, and I will be fired.   I'll keep you posted.

      For those of you who don't know, my dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer about a month ago.  We're fortunate because it is a very treatable cancer and it has been caught in the early stages. Treatments include surgery or radiation.  Dad decided to go with surgery and went under the knife last Wednesday morning. Everything went well and he was given his release papers on Friday morning, painkillers in hand.  Unfortunately, one of the side effects of said painkillers is extreme nausea and it can really screw up your digestive system.  He started feeling bad on Friday night and by Saturday evening, he was extremely miserable.  Under the advice of his doctor, he went back to the hospital so that they can get him back on track. While it is not as serious as it could be, it's still rather stressful, especially for my mom.  I'm afraid she is going to crash soon.   Spending time in the hospital, and seeing some of the people there, makes me realize how fortunate my family really has been.  Even with dad's cancer, things could be a lot worse.  On a lighter note, I've started running.  I've been feeling miserable lately and needed to get back into a work out routine, so I bought a new pair of Nike's.  I do better when motivated by spending money.  There is a path along the sea wall that is set up for runners/walkers, bikers, etc to use. It even has the 10th of the miles marked off on it.  I figured that I won't be able to run by the sea at sunset in Baton Rouge, so I need to enjoy this while I can.

      I was just sent an email torward of random facts.  Things like "elephants are the only animals that can't jump" and "thirty-five percent of people who use personal ads for dating are already married." I've seen emails like this before, so I figured it would be mildly entertaining, but then I got to the end.  One of the facts (towards the beginning) was that it is physically impossible to lick your elbow.  I promptly tried to lick my elbow.  It is indeed impossible. Ok, I didn't try that hard, but come on...I can see how it would be impossible!  Then I get to the end of the email and it has the fact that "almost every person who reads this email will try and lick their elbow."  This was damn funny.  I've seen a lot of movies lately.  There isn't much to do in Pascagoula, so I have to keep myself entertained somehow.  There are a lot of movies out that look good, that I can't wait to see, but I find myself going to see movies that have been out for months.  I just saw 13 Going on 30 and Mean Girls.  Both entertaining.   Work is getting a little busier.  One of the Auditors left for a different job this week, so I've moved desks.  I'm no longer hidden in the corner where no one sees me.  Apparently, now that I'm in a central location, and everyone has to walk by my desk, they don't forget about me.  I feel like I'm actually earning some of the money they've been paying me.  Its a nice feeling.    I'm tossing around the idea of doing a fall or spring internship with one of the Big 4.  I'm torn between just wanting to finish school and start working and gaining valuable experience and contacts.    I'm traveling home this weekend.  I will actually be in BR a lot in the next two weeks because of my Dad.  Give me a call if any of you will be in town also.

      As  urlLink Claire  mentioned, the Baloonfest is in Baton Rouge this weekend.  I spent a great deal of time sitting on the tailgate of my dad's truck watching the balloons float by our house.  The first 50 or so that we saw were a little distance away.  Close enough to make out the designs on them (like the tooth and the partridges), but not close enough to  actually see the people inside.  After a while, it didn't look like anymore were coming so we went in and ate mom's saturday morning biscuits.  As mom and I were doing the dishes, we heard one of the balloons outside.  We rushed outside to see two balloons hovering just feet above our house!  We were shocked that they managed to clear the oak tree we have in our front yard.  As one of them passed over our neighbors house, we heard the guy say "Good Morning" to our neighbors in their backyard.  One of the balloons landed in the empty lot behind their house.   After that, Renee' and I jumped into her car and tracked down the rest of the balloons landing on the levee.  I'll post pictures soon, I just need to find the cord to download them onto my computer (I hate moving).

      Movies have been a big part of my entertainment this summer and I've seen pretty much everything out there.  I haven't really been in the mood for movies that will make me cry, so I haven't seen The Notebook and since I'm not a huge Will Ferrell fan, I haven't seen Anchorman.  Other than that, there's not much that I've missed.  I've discovered a theater in Mobile with stadium seating that plays movies that have been out for a while.  I'm not entirely sure how the place stays in business since I'm normally the only one in the theater for whatever movie I'm watching.  I finally saw The Day After Tomorrow a couple of nights ago.  While the plot is a bit impossible, I enjoyed the movie.  The theater had a hand in making it more realisitic by keeping the a/c set at sub-zero temps and I walked out of the theater expecting blizzard conditions to have taken over south Alabama.  I was happy to see that if an ice age would suddenly develop, Louisiana would be ok other than all those cajuns trading in their 4 wheelers and cajun reeboks for snowmobiles and ice-shoes.  They'd probably really enjoy getting new breeds of animals to shoot at.  Can you imagine the smoked meat festival with fried moose?

      "Virgo: You'll finally break the endlessly mounting tension at work when you cause the rollback of that aggravating 'days without an accident' sign."  This worries me.
