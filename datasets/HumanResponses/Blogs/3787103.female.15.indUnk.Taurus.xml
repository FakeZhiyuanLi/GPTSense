      Today was a very inexplicable day.  In the morning i received many telemarketer calls that kept waking me up, and liz called me from Florida so i decided to wake up.  I was very lazy today.  I had some cheerios then watched t.v.  Then i had some lasagna and went swimming.  I was supposed to be doing homework all day but i changed my mind.  I took a shower and was planning on seeing  Spiderman 2  but my mom made other plans to see a movie called  What the What the #$*! Do We (k)now!?  playing only at the Valley Art theater downtown in tempe.  I had to hurry and get ready for that and eat my dinner on the way.  Well i was a bit mad i had to go see that instead of spiderman 2 but i discovered it was an amazing movie.  It is about the mind and how we think about ourselves and the world.  It really has changed my outlook on life and matter.  Did you know that our eyes see 40 billion particles in a second, but our brain can only translate 2 thousand?  Think of what we are missing?  It is such a good movie and i recommend seeing it if you like the brain and quantum physichs and stuff like that.

      I awoke at 7:40 to the barbie girl ring tone on my phone.  It was rachael.  Today most of jv cheer was going to go to waterworld.  Woohoo. We were all meeting at ashley's house at 11:30 a.m.  However, rachael did not have a ride, so she got dropped off at my house at about 8:00.  Ashley was still sleeping so rach and i had a banana and watched all the old real world episodes for the season finale tonight.  Then at 10:00 we decided to wake ashley up.  That is a difficult task (it takes skill).  First we turn on the radio, remove the comfortor, turn off the fan, then take the pillows, and poke her on the forehead while speakin loudly.  Once she woke we put on our swimsuits and got ready to go to her house.  We jumped over my back fence and walked through the wash to ashley's.  Other jv cheerleaders met us there and then we were off.  We had some trouble getting there, but once we got there it was all good.  Later we came home and picked out barbie attire for Katie Miller and Kelsey Freese's 16th B-day!  I was Nerdy barbie.  The night didn't go well at all but they can't all go well.

      So yeah today was a good day I suppose.  I slept in, always refreshing, then ate an everything bagel from Einstiens.  Jill (ashley's mom) wanted to take us to the bank so ashley could deposit money and rent Great Expectations, there is no way i'm reading that whole thing.  Instead of getting ready we dressed up like Nerds.  It was the only way to go.  I put on the lime green fluffy flip flops, hair in pig-tails, and of course the glasses.  We sucessfully completed all of our tasks and made people laugh, that is always our mission.  I did some spanish homework, then we walked to my house and went swimming.  Later we went to see the Day After Tomorrow.  It was ok.  That was my day.

Well i did chores read a little and watched tv.  Then my mom came home and i ate dinner.  After dinner i went to desert ridge with britt and then we went to mcdonalds to get an m&m mcflurry.  I spilled ice cream on my shirt and white shorts.  Way to go.  Then i came home and i am tired.  What a day.

      Today was good, i am just in a nut shell right now.  I woke up took britt home, then went to get a massage.  It was nice.  Then i got my hair cut.  Not too happy about that.  I said a half an inch, she got confused and thought i said two and a half inches.  It is short, but it will be good for the summer.  Then i did some espanol homework and went to my dad's.  We went swimming, what else, he just got a diving board though!  Woohoo i was doing all types of flips. When i did a gainer, well not did more like attempted, i couldn't quite rotate all the way and smacked my shins and lower arms cuz i tucked into a ball.  I bet i will have bruises.  I got home later tonight and went on a walk/talk with my mom and dog.  Thats where i am stuck thinking.

      I'm a bit behind on my days but you are not missing much.  Let's see 4th 'o july went pretty well and watched the show at MVCC then spent the night at chelle's.  Me, chelle, rach, and britt went to scottsdale fashion square monday afternoon.  Then i came home did some spanish homework and took a test. Woohoo 30 out of 30 again!  Then britt came over to spend the night and we went swimming, played ping pong, then played some mariokart lol.  We woke up at 5am and rode our bikes to McDonalds, this crazy guy asked for our numbers, we ate and then happily pedalled home.  We went swimming again and then i had to go to my favorite place, john c. lincoln adult day care to help out with the old folk.  Today we made ice cream!  Then i came home and took a wonderful nap.  Later i went to pv mall with britt and her fam.  Then we came back to my house to, of course, go swimming and play some more mariokart.

      Today was a nice feeling.  Britt's mom Ellyn woke us up at about noon and made us these really good breakfast burritos.  We mostly listened to music all morning and afternoon.  Since britt's brothers both just recently moved out she now gets to have her own upstairs bathroom instead of using the downstairs.  Ellyn cleaned it all nice since the brothers left it a bad mess and then we went to target to get towels and stuff, but there was no good selections, so we went to Bed Bath & Beyond.  It was really fun to pick out totally new stuff.  We finished our task and then went to Pei Wei yum!  I got the crispy honey chicken because it is the only way to go.  Then britt and i got this picture with this statue thing and this little girl was picking my nose.  Well i hadn't seen my mom for 24 hours and i guess she had some withdraws, so we set up britts way cool new bathroom then i went home.  I showered, then britt came over.  We played ping pong (oh yeah i feel bad because any guy that wants to date has to play ping pong w/ my mom and her boyfriend john sry my mom's weird) and then went swimming.  So much for that shower.  Then i talked on the phone and cleared a lot of things up.

      I'm a day behind so this is for friday.  It was a nice day.  I woke up at about 12 because i was up till like 4 the night before.  Then i was off to John C. Lincoln Adult Day Care, yes for adults.  Its really for mainly old people, but there are some mentally different ones too.  I'm in National Charity League (NCL) it is this mother daughter thing that a lot of us gals in moon valley do.  As a part of it we have to do a ton of community service so friday i was "babysitting" or helping the eldery and challenged make their 4th of july visors.  We decorated them with spongy stuff, confetti, star beads, and of course buttons.  Oh they turned out beautifully.  It is funny and true that when u become older your mind degenerates, like they fight over who had the most buttons, or who had a prettier colored sponge star.  I have to tell you i love them.  If you ever have to do community service i reccomend going there, it's (as they would call it) a hoot!  When i was done with that at about 3:30 ish i went to work with my mom.  OMG i drove her crazy.  Her secretary gave me a task, it was to take out papers and proposals from various companies that were in like forty notebooks, some were binded, some were three ring, some were spiral, but my favorite was like the square spiral crap that is wire.  Well i had to take them all apart because the cover and back page could not go in the paper shredder so i undid the whole thing of all the notebooks.  I thought the square spiral was so cool that i made my mom heart sculptures and hung them on her office wall.  They were awesome.  Well she didn't enjoy my work as much as i did.  There was silver wire hearts and black wire hearts, she didn't like the black ones, she said they were tacky.  So as we were about to go i took down the black ones and left up the silver ones and gathered all of the unused wire and made like this 3D elephant head.  It was so sweet that i hung it in the corner above her computer.  I had quite an artsy fartsy sort of day.  Once i got home i had had such an amazing day i was bored.  So we picked up teresa and met britt at the movies, catching the end of spiderman 2 and then watched the beginning of stepford wives.  Stepford wives didn't seem all that great and we realized we were waisting away our friday night so we left.  Later at britt's ricky and lyndsey picked us up to go to matchik's house for like this kick back.  We were good girls, and just went swimming the whole time.  Then we ate at filibertos and called it a night and got home at about 2:30 ish.

      Today was a fun day. I slept in again, it's very nice.  I made this list yesterday called  My Daily Positive Thoughts .  I really think this will help my future days to come if i say them every morning in the mirror to myself.  Lately i have just been a bit depressed.  I just came up with 26 positive thoughts (becuase 26 is my lucky number & thats how many lines there were on the paper) and said them to myself today.  So i woke up starting the day with my positive vibes and ate some toast.  I really had the urge to dance so i did that too.  However, my cd case was stolen so i only had the crappy cds that i didn't carry around but it was all good.  I miss dance a lot, but luckily i am taking classes this season.  Then teresa and i went to desert ridge.  We went to hollister and bought some stuff then we went to see the Notebook.  It is a really good, sad movie and it was kinda rude of us becuase we were so hyper for some reason it was hard to sit still and we would like start laughing all of a sudden but it's all good.  That is my favorite saying  It's All Good .  After the movie we went to fatburger.  That was fun, because we were the last customers and got the rest of all the fries and we got to blast songs in the juke box.  I had a good day for the first time in a while :)
