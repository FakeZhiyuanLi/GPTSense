      yesterday's euro match featuring the czechs against the dutch was probably among the best ive ever seen.the czechs well and truly proved they are strong contenders,coming back from a 2 goal deficit against a star studded(and constantly underperforming) dutch team.it really beats me how pavel nedved hasn't been named european footballer of the year yet.infact,this year's euro has brought a lot of superstars into the limelight.people who had always been famous but not exactly superstars.the english are one team who have seen a bit of both.becks,with all his glitz and glamour is probably as low on confidence as ive ever seen before.on the other hand,lampard has come out of nowhere to declare himself as one of the kingpins of english football.to be very truthful,i had hardly ever heard of him before his stint at chelsea this year.baffles me how abramovitch won't pay him enough to keep him at chelsea.english football will lose a rising star.another one of these rise to stardom cases is ofcourse, rooney.i had heard of him becoming the youngest player to play pro football few years back.yet he didn't make too much of a mark in the premier league.now that he's scored 2 in the euro already,european clubs will be drooling over him.its amazing what confidence can do to a player. talking about confidence,just watched the US grand prix.another ferrari 1-2.i guess by now even the ferrari fans are starting to get tired.if there's someone who can be crowned the king of confidence,it is probably michael.driving at over 350 kph at soaring temperatures and yet not even breaking sweat takes some doing.What is the stuff of champions?do we mere mortals have it too.i often think what exactly im doing with my life when i come across all these articles about young achievers and entrepreneurs.what does it take to be the absolute best at what you do?for someone like me,who does everything possible that an urban schoolgoing guy can do,nothing ever brings satisfaction.winning a debate or a quiz or a play or anything of that sort just brings me to the irritating thought that maybe the competition wasn't good enough.is that how champions feel?damn,i wish someday i can become one and then gleefully declare "I AM THE BEST". but doesn't everyone else???lets call it a night then.will write sometime later.

      As the name reads,everyone's invited.I had been reading a number of blogs for a while now,always wondering how it worked.Also,what i though most about was how authentic the writings in the blog were.What their very basic purposes were.I read lots of blogs of schoolgoers(like me,in their last years of schooling,in class 12).Somehow felt as if a lot of them were putting up a farce.The entire purpose of a blog,therefore,sometimes needs questioning.Is it supposed to be an online diary,or is it a journal of sorts,or just a place where one advertises himself/herself.im quite a firm believer in it being a "public diary",something where one could express their thoughts without having the fear of being questioned or laughed at.some people,however,believe that their blogs are mainly meant for people of their age(and even their school!!) and for noone else,and use that as an excuse to write a major amount of trash.thats probably the lamest excuse ive ever heard.it just shows their entire thought process.the entire essence of the internet making iits users "lord of all they survey" is lost. anyway,ive complained enough for my first time.just as an introduction,the name's Arpan.male for those who aren't quite sure!born and brought up in Kolkata(yes...the city of Joy and dont anyone dare say anything against MY city).shifted to bangalore and studying in 12 in bishop cotton boys' school.and to conclude,if it is of interest to anyone,AVAILABLE! PS-as the name of the blog reads......everyone's invited.comments always invited.i would throw it open too,if i could.interests are mainly books,and loads of music.technology also,and surprisingly,politics also!!NOT interested in posting my weekly study schedule on my blog,thats just for sheer losers.
