      My house lately has been quiter than it should be... and I know wats missing..my little brother and sister are at my grandparents place with my mom..they've been there for like 3weeks, I cant stand it!! theres no one to scream at and throw around :( Its almost as if theres no one that understands me... before it was my sister who'd wake me up and ask me if was sick, or she'd come and sit with me while I eat lunch.and sometimes she'd even just hang around my room,drawing and stuff. Prety normal sister stuff but the amazing thing is shes only barely 3...What a SIS!!! The other component thats irreplaceable is my brother.Hes turning 2in like 4months but he is one tough dude,seriously im not the bully type but he sure is.He'll take anyone on.I dont know where he gets it but he'll stare my mom down and shout right bak.Although he doesnt say anything coherent but still.And god forbid you ever get in his face, he'll just stare at you and like hypnotize you with a little smile and you think hes gonna give you a hug or a kiss but BAM!!!!!!!!!!! outta no where he swings a blasting left handed punch to the side of your head! its not powerfull hit my no means but it comes fast and unexpected~! although hes done it, it doesnt go unpunished,he gets his ass yelled off by momsy..Even though he seems like a tyrant not in a million years would anyone not absolutly love him.Which I do! I'd do anything for the stinker. But one of the worset things about being the older brother whos loves them and does everything they ask for well, if EVER you get ticked or pissed off,and raise your voice at them,well then your gonna be the one in trouble.I had to tell my sis not to stick her fingers in the VCR like a year ago and I yelled cuz she wouldnt stop, so she turns to me and takes her hand outta the Tv and ran away crying..it was truely heart tearing.she wouldnt even look at me for days,until someone else made her cry:P:P i cant wait till i have my own kids:D

      hey everyone, i finally got this thing to open my page.. it was blocked, and it seems those responsible for its blocking have no idea what they really wanna block.they believe that it all should be blocked but still they praise the uses of the internet! What is their line of thought? I honestly have no idea. for instance yesterday I clicked on this astrological site,about health or something.And the site was blocked under the catagory of being "Non-Traditional Religions and Occult and Folklore". well of course its not part of our religion, and we all know its just crap..but say for instances I had a report or was doing research on something such as ancient chinese customs or indian history,etc.(anything along these line) well wouldnt these topics and all sites relating to them be under this catagory?If so then the purpose of the Internet or "Global Village" as a means of sharing Information throughout the world is lost and obsolete..I'd have better luck just trying to look up stuff in encyclopedias at libaries.   Which brings up another problem in the structure or sensibility of the set-up of our resources. Because there are no public libraies for me to continue my research in.which in retaliation hinders my academic acheivements.so wats the point of doing work that is uncompleteable. But now dont get me wrong Its not that I resent the country.I critical in order to point out the faults and hope that they'll change for the best.I hate these topics its soo depressing:(  well ill just talk about myself for awhile, there isnt to much to say.I cant tell who i am..To know someone you have to meet and experiance the atmosphere or aura they project..but basically Im the kinda guy to do wat eva is possible and whoevers' avaible..I'm devoted to people and their cause even if it aint mine..I like doing things that'll make someone else happy..I cant stand not seeing people and feel like i done a wrong if I dont have a tons of friends around when doing an outing... yall are probally sick of reading this crap,If you've read this far your probally really bored... well ima stop here..thanks for reading...I'd appreciate yalls comments..it'll give me a direction to talk about,,thanks again
