      I don't know about you, but one of my favorite things are cars. Sports car, race cars, regular cars, trucks, and motorcycles. I always think to my self in my spare time how I want to be really rich and buy a Ferrarri or a Lambraghini or some fast car when I grow up. But, the one thing I really want to happen is, i want to get like a 100 billon dollar check in the mail so i  don't have to work for the car. But, i know that the odds of that are not very likely.

      After I saw the first two Spider-Man movies, I wished my life was like Spider-Man's. Go swinging through the city, defeat the bad guys, and save the girl that I like. Yeah, I would think. That'd be the life.

      On the Fourth Of July I went to the beach with my cousins. All cay long i was wishing i knew how to surf. But I Didn't so I went boogie boarding, it was boring. For dinner we had hot dogs. it took my dad 4 Hours to put the mini BBQ together. At 9:00 a barge full of fireworks cruised into position. Then the show began. After the fireworks we packed up and went home. That's what happened on the Fourth of July.
