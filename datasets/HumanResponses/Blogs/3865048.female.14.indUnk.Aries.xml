      Well it's my second day at my older sister's house and we are having a blast!!! Let's see yesterday the plane flight was really boring. My younger sister, Kristin, slept on my shoulder for a really long time so it hurt after a while. The flight attendents were pretty nice though. Then we met my brother-in-law, Randy, at the airport and listened to him talk until we got to the appartment, where we were greeted with my sister, Jessica, and my niece, Abby. Abby is 1 and a half and full of energy! She gave us a tour of the apartment and then we played animals, dinners (play food), blocks and read books with her. Then Jessica had the idea of going to the zoo. We attempted to go, but it was way too croweded. We couldnt even find a parking spot! So we decided to call up Randy and ask him to go to the Cheesecake Factory with us. We picked him up and ate there. The food was great, and Jessica and I split a cheesecake, which was awesome. I didnt sleep the night before we came here, so I was very tired yesterday. When we got home I slept a little. Before dinner, Randy, Kristin, Abby and I went bunny counting. We saw 6 bunnies, but Abby told her mom we found 3, which is what she always tells her. Then we ate a delicious dinner made by my sister and went to..idk some smoothie place and what i drank of my smoothie (Abby had most of it) was really good. When Abby and Kristin went to sleep, we played Yatzee and surprisingly, I won. Then I called Jackson backed and we talked for about 20 minutes before I went to sleep.  Abby woke up at all hours of the night last night (We share a room with her) So anyways, that was my day yesterday. Today has been good so far. I think we will go to the park today. So I think I'm going to go eat some lunch. I'll write some more tommorrow.
