      nope this post isnt about the new rasmus song its about my guilt! earlier on tonight when i was comin back from school this goth from the school nxt to me got started on by some charvs!!! i wanted to go over to them and tell them to lay off but i didnt! but i have just been talking to my friend kate and apparently this girl goes to her school and she gets picked on all the time. i feel really sorry for her cos i know what its like to be picked on cos it happens to me all the time and i also feel guilty because i did go over and stop them from hurting her. i feel so bad and i know i didnt know her but i still would of went over and told them to clear off. even if they had of started on me she would of been safe becuas ei dont care she didnt deserve to be gettin the piss takin out of her like she was!:(
