Rather than trying to keep a journal for class in a notebook (something else to packmule around with me while I schlep around campus), I'm going to keep my assigned journal for my Advanced Composition class as a blog.  If I fall in love with blogging, or it with me, I'll keep this up.  I hope things work out between me and my blog, because I really hate breaking up.  The 2 am booty calls, the drunk dialing, the driving by the house at night.  And the embarrassment of running into an X in public!  Agh, the humanity!    I'll begin with the journal entry we worked on today.  Doc Kates (who occasionally looks like he might have misplaced his meds when he's lecturing - he really, really likes his subject matter...) wrote this on the board, "I'm a _________ writer" and told us to basically just write whatever we wanted to, without editing, etc.  Well, it's downright impossible for me to avoid editing.  If it's wrong, I'm going to fix it, and you'd have to tie my fingers behind my chair to keep me from it...so this doesn't technically fall into the stream of consciousness category...more like the fountain outside the big Stream of Consciousness building.  I am a ______________ writer.  I am a blank writer.  I am a writer of thoughts, lists, papers and letters.  I write emails, notes on the refrigerator for my family, reminders of things if left undone, dire circumstances would result.  My writing is important, but not visible to many.  I write in a journal, I write online.  I write to the student paper.  I write to The Tennessean.  When I email my friends with a funny story or a sad story, or something that I know will make them think, I love to hear how much they enjoyed reading what I wrote.  Sometimes I go back and re-read the emails I send to friends, and laugh myself.  I want to write more.  I want to write things that I want to send out into the world, to make my statements for me.    My writing has changed incredibly since I began at MTSU.  I learned how to write for attorneys when I went to school the first time.  I was at a technical school for paralegal studies, and I got an Associate Degree.  I don't recall writing papers at my technical school like the papers I have had to write here at university.  The first paper I wrote at MTSU was for a history class.  I cursed.  I flung my book across my desk.  It bounced.  I cried.  I sweated.  I wrote longhand.  I wrote at the keyboard.  I read and reread my paper.  I read and reread the instructions from the professor.  I hated that paper and the professor.  I got an A on it, was overjoyed and thought the prof was better than beer.  I was ecstatic.  I no longer put so much angst into my papers, but as a result, I fear that my papers may be becoming stale.   My personal journal is full of writing -  I find that I write in it most when I am unhappy, so I either need to write more when I'm thrilled, or else I need to make sure that all my journals are destroyed on a regular basis.  Who wants to be remembered as someone who was never happy?  My writing in my journal is writing whose purpose is to act as a steam valve.  If it doesn't come out the tips of my fingers into the journal, it turns into a giant pimple on my brain and poisons my outlook.  My journal is Clearasil for my brain.  When I was taking Spanish, I wrote notes to the household in Spanish.  They were wholly unreadable by anyone but my stepdaughter, who took Spanish in high school.  She corrected my spelling, my pronunciation and my grammar, which irritated the (somewhat conceited) composer within me.  It seemed that the point of my foreign language missives was being overlooked...I was a bilingual writer!  Imperfect, but capable.  Having gone a semester without a Spanish class, I have misplaced my ability to do this.  This ability is not missed by anyone in my household.  I want what I write to be enjoyed, to be understood, to be clear, precise, specific.  I want people to read what I have to say and be persuaded, reminded, or (better yet) to laugh.  I am trying to learn how best to do these things, so I am a blank writer.

I'm taking a Women's Health class.  Very informational, actually, and even though it's held at 9am, I usually manage to make it.  Today we met in the physical education lab, where they do tests on one's person to determine the amount of fat your body contains, and how flexible you are, and basically how in shape you are or alternately, how close to death from consumption of twinkies you are.  Today we arrived at the lab, and were told to doff one shoe so that the electrodes could be attached to the foot and the hand.  That should have been my first clue that this was a bad idea.  The young, very young, practically prepubescent girl asked me my age - "Older than you, sonnyboy!" was my preferred response, but I opted for the truth:  22.  She then asked for my weight, and received a sound thrashing for her laughter when I said I weighed 135.  She then exacted her retribution and cranked up the voltage.  My hair curled.  I was informed that not only am I extremely dehydrated (well yuh) and that the only portion of my body which is not fat are my bones.  So basically, I'm a box of jello:  if I HAD any water in my body, it would mix with the fat and I would become gelatinous.  Throw some mixed fruit in me and you have a  urlLink lovely salad , suitable for serving at your local church supper.

...that I'm going to actually graduate, and that we are actually going to move to  urlLink Texas  so that Gary can go to  urlLink school .  I don't know if it's the conversations I've had with my advisor who assures me that, yes, I  will  graduate, or if it's that I finally quit my terrible work/study job (more on that later - that's an entire entry all to itself!) or what.  I quit my workstudy job because the dude I was working for was an ass, and also because I was spending all my time worrying about a stupid minimum wage job - not really the reason I'm in college.  If I had wanted to do that, I would have skipped the whole college thing and stayed a secretary.  Much less overhead that way and look at what I'd have saved in school loans!  Anyway, my schedule was so packed with Stupid Minimum Wage Job and Associated Worrying About Same that I was losing focus on my real goal:  matriculation.  Education.  Intelligence.  Now my time is freed up and I'm able to actually envision us in grad school.  Eek.  Scary.  Yet compelling, like a bloody accident on the side of the road that you just can't look away from.

The joys I feel at the concept that my child has pants which fit his bony little behind...I cannot begin to say how happy it makes me that I have purchased clothing at Wal-Mart (the Store of the  urlLink Devil  but my pocketbook prevents my liberal leanings from allowing me to girlcott...YET), that actually will STAY UP AROUND HIS WAIST!  I have my suspicions that Chris thinks he is more  urlLink urban  than he really  urlLink is .  I told him that he looks like a clothes hamper when he dresses that way, but oddly enough, he doesn't really listen to me.  Then, to top it off, he asked that I make a particularly ripped/torn/ready to be tossed out pair of baggy jeans into a pair of baggy shorts - which I did - but with the warning that he was not to EVER wear them out to school.  This, of course, got the patented Jeezus-Christ-I've-Got-the-Stupidest-Mother-Ever eyeroll.  He's really quite good at that, by the way.  Oh, if only there was money to be made in THAT, we'd not have any more of those "But you HAVE to graduate from high school to get a JOB!" conversations.    I was not, however, awake when he left the house this morning.  So I have to wonder, did the Smilin' Mom pants make the cut, or did the "I'm a homeless rapper" shorts make the cut?

Our recent assignment in Dr. Kates' class has to do with writing a narrative of an event we witnessed or did before the age of 13.  This was due during the time I was sick (I'm still not quite 100% - did you know that you can throw out a muscle in your neck from coughing?  Nor did I, I'm happy to say, but I'm also sad to say that I unfortunately know it now).  When I came in to class with my really horribly written paper (now consigned to the shredder pile) it had attached to it a note that said basically for Dr. Kates please not to hold that paper against me.  I'm really a better student than that, it was just the Nyquil talking.  Thankfully, we weren't required to turn that paper in yet - thereby giving me time to shred and delete the offending paper from my past.  I turned from the topic I had chosen (the divorce of my parents and the part I played in the later aspect of it, the custody hearing) to the topic I had initially chosen, prior to being stricken with the Rockin Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Floo.  I've turned it about in my head like a chicken on a rotisserie for days now - well days, then into sick days, and again into well days.  I think I've managed to capture the occasion - I hope I have, anyway.  Just like  urlLink "Paths" , I wrote without editing, rereading or stopping once I began (and I unfortunately decided that I MUST begin during my Women's Health class - devil take the hindmost, I whipped out my paper and pen and most likely looked to all my fellow students to either be a real suckup ("Gawd, look at all the notes she's taking!") or really, really concerned about jotting down everything ever said or thought about STD's, our topic of the day in health class).    Now in turning to the journaling portion of our assignments, I flip The Book open randomly and am face to face with this passage:  "The key to good description begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary...Practice the art [of narrative] always reminding yourself that your job is to say what you see, and then to get on with your story" (179-180).  It was really quite fun to write the narrative paper - which as yet is untitled.  I might go with " urlLink Swiss Cheese " and I might go with "Arms."  Then again, "The Red Leotard" is right up there in my choices, too.  But the writing of it - that was fun.  As I reached the end of the story (it involves the possibility that I might suffer a terrible fall, and be found crumpled, bleeding and dead on a heap of cinderblocks, wearing a horribly ugly red leotard.  A  polyester  leotard), I discovered that my palms were sweating...I could really see in my mind's little eye what happened.  I wonder if I managed to convey it?  I tried to write what I was seeing, and feeling, and hearing, but will it read like something other than a navel-gazing type paper, written for a college class?  I will have to return to what I see, and re-read my paper to check for the same things in my paper as I experience in my mind.

I know I wrote previously about my vocabulary and my feelings about how strong it is.  There is another little bit of text in SK's book that I wanted to bring up with regards to that:  "One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones.  This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes.  The pet is embarrassed and the person who commited this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed" (117).  Firstly, I think that is a hysterical analogy.  Reading that made me laugh right out loud.  And, of course, it got his point across very well.  I know that I have a strong vocabulary, and I don't  think  that I put it in a cumberbund, but sometimes, I'm not sure.  Sometimes, that's just how I talk and express myself.  SK says that a writer's expression should be "plain and direct."  I know that I miss that mark fairly frequently.  Or at least I feel that I do.    SK says that in order to write well, you have to write every day.  In order for your muse to approach you, it has to know you will be at your desk from the hours of 9am until 2 pm (or whatever).  I completely agree - it is the case with any sort of creative endeavor.  If you rely on the happenstance method of writing, as opposed to the work method, you will miss out on a lot of those Muse/Writer meetings, I think.

pg 248, SK addresses the issue of writing to pay the bills.  He says he does it for the pure joy of it, and that the fact that it pays the mortgage too is gravy.  Being able to do something purely for the enjoyment of it AND get paid for it seems like the very best possible thing that could happen to someone.  I can certainly understand the concept of writing for the joy of it...when I have written something that I particularly like, I find that the stops and starts in my writing are fewer (there have been LOTS of them today) and that the pleasure to be found in the act of writing is easy to find.  Unfortunately for so many of us, the words don't always flow easily and the fits and starts come more and more often.  Although, to give SK his due, he's not saying that when you do it well, writing is easy.  He definitely does not say that - he makes sure that you understand that it is WORK.  Just like any other type of work, even when it's difficult work, if it is good work, it is worthwhile and can be fun.    He says that "there have been times for me the act of writing has been a little act of faith, a spit in the eye of despair."  I can definitely understand that as well.  While the writing that I have done in that vein is not something I would share with anyone (way too personal) I can echo his sentiment in this regard.  Taking out a pen and paper and beginning to write (anything) when I am feeling fairly hopeless is very therapeutic. During the very bad times, (which obviously never make it to those email stories which make my girlfriends laugh), if I pull out my journal and begin to write, some of the hopelessness I am feeling dissipates.  Not all of it, of course, but I am able to get a little distance from it.  And where would we be if we couldn't get some distance from our own dispair?

"When you write a book, you spend day after day scanning and identifying the trees.  When you're done, you have to step back and look at the forest."  (201)  I really like that.  He goes on to say that a writer's job in the first draft is to make sure that the story is about something, then during the second draft, to make sure that the something is clear (I'm paraphrasing him here, a bit).  It really sounds simple and easy when he says it, doesn't it?  For me, though, the deciding that the writing is about something is sometimes a lot more difficult than what it sounds.  I might spend day after day scanning and (mistakenly) identifying giant berry bushes as trees, then discover - WOOPS- that's not a story at all!  That's a berry bush, you idiot!  I haven't really tried writing anything other than papers for school in some time.  If it's all about the story, as SK says, then I suppose I handle that part of it okay...as I have said before, most of my writing consists of notes and emails to my friends--in which I tell them a story.  It might be a story about, say, the time I had just started work at the Medical Clinic as a transcriptionist, and was walking out into the hallway where I encountered a gentleman in a wheelchair who asked me for directions.  I pointed the way to him, ("Dr. Urologist's office is right there, sir...") only to have him say to me, "I'm blind."  I managed to tell the story in such a way that when I later saw my friends, I learned that they had sent it all over the office because it was just so funny.  Susie was in absolute tears she was laughing so hard.  So I managed to tell the story successfully - but no symbolism.  The blind man was really blind, and I still felt really stupid...

I do not write well when I am sick.  That is really evident from the paper I just threw together for Dr. Kates' class.  The bozo I work for came in with some illness last week (which turned out to be strep throat) and so of course I got that.  Apparently while my white blood cells' backs were turned, another virus crept in and so I got sick again.  So I have spent the past week doing the bare minimum for classes and sleeping.  Oh, and hacking my lungs up.    Symbolism is something which totally fascinates me.  SK discusses this on pg. 200, and says that it can be used as a "focusing device" for both the writer and the reader.  During my first lower division English class, we spent a great deal of time discussing symbolism.  Prior to this class, I really do not recall having any exposure to discussions about symbolism in writing.  We discussed stories like "A Rose for Emily" and "Invisible Man" and "Hamlet."  After a few discussions, and re-reading the stories, I said, "WHOA!  You mean there's more than just the meaning of the words?"  I suppose that having spent the better part of my life reading books that were no more deep than a mudpuddle can have a negative effect.  I'm not entirely sure that I can successfully utilize symbolism.  While I love to find it in the novels and stories I  read , I am not entirely sure that I am capable of putting it into anything that I actually write.  I really envy those who can weave symbolism into their stories without (seemingly without) effort.  SK talks about the symbolism found in his books "The Green Mile" and how he got beat up a little for the symbolism involved in John Coffey's initials.  As is the case with the "deeper" stuff that I read for class, the symbolism went right over my head.  I suppose that maybe my problem with symbolism is that I can't see it when I read it, so how the heck am I going to put it into my writing?

Yes, it is true.  Those who know me, know that I am no big fan of small children.  I am the grinch of small children.  I profess a strong, visceral dislike for small kids.  Perhaps it's just that I know what they grow into:  teenagers.  I really have nothing against small kids.  I loved mine when he was small (note past tense).  He had cute little blonde curls, was a happy baby and we went and did all sorts of things together and had many adventures.  Unfortunately, he has now left the Happy-Baby-Pooping-In-Drawers stage and has moved on to the Sullen-Teen-Wearing-Drawers-Which-Appear-To-Have-Been-Pooped-In stage.    His father has offered him a  urlLink car .  Please insert your own mental picture of my hair standing straight up and my eyes bugging out.  I'd rather he got him  urlLink this , or maybe one of  urlLink these  but something tells me that the Fiero might be a little more in keeping with his pimpin' image.  Needless to say, I am quite a bit worried.  I might have to contact my congressperson.  Who said it was acceptable to give a drivers' license to a person who is simply mentally incapable of operating a clothes hanger with any sort of dexterity?  This is serious valium time, folks.  I am missing the poopy diapers more and more every day.

Another King journal entry:  Keeping in mind that I am currently operating at about 50% - I have strep throat, a fever and spent all day in bed yesterday - here's my thoughts on another passage from the King book...(sounds like church:  I'll now read from King, chapter 2, verse 6:  "And he sayeth unto you; yea, though you walk through the aisles of Books-A-Million, and see not the latest King novel, asketh the clerk at the counter to bestir himself off his behemoth behind and locate it, and place it on top of the Ann Coulter books, as they are foul and should be gone from the earth in a plague...").  See?  Told you I have a fever.  SK discusses a writer's toolbox, and what needs to go into it.  I am so lucky that my dad did so much to help me stock my toolbox.  My vocabulary is pretty great   and I have nobody to thank for that but my dad.  He came up with a game for my sister and I to play with him in the car.  He even gave it an incredibly original name:  The Word Game!  How great is that?  The point of it initially was to teach us some new words, and then Dad would "lose" the game (i.e., let us win, although we weren't supposed to know that) and we would get the added benefit of a self esteem boost.  Well, after a while, Dad stopped "losing" and started Losing.  I mean, really losing.  The rules of the game were easy (unless you were dad):  one person picks a letter, then another person thinks of a word beginning with that letter.  The entire car would "take time about" (that's a Grandma saying) until someone (Dad) couldn't think of another word beginning with that letter.  Things like A, An, About, Was, Were, didn't count.  Added to the difficulty for Dad was that he would sometimes forget the letter we were doing, and consequently, he would shout out a word which didn't count.  As a result, I was probably the only third grader in my school with the knowledge that tungsten was a metal.  So my vocabulary is a portion of my toolbox which I really don't have to think too much about.  It's just there, sort of like being double jointed or being able to curl your tongue.  Thanks Dad!

On page 121 of Mr. King’s book, “On Writing,” the book that is the basis for this assignment, he speaks about the simplicity of noun-verb construction.  (From reading that sentence, one might think that I had skipped that section of the book.) He says that it is “the pole you grab to get your thoughts up on their feet and walking.”  What a wonderful concept.  As a writer who has a tendency to really burden my thoughts down with extra baggage, this concept is something I will really have to work on to embrace.  Plums deify.  How great.  I struggled with this as I was writing our first paper.  Combine the Plums Deify Credo with the Passive Voice Section and you have a summary of my difficulties with my writing.  My earliest training in how to write was in paralegal school.  Therefore, I write as if Constant Reader was Constant Reader, Esq.  Not a particularly fun and raucus audience to address my literary thoughts, obviously.  I write in the passive voice so much that I don’t even notice it anymore.  I am appalled that I am doing something that “irks the shit” out of Stephen King.  I should turn in my fingers and cease work on my novel immediately.  “Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation” (128).  Goodness, that’s two thirds of the emotions my writing stirs up in me.  When I write something that I think is pretty passable (“Paths” falls into that category), the concept of someone else reading it does strike a pretty sound bolt of fear in me.  SK finishes the paragraph with: “Affectation itself, beginning with the need to define some sorts of writing as “good” and other sorts as “bad,” is fearful behavior.  Good writing is also about making good choices when it comes to picking the tools you plan to work with.”  How can I not mark my writing in my own mind as “good” or “bad”?  I try not to write with any sort of affectation, but frequently I’m afraid that I do…or I am afraid that others will THINK that I do.  I guess that’s two different things, though, isn’t it?  I’ve always enjoyed SK’s work – even the really awful stuff like “Pet Semetary,” (by awful I don’t mean poorly written, but that the concept was more disturbing than vampires or rabid dogs) which I only read once because it encompassed such a horrific concept.  My husband joined the SK book club for me when we got engaged as an engagement gift.  Now I have every single SK book, complete with original book jackets.  It’s a terrifically cool gift, not to mention a gift I am still receiving even 9 years after we got engaged.  Now THAT’S a gift.  So when I saw that a book by Mr. King was going to be used in this class, I was quite excited.  After all, it’s not very often that you go to take a class and realize that you’ve already read the textbook.  Plus, I really love to write.  I write emails to my friends and they become tomes.  I write notes to my kids on the fridge and I run out of room on our expansive grease board.  My only problem is actually doing it.  By incorporating the blog concept with it, I am hopeful that I will do this a little more regularly.

On pg. 228 and following, he details how he got the story for  From a Buick 8  - he slid down an embankment during a potty break on a trip and almost fell into a rushing stream.  As a fan, I just want to give him a little shake and ask him to please, please, let's try to take better care of the ol' Word Processor of the Gods, hokay?  First he tried to do himself in with alcohol/drugs....which lead to some rather interesting stories, I have to say (I mean, really - does he really think that we don't see where Jack Torrance, the main character in  The Shining  came from???).  Then the slide down the side of the stream, leading to  From a Buick 8  and the big smash up with the van, which is featured prominantly in his Kingdom Hospital series.  Rawther creepy, that.    Anyway, the purpose of sharing how he got the story for  Buick   is to explain some about the importance of research.  For the purposes of SK's writing, the research is for back story and correcting what he calls "the howlers."  For the purposes of our next paper, research is the meat and three.  I enjoy that aspect of writing too.  I can get totally lost in the process of learning something about what I want to write about - in this case, I have shared with my class Andy's "howler" about why in the world would I want to minor in Women's Studies, when I already have the right to vote??  I had been wondering what, exactly, I could do with my minor and any continuation of study in that field.  I don't really see many ads in  The Chronicle of Higher Education  for that sort of work.  So I am going to talk to some profs, do some reading, and educate myself about my education.  Pretty timely too, as I have to make a decision sooner or later about what I'm going to do.  Will I be returning to grad school along with Gary?  Will I go back to work as a legal secretary, perhaps finally utilize the paralegal degree I got lo those many years ago, but instead of working for The Evil Corporate Empire, perhaps go back to where I started, but with a bonus - the knowledge that I could actually do something to help people?  I mean, what if I could actually get a job at a law firm that was woman centered?  Where women were helped?  What about NOW?  (the group, not the time frame).  What about Planned Parenthood?  I  realize  that there's no money in this.  But if I wanted money, would I be considering working as a teacher?  Yeah, I really see a lot of Lincoln Navigators (like what Stephen King was driving when he found  From a Buick 8 ) sporting the white parking passes designating them as vehicles of the profs.  Sure.  So we have established that money's not the thing for me.  So what is?  Well, being able to look at myself in the mirror, feel good about what I am doing, positive that I am doing something that can help other people.  I never got that feeling when I worked at Miller Martin - gee, how great does it feel to know that you are helping to pad the pockets of The Man?  Whose pockets are already fairly padded to start with?  And when I worked for Waldren & Fann, here in the boro, I had occasional flashes of times when I felt positive about my work.  Funnily enough, the best time was when I was able to use my skill with writing when drafting some discovery responses.  But whose signature went at the bottom of the work?  Not mine.  Whose words were they?  Mine.  But they helped out the person applying to me for help.  I listened to their convoluted story and managed to put all the important points of it into a document that helped them out.    So how does all that play into my thoughts about research?  Sometimes this class really rocks in ways that you don't know, Dr. Kates.

Reading over the portion of The Book about revisions was really fun.  SK tells all his prospective authors out there that once they have completed something, put it away for a while.  He says that "reading your book over after a six week layoff [might] be a strange, often exhilirating experience.  It's yours, you'll recognize it as yours...it will also be like reading the work of a soul twin perhaps."  The papers that I write for school are like that, sometimes.  I went in to see Dr. Koskowska about the paper I wrote for her class, and she read it over and asked me a question about it, and I couldn't even remember the topic of the paper...while I could chalk that up to a number of things (education burnout, impending spring break, overindulgance in beer resulting in the brain cells where that particular paper was stored turning into little mini-kegs), I know that I do that regularly.  I'm planning to rewrite both my place paper and the narrative paper over spring break, and that should give both of them plenty of sittin' time.  It can be quite entertaining to re-read things I have produced as a writer - I have saved a lot of the emails I sent to my buds at Miller Martin just because they make me giggle (Unfortunately, the one about the blind guy in the wheel chair that Susie found so screamingly funny has been lost to the Computer Gods).  I do like the editing process myself - being able to go back over what I have written and polish it up - that's fun.  Some would probably rank that right up there with dental work, but hey.  I'm an English major.

SK says (pg 174) that he thinks that if he gives too much description of a character (Carrie, for instance), his picture of the high school loser will muscle out the high school loser being forged in the brain of the reader.  This is why (I think) movies generally do such a bad job with good books.  I know, I know, there's probably a bunch of them I could name without really having to think too hard (and Harry Potter is NOT one of them) that actually do a good job of translating the book into the movie.  I think that  Stand By Me  was really good, and so was  The Shawshank Redemption  (just to keep with the SK theme and all).   Children of the Corn  - so bad that it could be considered ptomaine on the all-you-can-eat buffet of movies.  But movies are not the point.  Although in a way, reading a good book is sort of like watching a movie - only the reader is the one who directs it.  At one point in my life, every book I ever read took place in the house where I lived at the time (that would be the Terrible '70s Shack I wrote about in  urlLink Swiss Cheese ).  When I go back and re-read those books I read during that time period, I still see the action taking place in the same house....weird.  I no longer picture things taking place in the '70s Bungalow of Style, fortunately, but for the longest time, that totally frustrated me.  And now, if I re-read something I read during that time, I'm locked in to seeing the action of the book taking place in the same place.  No matter how wrong it is.  Perhaps laziness of the reader can be blamed here.  But for instance, every time I read  Firestarter , the portion of the story where Charlie and her dad go to the grandfather's house in the woods (Gunther's cabin? Not sure, and entirely too tired to go to my mammoth Altar To Stephen King and locate the book - wouldn't be hard to locate though, as I have them in chronological order...), I see it set at my old house.  Strange.  That's a little nugget that I would NOT want to share with SK.  He'd know that for a while, all his description was wasted on  this  Constant Reader.

On page 165 of On Writing, SK tells a tale of how he came to be introduced to the story "Misery."   He had a dream.   HFCIT? He woke up on a plane during a flight to London and had the bare bolts of the story.  How great is that?  But how unreachable does that seem to those of us who just don't have dreams of that sort?  I don't know about anybody else, but most of my dreams are the garden variety Sigmund Freud type things, and I doubt that even SK could make a tale out of my dream that I've gone to my highschool typing class naked except for my 3 ring binder.  Wait.  He did:   Carrie .  Right-o.  Another brilliant journal entry, hoisted on its own petard.  Anyway, SK says that the plot is something that he doesn't push - that would be like using a jackhammer on an archeological dig.  I can relate to that, in a way.  Once you get started tapping away, the act of writing is less the herding of characters into the velvet ropes leading them backandforthandbackandforth to the behavior required of them and more just watching what they do and where they go - without the velvet ropes (what ARE those things called? Cow catchers?)

At the back of SK's book there is a reading list.  I have read a number of the books he has listed, and a number of the writers.  I made the initial mistake, when I got the book to begin with, of trying to locate some of those books at the local Media Play.  Well, Media Play is NOT the same as the library - many of those books just weren't there.  But eventually, after I got into school, I read "Heart of Darkness" and "Oliver Twist" but most of the other books are still unknown to me.  "Poisonwood Bible" is one which I read on SK's suggestion (sounds like I got an email from him) and enjoyed it somewhat.  But I don't think the importance so much is in reading "The Classics" so much as in reading and reading enough to develop a taste - if one hews hard and fast only to Stephen King novels, well, one is going to have scurvy of the brain, no matter how smart SK is and how great this "On Writing" book has been for us in class.  Just as he says that one cannot be a good writer without having read voraciously, he more specifically says that one cannot write good dialogue without listening to others.    In another class (Female Modernists with Dr. Kostkowska - great class) we watched a film called " urlLink Paris Was a Woman ."  At one point in the film, Gertrude Stein read a portion of her word portrait of  urlLink Picasso .  When I have previously had Gertrude Stein foisted upon me, I have been less than happy.  Hearing it read, however, was something entirely new.  The rhythm, and the cadence of her voice as she read it - it was really overwhelming.  I felt terribly guilty that I had given someone such as Ms. Stein such a perfunctory reading.  That sense of cadence and reality has to come through in the writing of good dialog, and those writers who are not also listeners are condemned to dialog similar to that found in  urlLink here .

Gary will be having a  urlLink performance  of a piece!  I am so excited - he has worked on this thing for a LOOOONG time - through at least the life of one or two of my Sims (I generally would engage in my favorite past time:  Procrastination Whilst Playing The Sims Concomitantly while Gary composed in his studio).    Let me just begin by saying something about Gary.  We've established that he wants to return to school, and that he wants to teach.  Really, what he wants to do is wear flip flops to work, but that's beside the point.  He is ecstatic about our plans to do this - us both attending grad school and all that.  He has spent the better part of his adult life being berated and abused for trying to do that - educate himself - and now he's able to actually make some progress towards creating and composing his music again.  This is a really big deal for him - when he had created the final final final piece of music, (entitled Contemplative Refrain) and it was time to ship it off, I offered to overnight it from the campus post office.  I was given the information by The Nervous Nellie Composer, and told to please write on the CD the name of the song, Gary's name, and Liquid Sphere Studios (where he composed it).  Well, I shipped the CD off with no problem...ooh dear.  Forgot to write anything on it.  When Gary found this out (I wasn't going to tell him, but he wanted to know what I had written on the CD...apparently my face said, "OH SHIT he asked...NOW WHAT!") he was less than happy.  But obviously, all is well, because the dude at Art Radio is going to play it!    Everyone should cease what they are doing tomorrow at 1:00 and listen.

 Cacadilla Falls  I went down by Cascadilla  Falls this evening, the stream below the falls, and picked up a  handsized stone kidney-shaped, testicular, and  thought all its motions into it, the 800 mph earth spin, the 190-million-mile yearly  displacement around the sun, the overriding grand haul  of the galaxy with the 30,000 mph of where the sun's going: thought all the interweaving  motions into myself:  dropped  the stone to dead rest: the stream from other motions broke rushing over it: shelterless, I turned  to the sky and stood still: oh I do  not know where I am going  that I can live my life by this single creek. --A.R. Ammons   This is me.  This is so me.  I totally connect with this poem.  I'm afraid, though, that Dr. Mapp is going to think me tetched in some way, or perhaps suffering from depression or whatnot, as I so often seem to wind up fighting off tears in his class.  By the end of the semester, I might be trucking a bale of hankies to class to honk my nose with and dry my streaming Scarlett O'Hara eyes.    I'm leaving my single creek.  But I love my single creek so much.  I am familiar with the plants growing on its banks, the rocks in its bed, and the rush and flow of the water.  How can I possibly pack up and go somewhere else?  How can I  not ?  I love my friends who are now as much my family as my family is, and I trace my life's beginnings (however incorrect this might actually be) back to when I got here.  It seems so tratorous to pick up and leave.  But I have an overriding grand haul to deal with - my future is elsewhere, but my single creek?  It's comfy.

he says, "when you find something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head."  Leave it to SK to include the blood and popping eyeballs in a book about writing.  But he's right.  If you love to do something, whether it's writing, or skateboarding, or whatever, if you have a true talent for something, doing it is never a chore.  The joy comes from the doing.    Take Gary, firinstance.  When we met, he had put away his music.  He didn't practice, he didn't play, he didn't even think about it.  His keyboard was in its nice box, put away in the laundry room.  The dust it wore was thick enough for me to write the words, "Play me," in its surface.  He loved what he did, and hated not to do it.  He was just like one of those poor Skinner mice, though.  He had received enough mental and verbal beatings for loving to do something and working hard at it until he just folded and gave up the fight.  The fight was just more than he was willing to put into it.  When we met, I had to convince him that no, I wasn't his ex, and no, I wasn't going to nag/complain/fight/scream/harrange him into getting a job with the phone company (or any other utility company).  He had to be reminded of the love that once existed between himself and his talent.  Once he dusted off his toolbox, and realized that the key to the box was not, as he had previously thought, still in the boxes down in Texas, but instead right there in his hand, he was able to return with excitement and love to his talent - something it is a sin to keep under a bushel, some Book or another tells us - and now he won't stop.  He works on his music, his composing, until the wee hours.  He gets pissy when interrupted from his  urlLink work , his writing, and he gets foul when he goes too long without a fix at his desk.  His "every outing is a bravura performance - because...the creator is happy."

There's a portion of SK's book where he says that if you want to be a good writer, you must write regularly, but you must also read regularly too.  This is so true, and it is also fortunate for me, because if I didn't have a book beside my bed, in my john, beside my bathtub, and on my desk (as well as one or twelve in my backpack) I really would lose it.  Reading for me has always been an escape of sorts, a way to envision myself into another place, listen to new voices, that sort of thing.  When I finish a new book, if it's really good, I am always sort of sad.  The adventure is over, the new friend is gone (or at least silent until the book is picked up for re-reading, which I do regularly) and life goes back to the dull and mundane.  When I got the last SK book (Wolves of the Calla - #5 in the Gunslinger series, I believe) I read it as I usually do - in giant gulps, rather than the "small sips" that SK mentions.  As much as I really, really wanted the ride to last, I was just having way too much fun reading it to slow down and savor things.  Hmmm.  Must be my addictive personality speaking up again.  SK talks a lot about telling the truth, and about how if you are a good writer, you have to do this.  When I first read this book (when it first came out - I never let an SK book sit on the shelf for longer than, oh, say about 10 minutes before I'm snatching it up for consumption) I truly did not get that concept.  How do you "tell the truth" about what you see if what you see is a fiction anyway?  Isn't fiction necessarily, by definition, untrue?  Tell the truth but tell it slant, right?  I get it a little better now.  Now if I could just do something other than write the "puff pieces" that he talks about :  "What if Jesus was My Teammate?"  That just completely cracked me up.  That's sort of how I feel about what I have written so far.  Who in the name of Bob really wants to read about me and a leotard?  Or where I'm from?  Who am I, anyway, to be so gone on myself to think that that would make interesting reading?  Well, my own insecurities aside, that just really is not the point now, is it?  The point is telling the truth - seeing what it is that you want to write (whether it is fiction or nonfiction) and then putting it down in a way so that anyone else who reads what you have written can see what you do.

What fun!  A social outing for myself and Gary with our lovely buds, Mel & Andy.  We began the evening by arriving at M&A's house for a thorough sniffing by the beagles-in-residence, Tuggle and Tessie.  Lemme give a big shout out to the Dawgs in da house, T&T:  Owwww!  BowwwW!!!  We headed over to the local Generic Mexican Restaurant (Las Palmas, Las Fajitas, Las Something In Spanish) where Mel and I consumed multiple margaritas (apparently one part shaved ice and approximately 42 parts tequila, then have the waiter stroll by the mixer on the way to the table).  Gary and Andy drank beers larger than their heads.  The Mexican waiter's Spanish became slurred. We plowed through many, many baskets of chips while Gary and I tag teamed our way through various stories about the children, any of which could be shared at the local Planned Parenthood to keep any kids hearing them from having sex too soon.  The food finally arrived, along with more margaritas, and more troughs of beer for the boys.  After throwing wads of cash on the table and staggering for the door, we stopped at the Food Lion for (what else) more beer!  While we ladies waited in the Bus for the return of the beer carrying gentlemen, I immediately set off the car alarm.  No one came to our rescue, nor did they attempt to arrest us.  Good thing too.  We arrived without incident (unless you can call much belching and burping "incident") back at Casa Ayers.  We spent a little while in the kitchen visiting and catching up on things.  There's actually an intellectual in the bunch:  Andy has a patent.  Color me various shades of totally impressed.  No, it is not for the invention of the hat with the beer carrier and straws on it.  Been done.  So, we began to engage in Playstation activities:   urlLink DDR Max  - much fun, but better done with two mats when you have two players, as I was attempting to dance sans mat while Mel used the mat.  Apparently, though, the mat had a short or something, because Mel could have hovered over the mat like Jesus ascending into heaven and she still would have gotten boos from the game - the left foot sensor seemed to be stuck.  So we scrapped that game and went on to the bane of morning afters everywhere:   urlLink KARAOKE !    Let me just stop here and say:  I can't sing.  I have known I couldn't sing for a long time.  I have, until now, managed to refrain from inflicting myself and my singing voice on my friends, because I love them, and do not want them to think badly of me.  Apparently, the margaritas had a magical effect, because suddenly, I was brilliant!  I could sing like the proverbial songbird.  There had to be some sort of miracle in the beverages because my voice was beautiful.  Yep, that magic was called Tequila In Large Doses.  Makes anybody Brittany Spears.  Andy and I did a couple of doo-ets, I did a few with Mel, and was ready to call in the Beagles and have them be the Pips for me.  Unfortunately, there was only one headset, so Tessa and Tuggle were saved that indignity.    At some point, the digital camera came out.  There really isn't more to say after that - that sentence should sum up the evening.  I knew that our fun was over, however, when I looked down at the sofa and realized that our  urlLink hostess  had gone to sleep.  We took the hint and boogied home - AT 2 AM.    So we shut down Mel's Bar & Grill and had a damn fun time doing it too!

This this  urlLink this  is why George W. Bush and his ilk must be stopped.  This is wrong in every sense of the word.  How can someone with so much power to harm not take this into consideration when doing the things he does?  I get so angry - although I know I will never be in her position, so I don't have to worry about this story ever being mine.  But it could by yours. Or your daughter's.  Or my daughter's.  Or Bush's.    Needless to say, I am all about  urlLink this  and am already deciding which militantly liberal t-shirt I should wear to  urlLink this .

...please be prompt.  The scourging should begin at approximately 6:02.  Cat-o-nine tails will be distributed with the Krispy Kremes and the complimentary coffee.  Gary and I are planning to lay down the smake on our idiot son.  The phone calls are beginning to come in from the school, and to our absolute surprise (sarcasm), he's not been doing his work!  And he's been paying more attention to the females!  Well!  What a surprise!  Pimp Daddy Chris is using his manhood to take notes in class - and this is going to STOP.  Gary and I saw a commercial last night (we were watching the Stephen King thing on TV - I can't help it.  I need a 12 step program for my SK addiction) and it was an anti-drug commercial called " urlLink Slam ".  Usually those commercials are totally lame-o, in my opinion (i.e., the one about anyone who's buying drugs supporting the terrorists - oy vey, don't get me started), but that one is me all the way through.  I certainly hope that our CTJ meeting is successful - we are even going to ground him from his pants.  I am not kidding.  The saggy drawers are history.    I thought that I had reached the nadir of the "parenting makes us say ridiculous things" when I was sick and just out of the hospital (single mom, so it was me, me, me, and my sick self dealing with a 7 year old - good god was that horrible) and woke up from my coma on the sofa due to the fact that my child had removed his mattress from his bed (it was a junior bed, and the mattress was a crib sized one) and had talked his friend from next door into sitting on it while Chris slid him down the stairs.  I woke to see Little Next Door Friend come hurtling down the steps at roughly the speed of sound, clutching the sides of the mattress.    At what point in your life will you be forced to say, "DO NOT SLIDE YOUR FRIEND DOWN THE STEPS ON YOUR MATTRESS!"  I mean really, people.  This is serious asylum type stuff.    So now I'm going to ground Chris from the phone, the TV, the playstation, any job he might get in the foreseeable future, any possibility of a car from his dad, any social life he might have, and his pants.  The baggy, droopy pants that piss me off beyond belief.  I tried to go with it, people.  I really did.  He's making his own fashion statement, I said.  Pick your battles, I said.  Pants are the least of our problem.  The pants are a problem.  Along with the incomplete in Band, the 18 point drop in ROTC, the F in English, the forty in Chemistry and the THIRTY in Algebra.  Really.  This is not a report card.  This is a GOLF SCORE.    In lighter news - I have comments!  Now, as the Wonder-Flea says, no smoking crack in the comments lounge.  I don't have a Comments lounge - my comments area is as yet unnamed.  Have we any ideas?  The winner of the contest gets a couple of pairs of jeans, size 34 in the waist, no cuffs (due to being drug off on the asphalt).

...is to guide this blind dude across the street.  See him?  He's the young guy, seems to be a pretty okay guy, over there.  I'm sure you'll do much better than I did.  See, I tried to do it, and boy did he object.  I tried to tell him, "Man, you just don't see what's out there.  There's cars, and motorcycles, and cement mixers, and they don't know you're blind!  They just go flying by on that street, and they don't care if they make an oil smear out of you on the highway."    That's when he really got mad.  He told me that I just didn't understand, he said.  He's not blind, he said, and for me to leave him alone and let him do it himself.  Okay, I said, go right ahead and step off that curb there and see if you can make it to the median of the highway.  Then we'll talk.  Well, he got out there in the road, and got clipped by one guy's mirror, and then (I watched all this with my hands over my eyes, but I had to peek out now and then - it was just mortal fear and curiosity, I tell you) and then another truck came by and it just missed him, and then - well, then, he gets rolled by another car and I thought that's it, a Moped is going to come by and do this guy in.  So now he's on the median, right?  And I KNOW he needs help, so I yell to him, HEY GUY!  Don't move, let me help you out.  Let me come to you and we will get over to the other side just fine together.  He shooed me away and scampered out into the oncoming traffic, dancing in and out of the oncoming cars, still demanding, increasingly loudly, "I can do this just fine by myself, Mom, if you would just FUCK OFF!"    So here I am, hands tied, on one side of the road, while Chris is on the median of the highway, with this truck coming at him (bad grades - will he graduate?) a big tank-like SUV (with GWB and Cheney and Wolfie at the wheel, lobbing grenades) headed for him too (If he joins the military, like he says he wants to, will I be placing a flag in a triangle shaped box over my mantle sometime, instead of pictures of grandkids?), then there's the flock of smaller vehicles that's in his path and headed for him:  bicycles, mopeds, possibly a solar powered car - that would be STD's, now that he's sexually active...and none of these dangers are real to him.  None of them can  possibly  hit him, according to his views, because he's...oh, I don't know, sixteen and invincible, perhaps?    In my southern lit class, we read a poem today called "The Lost Children" by Randall Jarrell.  As I am currently suffering from senioritis, I planned to read the poem before we discussed it (i.e., during the lecture...) and as I was sitting there, reading this little gem of a poem, while concurrently worrying about my own little lost lamb who cannot seem to get his crap together on a bet, I am overcome.  I mean, this showed the possibility of being on par with the giant gusher nosebleed I got during my final Spanish test.  I could feel it coming - I was going to cry.  And I mean CRY.  The poem is bad enough, but couple it with worry for your own child (who is, strictly speaking, no longer technically a child and a real stout hollering distance from being the baby with beautiful blond curls and sweet kiss) and you have a real recipe for hankie-needin':   The Lost Children   Two little girls, one fair, one dark, One alive, one dead, are running hand in hand Through a sunny house.  The two are dressed  In red and white gingham, with puffed sleeves and sashes. They run away from me...But I am happy; When I wake I feel no sadness, only delight. I've seen them again, and I am comforted That, somewhere, they still are.  It is strange To carry inside you someone else's body; To know it before it's born; To see at last that it's a boy or girl, and perfect; To bathe it and dress it; to watch it Nurse at your breast, till you almost know it Better than you know yourself - better than it knows itself. You own it as you made it. You are the authority upon it.  But as the child learns to take care of herself, you know her less. Her accidents, adventures are her own, You lose track of them.  Still, you know more  About her than anyone  except  her.  Little by little the child in her dies. You say, "I have lost a child, but gained a friend." You feel yourself gradually discarded. She argues with you or ignores you Or is kind to you.  She who begged to follow you Anywhere, just so long as it was you, finds follow the leader no more fun. She makes few demands; you are grateful for the few.    That's only the first little bit of it, but I have to say, I'm really glad we didn't get a chance to discuss it in class.  My teacher probably thinks that I was overly moved by the poem he was reading at the time I read this one (I read really fast, and the first poem - four lines - was devoured before the page was all the way open).    Labor and delivery was fun!  Ear infections were a breeze!  Let's go back to the days of yore when he would scream, cry, wail and cling to my raincoat when I tried to leave him in second grade!  Day after day, without fail, I would come to work wrung out, because he WOULDN'T LET GO OF MY ARM!  And now, (suddenly - it's suddenly, I tell you, there's no other way to describe it but gutwrenchingly urgently sudden)  I'm  supposed to let go of  him ?  In the middle of the  ROAD ?

I've set up another  urlLink site  - this one is for my papers I have written for Dr. Kates (and any others I might think the Internet would accept rather than spit out with a big patooie).   What got me interested (fascinated? obsessed?) with blogging was reading  urlLink flea's  blog.  She is fascinating woman, and if you have any interest in excellent, moving writing, you should read flea's blog.  She wrote an incredible post about a book called "The Mommy Myth" -  which I have not yet had the opportunity to read (as my books are limited at this juncture to anything I'm about to be tested on), but based on her discussion about it, it's now on my "must read" list.  One of the things flea talks about in her post is the incredible guilt that we mothers feel about our kids - the switch from being subservient to our husbands to being subservient to our kids' needs - that really struck a big chord in me.  How many "good days" have I felt like I had as a mother in the past year?  Exactly zero.  None.  As they get older, the good days just really seem to disappear - I had a better time wrestling Christopher into his Snuggli and attempting to buy groceries at the commissary than I do now, trying to wrestle a complete sentence out of him about his day, his friends, his life, now.  But a friend of mine, Sandy, had such a wonderful view on it:  she said that we simply  can't know  when we are doing the right thing, because we aren't dealing with the finished product yet.  Christopher is only 16, and he is currently enjoying a reign as the King of the Village of Smartass.  Will age knock him down from his reign as king to perhaps Court Jester, or will he abdicate the throne?  Not only do I feel guilty about my own child, but I'm starting to worry about the girl he chooses to marry - I might have raised up Sir Smart-Ass-A-Lot to be her husband, and if he's a jerk to her...well, we'll let Laura Schlessenger finish that sentence for me, won't we?

The events of yesterday evolved into what I thought was a necessity to talk to the Ex.  After all, this summer Chris was to go visit with them while Gary and I checked out UNT and TWU - our future home(s) for grad school...our future, period.  Not to mention, the child caught with a girl, marijuana, and stolen goods in his bedroom was, after all, also Kevin's, not just mine.  So I thought it was probably pretty important to relay this information to Kevin - it being pertienent to his child, after all.  While talking with Chanda, his wife, I enjoyed this brief exchange regarding Chris' propensity for punching holes in our walls:  ME:  (some now-unremembered comment about Chris' temper and hole punching) SHE:  I don't know where he gets that from.  It's not like he was ever exposed to it as a child...  This is known as, in some circles, a "triggering" remark.  It's also known in some circles as an exceptionally ignorant remark.  So while I took the high road and did no more than gently correct her (she really didn't know, and that really does not surprise me), I then was treated (and continue to be treated) to a lovely mental slide show of just exactly what chris was supposedly "not" exposed to as a child.  While I am exceptionally happy that Chanda and her daughter have not yet been treated like Chris and I were, I could have gone the remainder of my natural life and not had that conversation.  So she's never tossed out a sweater covered in cigarette burns inflicted by her husband while she was wearing it?  Cool.  Never been drug over to a staircase on a hardwood floor in sock feet - no traction there, toots, forget it - and looked down and seen each and every hard step looming up at her, knowing - absolutely knowing - in her heart that yep, this time he's gonna do it, I'm going ass over teakettle down those steps?  Excellent.  Not drug around by her hair?  Most definitely swell.  Never looked in a mirror and seen powder burns on her forehead where the shot missed her by  just that much ?  Super duper.  Never convinced herself that  she gave herself  an STD?  Too great.  Never gotten punched so hard that the pattern of the thread in her maternity sweater showed in her skin?  Stupendous.

Now I understand why exactly it is that the Indigo Girls make me cry.  No, it wasn't the beer at the Lillith Festival that did it - I know what it is now.  When Gary and I were first dating, during the spring of 1995, Chris was 6 and Crystal was 11.  We met through little league, and I was at the point where my life revolved around my extrication of myself and my child from a monumentally abusive relationship (that's stupid - is there any other sort of abusive relationship?).  I put Chris into little league, so that we would have something to do other than sit around and stare at the walls of our little apartment and wonder how far the tuna fish in the cabinet would go and just how long I could wait before I had to go get a second job (as it turned out, "not too damn long" was the answer to both questions).  Luck of the draw had it that chris wound up in the little league team that Jeff coached, and I met Gary through Jeff, as they worked together and were best friends.  Long and the short of it, Gary and I fell in love and I spent all the time that I could with Gary, Jeff, Brandon (his son) and Teresa (Jeff's wife).  More often than not, we were at Gary's apartment where the grill and the deck faced out to the tennis court, where Chris could play with the other kids his age, and ride his bike, and - I hoped - start to live a life where there was no wondering what fresh hell his father would cook up or what sorry sort of response to it his mother would cook up.  Gary has always been so devoted to Crystal - I still remember walking through his apartment and seeing his little momentos of Crystal everywhere, and Saturdays and Wednesdays were sacred:  he called Crystal then.  His love for Crystal and his determination to do what was right was as unfamiliar to me as a foreign language.  It drew me to him and formed the foundation of our love for each other - the love we had for our kids was strong in both of us, and as we began to love each other, we began to love the "new kids" in our lives, too.  The weather was turning warm by the time Gary and I were becoming serious, and I was spending more and more time on his deck, perched in one of those cheap green Kmart chairs that always catches water in the seat, so if you aren't careful, you wind up looking like you wet your pants when really all you were doing was perching.  Gary's apartment had a perfect little deck, the apartment had a fireplace, and of course, since Gary is a musician, there was loads of music.  My past life had been full of Garth Brooks, Alabama and Skynard - Freebird, o'course.  Light your lighters and hold 'em high folks.  In a turn of good luck that I still find breathtaking, redneck music (as frequently sung by the drunk redneck in residence as Chris' father) was replaced by Tuck and Patti, the  urlLink Eagles , the  urlLink Indigo Girls .    The biggest draw for me to Gary was the hope that we held together for our children.  We had hope that they would be happy, that we would be happy with them, and that all the love we had for each other would spill over onto them and make them happy.  Happiness would spring from our home, infect our children, and they would be happy.  They, in turn, would funnel happiness back to us, and we would all just be awash in happiness, and joy, and love.  We had love, and we had the hope of more love, through our kids.  There is little in the world that is sadder than the death of hope.  Unless it's the fond remembrance of that hope, and the realization that it is just not to be.

I wanted to post some thoughts while I still had the dust of Washington, DC in my nose and on my shoes.  This was an amazing, incredible event - over one million people converging on Washington, all concerned about the same things:  choice for women, women's rights, gay rights, getting Bush out of office - it was bliss.  Living where I do, sometimes I feel like the lone voice for choice and liberalism in the wilderness.  I have lots of liberal professors, liberal friends, and liberal family members, but I still read  The Tennessean , so it seems like outside of my little circle of sanity, there's a world full of ultra right wing conservatives, hell bent on removing my shoes and sending me packing to the kitchen.  Going to the March not only helped galvanize my intent to become more active in certain issues (the war in Iraq, for instance), but it also drove the point home that I most certainly am NOT alone - there were over three hundred people with me, riding the buses (four buses in all, thank you very much) from Tennessee.  We sat on those accursed buses from Saturday 4/24 at 4pm until Sunday morning 4/25 at around 9:00 am.  Then we marched.  Then we returned to the buses to sit on them some more for the return trip home.  I came home literally a part of the unwashed masses, exhausted, sleep deprived, having existed on water, granola bars and  urlLink peanut butter  and with many, many papers due and basically unstarted.  But I would not have it any other way (well, if I could convince my profs to let me write on the march in lieu of my assignments, that would rock.  Or if perhaps the Paper Fairy would make an appearance at my house.  But as she hasn't done that in the 3 years I've been in school, it would be a little late for her to make her appearance now, wouldn't it???).    Walking out onto the mall was the most incredible experience of my life - it literally overwhelmed me and brought me to tears the sheer volume of people there.  I heard Hillary Clinton speak, and I heard her referred to by another person as the future president of the United States.  If she runs, I have to say that I will never be at home again, because I will move to wherever she is, set up a tent and volunteer my time 25 hours a day, 8 days a week.  I would fetch her coffee, fetch her staff coffee, fetch her gardener coffee and then fetch coffee for her dog.    But the march.  Was. Awesome.  I can't wait to pick up my photos.  I dropped them off at the Walmart (aiy! get thee behind me Satan!) and will pick them up today.  I got CDs so I can post the pics on line.  Woohoo!  I am terribly thrilled.  The lovely Emilin has linked to me on her blog,  urlLink Postcards of Grief.   I am going to have to do some linkage of my own, because I begin my stroll through the wilds of the internet with flea, then I use her site to run around and check all the other blogs I love.  Flea's makes me laugh right out loud, and Emilin's site makes me call my mother.

I have a sign up on my wall, with sticky notes on it, showing how many days until graduation, how many papers or projects I have due, how many revisions I have due, etc.  One more came down the other day from the "Papers or Projects Due" list - my King journals are DONE!  Woohoo!  Now the blog is mine, all mine, where I can write all I want about what I want!  Bwahahahaha!  Expect very sporadic posting as a result.  HA!  I'm going shopping today for what I need on my trip to D.C. for the March.  I seem more concerned about going without a shower for longer than a day than I am about the fact that I'll be spending the weekend without a bed.  This is terribly silly, because one of the more embarrasing results of my senioritis is that when I need to be doing something else, like getting ready for class (uh, like now) and then I wind up doing something other than what I really need to be doing (uh, like posting on my blog), the first thing that winds up getting cut from the program is my morning shower.  So I throw on a hat and out the door I run.  Look, I'm a college student.  I can do that now.  My pants have holes in them, and the cuffs are drug off at the bottom.  I don't think a little oily hair is going to offend anyone, especially since it is generally under a cap.  Okay, now I really HAVE to get going.  I'm going to be seriously late.

I hope that you continue to use this book in your class, Dr. Kates.  It's great.  It's fairly obvious that I love Stephen King, and that I enjoy his writing.  Reading this book, then going back and reading other things by him allowed me to see him actually doing those things that he suggests in  On Writing .  If I had to pick one thing out of the whole book that was the most important, it would be the concept of writing on a regular, steady basis.  Nothing worth doing is going to be a breeze, and if it is a breeze, well, you're probably doing it wrong.    I can only improve my work with constant application of myself to the task.  I won't get better, nor acheive any goals, by chewing the end of my pencil and fretting.  Writing is a skill - use it or lose it.  When writing goes well, it's the greatest feeling.  Being able to put something down in words that others can relate to is beyond beautiful.

I love the way that SK talks about his characters behaving in this way or that way.  At first blush, it seems sort of crazy.  Um, dude, don't you know they're not real?  But I think that's his point.  If you don't treat them as if they are real, if you don't allow them to run the story, you are going to miss out on a lot as a writer and consequently, your readers will miss out as well.  The very worst book I ever, ever read had characters that rivaled the wooden cigar store indian in terms of believability.  I bought the book because the author was sitting in Books A Million signing his books, and appeared so pathetic (that really should have been my first clue) that I felt sorry for him and bought the book.  I read the first half of the book and was appalled.  I write better dreck than this, I thought to myself.  The book was donated to the library unfinished, and I pretty much forgot about it.  But I still have the free bookmark that went with it!  (It was a lovely shade of purple)  The characters were so stilted and unbelievable that the book was unreadable.    Without believable characters, you simply have no story.

Right around page 200 in our book, SK writes about writing  The Stand .  I love that book.  I have fallen asleep reading that book more times than I can count....leading to the inevitable crack on the noggin when a 4 pound book lands on my face.  Of course, the miniseries didn't come close to doing it justice.  That book rocks.  I'm afraid that I have read it too often for this to occur anymore, but back in the day when I  couldn't  recite entire pages from memory, after reading it, I would look around at the world and try to imagine what it would be like if The Superflu really did come along and kill 99.999% of our population.  Sounds pretty grim of me, huh?  But like SK says, he "had an absolutely marvellous time envisioning a world that went smash during the course of one horrified, infected summer."  That marvellous time really comes through in what he produced.  Reading the book is like walking through the Lincoln Tunnel with Larry (you'll get that if you've read the book).    My mom was the one who got me started on Stephen King (have I said how much my mom rocks?).  I'm not sure if she was trying to be funny, or if she was really trying to get me started on something new and interesting.  Mom had been reading SK (she stopped shortly after  The Shining , I think.  Too ooky, she said), and she gave me a copy of  The Stand .  She didn't just walk up to me and hand it to me, oh no!  No way - I was sick.  In bed.  With a COLD.  I made it to the first mention of phlegm (comes pretty early on in this book, oh, somewhere around the dedication page, probably) and I put it away.  No way was I going to read a book that had PHLEGM in it.  Like I said, I'm not sure if she was poking a joke at me, or what, but many years later, when I picked up the book and really read it (I was pregnant with Chris at the time, so I was around 20), it was like lifting the lid off a well and falling in.  SK told that story so well it even effected my dreams at night.  And I don't mean in ways like, "Oh, I had nightmares."  It wasn't that at all - it was more of a realistic type of dreaming.  Where other folks dream in Technicolor, 3-D, complete with orchestra and big box of buttered popcorn, I get the  urlLink pre-talkies era .  Can't remember what I dreamt, but I sure remember waking up and being surprised to find that whatever it was was really all in my head.

Well, I've heard the tv called worse things, I guess.  SK says that we need to shut off our TVs and spend our time reading, and engaging in more thinking type activities.  As it is, I don't watch TV, really.  For a while, we watched  urlLink "24"  with that cute Keifer Sutherland, but that was about it.  It was a family night thing - the kids would come over, do their laundry, eat our food and watch our cable.  It was great.  Then "24" went sort of south on us, and Keifer's character didn't do much but yell a lot (which after the day he's having, who'd blame him?) and so we disconnected that teat, in SK's words, and there hasn't really been a show to replace it.    I've always read.  I can't imagine not reading.  It's a compulsion for me.  I can't sleep at night if I don't read first.  It doesn't matter how tired I am, or if I'm currently reading something for class, for pleasure or for  urlLink more reasons to get out and vote in November , I just can't sleep if I haven't read something.  And I've always been that way.  When my sister Judy and I were kids, Mom would take us into bookshops and let us browse for hours.  I remember sitting in the Intimate Bookshop, which had very cool wood flooring, and lots of steps, and picking something out and just plopping down on the floor to read.  This obviously was in the days before the trendy (and now not so trendy) bookshops putting coffee shops in to go with their books.  I guess they got tired of the kids coming in and just plopping onto the floor.  Mom took us to the library and she found the most wonderful thing - I considered it an absolutely magical book.  It was grand.  It was amazing.  It was An Oracle Among Books.  It would tell me what to read next.  Well, it would tell mom, who would then help me locate the book, which I could either give a thumbs up to, or a thumbs down.  I think they still have them at the library..."If you liked this book, you'll like these too..." sort of thing.  It was encyclopedia style - I think you could look up books by the author or by the title, but I'm not sure.  As I said, I was the kid.  She was the Mom with The Plan, and boy did she keep me hooked up with the books.  My Mom Had The Hook Up.  I suppose that when I said earlier that my vocabulary came all from my dad, that was totally untrue.  It came also from my mom's careful and thoughtful help, providing me with books I'd like, and read.    When I went back to Mom's to visit last summer, she gave me a whole box of books I'd read as a kid - including my tattered copy of "Harriet the Spy."  That was the greatest book.  And getting it back as an adult, and seeing my little 3rd grade handwriting in the front page was really cool.  Hmmm....I might have to pull that puppy back off the shelf.

Okay.  So what if my thinking is about as refined as a bottle of Ripple in a brown paper bag?  I am really struggling with my assignments right now...I have late class on Weds nights, and in typical fashion, I managed to "overlook" (read:  block) every hint that the final was upcoming in my Weds night class...I mean, I missed it on the syllabus, I missed it in my notes (hello?  Hello?  Is anyone home?)  and then I even missed it WHILE I WAS STUDYING FOR IT...  I didn't realize I was taking the final until the teacher put it in front of me, with the words:  French 3130 FINAL at the top. (It's a French women writers class that French majors can take for French credit, or women's' studies minors can take for their credit.  I got to read all in English)  Anyway, even though I gathered up ALL THE BOOKS we had read, and was diligently studying for the test, and HAD NOT READ ANYTHING FURTHER for the class, I still expected to take notes after the test, and would have sat there patiently waiting for the lecture to begin after I handed in my test had Dr. Goldberg not put that handy "FINAL EXAM" at the top.  As it was, I still engaged in rather hesitant packing up of the ol' backpack after finishing the final.    Are there drugs I can take for this?  Well, my thinking is currently not terribly refined.  But I know that it CAN be.  Refining thoughts is what school is for, in my opinion.  At least partly so.  Refining them, and learning new ones.  Because if you are stuck with the same old thoughts you had when you started college, what good was it?  Considering the changes that my own composition has undergone during my time in school, I can see some stout changes.  I began by trying to write a very short essay (5 pages, double spaced) about native americans in my history class.  The writing flowed like...well, let's just skip that.  The writing did NOT flow.  There was no flowing.  There was, on the other hand, throwing.  As in, throwing the book.  And my notes.  See, I was trying to put wayyy too much into this little, bitty 5 page paper.  And staring at 5 blank pages, knowing that they had to contain some prose about a book which was  urlLink less  than a page turner was really doing a job on my mind.  Now I understand that I have to take a nugget, decide what I want to say about it, and then devote my 5 pages, or whatever it is (12 in my damnable French Women Writers class) to succinctly saying what needs to be said.  Sometimes I can be succinct.

My approach to this assignment was to read the whole book, (whoo, now there's a toughie - since I had already read the thing when it came out, all I had to do was take it to the gym with me a few times, and poof! done) then when it came time to write about the various "nuggets" we found within its pages, I just let the book flop open and would write about what I found there.  Beginning my marathon journaling entry undertaking, I flipped to the section (pg. 157) regarding writing what you know.  I might or might not have written about this before - but I am really taken with the concept of writing what you know.  He talks about John Grisham (another set of books of which I am the owner of all):  "John Grisham, of course, knows lawyers.  What you know makes you unique in some other way.  Be brave.  Map the enemy's positions, come back, tell us all you know.  And remember that plumbers in space is not such a bad setup for a story."  What do I know?  What could I write about?  I think about the "what if" approach that SK uses to his writing ("what if a bunch of vampires took up residence in a small, northern town?" etc.), and all I come up with is, "What if...what if....what if...what if I quit this and go kick Chris' ass at some video game?"  Not exactly fascinating stuff.  But I'm not looking to write a novel with the popularity level of SK's.  That would be nice and all, and I've thought about writing (what English major hasn't?), and I realize that if I follow my current path to it's logical end, there will be a large roadsign that reads, "PUBLISH OR PERISH!" So I expect that there will be some sort of publishing in my future, even if it only takes place when I click the "publish your post" button on this blog.

Apparently all my creative cells, all my writing-intensive bodily parts, all those things which are quite important when it comes to engaging in this exercise called creating, being educated and finishing what I have started, seem to have already strolled across the stage, shaken The Man's hand and picked up the empty sleeve which will one day (God Willing and I don't cut any more class) very soon hold my Bachelor of Arts Degree.  I sure do wish they hadn't done that, because they have left the rest of me (i.e., the part that has the nervous breakdowns, does the paying work, and runs various errands) sort of in a fix.  Let me just sum up the past few weeks with this little vignette:  I went to the new Wal-Mart, shopped for some junk food to nosh on whilst watching the Preds lose, ran into a friend there, chatted with her, paid my tab, went to the car, and loaded up.  I loaded up all the bags, I loaded up the beer.  I loaded up my nice little Lyra (early iPod) which was currently blasting "Honking on Bobo" by Aerosmith (the only thing that made a trip to Wal-Mart bearable).  I put everything into the car.  Except of course, my wallet.  Yes, I left my wallet in the buggy, which I then am embarrased to say, I did not walk to the little corral created specifically for the buckin' broncs.  I pushed it over to where it was out of my by-God way, and took off.  Leaving my wallet to pay for my sins.  Well, apparently some kind soul found it, and turned it in, without removing the 7 quarters, 2 dimes and zillion pennies I had in it.  Oh, and my checkcard also escaped assault as well.  Can you believe it?  Someone's karma just got a big fat goose in the behind.  God knows it's not mine.    The purpose of that story is more to get my stupid fingers going again and to also prove the points that SK has made.  First, one must apply oneself daily to the exercise of creativity, and secondly, while the use of Swifties might be quite entertaining for some, it really does get annoying after a while.  These days my thoughts (creative or not) seem to be approaching from way far away, and they are on a train track.  But they aren't walking, oh no!  Not my thoughts!  They're RIDING!  They are riding on one of those  urlLink rairoad hand carts  that you used to see in the movies.  But unfortunately, they seem to be arguing about just who is going to do the pushing of the handy hand cart lever!  This of course requires me to go meet them, climb onto the stupid handcart and do the moving myself...  I suppose this explains why my final Stephen King journal (7 entries in all) is due tomorrow, and why, as you can see, there are NO new entries.  They're all riding the handcart.  The wrong way.

If you had told me, say, five years ago, that I was going to be this excited about a trip to Texas, I would have first laughed in your face, then probably deleted your number from my cell phone rolodex.  Texas has always been the place where bad, painful things reside and from which bad news always flows.  Texas has been the bane of my existance since Gary and I met.  I have had a love/hate relationship with Texas for years.  When I saw the trailer for " urlLink The Alamo " in the theaters not long ago, I wanted to go see the movie so I could pull for the Mexicans.  The good to come from Texas:  Gary's education.  Gary's divorce.  Crystal always arrives from Texas.    The bad to come from Texas:  Gary's divorce.  Anytime we are sued, it's a lawsuit in Texas.  All the uproar, hatred and vitrol in our lives has stemmed from Texas.  Is it any wonder that I have such a difficult time with this?  When we traveled to Texas for Crystal's high school graduation, I was not thrilled.  Even though her turning 18 and graduating from high school signified the end of our indentured servitude to her mother through the form of child support, I still could not get happy about our trip.  Texas has always been the bearer of bad news, the place where my pain comes from, the big boil on the butt of my life.  All good things that came from Texas also came with accompanying bad things.  Crystal almost always arrived with some sort of nasty, ugly letter from her mother, always with bills for Crystal's medical care enclosed.  Gary even got a birthday card from Crystal, with a bill in it once, and Crystal was always appointed Bearer of Bills when she arrived.    When Southwest started the "ticketless travel" thing, Gary got a call from Pam saying that unless Crystal had a paper ticket, Pam wasn't putting her on the plane.  I arrived home to find a note saying that Gary had had to go to the airport to physically pick up tickets (no easy task, as they technically no longer provided them, but Gary loves his daughter, and did everything he could to placate the ex), and then Gary had to Fed Ex the tickets to Pam, since Pam waited until the very last minute to pull this one.  So Gary jumped through the hoops that Pam demanded, and managed to get the tickets to Pam in the nick of time.    Oh, and then there was the medicine fiasco.  Crystal came up here from Texas for a visit in the summer - 42 days - the maximum we were allowed, and Pam sent her with a prescription for us to fill for antibiotics for Crystal's face.  It was a prescription that would provide her with her pills for the entire visit.  Pam didn't get the prescription filled there in Texas, no way.  She filled another prescription for the medicine that Crystal needed and just sent the extra prescription with Crystal and demanded that we fill it here.  Of course, the insurance company wouldn't cover it, since Crystal had already gotten medication of the same type in Texas.  We would have to pay for this out of our pocket, with no hope for reimbursement, and this was no small amount of money, either.  When we asked Pam to send the medication to Crystal, she refused, saying that it was against the law to send medications through the mail.    I'll let you think about that one for a minute.  Yep.   urlLink Against the law to send medications through the mail.     Those are just a few things that occurred.  Our lives were lived constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.  And trust me, there was  no  shortage of shoes.  After Crystal turned 18, after she turned 19, well into her twentieth year, we continued to receive things from the Attorney General's office in Texas, saying that Pam thinks she is still entitled to money from us.  Crystal is now 21, and we still are not sure if Pam will try to pursue a claim against us for more money.  But the good that has come from Texas, well, there is good too.  Gary's  urlLink education , as I said.  And I enjoy a friendship and love and respect for Crystal that runs deeper than any distaste I might have for the home state of Dubya.  Oh, and it's highly likely that I'll be getting my Master's Degree and Ph.D. there as well.  I may even stay there and teach down there.  Who knows?  So that's why I'm so surprised.  I am giddy with excitement over this trip.  I am beside myself with joy over traveling to (what is to me) an uncharted territory, a place that holds promise now, instead of only trouble.  We are going to finish something Gary began many years ago, but had to drop at the insistence of Pam.  This is the first real step toward's Gary completing his Ph.D.  Gary is finally going to get to do something for himself, after 20+ years of looking to the needs of others.    I feel excited for myself, but I feel priveleged to be joining Gary on his quest.

Okay, so yesterday was Crystal's birthday - her twenty-first birthday, and much ado was made over the big Two One.  I took many photographs, but unfortunately, I think that most of them were of Bruce, who was alternately tooting and wearing his horn/hat made from Miller Lite Beer boxes.  Bruce's invention was really quite stunning:  he took a cardboard tube (I had been wrapping Her Royal Nibs' birthday presents) and through much cutting, twisting and taping, he managed to attach a cone made of beer boxes at the end of the tube.  He used this to make Riccola-inspired horn blowing noises for a while, then he announced, "This can be Crystal's horn.  And if she starts acting like a bitch, it can be her broom!"  With that, he cackled, hopped onto it, and galloped around the house.    Obviously, the dog went into hysterics, as did I.  Bruce then topped off his...masterpiece...with a cutout of the Miller Lite emblem, which he secured to the back of the cone/broom/horn with an olive topped tooth pick (that was one of the decorations for Crystal's birthday cake).  He said it was her license plate, should she chose to use his invention as her broom.  We then went to Crystal's work and abused her car.  We painted her car with window chalk.  I wrote "Beer!" all over her windsheild, her doors, etc.  On the back window, I painted "Pull me over!  I'm 21!"  We filled her car with balloons, covered it in streamers, and Bruce put new car seat covers, steering wheel cover and a license plate on the front, all with dolphins on them.  She loves dolphins.  Bruce then needed a shower, and so he came to the house to get ready.  He had clothes he had to wash, to wear  that night .  So he put the clothes in, put himself into the shower, then ran around with a towel around his lower half for some time, while his clothes dried.  Apparently, he had on more than one towel, because at one point, he snapped the (outside) towel off, and I almost had a stroke.  But fortunately, as I said, he had doubletoweled it.  More horn blowing.  More dog chasing.    I pulled out the sangria.  Crystal finally got there after she got off work, and we ate, and drank, and ate, and drank and drank and drank.  She pounded back a few rounds of sangria (4) and then had a few margaritas, made with her new smoothie blender (3) and then tripped out of the chair in the living room playing Playstation - a very difficult move, and not something that should be undertaken by a novice.    Gary and I were having our coffee this morning, and discussing the evening's festivities.  Gary looked at me as I totalled the number of beverages Crystal consumed and said, "I don't think either of them is a rookie."  Hmmm.  At one point in the festivities, Gary was admiring Bruce's handiwork with the broom/horn/hat and the flames and such that he painted on Crystal's car.    "You should ditch the engine work, Bruce.  You've got talent.  You could be a teacher, and work with kids.  You could do Arts and Crafts with the kids," said Gary.  "Yeah," said Crystal.  "Kids with ADD."    I'll post pictures of the broom/horn/hat later.  My description above does not do it justice.

Okay, this is just  urlLink wrong .  I don't know how anyone can sleep at night if they actually support this administration.  This is just totally fucked up. They are going to set our men and women out there in the middle of all this danger, for absolutely no reason at all, and then to top it off - the Parmesan on top of the ravioli, as it were - they're not going to even give them any weapons to protect themselves?  Well, unless you count their digital cameras...  And in the meantime, we continue to drive our giant SUV's, support the idiots in office and their compassionate conservativism, and get angry at the cost of gas.  The most depressing part of this picture is how likely it really is that Bush will get elected.  I tend to go back and forth on this:  I'm told by some that no way will he make it in 2004, but then it just seems that there are so many people out there who are so invested in ensuring that they keep all the money on the Monopoly board and don't lose even one sorry railroad...well, it just seems so unlikely that Bush is going to be defeated.  I get totally depressed about that sometimes.  And the thought that because of a politician's greed, someone was considering bashing an Iraqi's head in with a can of ravioli just makes it that much worse.    *******************  On a happier note, I went to the  urlLink Tennessee Renaissance Festival  this weekend.  I bought Chris some elf ears, which look rather fetching on him, if I do say so myself.  We saw jousting, a human chess match, the Queen of England, Mary Queen of Scots, and a fire eater with quite a sense of humor.  In my own twisted sense of humor, I chose to wear my favorite t-shirt to the Festival:  "This is what a feminist looks like."  An older woman who was selling, of all things, crowns with manmade stones in them, commented on my shirt.    "I never really thought of myself as one," she said, after telling me how much she liked my shirt.  "What changed your mind?"  I asked, hoping that I wasn't going to get into a long, drawn out, detailed story about how her ex-husband wasn't supportive of her crown making business, or that he didn't like for her to be on the road all the time, selling the crown jewels.  Or that all the fairies and pixies that came in through the window, wanting a fitting was just the last straw, and he was outta here, leaving to serve with Her Majesty's Royal Doublet Makers or somesuch.  "At the Annual Medieval Historians Convention of Crownmakers and Pixie Fitters*, camped nearby was a group who were reenacting the Misogynist* Books and I had just had it when I looked over into their camp, and there was a guy leading a woman around with a dog collar.  A dog collar!" she said, obviously highly (and rightly) offended.    We continued on with our conversation for a little while - not long though, as I was now beginning to feel the beads of sweat rolling down my back and into my underwear, and I thought that I probably needed to make a beeline for the shady portion of the Fair.  I wanted to buy one of her crowns, though, if for no other reason than to call it My Feminist Crown when I wore it, but as Crystal said, "Where would you wear those things, anyway?"  Personally, I had planned to wear it as I wrote in my blog, or even as I perched in my bubble bath.  I even fantasized about wearing it in my new tomato garden, but thought that might just be a bit much.  She may have just been trying to get me to buy something, but it made me think some more about the things that cause us to have "Aha!" moments.  Mom asked me what had caused my interest in feminism, and I had to lay all the credit at her feet - she was the one who encouraged my reading so much, and of course, made available to my malleable little mind so many books with strong female characters in them.  Did I ever have an Aha moment, or did I just grow up this way?  I remember a few things that sharpened my feelings about feminism, and women in general, but I don't remember having an "It's dark, now suddenly, it's light" type moment.  I guess some of us actually have to see dog collars on women  before we can see the ugliness that is misogyny.  Then again,  urlLink others  will just see it as a really neat marketing ploy...  Fashizzle, huh?   *Nothing quite that obvious, I'm afraid - totally made up names, due to my inability to retain knowledge when my brain has heated up to temperatures high enough to cause sweat to run down the crack of my behind.

I finally figured out what the hell my problem has been over this past semester.  Please bear with me.  Sometimes I am not as quick on the uptake as others are in regards to things of this nature, but when I finally do figure something out, well, I just have to share it.    This past semester I had not one, but TWO health classes:  Effective Living and Women's Health.  Both of them were Warm Body classes - so long as there was a warm body in a seat and the Warm Body had your name attached, whether said Warm Body was awake, aware or taking notes really did not matter.  You got an A anyway.  Much of the topics covered in these classes were similar (okay, they were MIRROR IDENTICAL, if you must know), and I have already said that I realize how important it is for freshpeople to understand how to avoid unwanted pregnancies, STDs, the Freshperson 15, stress induced heart attacks, etc.  You know, the sorts of things that can wipe an incoming class out before midterms.  Anyway, when we reached the sections in the book that deal with domestic violence and rape, and crimes against women, well, I found myself angry.  Totally angry.  Absolutely pissed off.  This made no sense to me.  As a feminist, as a woman, as the step mother of a girl, I  want  people to know about these things.  I think it is a  great  idea to have a class of women get extra credit for compliling a list of phone numbers that can be useful if one finds oneself in a battering situation.  So why, I wondered to myself (albeit with only a part of my brain), was I reacting with so much anger and vitriol at the thought that these topics were being covered?  Isn't knowlege of a problem the first step towards fixing it?  Isn't the knowledge that these people gain through this class worth it?  Well, yeah.  Of course it is.  But why, why why in the name of all that's holy, is it pissing me off like I have been personally offended?  I mean, when I have issues come up about things in my past, usually when I am discussing things of a feminist nature with Crystal (and trying to convert her to Our Agenda of Lesbianism, Terrorisim, Child Killing and Husband Leaving, according to Pat Robertson or Jack Van Impe or whoever) I just discuss them openly.  I don't get all bent out of shape about it.  It's over 10 years in the past, anyway, right?  What's the deal?    I'm asking a lot of questions for someone who began the post claiming to know just what I was getting at and where I was going with this.  One of the most disabling parts of living in a violent environment is not knowing what's coming next.  Will it be a loving husband?  A pissed off husband?  A drunk husband?  A husband with a girlfriend?  A husband with an STD?  Will wanting to attend church set him off?  Will a phone call?  What about dinner?  What about traffic, work or the dog?  Will any of those things lead to a blow up?  You just never know where the other shoe is going to land when it finally drops, and you sure as hell don't know what's going to finally jiggle the damn thing loose.    I never know now what's going to approach my car when I pick Chris up.  Not that he's in any way, shape or form violent - I don't mean to imply that.  I just never know what sort of insanity is going to come out of his mouth.  Nor do I know if he's going to do as I ask or even as I tell.  I told him to please mow the grass yesterday (the grass is so tall now the bunnies have moved their warrens to our yard, certain they will never be found by the Rotund Corgi who guards the yard), but rather than doing as I asked, he went to bed.  At 4:00 in the afternoon.  I heard another mower outside, and as I was working (like I supposedly am now) I thought it was Chris.  Imagine my surprise when I looked out my back window after the mower stopped and saw the Bunny Parade taking place in the back yard.  I only knew it was taking place, of course, because their little ears were sticking up out of the grass.  Not that that's any sort of comparison, you understand, to domestic violence.  I'm just talking about the uncertainty, the confusion, the constant reacting and backing up, and setting off.  It's so difficult to figure out just what's coming, and boy, am I tired.    It sure doesn't help, either, that Chris looks so much like his dad.  He has his walk, which really is unfortunate, and his laugh, and all his looks.  It just makes it so difficult for me to deal with Chris as Chris, and not ChrisasKevin.  Chris never yells or anything, actually it's the opposite.  Mom says that Chris sounds like he has  urlLink Oppositional Defiant Disorder  and I tend to think she might be right.  One of the things that kids with ODD do is that they intentionally try to get on your nerves.  It's not necessarily even big stuff, although God knows, they can do that too.  Chris has been told and told that he needs to speak up.  When he talks, he mumbles, he speaks softly, to the point where I'm constantly saying things like "Huh?"  "Whatdidyasay?" and other brilliant comebacks.  I sound like a resident of an old folks home who's hearing aid battery is in the weeds.  I know I'm not losing my hearing.  But I also know that I can't hear what the fuck he's saying, either.    So while I now understand just exactly why I was pissed all semester and remain pissed to this day, that knowledge does not really help.  I'm still going to wind up at some point in the near future with question marks floating around my head and a constant case of Futility Invoked Fatigue.

There is a certain joy in doing things differently from everyone else.  I am 37 years old, and my children are moving into their own lives, leaving Gary and I with the options of either "Empty Nest Syndrome" or the more palatable and infinitely more plausible "New Life Syndrome."  Gary and I are going to get to go to graduate school, and live the lives that we derailed ourselves from living with our earlier, stupider, younger decisions.  Now I totally understand the pleasure that old, gray headed men have in driving convertible BMWs or other fancy cars:  you know what you couldn't have before, and now the knowledge of that makes the Now all the more pleasant.  When Chris goes on to his grandad's and spends the summer, I'm going to get to go make coffee without having to fully dress myself, including hat and shoes.  I'm going to be able to eat what I want, and use my own phone, and not have to guess what new uproar will enter our lives as Chris climbs into the car from school.  Gary will be able to work at night without locking his door...without even closing his door!  Our guest bathroom will never have dirt from the yard in the sink from a thorough shoe washing that took place in my newly remodeled guest bath.  I won't leave the house for 45 minutes wondering what group of partiers might show up to smoke some dope with my kid in my house in my absence.  I won't have to constantly wonder if the gallon of milk I just bought will still be there when I go to make some cereal, even though I just bought the thing this afternoon, and it simply isn't physically possible to ingest THAT MUCH food in one day is it?    I feel terrible for people who can't have children.  I know that they must be feeling something that I cannot even imagine.  And I would certainly never try to say that my unhappiness with my own decisions as a child is equal to what people go through all the time in trying to have children.  But the bitterness that I have towards my own child is strong enough to bubble over onto my outlook on other children.  I no longer see them as sweet, or cute.  They have become the enemy, just like Chris has.  All I want is to live my own life, without the interference of someone else who holds so much power over my existance....which is exactly the same thing that Chris wants.

That's just how I like to think of myself.  I tried to do a search for images online to see if I could find a good picture that would represent me, rather than actually being  of  me, since I have no photos anywhere on the internet that are actually me.  I searched my first name, Laura, in the Google images search.  My, but there are a LOT of you people out there named Laura!  And the things that you do...well...I'm impressed.  Horseback riding.  Scuba diving.  Pron.  Living with George.  Jeez, I'm just some boring college student, where all you other Lauras are out there living lives of great fun times.    I eventually gave it up and went for a cartoon character.  It was either that or Jodi Foster, and I don't think anybody would really mistake me for Ms. Foster.  I considered putting Laura Ingalls Wilder up there, but decided that if I'm going to lie about what I look like, I'd rather lie myself into a cartoon character than...well, a sweet looking old lady in a very high necked dress.  That's in my future soon enough, thanks, for now I'll just imagine myself as WONDER WOMAN!!    My sister and I used to play Wonder Woman all the time.  If we were really into it, and we were lucky enough to stumble upon at least four styrofoam cups, we could be  urlLink Wonder Woman and Wonder Girl  with REAL bullet proof bracelets, rather than imaginary ones.  Unfortunately, styrofoam bracelets have a tendancy to make one's wrists sweat, so these were frequently made then cast off for their lighter, more aerodynamic counterparts, the Imaginary Bracelets.    We kicked some serious ass, though, as Wonder Woman and her spunky counterpart, Wonder Girl.  I was obviously always Wonder Woman, as I was (and continue to be) the older of us.  Nobody every played the bad guy - he was always imaginary.  But Judy and I kicked his butt every time, no matter what.  And there was none of this dumb "Wonder Woman is in love with Steve Whatsisface," either.  My Wonder Woman was strictly about laying down the smake on some unsuspecting Evil Doer.  I think we even used the Invisible Jet, which was  really  easy to imagine, since it was invisible and all.    Coming in a strong second to Wonder Woman was the  urlLink Mighty Isis .  Needless to say, no zephyr wind blew on high enough to get us airborne, but we sure tried.    Of course, I also engaged in various abuses against my sister's person and psyche, including convincing her she was adopted and later, when I decided my cache of dolls and toys was not suitable for my needs, I convinced her that all her dolls came awake in the night, specifically midnight, and would come to her bed and eat her face off.  I, of course, was the only one who could keep them from harming her, so she'd best let me have them to keep in my closet.  Had my mom not figured out my little racket, I'm sure I'd still have Judy's Cabbage Patch doll to go with mine.  I guess the fact that my sister was left with only the dust bunnies under her bed to play with must have been the big giveaway.  Or my disgusting smugness at how well my plan was going.  Either one would have done it.

I got all A's for my last semester.  Not quite to the point where I got honors, dammit, but hey.  This is the first of three graduations I intend to participate in, so I'm not going to fret about the grades too much, because I just need to be able to get into grad school.    Anytime I think about grad school, I think about a line in that Robin Williams  urlLink movie  where the kid, who can't pronounce "graduate," asks the Dad, "What's gradual school?" and the dad says, "Where you gradually learn you don't want to go to school anymore..."    How gradually am I going to learn this???

Holy crap.  That was some kind of experience.  Hurricane Dad blew into town last week - was it Wednesday?  Thursday?  I can't remember now.  He brought with him many wonderful gifts for the Graduate (that would be me) and I was exceptionally happy with all of them.  One of the gifts was diamond earrings, and the other was a check.  Loved the diamonds, loved the check.  With the check, we'll be able to take our trip to Denton without having to stiff the mortgage company for a month.  Woohoo!  Chase Manhattan Bank takes a dim view of that sort of thing.    The down side of graduation (if you can even call it that) was that we didn't really get any up close and personal pictures - they're all pictures Gary took from the nosebleed seats.  I had no idea where they were sitting, because the way the gymnasium is set up, the graduates were facing into the sun and Gary and fam were sitting with their backs to the sun, facing the graduates (that would be MEMEMEMEME! Sorry.  Giddy moment there).  As I was facing into the sun, I couldn't tell for sure where they were - I just knew they weren't to my immediate right or left.  Eventually, I managed to catch a glimpse of The Boy's ears, silhouetted in the sun, and knew it was them.    I wore my denim miniskirt, flats (to ensure that I avoided the Terrible Trip that I was certain was to come) and of course, my hot pink, "This is what a feminist looks like" shirt.  After graduation, we headed to Outback, where we ate like goats.  I, of course, remained in gown and cord, but sans hat.  I kept getting the tassel caught in my mouth.  Not a good look.  Due to terrible misunderstandings and general exaustion of all, we missed some great photo ops, but I will be donning the cap and gown and Feminist shirt again on Tuesday so's I can get some photos with the whole fam damly when they arrive to do their laundry (that would be Crystal and Bruce).  I can't believe that I didn't even get a picture with Dad while I was wearing my cap and gown.  I really am pissed at myself for not speaking up and halting all and sundry and yelling for a picture.  What was I thinking???  I will be posting photos  urlLink here , although it might take a while.  What the hell is with Walmart not being able to put pictures on a disk without flipping them like pancakes?  It looks like we graduated on the ceiling of Murphy Center!

I got an A in Women's Health.  That brings my GPA up to 3.339.  Yes, I included the thousands point.  I worked hard for that.  Now the only remaining question mark is my Advanced Comp, which, by the way, is the class that got me started with this blog.  Hmmm.  I've been considering a revamp of the blog, as I'm now out of school and this is no longer a class assignment but instead, something I do because I want to, no longer for a grade.  Perhaps I should make it the Honorary Dr. Kates Fan Page until my grade comes in.  Hmmmmmm.....  Did I mention that he wears great ties?

I just had a terrible thought.  What if the IT department at MTSU can tell how often we check our grades?  This is a horrible thought, as I will immediately be outed as the most needy, grade consumed individual on campus.  Fortunately, I am graduating, and would never need show my face again.  But still...the concept is terrible.  Oh, and there's still no new grades up.  Maybe I'll check crystal's now.

I am currently alternating between scrubbing the grout in the house and checking my grades.  Currently, I have all of them in except my Advanced Comp and women's health.  All A's so far, so let's hope the trend continues, and my DSL connection holds up to all this insanity.  AC is the only class where I  really  don't know how I'll do, and where I particularly care how I do - Dr. Kostkowska's class was important too (Gender and Modernism) but I pretty much figured I had the A in that class.  If I can keep the trend of A's going, I should have an honors designation on my transcript - although it will be too late for graduation.

Now that I've done all there is to be done with my schoolwork (all all everything - DONE!) all that's left to be done is engage in the compulsive checking of grades.  Woohoo.  I've already checked about seventy bajillion times today.  And I found in my checking THREE A's already - yay!!  Of course, one of those was my totally silly Effective Living class.  I understand that EL is really important for those newly arriving freshmen and -women, who need, desperately, the information about how NOT to get a sexually transmitted disease, how to do their own laundry, and how to tell if your best friend is about to leap off the top of her dorm in a fit of depression over the gajillion things that all come due at one time.  Yes, these are all very, very important things to know.  I was very, very happy when I learned them way back in the Stone Age.  I could relate more to the info about menopause in my Women's Health class than I could to the other stuff in my Effective Living class.  How depressing.  When I got done with my last final yesterday, and turned in my portfolio, I went to the library and got some really  urlLink trashy   urlLink novels  and a  urlLink giant Cherry Limeaide  and really did nothing else the remainder of the day except read and drink my gynormous Route 44 drink.  Bliss.  Sheer bliss.  I have now moved into the  urlLink giddy stage  of my collegiate career, and am thoroughly annoying Gary.

My Mom.  (ahem)  My mom is the best.  My mom can fix anything.  My mom can even make me feel better about the septic tank that is my relationship with my son.  Mom emailed me and told me that I should keep in mind that my dad's job when the two of them met was at a boy's training school, and that he has worked his entire life with deviant behavior.  My dad is a criminologist, a sociologist, a dude who deals with people who just ain't right.  Come to think of it, my mom does that too.  Deals with people who ain't right, I mean.  She's a counselor/therapist/fixerupper of bad relationships - use your title of choice.  Mom says that Chris probably can't come up with anything that Dad hasn't already seen before.  Isn't it amazing that as children of our parents we can actually go into adulthood (I'm 37) and believe that we can do or think or feel something that our parents didn't?  How the hell did I forget that Dad deals in deviancy?  (Woo - alliteration!  The college education is really working for me!)

"Honkin' on Bobo"...as any Aerosmith fan knows, many of their titles have double meanings.  "Honkin' on Bobo" is slang for oral sex performed on a guy. As I'd rather not get a slew of hits from people looking for pron, I'll just leave it at that fairly prim description.    I tend to just think of "Bobo" as the pet name that Steven Tyler gave his harmonica, but I guess I'm fairly naive that way.  "Bobo" might be a pet name for something, but probably  not  for his harmonica.

Okay - the way it's looking for me is that Chris is just going to have to go.  Makes him sound like a puppy who tends to chew on shoes or something.  We simply cannot continue in the vein we are in.  Our home is becoming so dysfunctional that even the drains are backing up.  I don't know what to do with him, Chanda and Kevin are equally clueless, and Gary continues to be furious with him, with good reason.  Hey, Gary is the most passive guy around.  You have to find a big, flaming stick and poke him with it repeatedly to get a rise out of him.  Chris apparently owns stock in the flaming stick industry.  Here are the options that I am seeing for us at the moment, none of which are any too palatable to me, but palatable went out the window and was replaced with possible:  --He goes to Dad's house, and stays at Dad's house.  Chris is not interested in the part of that option that involves him staying with Dad.  I think that Chris will go to Dad's, comport himself like the wonderful kid that he can be when he wants to, and then return here, exactly as he is now, with no change in his behavior or attitude.  I think that Dad, as wonderful as he is, and as smart as he is, doesn't really realize what he is getting into.  Chris is manipulative.  He will go to Dad's and behave wonderfully.  Dad will send him back here, in time for school, and Chris will have what he wants:  a summer away from us, at the beach, with a guaranteed return here for school where he can continue to torment me and Gary.  That sounds quite Machiavellian for a 17 year old, I know.  You'd have to live with him to appreciate it.  I really think it's true.  And I'm his  mother.   --We put him in some sort of troubled teen home.  Hopefully, one where they feed them gruel and make them hoe beans or something.  Unfortunately, there is generally a requirement that you have money for that sort of thing.  That leaves me with the option of the Rutherford County Workhouse, and I don't think that's really what we have in mind.  I'm considering contacting each of the grandparents (my dad, my mom, Kevin's parents) and saying this is where we want to send him, this is how much it costs, I am passing the proverbial hat.  Unfortunately, I think the hat would return with nothing more than lint in it.  We are not a well off group.  Well, except for Kevin's parents - they have buckets, but parting with it - well,  urlLink  the terms "teeth," and "pulling,"    come to mind...you get the picture.  --He remains here, we all suffer through his final year at school.  Gary does nothing to prepare for grad school (it's all we can do to get through the days as it is, much less anything extra) and we just postpone our dream for a little while longer.  Unfortunately, that last option seems to be the one that is most likely.

The workers are here to fix our siding.  I am working in a room which generally affords me quiet when I am home alone.  Alas, this is not to be.  Siding removal is apparently quite loud work.  During the storm of last year we sustained really minor damage - our neighbor had to have one entire side of the siding on his house replaced.  There were holes all over his house where hail had torn through the siding.  You couldn't walk through our neighborhood without seeing blue tarps everywhere, and hearing the sounds of roof work going on.  We, on the other hand, seemed to be lucky (aha!  foreshadowing!  Note the use of the term "seemed"!!).  Our house sustained a minor ping, compared to others.  We had a hole in our siding roughly the size of a silver dollar.  Perhaps a Susan B. Anthony dollar at that.  This  is  a feminst home, after all.  We have finally gotten around to getting things fixed now - the roof, the screens, the deck, etc.  All told, the last estimate (now woefully outdated) was over $12,000.  Obviously we have homeowners.  Otherwise, the hole in the side of the house would continue to be "repaired" with duct tape, and the roof...well, we'd just plan to move before we'd fix that.    According to our contractor, the people who manufacture siding change the warp and woof of it every so often, just so they can be assured of big fat sales - like with us.  Because the insurance company can't locate one tiny piece of grey siding that matches ours, our entire house gets resided.  Seems a bit extreme to me.  Oh, and Gary is not happy that the creases in the roof are no longer symmetrical as they were before.  I'm letting him deal with the contractor, because I know I can't work up enough existential angst to actually seem upset about off center creases in the roofing.  The workers have arrived and are wrenching the siding off my house with enough vigor to make the pictures dance.  I miss the quiet canoodlers.  This paper is going to suck butt.  I mean really suck.

I'm listing my schoolbooks on  urlLink Half.com .  But I only have a couple of finals left - Effective Living (aka, The Breathing Class - as in, easy as...basic as...) and Women's Health (another duh - yes, yes, I KNOW I need a pap smear, thanks.  No, I really don't want to look at the giant box of contraceptives.  Don't need 'em.)  Oh, and I have a final in my Southern Lit class, which was a really great class, in an incredible juxtaposition to the first time I attempted the class and took it with the resident Crazy Obnoxious professor - the walking, talking, barking proof of why tenure is a bad thing.  Click  urlLink here  and do a search on her name, which I won't give you coughjacksoncough and you can see what I mean.  Anyway, I know I am a class favorite (insert preening here) because when I have sent him (the Good Prof, that is) drafts to review for me, before I turn them in in final, he always gets back to me pronto.  I mean, like within hours.  Even when he was out of town.  The other students I've spoken with who don't seem to happy with him wind up getting responses from him days later.  Hee!  I'm a teacher's pet!  Ha!  I've never been a teacher's pet before...  Today is my final class as an undergraduate.  The same part of me that's excited about it is also sad in a way.  I mean, I never expected to get here.  I had reached a point in my life where school was totally done, and my life was about the 8-5 grind.  Things are so different now.

Okay, look.  I am all in favor of love, passion and all  urlLink that .  But I am not exactly in a happy place right now, so if you guys over there in the next carrel here in the library could PLEASE stop making out, and being all in love and stuff, it sure would help me stay focused.  The library is for (a) working on papers that are painfully late, (b) messaging friends and (c) having a quiet nervous breakdown.  Nowhere in there is a mention of canoodling in the carrels.    That is all.

Not without surprise, Gary is totally pissed off about Chris' antics.  Life in our house is turning into life in a prison.  I expect to see some dude in big shades stroll up and say, "What we have here, is a failure to communicate..." and make me dig a big hole in the yard, just to fill it in and dig another, and  urlLink another ...Gary has stopped laughing, and stopped being happy, and really seemed to stop not when Chris made his infamous, "You're not my dad" remark, but more when Gary made the little squeak he made when trying not to cry, vomit or otherwise freak right the hell out on the deck right after slugging the shit out of Chris and knocking him into the dog's bowl.  Gary goes to work and stays gone all the time, he's always gone, whether he's at work, or out driving randomly around for hours at a time, or whether he's in the house, in his studio - always with the door locked, locked up in his studio, with me locked out.  I can't really talk to him about it anymore, because I never seem to be able to do the right thing, the correct thing, what Gary thinks is best - nor can I even seem to do what I think is best.  I feel frozen to the tracks, stuck in my shoes, incapable of movement.   urlLink Tharn , I think is the word that comes to mind...  So Gary's room and mind are locked away, our regular route to discussion is gone (we would go out to Logan's and eat dinner every so often and discuss things - kids, work, school, etc. etc.) because we just can't leave Chris alone for even a second.  It's like he's a toddler again, but a  urlLink toddler with a monumentally fresh mouth .  My final days in school are shot, because anything I do is overshadowed by Chris' stupid antics...not to mention none of the things I had planned for him will come to pass either:  no driver's license (can't you just see him in the Cheech and Chong mobile with the little bitty steering wheel, saying, "I think we're parked, dude..." - that Cheech and Chong shit gets severely less funny when it's your own kid you're talking about and not yourself, by the way), no job (we all know where the money would go, now don't we?), no social life...do I really need to keep going here?    Oh, but according to him, it's all my fault for searching his room.  Dude, you had it in your  sock drawer , which means that it was just a matter of time...  But Gary's studio stays locked, and the chilly gulf between us remains as well.

...in my nightmare where I was naked except for my underwear and hose, running violently late for graduation.  This was the stressed-out-dream from hell.  I mean, it took ALL the aspects of the typical stress out dream and put them all together in the  urlLink mixer  and spun them around.  I began in my undies, as I have said.  Undies and hose.  No shoes.  Slip, undies, hose.  That's it.  We are at school, I'm preparing for graduation (obviously not well, since I seem to have forgotten a few things, like CLOTHING), when I discover that I have not picked up my cap and gown.  So I dash across my school campus which seems to have turned into an exceptionally crowded  urlLink flea market .  I obviously have trouble getting through the crowds, as they aren't parting for a crazed woman wearing only underwear.  I finally get to where I'm going, i.e., the Magical Place Where You Pick Up Caps and Gowns In An Anxiety Nightmare.  The booths are set up in such a way that they are alphabetical: A-C goes to this booth, D-E over here, etc.  Unfortunately, this is an alphabet that DOES NOT include the letter K.  I finally get my cap and gown, and turn to run back through the melee that is the flea market my university has turned into.  Poof!  My mom is there - Queen of the Shopping Experience.  "Don't worry, sweetie," she says.  "I'll take you in this cool shop over here, and get you an outfit to wear."    "Whew!" I think in my dream.  "Mom saves the day again!"  We enter the shop, which is blissfully empty.  Until I begin to shop.  Then it is crowded with old women (what is it with old women in my nightmares?  I don't think I'm ageist or anything - although now that I think of it, the African American culture  is  under represented when I dream, as well as the old folks.  Perhaps this is an attempt of my subconscious to integrate.  Hmmm.  Just call my Id " urlLink Jesse The Dumbass Helms ")  Anyway, Mom grabs up this great dress and manages to toss it up in the air and suddenly, poof!  She's dressed!  Fully dressed!  Unlike me, who is still in my undies and hose, now shredded from my sprint across campus/flea market to get my robe.  So I pick up a very, very heavy  urlLink beaded dress .  I become totally distracted by the buttons and beads, to the point that it is suddenly time for me to be in line for graduation, and I am miles away, across campus, holding a beaded dress and somehow I don't even have my pantyhose on any more.    My anxiety level has reached peaks never before known to womankind.

As I am sure everyone on earth and possibly in the solar system knows by now, that stunningly wonderful photo I posted earlier as a hint regarding Gary's birthday was from Bourbon Street.  The surprise was that our best buds, Melanie and Andy (a/k/a Twinkletoes and Handy Andy) were going with Gary and I to NOLA to celebrate Gary's fortysomethingish birthday.  We left Friday night and returned Sunday night.  We were gone at least a month, judging by the rings left on our livers ("Use a coaster!").  As Frog of Frogblog is fond of doing, here is a list of words/sayings that are burning into my brain as a result of our trip, in no particular order (except for the first one):  1.  Friends 2.  Beware of Dog 3.  Sweat 4.  "Where's Gary?" 5.  "You don't  have  to eat all that."  Melanie to Andy, over a plate of ben-yays. 6.  "Don't you think a frozen beverage would be very refreshing right about now?"   7.  "Move the barstool so I can jump down, for the love of God!"  (me to the old drunk at the end of the bar at Coyote Ugly's, after Mel and I were called back for our encore performance) 8.  "Where's the Rat Cellar with the cheap beer?" 9.  "If I got drunk and got a paint brush, I could paint that..." (Andy surveying some...uh, art...in the French Quarter) 10. "There's the refrigerator, we're almost home!" 11. "There's the boxspring, we're almost home!" 12. "AR-AR-AR-AR!" [insert bared fangs here] 13. "I didn't know you could move that fast!"  (Mel to me after I danced away from the  urlLink snarling dog , who looked very  urlLink pettable  only gigaseconds prior) 14. "Isn't my wife beautiful?" (Andy, speaking about Mel) 15. "I love you guys..." (Andy, speaking to me and Gary, through a haze of Bourbon Street Beer) 16. "I think there's something in my thumb."   17. "Don't worry - nobody's paying attention."  (Bartender at Coyote Ugly's, convincing Mel and I to leap onto the bar and dance.  What can I say?  We're gullible) 19. "He went down like the Sta-Puft Marshmellow Man at the end of  Ghostbusters !" 19. "There's a fan here already?" 20. "Can we climb into the cage?" 21. "Nutcatcher!" 22. "You just  left  him there?"  NOLA was great.  We had a total blast.

I've often wondered what it would be like to have a child with someone I love.  I suspect that it must be very much like  urlLink this , or like  urlLink this .  Unfortunately, I never got to experience that.  My son, Christopher, arrived three years into an ill-fated and (already) exceptionally unpleasant marriage.  I still distinctly recall preparing to go to the courthouse to marry Kevin and fastening my flowers into my hair, and thinking to myself, "No way is this going to work."  And it wasn't the flowers I was worried about, either.  I have recently been on a fairly anti-child rant.  My life has been made up of anti-child positions, and anti-child feelings.  My child has brought me more sadness than joy, more dark than light, less heavenly angels wings, more lucifer's short and pointy trident.  I've heard lots and lots (usually from people  other than  recently laboring mothers) that we mothers forget the pain of labor - after all, how is it that the human race would continue, if we women could carry that memory of the pain of labor, the pain of delivery, the mind clenching and eye watering excruciating pain that consists of not moments or hours, even -- but  days  of pain.  I do remember that it hurt.  I do remember that I was scared.  I do remember thinking, "Nope, this is it for me, I'll be taking some drugs now and doc, while you're up there, you wanna fix this babymaker so nothing else pops up?  There's a good chap, now where's the anesthesiologist?"  But the pain I'm thinking of now doesn't come from the laboring, the delivery or even the nipples that crack and bleed from feeding the new person every two hours on the hour, 2am, 4 am, 6 am, no let up.   The nights when you jolt awake to see a small face at your bedside, saying that gosh, their stomach really - BLARG - up appears dinner all over your bed and your nightgown.  Nope, that stuff is the easy stuff.   It's when their rooms are empty, the dog is moping and your grocery bill drops that the really hard part starts.  "Things are going well, there, then?" you ask, and it sounds as if things really  are  going well, and this really  is  for the best, and after all, that really is what you want for your child.  That's what all good parents want for their child, why we put all the cleaners in a high away cabinet, and use the best carseat we can, and put them into Boy Scouts, and band, and get a tutor when the grades go south.  "Of course I'm happy that you're happy, son..." and you really mean it, too, of course you mean it.  "Sure, I'll send your computer on, then, and the rest of your things, too..."

Just in case you're lurking out there, Gary, this is another hint:  GAMBLING.  Now everyone, step away and allow Gary to process the above hint.  If you smell smoke, hear wheels turning or see a lightbulb going off over his head, do not be alarmed.  Although if you see a lightbulb, I would be surprised.  Bwhahaha.  I'm so evil.

 urlLink    I am considering sending this picture to Gary as a hint for his (now very late) birthday present.  &nbsp; urlLink     Gary's gift for my birthday was shrouded in secrecy, and turned out to be quite cool.  I knew I had to act.  So I came up with a plan (which I will spill in alarming detail later, after this weekend, which is when it all takes place), and I figured that I ought to do the same thing for Gary that he did for me:  give hints.    Gary gives really bad hints.  Well, they're GREAT hints if you already know what the answer is.  So I am doing the same - and this is one of those hints.  Rather than send it to him, I'll just leave it here, and see how long it takes him to mention it.  Honest to God, if you knew what the gift was, this picture would make PERFECT sense.

Okay, I give.  I totally have lost the bubbles in my header or whatever that is up above, and I did it myself.    Note to self:   You do not know HTML.  Do not pretend that you do.   Love, Your Nonmetatagging self.  Dammit.    I was trying to figure out the whole RSS feed stuff and have now made my blog not only starving for any sort of RSS, but also it is now sans bubbles.    I would make one terrible programmer.    To further exacerbate my disgust with my current physical surroundings (in keeping with my disgust for my internet surroundings - namely my blog, see above), my very short and very cute tree in the back yard that my father gave me from one of  urlLink those  catalogs is apparently now The Love Shack for all the Japanese beetles in the neighborhood.  It's a  urlLink fruit cocktail tree  and none of the catalogs show it in picture form...only in drawing form, which leads me to think that perhaps none of them make it to adulthood or something...they don't live long enough to be photographed in any form other than sticks, maybe?  Anyway, I discovered the new purpose of my tree (Hang Out for Beetles with One Thing on Their Beetly Mind) when I glanced at the tree and saw a few plums turning a nice shade of purple out there.  At the rate that tree and the beetles are going, I can only figure that getting their mack on makes for a really hungry beetle.  Oh, and there's one voyeur wasp out there, hanging onto the one overripe plum, smoking a cigarette and taking pictures.  Perv.

As a natural extension of Frog's meme of the other day, I began thinking of what exactly my room in heaven would look like, should I be fortunate enough to be consulted as to my rooming situation upon my arrival.  If said arrival takes place, that is.  I thought about this today especially while I was walking along the wonderful greenway we have here in town - which I have totally and completely ignored for the 8 or so years I have lived here.  (This is in keeping with the theme I seem to have developed regarding my discovery of many excellent groups, organizations and possibilities on campus - right before my graduation.  I fully expect to strike oil in the back yard immediately after closing on the sale of the house.)  My room in heaven would have lots of windows.  Clean windows.  Windows that have fluffy, white curtains in them, which flutter when the pleasant warm breezes float through the window.  Breezes without dust, pollen or any sort of dander in them, that is.  My TV would get educational TV, a movie channel that played whatever movie I wanted to see at that very moment, and I would have my kettle on a ring that Mom gave me, along with all the tea I could guzzle.  Of course, I would also have my Sims.  My room is in a beautiful house, with hardwood floors and all my pets from days gone by.  My house is in a town (yes, I'm branching out from a description of my room into a larger social construct.  It's my blog.  I can do that.) and the town has no dirt or pollution.  All the cars are electric, and garbage just disappears into thin air (if I weren't describing heaven, but instead what the world would be like if I were Queen, I would say that all the garbage generated wound up on a certain ranch in Crawford, but...that's not the sort of thinking that the Engineers of heaven really encourage, now is it?)  Anyway, everyone in the town has homes that equate to their vision of what their home/room in heaven would look like, so no cookie cutter, tract house sort of town is this - and particularly nothing like  urlLink this .  There would be lots of bikes, which would never have to be locked up (it's heaven, remember?) and we could leave our windows open, too.  There would also be a ginormous school, where anyone could wander into any lecture that struck their fancy.  No tests, of course.  Just learning for the joy of learning.  On the campus would be a computer lab, where you could access the internet (with none of the distracting, unpleasantness of our internet, either - no spam, pron or promises to enlarge various body parts).  The internet in heaven would be the way in which we would be able to answer all the annoying questions we encountered in life:  Where, exactly, did I lose my high school ring?  Who really shot JFK?  Why do Corgis shed so much?  Is there life on other planets?  What are the lyrics to "Louie Louie"?    There would be a library containing every book ever written, and also every book ever conceived of, even if not written.  If you wanted music, it would be equally accessible.  And obviously, not broadcast by Clear Channel...that's what plays in The Other Place.  Everyone would have a job, because just sitting around is not a whole lot of fun - at least not for me.  But the jobs that we would have would, of course, be our dream jobs.  If we chose to do volunteer work, we could venture back to Earth to help out those who need it.  So I could leave my job at the library, reshelving all the books I've been reading, and go pick up my grandma at her job in the nursery/day care, where she takes care of all the kids yet to be born, and we could go have lunch in the cafeteria, where she could put real sugar into her coffee, since she wouldn't be diabetic anymore. (Again, were I describing Queen Laura's World, I would say that I could plow through the dessert area of the cafeteria, while keeping my size 6 body in perfect shape.  However, as gluttony is one of Those Sins, I will restrain myself.)  Fresh fruit and vegetables would always be in season, and if desired, residents could plant their own gardens.  Any sweat worked up in relation to work would be immediately cooled by fresh breezes (again, sans the pollen, etc.) and all drinking water would be icy cold.    When night fell, all the stars would be perfectly bright, and all the beds would be wonderfully fluffy.  So - what's your room/house/town in Heaven look like?

What would your room in hell look like?  My room in hell would have no windows.  It would have no books.  No plants, either.  There would be a TV playing only Jim Bakker, Pat Robertson, etc. with the occasional Disney kids show in for variety.  The room would be filled - every possible spot covered - with little tchotchkes and those annoying antimacassars little old ladies seem to insist on putting on chairs.  There would be no dogs, no cats, no critters.  There would be no bathtub, only a shower.  The room would also be used for an unending Republican National Convention, at which many rousing Republican speeches would be made about the dangers of gay marriage and the importance of Dubya's tax cuts.  The sofa would be the really, really ugly one with the bad karma that I gave away to Goodwill when I got divorced.  The floor would be covered with the ratty, rust colored old carpet that was in the house I lived in right before I got divorced.  That was some ugly carpet.  As carpet goes, that carpet won the ugly prize.  There would be no computer, thus I could not keep up with  urlLink Frogblog , where I got this meme from in the first place.    Yup, hell would definitely suck.

It's therefore unadvisable to sit next to me at either a Weight Watchers meeting or at the boo-fay.

I had no idea that Coke had carbs, thereby requiring that the Coke company come out with a new low carb,  urlLink sorta diet drink , allowing them to jump onto the Low Carb Bandwagon.  Upon said bandwagon, all riders are allotted all the bacon, steak and lobster dipped in drawn butter that they can tolerate.  Should a bagel be ingested, one can expect to be immediately kicked to the curb.    The  urlLink photos  from our trip to Texas were the last straw, causing me to renew my addiction to Weight Watchers.  I am now charting everything I eat.  Unless, of course, it is beer, an appetizer, or more points than I care to consider.  Something tells me that approach might not work.

Apparently, I need a shave:   urlLink   Harry Potter Personality Quiz  by  urlLink Pirate Monkeys Inc.   Via  urlLink Grace , who was lucky enough to be Hermione.  (I wanted to be Hermione.  It looks like she seriously kicks ass in this new HP flick.)  As usual, I'm really quick on the uptake...Apparently there's something in the Blogosphere where bloggers post similar question/answer thingamabobs on their website - called "Mememe"s?  Do I have this right?  Sometimes, I feel like I am channeling my grandmother.

 urlLink This  is the guy the Republicans want on the $10 or $20 bill?  Forget the ketchup.  This guy was not worthy of the empty boots, the horse named Sgt. York or the caisson that bore Kennedy to his resting spot.  And if the republicans try to put a flame or some such on his grave, it is my distinct hope that someone with AIDS goes and pees on it.

 urlLink AlterNet: 66 (Unflattering) Things About Ronald Reagan   I hate to flog a dead president, but I really am getting sick and tired of all the carrying on about Regan.  Oddly enough, I was not interested in politics as much as I am now when Regan was president.  I say oddly, because I was married to a soldier, so one would think that at that time, I would be more into that sort of thing.  Head in the sand, and all that, I guess.  I do, however, remember some of the things discussed in the Alternet article.  Ketchup as a vegetable?  Hello?  Were they serious?  Yes.   They were.  Just as serious as they were about becoming homeless by choice.  What total, unbelievable crap.  Is that really how your thinking changes if you become rich and powerful?  Or is it that the thinking of the rich and powerful is that fucked up from birth?    And really, really, really - how in the world could we have someone in the Oval Office who referred to his wife as MOMMY?  I'm sorry, that's just downright strange.    My memories of the regan years are not that hot.  I do remember watching a State of the Union address while largely, hugely, enormously pregnant with Chris, and continuing to be terrified over the type of world that I was bringing a child into - the concept of nuclear war was so much more at the forefront of my mind at that time...I guess as it was for most people, thanks again to Ronnie.  So the flags at half mast do nothing for me, because I'm not mourning.  I might be mourning the thought that anyone (even a Republican) has to die from as terrible a disease as Alzheimer's, but I'm certainly not mourning Regan.  He was a bad man.  Anyone who would leave a legacy that included the terms, "voodoo economics" and "constructive engagement with apartheid South Africa..."  can't be considered good.  I don't care how much he liked jelly beans, he was not a good man.

 urlLink    This, my friends, is Jak.  Our family consists of me (LAK), Gary (GAK) and our Corgi, who owns us, JAK.  While Jak is smarter than your average dog, he is also more neurotic.  He is frightened of (in no particular order) various toys, the garbage truck, spray cans, larger dogs, smaller dogs, louder dogs, trucks of any sort, and, most famously, fireworks, which have, in the past, caused him to spontaneously poop.&nbsp; urlLink

No really.  Stop laughing.  It's true.  I've overdosed on books.  Yes, me.  The girl whose mother finally said, "I hate buying books for you for gifts because you read them before you can get them unwrapped!"  I have gone to the sorry-assed excuse for a library this county has, then gone to BAM and splurged on myself, then received a gift card from a couple of wonderful friends, which of course required me to go and purchase MORE BOOKS!  Oh, and I even bought myself one of those little lipsticks at the counter too.  Yes, I bought lipstick at Books-A-Million.  How weird is that?  But anyway.  I've too many books on hand at once.  This is just proving to be a TERRIBLE distraction to me.  I'm attempting to type for Dr. Martin (the wonderful plastic surgeon that I inherited from Carmen, she of the BAM gift card) but I just keep thinking about ALL THESE BOOKS in my house that I have not yet read!  It's like taking an alcoholic to a bar and telling him that he can't have a drink until he gets all the glasses clean.    I'm beginning to twitch.  With my giftcard from my two stupendous friends, I finally got  The Mommy Myth , suggested by Flea, and I'm having trouble putting that one down for the terribly timed and appallingly trashy true crime Ann Rule novel based in a very large state to our south, which I won't name here...(coughtexascough)...which I am currently gobbling up for it's absolutely wonderful LACK OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL.   But I'm telling myself that I simply will not succumb, that I will wait to hit the tub with my bubble bath, book and chilled fruit flavored bottled water until I have done some work.  At this rate, Dr. Martin will be performing surgery from the nursing home in which we have all been ensconced before I manage to get to my books.    This just won't do.  But I'm pretty tickled none the less.  I have (finally) a silent house.  My dog is even being quiet.  This is especially wonderful in light of the fact that Bruce and Crystal were over tonight, and Bruce was ON.  He was channeling A Cavalcade of Stars - from Ahnold (we just call him the Gropenator, like Doonesbury does) to Beetlejuice (that one's referred to as BeetleBruce) to Gollum, Hannibal Lecter, Chris Farley and the Pinnochio voice from Shrek.  Bruce is probably one of the most entertaining kids I know - he had me in tears with laughter listening to him.  Physically and personality-wise he totally reminds me of a large lab puppy.  He lopes, he flips, he entertains - at his own physical expense sometimes - and he just seems so good natured.  Fortunately, he does not pee on the rug...but I'll bet that if given the opportunity, he'd dig the hell out of the back yard.  Anyway, my deep contentment also comes from the fact that I discovered (after a little searching)  urlLink a website  that streams various radio stations...all types of stuff.  Including a female artists only station.  How Fucking Cool is that???    I'm easily amused.

I got this courtesy of  urlLink Grace , whose blog I read EVERY SINGLE DAY.  I took it while I was avoiding working on my typing for Dr. Martin...

I saw a shirt I simply HAD TO have ( urlLink "Keep Austin Weird." ).  Austin really rocks.  Unfortunately, we couldn't stay very long, and had to head back to Tennessee without doing much more than driving around the city a bit and drinking some beer.  But the place was really great - I wouldn't mind living there sometime in the future.  I'm still sorting my thoughts on the trip - it's hard to do when dashing about trying to get all the dirty clothes washed up, unpacking, then catching up on undone work.  Or, in my case, avoiding undone work and obsessively reading Grace's blog, and Flea's blog.

I've been hearing a lot about hope recently - and having my own little flashes of same.&nbsp; Over the past three weeks or so, I've been trying to take better care of myself, trying to establish better habits with regards to my eating, sleeping and exercise.&nbsp; I've discovered the wonder that is REM sleep, which is a wonder indeed.&nbsp; I've found how pleasant and important it is to get my blood moving in the mornings.&nbsp; Murfreesboro has the greatest greenway park ever, and I love it.&nbsp; I load up my MP3 player and start hoofing it.&nbsp; It's great.&nbsp; My mind can wander as far from the path as it likes, and frequently does.&nbsp; But because apparently the trails are well marked, it always finds its way back.  I'm going to NC this week to visit with Mom, and my sister and my dad.&nbsp; And Chris and the kids too, of course.&nbsp; There's more to this visit than just "Hey!&nbsp; Howyadooin?" It might be awhile, for obvious reasons, before I get back there.&nbsp; I didn't get to see Mom or Judy at graduation, so the original reason for my visit was to spend time with them.&nbsp; Now, there's more - Dad and Susan...Dad wants me to meet Susan, and the two girls.&nbsp; Apparently, wedding bells might be in the future, and Dad wants my input.&nbsp;   I want my dad to be happy, and I had hoped that both he and mom would have remarried by now (although I never entertained any of those soggy, supersweet Disney type fantasies that they would get back together.&nbsp; I think I was just a wee bit too smart for that one).&nbsp; I think Mom will probably stay single, just because that's the life she wants.&nbsp; Which I totally support, and can't say that I blame her.&nbsp; She once told me that the less people you have in your life, the less complications there are.&nbsp; Totally true.&nbsp; Sort of depressing, but true.&nbsp; Mom's village is pretty small...just her friends from work, and my sister and her kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; I worry about Mom.&nbsp; I wish I lived closer.  But I worry about Dad too.&nbsp; It freaks me out that he's going to place so much importance on what I say, and don't say, about Susan.&nbsp; Um...hello?&nbsp; I'm not exactly Dr. Phil here, or even Dr. Phil's janitor.&nbsp; While I did really, really well in choosing the SECOND time, that came later in life for me, and the first time was pretty much a waltz through hell to polka music.&nbsp; So what in the world might I have to offer in terms of input?&nbsp;   Of course, I could just plan to go to a lot of movies with Chris, and to the beach, and totally avoid the whole thing.&nbsp; But that would be wrong.&nbsp; And let's not forget one very important aspect of how my dad deals with me (and others, probably):&nbsp; when I talk to him, sometimes I think all he hears is "blah,blah,blah..."&nbsp; I swear the man does not listen to me at all sometimes.&nbsp; It's the most frustrating experience of my life.&nbsp; Gary tells me to be more direct, which sends me TOTALLY over the edge into fury.&nbsp; It's not that I'm being indirect - I'm being as concise and to the point as I can possibly be.&nbsp; If I was any more blunt, some kid would be smoking me behind the high school.&nbsp; He just doesn't listen to me, or else when he does, he immediately forgets what I've said.&nbsp; It could be either.&nbsp; That being said, I don't know why this whole, "I want your input on Susan" thing is freaking me out.&nbsp;   So now I'm going back and forth between being excited about my trip, and regreting that I'm going...which is how I get for all my trips to NC.&nbsp; When Gary and I went to TX, at one point he asked me, "You just don't travel well, do you?"&nbsp; This was after I spent an evening in the bathroom, suffering from...well, let's just say that I was suffering.&nbsp; He smugly thinks it's that I was stressing out from all the upcoming changes in our lives.&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; It was those damned Whataburger onion rings.  And stressing out about all those upcoming changes.&nbsp;

Yes, ladies and gentlemen (all 2 of you who read my blog - heh), I really must be up for the stupidest person on the planet award.&nbsp; How else could this charming situation have come about, I ask you:  (I will make this as brief, yet compelling, as possible.&nbsp; Good luck to me)  Chris has become the poster boy for the use of contraceptives.&nbsp; He is recruiting for Satan's Workshop.&nbsp; He has done everything in his power to be as unpleasant and obnoxious and wholly unliveable to me, Gary, and to Chris' other parents (you know, the ones Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels did the movie about?).&nbsp; Chris stole, he used drugs and alcohol, he brought girls into our house while we were gone - and while we were home, getting ready for work (!!) - and in general, did everything that was possible to piss off everyone around him.&nbsp; Well, everyone except his homies and his supplier, that is.&nbsp;   So.&nbsp; After casting enough gasoline and petrolium products to satisfy even Dubya's Desire for Oil Supremacy all over the bridge that is Me and Gary, Chris was summarily booted from our home.&nbsp; He "decided" to go and live with my dad, even though once Chris was gone, I could not understand what had possessed me to think that allowing him to return here after his failed foray to his dad's house, was a good idea.&nbsp; I mean REALLY.&nbsp; What was I thinking?&nbsp; Do we not learn?&nbsp; Had I not scalded my hand on that stove plenty of times?&nbsp; Well, all I can say is that I had hopes for him to do well here - hopes that Chris took great joy in stomping on, dragging through the mud, and using as rolling paper for his latest purchase of California Red.&nbsp; Chris decided to stay on with Dad, and that worried me.&nbsp; I have posted about this in the past, and I will suffice it to say that I was more worried about my dad than I was Chris.&nbsp; Mom set me straight on that, and gave mad props to my dad for being skilled in dealing with just this sort of kid.&nbsp; For my mother to give props of any sort (other than the one that the big bald guy gets in the first Indiana Jones movie, that is) to my father is nothing sort of a miracle.&nbsp; But Mother speaks the truth.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; My feelings that this was the best move possible for Chris grew with each positive report that we got from my dad.  Of course, as much as kids everywhere bemoan this fact, summer does NOT last all year round.&nbsp; We must return our little snot encrusted hellions back to the annals of public education with the advent of August.&nbsp; This might come a shock to you (it apparently does to my exhusband) but it is impossible to register said SELH in school unless you are (say it with me, class) a parent or guardian.&nbsp; As Dad counts not as parent, but could possibly be considered guardian material, I drew up an agreement that everyone could live with for the remaining mere NINE MONTHS that we are discussing.&nbsp; Jeezus - I'll still be writing this concise and pithy post before Chris turns 18...I signed it.&nbsp; Dad signed it.&nbsp; Kevin (purportedly) signed it and then was to take it to the courthouse there in Lincolnton to file it in the still-existing case regarding Chris.&nbsp; The logic behind this approach was that we would do this so that Dad wouldn't have to hire an attorney, file suit against me and Kevin, and take longer than Chris was going to remain a minor to settle this.&nbsp; And this is where my blood pressure shoots off the charts.  I received this email today...and my eyes bugged out of my head:   Hi, I tried to file the agreement at the Lincoln County courthouse but they would not do it here because he will be living in Elizabeth City. It must be filed there. I have put all copies in the mail to Reed and also a copy of the insurance card. I do not have a computer right now so if you need anything please call us.  Thanks.    &nbsp; This ranks right up there with Pam claiming that she couldn't ship Crystal's meds to us in the mail, because it was illegal.&nbsp;  Is there something about me that makes people feel like I am willing to just SWALLOW ANY LIE THEY WANT TO TELL ME?&nbsp;  I might have spent roughly ten years listening to (and buying, hook line plus sinker, for what it's worth) everything Kevin told me, but that doesn't mean that somewhere along the line I didn't grow a brain.&nbsp; For instance, if you told me, while I was pregnant and appallingly faithful that I had given  myself  an STD, likely as not I would probably find that pretty hard to buy...NOW.&nbsp;   I buy this crap from NC about as much.

How do you keep from hating someone?&nbsp; Hate is a dangerous, sick emotion.&nbsp; It is not an emotion that I am particularly happy feeling.&nbsp; I much prefer my usual state of being - i.e., happy, positive, upbeat...if rather scattered.&nbsp; I'm not, by nature, a hater. &nbsp; There is someone on the fringes of my life for whom I feel the most distinct, incredible, strongest, foulest hatred possible for womankind to feel for another human being.&nbsp; As much as this person has done to hurt me and the people I love and care for, I don't want to rain hatred and vitrol down upon them.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So just how do you lose your hatred?&nbsp; And trust me, this is justified hatred.&nbsp; This is not, "She got the last copy of the new Stephen King book at the bookstore."&nbsp; Nor is it, "He took the last beer after I mowed the grass."&nbsp; This is a feeling that has been growing for a long time in me, like a cancer, or a mold, and at times has threatened to choke off my ability to speak, or write, or communicate in any form...I recognize the danger and wrongness of my feelings, but I don't seem to be able to do anything about them.&nbsp;  &nbsp; But I have to say, that if this person were a slug, I would happily pull out the salt and let it flow.&nbsp;

My life would be lived completely in mono versus stereo were it not for my multi-talented, incredible husband.  Thank you for fixing my speakers on my pc - The Indigo Girls are ROCKIN' now!  I cannot even begin to go into the marvelous, exciting, wonderful, incredible weekend I had.  Seriously.  This is what I did:  I did NOT work.  Yet I did.  I cleaned up, organized, and prepared.  I worked hard.  But it wasn't really work.  It was bliss.    I organized my kitchen.  We listed a bunch of crap on Ebay (some of said crap is now in the custody of the USPS, on its way to its new homes, where it will not be considered to be crap).  I cleaned the guest bath (used to be Chris' bathroom, therefore, it was filthy to the point of mimicking a gas station bathroom.  It's bad when you don't even want to sit on the seat of the toilet in your own HOME).  Gary and I spent a few hours going over our budget and deciding how to go about achieving that which we want.  I enjoyed breakfast at my table in my kitchen without intrusion from an obnoxious child.  I enjoyed dinner with my husband in the same circumstances.  Those things that occurred during the day and the evening were all things we planned.    Life without children is bliss.    Crystal and Bruce aren't even around.  They're busy entertaining the woman who crawled out of Satan's ass, so we won't be hearing from them (barring any sort of unpleasantness that might erupt between them and their ass crawling houseguest).    Bliss, I tell you.  Bliss.

It's been a while since I wrote anything - while I could chalk that up to busybusybusy life as usual, or lack of anything profound to say, or any other manner of things - all of which would be untrue - I guess the closest to true would just be the statement that so much is going on, my brain is overwhelmed.    I had so much fun in NOLA with my friends.  It was great.  Gary and I tend to live a very secluded life, out here in the 'burbs, and don't have much contact with people other than those we work with (and I work at home, so my contact is limited to a non-verbal Corgi) and of course, the kids.  While time with Crystal and Bruce is excellently spent, it can also become a bit much at times, with the style of conversation that they have between each other: ("Bruce!  It's time to go! [Bruce tickles/pokes/picks up or otherwise annoys Crystal] "Ow!  Bruce!  That hurt!  Come on!  Let's go!" [Cycle continues until Bruce gets tired and falls asleep on the sofa]).  So Gary and I were way overdue for a fun weekend, and a weekend with adult friends, at that.  Friends that we didn't have to caretake for, or be on the alert for an opportunity to insert the admonition to please, for the lovea bob, take your birth control pill every day, please!    It was great to be with Mel and Andy, people we have spent a lot of time with over so many years.  I should endeavor to remember the importance of having friends around.  Laughter is so important, and so undervalued in our lives.  My friends recharge my batteries.  I came back from NOLA exhausted, but excited about what was in front of me.  The work I am doing to get into grad school suddenly fell into a nice, neat orderly plan.  I guess while the front part of my brain was engaged in the Avoiding The  urlLink Pissed Off Doggies  On Bourbon Street Dance, the back part of my brain was creating a numbered list, writing emails, and beginning applications.

During the time I was out of town, the following occurred - we should probably just refer to this week as "The Attack of the Insane Exes, or If You Own a Pet Rabbit, Hide the Large Cooking Pans":    Gary had to call the cops to come out and look at the second incidence of vandalism we've had at our house.  Apparently Keisha, the crazy-assed ex girlfriend of Chris has a personal vendetta against our dryer vent.  She pulled off the cover, yanked out the hose and drug the whole shootin' match into the street, trailing dust bunnies and lint all the way.  Our  urlLink attorney in Houston  called.  This is never a good thing.   Apparently, the Attorney General's office still believes that we owe money to Pam.  During a lull in our lives earlier (that's flaming sarcasm) I sat down and watched The War In Iraq, (sponsored by Faux News and Halliburton), and figured as long as I was upset I might as well do some homework on the whole child support issue that just WILL NOT DIE.  We had been getting notices from the AG's office that Pam had notified them that she had moved, and that our case was still active.  You can understand my confusion, as the alleged child in question was (a) over 18, (b) living with us and (c) in the process of getting married.  Apparently facts such as that make no nevermind to those in Texas.  So I sat down and listened to Wolf Blitzer, cried over the war, and cried over the ongoing, neverending war waging between Us and Them, Good Versus Evil, Pam and the Government of Texas versus me and Gary.  I pulled out all our financial paperwork:  taxes, bank statements, cancelled checks, paystubs.  Everything.  We have learned the hard way, and we keep EVERYTHING now.  I made copies, and I sent them to the attorney.  I took the proof (i.e., our bankers boxes of stuff) and charted out on calendars (years of calendars) how much we were due to pay during various months, how much we paid, how much we were over or under.  I included court orders.  I included tax returns that we let the IRS intercept.  Ultimately, it came out that Pam owes us $550 roughly.  Consider it a gift.  Just leave us the fuck alone.  So, you can see why the phone call from Jeryl sent me into the stratosphere.  Here we are, recently having weathered a scare that we might be GRANDPARENTS for fuck's sake, and someone in Texas is still trying to squeeze money out of us, money that will only go to pay for Pam's recreational vehicle (she purchased this $22,000 camper so that she could take trips and not have to leave her dogs) or for something similar.    It was not a pleasant day, that day.  As it turned out, Gary finally reached Jeryl, and found that she was just calling to let us know that she had FINALLY gotten an appointment with those assclowns at the AG's office.  She has apparently been calling them and harrassing them to leave us alone to the point that she's been told, "Stop calling us."  Her response, apparently, was "Stop dunning my clients."  She's doing all this for no charge.  She's a saint.   And all this is going on while I am a state away.  It's a miracle that I had any fingernails left for the manicure that Mom treated me to.    I am tired of the high road.  I am tired of getting the shaft.  I am TIRED of being someone else's source of income, when we don't even have HEALTH INSURANCE.  I am sick to death of thinking of others first.  I want to be a Republican, and think only of myself and my own bottom dollar.  I want to be selfish.  I want to view the world differently.  But I can't.

Never thought I would profess love for a Regan, but Ron Jr. has really made my day:   And chances are your America and George W. Bush's America are not the same place. If you are dead center on the earning scale in real-world twenty-first-century America, you make a bit less than $32,000 a year, and $32,000 is not a sum that Mr. Bush has ever associated with getting by in his world. Bush, who has always managed to fail upwards in his various careers, has never had a job the way you have a job—where not showing up one morning gets you fired, costing you your health benefits. He may find it difficult to relate personally to any of the nearly two million citizens who've lost their jobs under his administration, the first administration since Herbert Hoover's to post a net loss of jobs. Mr. Bush has never had to worry that he couldn't afford the best available health care for his children. For him, forty-three million people without health insurance may be no more than a politically inconvenient abstraction. When Mr. Bush talks about the economy, he is not talking about your economy. His economy is filled with pals called Kenny-boy who fly around in their own airplanes. In Bush's economy, his world, friends relocate offshore to avoid paying taxes.  Taxes are for chumps like you. You are not a friend. You're the help.  When the party Mr. Bush is hosting in his world ends, you'll be left picking shrimp toast out of the carpet.      (Emphasis mine, sayeth the Blogger).  Read the whole thing  urlLink here .  This is the sort of thing that my brother-in-law, who has never voted, needs to read.

 urlLink This  is really interesting...all the broken promises found in one place.  While I understand that no politician really expects to keep all the promises they make on the campaign trail, I don't understand why it is necessary that those who have the least must give the most.  Take Crystal and Bruce for example.  They're far from rich, far from well off.  They have no insurance.  Their only savings is money which has come from her school loans.  They don't live large, by any stretch of the imagination.  Crystal can't get a Pell grant this year.  They make too much money at their high paying jobs:  waiter at a mexican restaurant and sandwich artiste at Bellacino's.  How is this good?  How is this right?  Oh, wait, I forgot.  IT'S NOT.

I'm such a geek.  Leave it to me - my mom gives me her car, her credit card and $20 for gas.  Where do I go?  THE LIBRARY.  To write in my blog.  Jeez.  Well, that and to see if Flea is up and running again.   We had planned to go to my dad's to visit, and to meet the significant other in his life, and I obviously (see below) had mixed feelings about the whole thing.  Unfortunately for Judy, and rather fortunately for me, Judy got a stomach bug and we didn't go.  What that meant for me was that am now hanging around with absolutely NOTHING to do other than to tease Mom's cats (Max and Ruby) with the laser pointer, go on long, sweaty walks in my new running shoes, and watch my recently painted nails glisten in the sunlight.  I'm having a lot of fun, even if I am homesick.  And I am.  Homesick, I mean.  What's up with that?  Apparently, the length of time I can be away from home has shortened now to approximately 4 days.  Left Saturday and by Wednesday (um...today) I'm ready to go home.  Happned at the beach too.  The BEACH, for the love of God.  I just wish that Gary would go with me when I travel.  He's never been here.  He knows my folks, but has never visited where I grew up.   If Judy and the kids are feeling up to it (and I suspect that they will be) we might all go to the  urlLink Wet and Wild water park  on Friday.  Woohoo!  That's going to be a blast.  Claira is a real fish, and so is Tyler.  They take after me in that respect.   We went to Judy's house for dinner and celebration of Lammas (I think that's right, but I'm not 100% sure) which is a pagan/wiccan/notsureaboutthateither holiday celebrating the first harvest.  I think.   All I know is that we grilled out, baked bread (mmmm....yummy carbs!) and I jumped on the trampoline with the kids.  Before eating all the bread, that is.  Certainly not after.  Glurg.  Then after dinner we sculpted (I use the term loosely) some things with clay.  I made a purse (got quite a hoo ha out of that one, let me tell you) and then I made a nest with a little bird in it.  Yes, I'm quite the artiste.   Hm.  We'll see about that.  Tiffany is going to take them and fire them, and no telling where mine will wind up.  Possibly as an ash tray.  Not sure.   I've been thinking/worrying/etc. about Chris a lot.  And I really have mixed emotions about Charlotte.  Being able to do a lot of nothing can be nice, but it also can leave one with plenty of time to get the total jeebs.  Perhaps I'd best go to the mall and shop.
