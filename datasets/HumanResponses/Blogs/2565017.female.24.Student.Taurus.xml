       urlLink Visit Finland   This piece is not literally of the planet Mars and the life there may or may not be. By Mars I mean a figure of speech, any place that we know exists but we don't know it very well.... in this case, I'm going to make Finland less of a Mars to you.  Let's clear up a few clichés to begin with.... 1) Finland is no situated in the Arctic or the Antarctic 2) Therefore, we do not live in small no-electricity huts with polar bears walking in our streets. 3) The official home of Father Christmas / Santa Claus is Finland. 4) Nokia is (or was, now the actual owners are mostly foreign) a Finnish company, not Japanese. 4) As I had to tell a pen pal in USA a few years back: Finland isn't a part of England, somewhere near Scotland.  But those were only the stuff that is common knowledge, except to the majority of USA citizens. No offence intended.  I'm going to by category, sort of, the first one was the clichés, apparently...   urlLink Cities   The most well known city to those who know little of Finland is our capital Helsinki. I have to be really lame now, and confess that I don’t know much about Helsinki and I’ve only visited there properly once. A few other cities (or towns they might be if you think world-scale) are more familiar to me.  Well, the town I’ve lived close by for the most of my life is Turku, which is situated in the south-eastern coast, east from Helsinki. Turku Archipelago is very famous and I’m fortunate to have lived right inside it, in a small village, on a small island right next to mainland. Turku is a very nice town with a river crossing through it. Lots of student life there, because of the University and the few collages and many high schools. As any city in Finland, it is at its prime at summer.   urlLink Pics of Turku    urlLink Pics of my childhood village . That's how the Turku Archipelago looks like.  Then there’s a lovely, a lot smaller town Kajaani, in the northern Finland. I studied business and administration there for 2 years before I decided to change my field of studying. It’s a very nice small town too, with a lot of park area, a river, a big lake and rural area and forests surrounding it.    urlLink Pics of Kajaani   And finally, my current place of residence, Savonlinna, which is situated a little bit to east from Mikkeli. (You’re able to spot Mikkeli in the map of Finland, which was linked earlier in this entry) Savonlinna, like most, if not all, towns in Finland is closely tied with nature. It’s situated in eastern Finland, by the biggest lake in the country. Very beautiful place, I’ve liked it here very much, although the night life isn’t so great, but what the heck, I’m getting so old already... hah =)   urlLink Pics of Savonlinna   Last but not least I have to mention Tampere, a town in middle Finland about 2 hours drive from Helsinki or Turku. I don’t know the town very well, but I’ve visited the fun fair there since a little kid, every summer. It’s a total MUST!!!  Here’s the urlLink  link .  Seasons:  As you might, or might not know, Finland changes throughout the year with the 4 seasons that we have. Summer, autumn, winter and spring.  Traditionally calculated, each season would last 3 months each but the way people see it here, winter and summer are about equally long, but spring seems to be very short, whereas the autumn is longer. Maybe the expectation of summer and increasing sunlight makes the spring feel shorter, and the memories of summer and the winter ahead make autumn seem long and dark.  Something like this: Summer: June-August Fall: September-December Winter: January-March Spring: April-May  The funny thing is, that most people (foreigners) think that December is the big winter month, but at least southern Finland often lacks snow, and the coldest and snowiest winter is usually at January and February.  Also the strangest things happen here when seasons change. Let’s start with midsummer. Midsummer (which is around from June 20 to June 30, it varies yearly: in 2004 it’s June 26th) is the time of year when the day is longest and the night is shortest. The expression goes 'night of no night' and it means that in northern Finland the sun doesn’t go down at all, and even in southern Finland it doesn’t get dark, only a little dusky. But from that day on the days start to shorten, and closer to winter they’re pretty short, not much daylight except late in the morning and early in the afternoon. A little before Christmas, usually at December 22nd, the length of day is controversy to midsummer. The day is at its shortest, and daylight lasts only for a few hours. And from that day onwards, the days start to get gradually longer, a few minutes per day.  The last (short) part of this entry is about the national treasures, so to say, which in Finland most people consider to be our vast, untouched forests and our numerous unpolluted and deep blue lakes, so nature, in general. At winter, if we’re lucky, we also get the phenomenon of aurora borealis in northern and sometimes even in southern Finland. (they do show in other countries too!)  I just read up on that right now, and it seems that one can check the weather in space online to predict when and where it’s going to take place. But the best place for viewing is definitely away from city lights, in the countryside, in as dark place as possible. Town lights, I’ve noticed, makes you have to guess if it’s it or if it’s not it, especially if the aurora borealis is weak or mostly white. But they’re truly breathtaking when you really see them!  Here's a link to  urlLink  Aurora Borealis pics .  Any questions? Ask in my 'comments' =D

      Finns are a crazy nation for lottery. The idea of getting rich without lifting a finger over night is irresistable to most people. And the relationship between easy money and earned money seems to be very complicated. I can't even remember the times I haven't read tabloids about how winning a lottery ruined someone's life: preassure of spending the money became heavier, jealousy among friends and family became unbearable, the good life suddenly turned into bad. If you had money, why to keep your job and not give it to someone who needed it more? Why not turn into a slob, and overly giving and used person because you happened to beat the odds of winning, randomly?  Thinking what too much money would bring makes you wonder if you want to get all the cons that come with the pros. I sometimes buy a lottery ticket, if my small studentaid money from the government allows to be stretched even that little. I never win. Anything at all. I often dream what I would do with the money if I won. So do most finns. Most people, including me, probably wouldn't even want to win the jackpot. Just some, so they didn't have to struggle so much and count every penny to make ends meet, or to improve their life just a little. And I'm the first to admit that there are many other people even in our so called welfare country who would need the money much more desperately than I do.  So why is the idea of money, especially a lot of money, so controversial? It's adored and desired and appreciated, but at the same no one really wants it... or admits to wanting it. The answer to that, I believe, is as complex as human mind and thinking altogether.  What comes to me.... I want to keep dreaming.... "what would I do if someday...."  Getting what I want, would destroy the joy of dreaming and a hope of the better.

      Hmm, ok, this may sound extremely strange coming from me (people who know me know that I'm in a very close symbiotic relationship with computers... basically attached to the net from my fingertips...)...  But, using computers in internet can sometimes be really difficult.   Not everyone knows the universal language of english very well, which limits internet usage quite a bit.... and even if you do know the basics of computers, the language, and even some html (which is not common with 'earthlings' i.e. non IT-pros) a lot of problems occur if you try to do things beyond your skill.  The most irritating thing that can happen (which sometimes does in my case) is that you have a good friend who is an IT-university degree graduate and who knows wayyyyy beyond you, to the level of expertiese. Because this friend thinks the basics to be so easy peasy, he "forgets" to concider how those incredibly easy things can be overwhelmingly difficult to you. In the end, it tends to go to "let me do it for you" and what is the result? The 'earthling' doesn't know one bit more as she/he did before. The next time some problem occurs, it's even easier to let your independence go and have things done for you, instead of trying to learn more about the tool you are using.  As I use my laptop quite a lot, and yet know too little about it, I clash with problems a lot.... Most of the time I try to solve them by myself but there's one indeniable area where I'm a complete moron. But, I can say that even my IT-friend hasn't been able to solve it the way that would satisfiy me... I think he finally gave up on me and my lappy after a series of childish and angry tantrums from my part, that he just noted "well, they work fine for me". And the issue here was internet security. Zone Alarm and Windows' own firewall. Either my computer has developed AI of its own with a very stubborn and un-cooperative attitude just like me, or then there is a solution no one hasn't discovered yet. LOL!  I think this was all for today, ladies and gentlemen. And remember....comment, comment ;)

      This is where you'll get to read bits and pieces of my thoughts. I'll get to some serious writing soon, but first, some basic information about me.  My name is Mari Annika (those are first names, no last name given here), and I'm a 24-year-old girl from Finland. I currently study nursing in a public polytechnic, and I'm coming to the half point of my 2nd year. So that means, 2 and half years to go before throwing myself into working life. My hobbies are.... I do some sports, hang out with friends, I love to cook myself (no wonder if you saw let alone tasted the food in our cafeteria) and music is my life... I have to do all this, and housework, with the little time I have left after all the schoolwork and studying. (whining, lol)  Everyone's welcome to ask more about me, if you're so curious....  easiest way is to post your questions to the comment section.  Untill later!

      This poem is dedicated to my one and only Love.  Your smile makes me all warm inside It's your way of telling everything's all right.  Your smile is so soft and sweet the arch of your lips so full and perfect  I could go on and on about your smile alone but I know it would make your cheeks flush....

      I just love this song.... the only problem with it is that it's too short.... I wish it was neverending. You should hear it to see the true beauty of it tho, not just read the lyrics....   you bring light in...  (repeated many times)  to a dark place  walking in light  glowing walking in light  gold ring around you  the hues of you  the golden sunlight of you   you bring light in...   cool wind following  following after you  rising for you  your skin beautiful  everything comes natural  fantastic fan  rocking rocking floating   There was a little drawing of a heart next to that, followed by an exclaimation mark. The back of his was covered in stuff... stuff like: Brandon is not a very nice guy, but Alex is sooo nice. And that had the exclaimation thing too. It was just silly crap that hit the spot. And he let himself be drawn in.

      I liked Punjabi MC from the start... didn't get the whole CD but got the 'Beware of Boys' (or Mundian To Bach Ke) single =) Then, I saw this funny Peugeot commercial shot obviously in India.... and loved the music of it. I assumed it was Punjabi MC.... now I've been trying to find the song on Yahoo free launch radio... and after listening to a few Punjabi MC songs, realised that that's not the way to find it...   So I did a search on google 'peugeot commercial music' and found out from one link that it's a song by Bhangra Knights. The next thing to do was to find out where it's available, so I searched by Bhangra Knights.... and at the site, which I've linked here, it's free to download.... so go get yourself a piece of some KICK ASS music =)  http://www.bhangraknights.com

      Smell your skin Feel your breath You on my side I couldn't resist  I hope I'll understand some day What's the meaning of this crazy game It is real and pure  T.N.T. for the brain  If there's no pain Rules are still the same I'm with you, just lead me I'm ready to play  T.N.T. for the brain  Don't be scared and have no fear I will show you what it means  If there's no pain Rules are still the same I'm with you, just lead me I'm ready to play  T.N.T. for the brain  What you feel is insane It is love and not a game T.N.T. for the brain   Passionate, or what? *sigh*

      I'm sad for not having a 'computer memory' in my brain... a memory where I could save and back-up file every cherished moment of my life. Too many, I'm afraid, I've already forgotten. Many meaningful conversations lost forever, millions of opinions, views and shades of life, gone....  I've strongly opposed the 'mad and crazy' idea that some day there could be an immersion between human and computer.... it seems too inhuman. But for memory, it just might be worth all the minuses. (Or then not, haha, stubborn to the end).  I miss the things I've lost (and will lose), things I'm unable to reminiscene, or 'relive'. I'm worried to live further, fearing more events will slip away without making me grow as a person, without having any impact on me. I fear forgetting events of my young age, losing the pillar and foundation of myself. I know for the most part I suppose it's close to impossible to have that happen, unless one gets a permanent, total memory loss, but I still worry about the possibility of forgetting some essential part of myself, one or more of the most basic qualities that help me define who I am.  It's not like I need advice, such as 'let go and live the life' cos I do not sit in a corner, passively, waiting for the life to pass me and worrying of my memory. But sometimes, when there's 'A MOMENT' in life, a faint thought of its possibilities of surviving in my braincells passes my thoughts.

      I dumped you again I don't understand It's happened before Can't take it no more  These foolish games Always end up in confusion I'll take you back Just to leave you once again  I died in my dreams What's that supposed to mean? Got lost in the fire I died in my dreams Reaching out for your hand My fatal desire  I've failed you again 'cause I let you stay I used to pretend That I felt ok  Just one big lie Such a perfect illusion I made you mine Just to hurt you once again   Just a great song. (added later: I bought this as a single)

      Hmm, niin, ajattelin nyt sitten kijjottaa... siis kirjottaa ihan suomeksikin tähän.... ihan vaan äsyttääkseni niitä kaikkia, ketkä eivät tätä pysty lukemaan. Eli kysymyshän on tänään siitä, että minä aion valittaa ihan karmean paljon...  No, tällä hetkellä eniten ehkä ottaa päähän koulussa tämä meidän luokka, no offence... Siis joo, lähinnä ryhmätyöporukat. Toisaalta olisi ihan kiva tehä töitä vaihdellen kavereita, mutta toisaalta näyttää siltä että osalla porukasta ei tule siitä työn teosta vittujakaan (anteeksi!) niin eihän sitä sellaseen ryhmään viitti itteään tunkea, missä saa 1) tehä kaiken työn ja 2) hyvällä tuurilla kaikki paskat vielä niskaan (eli lähinnä huonon arvosanan). Kiitos. Anteeksi. Ei pahalla, mutta ei nyt niin sydämellisestikään.... toisaalta onni, ettei tätä varmaan moni lue.  Muutenkin hirveää klikkikeskeisyyttä meidän luokassa vaikka silleen nyt toimeen tullaankin.... joskus sitä ihmettelee, onko itse niin uskomattoman vaikeasti lähestyttävä henkilö... no jaah, ongelmansa kullakin. Toisaalta ei kyllä ihan arvosta kaikkien luokkalaisten kaikkia tekemisiä... vaikka kyllä sitä itekin varmaan on jotenkin sotkuinen immeinen. Tänään kyllä oli ihan hauskaa Kivunhoidon tunnilla, pientä repeilemistä havaittavissa... Eiii... kurnuttava kipu. Miten voi pokkana sanoa "kurnuttava kipu"! Tämä naurattaa vielä vuosienkin päästä.  Muutenkin ihan outo päivä tänään... ensin olin kauhean kiukkuinen, sitten hysteerisesti naurava, ja nyt hölpötän ihan puuta heinää, siis... nuppi sekaisin, valitettavasti. Eli loppupeleissä ÄLKÖÖN KUKAAN OTTAKO TÄTÄ KIRJOITUSTA VAKAVASTI, joohan?Kiitos kaverit =) Kyllä minä oikeesti tykkään teistä, ihan kaikista. Ja enempää tälläistä sössöä herkistelyä te ette saa minusta ulos ;)  Heippa vaan, ensi kertaan...  ps. tämä koko blog (tai suomittain lok) tuskin antaa minusta niin älykästä kuvaa kuin olisi ehkä hyväksi.... mutta ehkä se on sentään totuudenmukaisempi kuin se älykäs kuva.... *iso virne*!

      If you're looking for something smart, interesting, funny or witty.... or anything readable, don't read this entry :)  The smiley is misleading, I'm feeling terrible. The sun isn't shining, I'm the only one who wore a t-shirt today in my class, my fave pants are this close from wearing out, I'm tired, I'm feeling sweaty, there's too much work, I just ate a donut, and everything's wrong.  Heard at school that the biggest modern art museum in the country (Kiasma in Helsinki) had bought a videowork, where the 'artist' gets a cat from homeless animals center, tortures it in various ways and kills it with an axe only to masturbate on it. Signed a petition to stop that kind of thing to be displayed and concidered as art (instead of the torture that it truly is). Yeah, yeah, it's not the same as all the cruelty that happens to people in the world, but it still made me feel sick.  Can't say that learning about that made my day any better...  What more could I complain? I don't know... I just feel so tired of everything right this moment... I don't want to take care of anything... although I know I should do all kinds of things.   The next 3 days ahead depress me also.... nothing but lectures of surgey all day long, 3 days. Nothing variable... school on saturday, bleah!  I'll write again, when I'm feeling better, should be writing an essay on feminism... once I get myself to do it... most likely not today. All I wanna do is zzzzz....... but can't.

      Hey ya my non-existent readers....  btw it feels great not to have many online friends... NOT!  Okie, okie.... Well first of all, SUMMER IS HERE!!!! Good bye to coats. Welcome t-shirts and tops. I woke up really too early today, but I remembered to do almost anything I was supposed to, before school, wee hee!!! ...took a beeday-card and 2 mother's day cards to mailbox (now don't be thinking I have 2 moms or something, cos the other card was for my darling, so beloved grandmom)... remembered to take a pillow to school....  Hmm, you might think what on earth did I take a pillow to school for... to sleep on lectures? No, no, I'm not quite THAT lazy yet... we had all day in auditorium (and I knew about it before hand) and the chairs are just terrible there, so the pillow was to sit on.... It really helped, a lot! Now, I thought earlier that the classes are going to be sooo boring... but I have to say, the surgeon really knew how to keep a lecture. He kept throwing case study type of problems at us, so we'd have to think for ourselves, not just write down. You had to pay attention all the time, cos you never knew when he's going to ask something and from who... He also cracked a few jokes, that weren't bad. I wish ALL our doctor lecturers were like that. We also had enough breaks. I almost can't believe it, but I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow!!  Ahh, studying feels nice right now, I couldn't be happier about my attitude change....  I don't know what to do for the rest of the day, ummm, not like I have much time to do anythingbefore bed time.... I have got to go to sleep earlier today, I felt dead trying to wake up this morning. I don't want to feel like that tomorrow morning, kiitos.  Oh, well... my room looks like it could use a cleaning hand..... some other time.... maybe tomorrow, after a night of lots of sleep. yeah, tomorrow....

      Ok, continuing from where I left in my recent entry.  We stayed at Anne's for a while, thinking that we'll go out, untill I told her "ok, come on, let's go then, this is just talk now"... we got on our feet, and got going. First we were going to walk a bit.... We walked to town, to a supermarket, where Anne bought a pair of socks and pistachios, and I bought a hairbrush and pistachios.... then we walked on, to the lakeside, near the market place and spotted a terrace (=outdoor bar) so we went there.... and ordered drinks.   On the way walking there, by the way, we walked by a few drunks... one guy in a group of them said loudly to us "give me a piece of that ass".... *sigh* why is it that there has to be idiotic people like that... well we paid no attention them, just hurried up.  While having them and chatting away and eating pistachis, we wondered that how come we didn't see anyone we know anywhere around... so we started smsing our friends to come and join us. Tatu came =D HE bought a beer and talked with us for a while, then asked us to walk with him to Casino island (=an island with a hotel named Casino, it's not a gambling place, and the island goes by its name) and on to another island, where a few friends of his were (drinking beer).   We left him there, walked back, walked thru town, went to a pizzeria and had pizzas. Uhhh, I ate too much...  but it was good. Not having another one for a few months, that's for sure. Then we walked home... I think we left Anne's place around... 6.30 pm.... and now I'm back at home at 10.30 pm... so it took 4 hours, lol! No wonder my feet feel tired.... well, we both had bad shoes too... we had to walk slow and careful not to twist ankles!

      I love it outside!!!! It's beautiful, it's green, it's sunshiny, it's warm, it's perfect and I love it!  I've learned massively today at the lectures, a good lecturer makes ALL the difference. I would have stayed longer.... hey, I even got a silly and random idea of "hey, I want to study medicine!!" I'm back to my senses tho, my head isn't made for physics, chemistry, maths.... especially not for anatomy and physiology! This is just enough for me now.  Well, got annoyed about some people asking "can we quit earlier today" and "how long do we have to have tomorrow". I guess they don't appreciate... stupid them. Well, almost all day went at the lectures... but after them, I bought 500 mL soda and went to sit outside with Anne, to drink, enjoy then sun and chat =) It was soooo nice. I'm going to ask her join me again later =) I might take my drawing pad with me, hey now that's a great idea! =) Ummm, even better idea would be taking a studybook with me =)  Oh, I feel like I'm living the best time of my life right now.... almost. I just want my 'clinical physics and hospital machinery' and 'surgical nursing' exams returned!!! I want to know how well I did... I think I did well, I hope I did.  I'm writing this at Anne's.... from her comp. She's watching 'The Bold an the Beautiful', the dumbest soap opera I've ever seen. They're all dumb though. I don't know why Anne, normally a great and sensible person can watch such poo =P  I think I'll go now... and try to get her off the TV now, lol. I can't stand even listening to this crap. Ah, it ended, thank you universe! Anyway, bye for now.

      I'd like to know what the hell I'm doing.   I'm 24, already swiched field of study once, not too much of government student aid left.... and searching information of other fields of study... like starting something else from scratch would make any difference in my life. As if it would somehow make me more content of my life.... and what real reason do I even have of being unhappy. My current field of study interests me tremendeously, I like studying health care. So why do I suddenly feel like I never should have left my original field of study.... or I should swich to IT... or English at Uni... or heck, medical science.... or art school...  Am I never going to know what I want to do with my life? Am I never going to know what interests me enough? Am I going to be "I wish I could..." for the rest of my life? Pathetic. I need some change in my life....  Not feeling so good now, about anything.

      Hmm, I've done absolutely nothing this sunday, although I was supposed to do so much.... I planned all kinds of things.  Anyway... what actually happened, was that I slept shamefully late.... listened to a thunderstorm for a couple of hours...whatched TV, ate.... now eating again (veggie PIZZA, even tho I promised I wouldn't eat any in months). This is terrible =)  It's silly to even write the blog, since there's nothing to tell about!!!  Embarrassement...  I'll write more later, when there's something to tell.

      Hmm, got around to do some refining work. Now that I've got my linking right, this corner seems much better and sooo much more user friendly :D  What's your win, is my loss... I used some of my precious sleeping-time to do this. Yes, yes, I blame  you !  Uh, ok.... I had better stop complaining and get my ass to bed. Good night, everyone. Zzzzzz.

      I'm at Anne's again... she's watching TV (news) and I decided to write my blog, instead of catching up with what's going on in the world, lol.  We just had a funny moment: we were carrying some stuff to her car, and I wondered quite a bit when she opened the trunk from inside the car... why not open the trunk lock from outside. When she got to the back of the car, I did ask her about that... she said there's no lock.   I look at her amazed and said "what are you talking about, it's right there!" and pointed it out to her. Now it was her turn to be amazed. She just never spotted it, even though she's had the car for about 2 weeks, and she's washed it 3 times. LOL. Blonde or what :P  Nah, she's not blonde :D  Ok, now, what else I've been doing the last couple of days when I've had no time to blog...  Oh, it's just yesterday (monday) and today then! Good, I don't have to write too much =) Well, yesterday... oh my god, I don't want to remember yesterday's schoolday!!! I was so embarrassing at finnish class. We had this drama rehersal kind of thing.  Well first it went well... but when we had to start improvising, I got wee bit too carried away.... ok, ok, I got way carried away... I made a "one woman show" of it, which was idiotic. Sigh. But actually, it was funny too. At least people laughed a lot :P Hopefully not just at me, lol.  What can I say... I'm downright silly.  Well, after all that, I, Satu and Hanna did some groupword about research and information analysis. Almost finished it, but then we got too tired and giggly and decided to continue some other day (wednesday)! And in the evening, I went to Anne's (she called me for dinner... guess what it was... yep, pizza, blugh) and we cooked together and had dinner.  And today.... well... *sigh* I've continued being a loser. I didn't go to school today. I stayed up way too late last night and felt horribly tired in the morning. So I refused to obey my alarm clock and slept in.   After I got up, I thought I might as well do  something , and so I made a proper and complete spring cleaning in my room. Noticed a lot of things I need (stationary and some storage boxes) and a lot of things I do not need (and they are taking too much of my space). So I packed some things away.  Now I'm again at Anne's, after washing some laundry... had yesterday's pizza (yuck! I'm beginning to loath pizza now) and we're soon going to watch 'Sex and the City' from telly =)  So, this is all I've been doing... nothing interesting really. The "heat wave", by the way, ended to last Sunday's thunder storm... it's barely + Celsius anymore.  And all this time.... I'm missing my One and Only Special Person. You know who you are =) If you read this, blow me a kiss :) *hugs* I think of you all the time.

      Oh my gosh, I've been so busy the last couple of days... actually I'm "stealing" this little moment to write here that:  I have no time to write. I'll update by the end of the week, about what's been going on =) And you might expect (finally) the article about feminism =P  See you later.  P.S. Hmm, wasn't too busy to change the look of the blog, lol! (it took some time with my mediocre skills)

      It's been a weird day... all we had today at school was tutor teacher's class, and all we talked about was... nothing important. I might as well not have been there. I was tired all the time anyway, and didn't really pay attention.  After school and finishing this groupwork with a couple of classmates, I slept for a while. And had bad dreams. Not nightmares, exactly... just dreams I would rather not have seen. Of a friend of mine.  Anyway, to the main topic. I downloaded something from online, and installed it, and after it my windows started restarting, over and over again. My first thought was that it's the feared and dreaded  sasser . I took off my LAN wire to see if it would stop once I'm not online. It didn't stop.  After that,all I did was open windows in error tolerant status, remove the latest installation and do a complete virus scan, and voilá, problem gone.I'll be a wee bit more careful about my downloads the next time. The ironic thing is, that my download was supposed to be a reliable firewall...  lol!   Another thing that has crossed my mind is tobuild a homepage again... retro style, using nothing but original html coding. I've done it before, I can do it again =) Oh gosh *giggls*... thinking of the first website I built. Sheesh. It was filled with little animations, couldn't have looked more tacky than it did! What the heck, I was a newbie back then :P My last site looked pretty good, very  urlLink Marimekko  at its simpliest.  Talking about Marimekko... if you want to see a stunning evening gown, go this path: In English -> Product Lines -> Clothing -> Jukka Rintala -> Collection. There's only one gown there, pretty kimono influenced, but I just now became to adore that dress :D Ok, ok, not everyone has to like it just because I do... it is pretty covering. For winterwear, I'd say.  Ok, now I have to stop about fashion and clothes...cos if I don't now, I never will. It's about my bedtime anyway, but since I slept earlier.... oh, dang! I missed CSI, ooooooh nooooooo.... ok, ok, not the end of the world. Well, as I wassaying, since I slept earlier, I'm not going to go to sleep in a while more. I'm not sure what I want to do tho. Maybe surf, maybe watch TV, maybe eat, maybe....

      Writing a homepae can be so much fun =) Right now, I think I'm going to hold for a while... I just need to find some images. Tomorrow I'm going to school to scan my very own "signature" and an ornamet that I drew...   I'm hoping to somehow turn them into proper images I can use on my website with this program (Macromedia Fireworks MX 2004). And I have no idea of how it works... oh shhhh.... it. Just realised that my thumb is covered in ink, lol! That's what you get from using a real ink calligraphy pen... But my ornament kicks ass :D It's worth the thumb.  Remember  NOT  to copy it :P Just reminding you in time...  I didn't remember how much time writing code can take! And it's a very simple code for that matter! But it's fun.... nice figuring out what's not working there and how to fix it...how to do things creatively, so that everything looks just right... This is the type of brain activity I like.... *sigh* maybe I should have become a programmer instead... lol. Nah, I like this as a hobby, that's all :)

      My stereosystem is ancient. So it probably doesn't support burned CDs, it doesn't recognize them. My friend Tatu says burned CDs should work on his stereosystem.... they don't. So I've wondered for a while if my computer burns them in right format at all.   But just now, my housemate Terhi, tried playing a CD that I burned for her on her stereos (she's listened to it from her computer only so far) and it works! So... my first suspicion was if her stereo system is able to play CDs in other formats also. I don't know, because she didn't know when I asked her. Not I have to do some research... and go see what the technical info on stereosystems of today is, lol.  I'm sure some people find my stuff amusing.... but hey, it's my life :P Laugh all you want :D So do I! Hahaha.

      The background that I insisted (and still do) to have is apparently on my dad's computer in another town, so it'll be a few weeks before I can add it to my html coding :P Don't worry, I'll work it up to the point of 'almost ready for uploading' so all it will need is the background image. It won't be delayed... and delayed... and delayed. I promise.  You might tell me to ask my dad to send the vital image to me but... if you knew my dad and computers, you wouldn't tell me to ask that. I mean, we're talking about the man who asked me the following while installing a program from a CD-rom: "Does the CD have to be inside all the time?" My dad's great tho. He's learned all he needs to know about computing (an invoice program for his company and information search from internet) at 50. My god, I hope I'll be a lot like him at 50! I just won't bother to ask him for things he doesn't know how to do, like attachements to e-mail... or how to find the right image from the labyrinth of my files on his computer.  Hmm... I might as well get back to work now that I have the appetite for it!  P.S. Don't expect too much please... It's going to be very simple, based pretty much on my last existing website. Like I said, my brain isn't in the mood for creating new things :P

       This  is the kind of stuff that happens to me all the time:  I walked to grocery store, filled a basked with food stuff, then I had a funny feeling in my brain, checked my wallet and  dang!  It's empty! *giggles* I had to put all the things I collected to the basked back to their own places and leave back home empty handed.   I'll try again later with better luck...  lol .  This silliness can be caused by 2 things in my life right now 1) I have really nasty  urlLink dysmenorrhea  right now... 2) I just got a surprise phonecall from my sweetheart :D It made me grin like mad and just forget about  everything  sensible :)   I'm betting on the latter reason :P  Hmm, what comes to my webdesign... I did plan something on paper, but it looks way too conventional... *sigh* I don't think my brain is going to do any creative work today. I'm also experiencing difficulty with my A-drive.... I don't get it why it is the way it is. I can get a normal sized diskette in there only if I fold it, lol. Why is the A-drive so small? Someone PLEASE tell me... is it for MP3s of what? My lappy handbook doesn't say anything about the A-drive....  I'm giving up on computers for a while now and give in to my stomach pains. *sigh* and wait for my love to call me again.... I'm counting on him to cheer me up. He always does, like no one else :D  P.S. The very strange weather continues in this town... today it's been on and off sunshine, not very warm, but with  snowing (!??!)  in between!!! Crazy!

      I feel like I did something today, for real...  I did housework properly, for once, all of it at one time :) Instead of leaving something for tomorrow. I washed laundry, washed dishes, vacuum cleaned, dusted, washed windows, changed bed sheets... anything you can imagine cleaning.  Then, I was invited to Anne's, to pack up her van with her stuff. She probably won't be with us the next semester. Not if she can transfer to a school closer to her boyfriend and the house they're building together. I wish nothing but the best of luck for her, but at the same time I wouldn't want her to go.  Well, Tatu's probably leaving too... so... we packed most of their stuff to Anne's van (she's going to make a little detour for Tatu and take his stuff to Tampere, to his girlfriend's place, at the same time as moving her stuff away) and we'll continue packing tomorrow. It was fun too, cracking jokes and spending a little time together.  Hmm... tomorrow I have only 1 class. 1! What's that supposed to be, pyh... Well, I appreciate the free time, I need it. I need to write a couple of assignments.... and... read for exams, majorly.  I think I'll go sleep soon, it's early wake-up tomorrow, I still need once machineful of laundry to wash. at 8 am.... I wonder if I'll want to wake up for it or just think "ahhh, I'll wash them some other time...zzzzz" :)  zzzzzzzzz.....

      Yet another finnish heavy metal/rock song, of which lyrics I totally love. Trying to roughly translate it.  The Clothes of Mourn by Timo Rautiainen and Trio Niskalaukaus (=trio shot in the neck) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  I do not wish to carry grief But I don't know how I could, in the middle all the misery see somehow differently  When the great men of our nations In their great action keep stumbling in the dark the chaos right behind them  The positive clowns cherish their ideas as good while living like devils This is why I dress in black  When our world that belongs to everyone is nothing but imagination I dress in the clothes of mourn and the clothes of mourn are black  If I were to see  more justice in this world I would happily wear snow white clothes  But if the world keeps continuing to travel the dark journey I dress in the clothes of mourn and the clothes of mourn are black  It hardly makes me laugh or lifts my spirits up when everything starts from crying and everything ends to crying  When whole nations follow The Beast in their actions This is why I dress in black The clothes of mourn are black

      Free and rough translation of a CMX song Ruoste (=rust)    Ruoste    hey, look how quietly everything happens but the years are short and when the moon and the sun are together in the sky I will collect all my posessions out to the yard and burn them  yes, books and papers maybe even furnitures and memories all the lies that come into the way of life all the good that stops you from truly seeing it is rust  smoke is licking the ruins you must know how it feels to keep your hands warm in the ashes of burnt down homes  hey, look how quietly the dust is raining onto the years again maybe these hands of a murderer are just seeking for a head to caress and feel the weight of the world it is rust

      How lucky we are that most of the time things really do turn better. I had a terrible day yesterday, for the most part, especially at the beginning of my workshift in the internship. Well, I have to say that my supervisor there is good, professionally, although I don't like her personally. She has this hard side I don't like about. But I've known her only for 1 day, so...   But one thing is good about her: she makes me do things on my own, instead of not letting me, like my previous supervisor. Both have pros and cons. I'm terrified of making mistakes... when it's people's health, wellbeing and even life at stake. And I'm pretty damn insecure about what I can or can't do. But it's good to feel you're trusted to do things right on your own.  Anyway, after a terrible morning of feeling like shit, and crying, it wasn't the best first day. I felt like crying a few times at work, and, well... but i got better, once I got used to work surroundings again. And when I got home, I was tired, but feeling better.  I had to rus to computer the first thing to see if I could talk to my best friend, and yeah, we talked for a long time... it was really nice and comforting. We had a good evening. I can't believe we chatted so long.... I fell asleep right away after that, and slept well.  Today morning's been nice. It's a day off from work, but tomorrow is a double shift, and I'm going (hopefully) to watch a hernia operation at a theater, as well as prepare the patient for it, and take care of the post-operative nursing. It's going to be interesting, very educating, but also veryvery hard and tireing. And the day after that is going to be morning shift, so I think I'm just going to feel dead. lol.  this is  my work schedule:  May 19th wed: 1 pm-9 pm (evening shift) 20th thu: no work 21st fri: 7 am-9 pm (morning + evening shift) 22nd sat: 7 am-2 pm (morning shift) 23rd sun: 1 pm-9 pm (evening shift) 24th mon: 7 am-2 pm (morning shift)  and then my surgical nursing internship is done. the first proper one. there's going to be  general ward internship, maternity ward internship, psychiatric ward internship, children's ward internship, emergency room internship combined to intensive care unit internship  and others. god knows what. I'm tired to check now. but a lot of internships... a lot of practical work. I like it =)  Ok, I have got to go wash dishes now. I'll write sometime later, if I'm not dead :P

      I didn't die to the double shift, although it was 14 hours. Actually it was interesting and surprising how well it went. I would have needed to sleep longer the next morning, I think, but I had a morning shift. Well, I can get loads of sleep now :)  Well, my surgical internship is now done, which is great. Only a few exams, and then I'm off to a summer holiday, wee hee =) So, now... Anne's visiting me for 2 days, staying at my place. It's kind of nice. But also kind of... lol, battle of the wills. Endless negotiation what we do, when we do, how we do... lol lol. But it's great to talk about all kinds of things. To bad she's probably leaving for good. I'll miss her a lot.  I just joined www.orkut.com. It's this "friends, their friends and their friends" network kind of thingy. Kind of interesting, except I'm not so good at networking. Well, there are communities I could find friends with similar interests but...well. Let's see if the whole thing is of any use. Found Breakbeat fans, which is great. BREAKBEAT KICKS ASS!  Now, all I need to do is find Beat Pushers: Murto. It's such a must, but it's sold out everywhere.... bleah! I wanniiiiiiiit :)  I think that now would be a great moment for a little nap...

      Hmmm, I've started to write all the more rarely here... I think the "first wave" of enthusiasm is gone. I hope it won't result to complete negligence to this blog and rather just even out a bit (no more "5 posts per day" type of thing).  Anyway. School semester is over and ahead is the 11 week summer holiday, of which 8 weeks is working a summerjob. I'm moving back to my parents' house sometime next week. It should be ok. I screwed up a couple of courses this semester and I'm going to have to retake the exams from them next fall. I don't mind, I'll try to bury myself into studying a bit more. We'll see if it works out as planed...cos nothing ever does.  I'm already high on planning an amusement part trip for July with some friends. I hope everyone's schedules can be matched for 1 day, lol. I wanna go get some scary, screamy rides!!!!! Over and over and over and over..... wee hee.  My friend Tatu even suggested we should make it a LARP... Jesus, is he a live-action-rolegame-playing freak or what!! Nah, he just wants me into it too but bleah. I have enough fun in my life anyways :P When it's rides vs. larp, larp is the definite loser.  Hmm, I'm living for the future now, cos present is just a bit boring. I have nothing much to do here alone, except wait for that internship feedback/evaluation-conversation with teacher and supervisor. *sigh* Oh well. I'll be getting it over with. Nothing could be nicer.  And now... I'd like to recommend an online radio for you:  urlLink Live 365  great music from ANY genre, I think.... haven't explored so profoundly, cos I just concentrated my picks to BREAKBEAT!!! surprise, eh?  Have a nice life y'all  :P

      ...and it's my dad's fault =P Kidding. Well, technically, I could be home right now, or going home today or tomorrow... but no, dad can't pick me up from the train station before saturday, so I have to rot here alone. All friends have gone to their homes... I've been desperately calling them and sms:ing them for company, lol. Pathetic... shouldn't be too hard to be alone for a couple of days. I want to get back home to meet my old friends. I miss them.  Hmm, I should sms Tanja and ask her about the horse :D I hope she's taking the whole thing seriously... I have my doubts, but I also know she adores her pets more than anything and treats them right. Hmm, just sms:ed her, and Sari too. I recently found out that Sari considers me as her closest friend, hmmm... I was a tiny bit surprised, but...well. She's a wonderful friend too. We're both kind of alike... at least in a sense that we don't talk much about very personal things.. feelings or stuff... Well, I don't know if she's really like that, but maybe she doesn't tell because I don't tell. Who knows.  Lol, sms:ing is taking my time now... I'm just making so many plans, son all my weekends will be full... gosh, I'm going to be broke before I even earn any money :P Nah, taking kind of easy the whole June, but when the payday comes...!!! Well, July is full of plans... barbeque parties, summer cottage parties, fun fair plans.... Well June's not going to be boring, cos my wonderful, lovable 9 year old(gosh she's so old!)niece is coming to visit. I love her sooo much. I'll make sure she has a lot of fun. I'll take her swimming, to playgarden, all kinds of places :) I might even bake her a nice strawberry cake (sure sign of summer) =)  Oh nooo...Sari invited me to Ruis Rock with her (a massive music festival event in Turku during one weekend). The tickets are expensive, but.... well anything for a friend =P And it's guaranteed fun too. We'll probably get just a 1 day ticket.  Hmm... I guess that's all.

I'm only going for saturday. -A day trip to  urlLink Särkänniemi  amusement park, located in Tampere. -and anything I can come up with  August: -work ends. I have 2 weeks of real holiday. -traveling back to uni and possibly going to Sari's summer cottage with her. It's located not too far from Savonlinna. -finally going to explore urlLink  Olavinlinna castle  which is located right here in Savonlinna.  Although I have sooo many plans, I'm going to relax as well, as much as I can from work! This is going to be one good holiday... *sighs with anticipation* :)

      Uh, Summer is almost half way experienced. I've done some things I planned, and some things were left undone.... plans change, and I love it.  June: Hmm, well, first of all, I haven't been able to spend one single weekend at summer cottage. There's always something... sheesh. I will though, this summer, even if it wasn't June. June's been rainy anyway, so who cares, lol.   My niece is visiting right now, and hopefully she's going to stay a few more days. I totally adore her :) I haven't had one single barbeque party either... I blame it on the rain :P But honestly, I've been too busy. I have spent time with friends though.... a little....  And I did go to Louhisaari Manor.   One thing I didn't plan for, was going to auctions, I liked it a lot, even though I didn't always get what I wanted, lol. I'll be going to more of them, definitely. I loved bidding, but I didn't lose my senses. I'm very sorry about a blue vase I didn't have the guts to bid for... I should have flashed some green, but I was being a stingy. Unfortunately. And now I regret it. Lol!  July: I am going to Ruis Rock, I'M LOVING IT :P I have the tickets, and I'm going with Sari and a friend of hers, Maarit. So far.. I haven't come up with anything else significant, and the amusement park trip is going to be postponed to August 9th. It's the ONLY (can't you believe this) day that Anne and I had a mutual day off from our summer jobs. Well, actually, on August 9th, I won't be working at all anymore, but she, luckily, has a day off.  August: I'm not a fortune teller, so I can't know if my plans for August will happen or not... I'll tell you guys when we're coming closer to September.  The weather is wonderful right now, I should be out, and not typing at my computer inside.... so I'll go and enjoy myself.  Hmm, I'm having some disagreement with my impossible big brother (my niece's dad) and he didn't say hello to me when we briefly saw each other just now... Talk about acting like a 3 year old. He's 31. Bleah, I'm not going to be bothered. I'm going to have a nice day.
