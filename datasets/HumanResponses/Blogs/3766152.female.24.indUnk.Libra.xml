       Last night (che tristezza!) we bid farewell to the first of the girls from my place to leave Catania!!!
  
For those not in the know, I've been living for the past 4 months with a group of ERASMUS students - one English, 4 Spanish, and 1 Slovakian girl. As the semester winds up everyone's starting to talk about leaving Catania, going home - the mood is a little strange, no-one wants to leave! (I can understand that!)
  
The first to leave was Zaira, one of the Spanish girls - absolutely nuts - so much fun...last week she decided to organise a dress-up party; she came dressed as a ghost, but everyone else decided to dress up as her! (Photographic evidence below.)

What a strange feeling this... Our little family's breaking up, we're all going our own way, back to normal lives (or, in my case, finding ways to continue living the fantasy). Zaira was almost in tears when she left the house; half the girls went to the airport with her too, and I'm sure she cried there. 
 It's not the changes so much...it's that it all seems to be ending! 
 
Strange days these!

       Recently, Jacquie - one of my best friends from Sydney - came to visit me in Catania (yay!); at the same time, Ingrid, another friend from Sydney who's studying in Ferrara, came down to Sicily for the second time.  We decided to take a weekend trip, to see parts of the island we hadn't seen before. First, we went to Piazza Armerina, where we met up with Saro, Andrea, and a couple of Andrea's friends (oh, and Andrea's dog, Fatta - whose full name is  Ombra di una fatta biancha , or  Shadow of a White Fairy ). While there, we went to the roman villa, a couple of thousands of years old, where the mosaics are still in pretty good condition; awesome to see. Afterwards we wandered around the town for a bit, had some dinner, sang "Figaro" and various other songs, got lost, and then got Saro in trouble with both his mum and girlfriend because he drove us to Caltagirone instead of going home...  The next day, from Caltagirone, we could either: a) get the bus back to Catania, or b) get the bus to Palermo so we went to Palermo. Spent the night there, wandered around a little, then in the morning got the bus to Trapani, which is on the western-most point of Sicily and is absolutely amazing; we got a boat across to Favignana, one of the Egadi Islands - gorgeous. Hired some bicycles and had a hilarious time trying to remember how to ride...Ingrid's seat kept falling backwards, and my skirt kept getting caught in the wheels...  Left Trapani at 6 in the morning to go to Agrigento, where the valley of the temples has some of the most amazing Greek ruins in Sicily (for those that don't know, Sicily was a Greek colony for quite a while, along with most of southern Italy; Sicily also features in many of the Greek myths, and is the home of the Cyclops from the Odyssey). By this time Ingrid and Jacquie were getting on each others' nerves a little; we were all a bit tired and hot I suppose. Ingrid suggested Jacquie could write a  Whinger's Guide to Europe . We made it back to Catania without them killing each other though...   urlLink    Photos from weekend trip in Sicily, with Ingrid & Jacquie  Some highlights of the weekend: a) Jacquie, showing ingenuity as always, came up with a new technique to stop the Sicilian mens' habit of staring at women: every time someone stared at her a little too long, she started picking her nose and eating it. A guy on a motorino, seeing her doing this, almost had an accident! b) Swimming in the mediterranean for the first time, at the beach at Favignana: the water was so clear and blue, and quite salty, so we could float along for hours. c) Dinner in the hotel in Trapani: we got some food and champas from the supermarket and had a girly night in. Necessary at times. d) Singing songs while driving the back roads between Piazza Armerina and Caltagirone with Saro. He didn't have his glasses on so I had to look out for street signs for him. He's also amazing at swearing - every second word it seemed - lots of fun! e) Well, we got to see all the ruins and stuff...you know, be cultured and all... Agrigento is amazing, if ever you get to Sicily you have to go. Trapani was quite different to the other places I've been here, and definitely worth a visit (I'll have to go back: there's ancient cave paintings on some of the Egadi Islands that I didn't have time to see). The Villa Romana at Piazza Armerina is definitely worth a visit too - but try to go outside tourist season; we got stuck for a while behind a huge tour group which kind of puts a damper on the experience.

       Welcome to my new blog! Old blogs can still (for the moment) be seen at  urlLink LivLog , hosted by my now ex-boyfriend's workplace which is why I've decided to change...
  
Here you can read about my adventures in Italy (or, more specifically, Catania, a city at the base of Mt Etna on the east coast of Sicily). To give a bit of a background, for new readers:  
I arrived in Catania in February 2004, with the intention of studying for a semester at the university here (faculty of literature and philosophy), as part of the Masters of International Studies offered by the  urlLink University of Technology, Sydney . The exchange program involves studying 2 subjects at the host institution and completing a research project: mine (still unfinished - aarrgh!!!) is on the effects of emigration on Delianuova, a town in the mountains behind Reggio Calabria, and also the birthplace of my maternal grandparents.  
At the end of July I was supposed to return home to begin a masters by research at the  urlLink University of Sydney . However, a few things happened in the intervening period - the main one being that I broke up with Garth, my boyfriend of 3 1/2 years, and also that I fell in love with the lifestyle here!  
So, I decided to postpone the commencement of the research degree and instead will be staying in Catania until February 2005. I'm heading north to Berlin to meet some friends on the 13th July, then back home to Sydney for the month of August, and will be back in Catania in time for the end of summer.  
I'll be updating this blog fairly regularly (depending on internet availability) so happy reading!

       Well, flew into Sydney on Wednesday night and have since been recovering from jetlag and trying to get used to the differences again... 
 Like everyone says, one of the first things that hits you after coming back from Europe is how much space there is here. There's not as much chaos either, I can't get over how sedate and clean and  quiet  the place is! 
 Strange this, going through the process of re-adjusting, slowly remembering all the things that make this place home, make it known and familiar and my own. Remembering how to be more polite, to wait in line instead of pushing in, to drive on the left-hand side of the road...to follow the road rules while doing so... 
 Have to get used to the temperature again too, I've just left a gorgeously hot European summer to come home to winter - wearing a scarf, pulling out my old winter jackets, trying to find warm enough clothes (I've left most of my winter stuff in Catania for when I go back - not smart!) 
 What's the bet, just as I get climatised, just as I calm down and get used to being in Sydney again, it'll be time for me to jump on another plane and go straight back to Europe... 
 Funnily enough, I can't wait!

       Am sitting in the hostel at Rome at the moment, where I'm staying for a night before heading back to Sydney for a month...strange to think that I'll soon be home!!! Still it'll be good to see everyone. 
  
My flight from Berlin was delayed by about 3 hrs so spent a night sleeping (or pretenting to sleep) at the airport in Milan, before getting on the train to Ferrara to spend a couple of days with Ingrid.&nbsp; I&nbsp;arrived there to find that Ingrid was leaving 2 days later to go to Croatia... 
  
They put on a huge party that night, for Ingrid's birthday and as a farewell for one of her flatmates who's going on student exchange in Brasil. Was great fun - after doing a congo line around their apartment, we took a whole heap of food down to the city walls and sat on the grass eating and drinking and talking shit... Quite a few of the guys & girls spoke English - although it seemed to be limited to a few words interspersed with swearing, which got a little repetitive after a while. Still, had fun. The next day I borrowed Mariana's bike (Mariana is Ingrid's roommate) and we rode around town - it's a Ferrarese thing, everyone rides bikes there and the very centre of town is blocked to cars to make it easier for bikes &amp; pedestrains; there are bike lanes on all the main streets and it's just generally awesome fun! Went out for aperitivi and then back to ingrid's for dinner before heading up to hang out in the piazza in front of the cathedral.  
Ingrid left the next day, but she and her other flatmates were more than happy for me to stay in their house (thanks guys!), so I had a relaxing day doing nothing much and trying not to die from the heat and humidity... I went out with Piero, a mate of Ingrid's, that night, we spent most of the time chatting and drinking cold tea before taking the bikes out to the city walls again, to Busker's, a place that opens up in summer where they have live music and films and bars,  c'Ã¨ casino, tutta la gente in giro...bella!  When I got back I couldn't open the door so had to call Piero for help...thought I was going to be sleeping on the street! Still he managed to get me in (thanks Piero!) 
 Next morning I left (and left my sunnies at ingrid's place...crap!); Piero helped carry everything to the station, and I got on the train to Certaldo, a little town between Florence and Siena in the Tuscan countryside, to stay at a hostel that Ingrid recommended,  urlLink Fattoria Bassetto . Gorgeous spot, really loved it there. Got chatting to another guy who was heading up there and we discovered that we both wanted to shave our heads; asked around at the hostel if anyone had any clippers and lo & behold, someone had some - so we had a group head-shaving! In the end I didn't go completely bald - the back's really short but I've still got a fringe, reckon it looks pretty good. We all headed up afterwards to the little bar in the next building, chatting and drinking and generally being like hostelliers all over the world. It was great fun. Oh, I also went for a swim at about 5am, in the rain... che bella serata!  
 Photos of the 'new look' and of all the recent adventures will be going up soon; bear with me till I'm back home and have access to cable internet, which I don't have to pay an arm and a leg for... Later!

       Well, left Berlin a couple of days ago. Highlights of the stay:
  
Seeing bits of the wall - so strange to imagine the city divided as it must've been. Some of the escape stories in the museum at Checkpoint Charlie are horrific; some are amusing, including the family that flew over East Germany in a home-made hot air balloon... 
The Chagall exhibition - an inspired painter, really enjoyed seeing his work on display (first time I've seen Chagall paintings & drawings in real life). 
Catching up with old friends, including Ben who I hadn't seen for about 5 yrs since he moved to Berlin. 
Being taken (by Ben and Ninon, his girlfriend) to a gay/punk party in some apartment building; they had to argue with the doorman to get us in since it was a private party; they put on a drag show &amp; danced to Kylie Minogue...very funny!!! 
 Writing on the run now - in Ferrara for Ingrid's birthday party - will be home in less than a week, hard to believe! More later.

      Well,itÂ´s finally done,IÂ´ve left Catania...

Spent 2 days in Rome, exploring the sights I hadnÂ´t seen before... went into the Vatican, followed the tourists around-lemmings, we were, soooo many people! Did a bit of shopping, saw the Fontana Trevi and the Pantheon-an awesome place to hang out for a few days before taking the plunge and leaving Italy again.

I felt ready to leave by the end, but sad as well-had a few days of farewells, all the girls from my place    leaving... A bit sad but weÂ´ll see each other again-somewhere!

Arrived in Berlin this morning and first impressions: itÂ´s cold!!! Overcast, about 15 degrees celcius; not the heat IÂ´m used to, where 5 minutes after getting out of bed youÂ´re soaked in sweat. But seemslikea gorgeous place, really different, should be good!

More later...

       A couple of nights ago we had a party at Jules' place: cooked up a storm (including the world-famous tuna & mayonnaise-stuffed eggs made by Zio Saro...); had a drinking competition (which I won, by the way, no matter what the lying Europeans say about it...); sang songs and played guitar and chatted and had a roaring good time; all followed by a dip in the swimming pool that's recently made an appearance on my terrace, thanks to Maria, one of the Spanish girls I live with. 
 All in all a great night! 
  P.S. Mum and others, yes I must admit, I have started smoking again, as you can see in a couple of the photos I think - but please don't kill me! (I don't need your help to do that...) And I promise I won't smoke at home...

       Vittorio, one of my mates here, grew up in Bari, on the heel of the Italian peninsular. He;s got a friend staying with him at the moment, Adriano, and they've been teaching us a few phrases in Barese dialect.
  
Tips for pronunciation: "g" is pronounced "j"; "sci" and "sce" are pronounced "shi" and "she" respectively; put the stress on the sylable that has the accent on it; pronounce every single letter as it's written.
 
 Se gnÃ  mascÃ¬, sciamanin. Se nn gnÃ  mascÃ¬, nn g n sim scend! 
 Translated (rougly): If we're going there, let's go. If we're not going there, we won't go. It's a barese toungue twister. Doesn't mean a hell of a lot in dialect either, but it sounds awesome - I love that I can hear the differences in accents now, when people from different regions of Italy speak!

       Gabi and Izzy left yesterday. We had their farewell party at the hostel (where else would we go??) There were heaps of people - forgot to take my camera though so no photographic evdence. 
 Dream boy made an appearance (Gabriella's dream boy Alessio, a really spunky Sicilian with dreds and a misconception that he's African because he plays the bongos and Sicily's so close to Africa anyway...); he was with Spiritual Brother though (Luigi - wierder than Alessio because he's really really moody). When Gabi told them she's going to Egypt in September they were a bit put out - think they're offended that this English girl is getting to Africa, their spiritual home, before them... 
 Everyone's leaving! I know when I get back there'll be a whole new bunch of people to get to know - it's part of the traveller's life - but still, sad to see these girls go. Especially now, when we've settled into each other's stranger characteristics and get along really well... Anyway have been trying to convince them to come back for new year's eve, if they can make it we'll have a huuuuugggge party, it'll be great. 
 In between all the farewells, I started getting a little depressed the other day... I guess it finally hit me that even though I still feel like I made the right decision, breaking up with Garth, it really is over. It's always sad when something ends, especially something that was so good for a while there. But it's over, and now that I've finished studying as well I feel a bit at loose ends, don't really know which direction to turn - the last few days in any place always seem to be like that, trying to fit in all the things you've forgotten to do, packing bags, saying goodbye to friends, all the while thinking about where you're going next. 
 Confusing thoughts that won't let me get to sleep at night, so that I have to drown them out with music until I relax and let go, dreams that seem to be getting stranger every day, waking up early because it's too hot to sleep in... I really feel like it's time to leave this place for a while, see something different, visit friends and family, reclaim myself in a way, get back into the travelling spirit before this city pulls me in so bad I can't leave. Time to move on, at least for a while.

       Don't you hate it when an observation is made about someone and you're forever doomed to see them in a new light? 
 Gabi called a friend of a friend "Gnome Girl" the other day; I saw her again last night and just couldn't get the image out of my head.  She is tiny, but she's also really lovely - I don't want to be mean - I need to control this image - she is  not  a gnome!!! Gnomes are fantastical creatures and do not exist! 
 (Hee hee! Gnome girl...)

       Yay! I finished my research project - finally - and emailed it off to my mum yesterday to print out (thanks mum!) and give to my aunty to take to the uni office (thanks Rita!) 
 Am feeling slightly under the weather today...after spending the whole afternoon at the beach with Annett and Dara, I went out last night to celebrate, and had a good old chinwag with a few friends - in fact, we didn't actually go out, we just sat around eating and drinking and being merry. Che bella questa vita! 
 It was also the last time I'll see Dara until I get back from Sydney, as she's gone off today to Naples and is then heading north for a bit of a viaggio. Che strano, we've spent so much time together this year - we're quite different people in a lot of ways but this experience of being in a new place, learning a new language, draws you together somehow... And anyway she's a lot of fun to hang out with (I know you don't agree, Jacquie, but hey, we can't get along with everyone...)  
Anyway it's drawing closer to the day I have to leave this place, time to start packing bags, working out what I'm leaving here and what I'm taking back to Australia... Sad in some ways, but I'm also looking forward to seeing friends and family, and at the moment I feel ready for a bit of a break from this city. It really does keep drawing you back though... I know as soon as I leave I'll miss it like crazy!

       Dara and I stocked up on ingredients from the international food shop again the other day, and introduced some of the sicilian boys we know to FRESH SPRING ROLLS! 
 We had to invent a little - couldn't find coriander, also the basil is different to thai basil, but still, it's fusion, modern Australian cooking, right?? Anyway it was very amusing watching them try to roll the little packets... Didn't do too well, except for Vittorio who studies art and got right into the aesthetics of it all... 
 Funny too their reactions to eating raw vegies - not used to it I guess. They seemed to enjoy it (and this time Dara didn't make anyone sick by using too much chili, either!) 
 Have to think of something else to cook up before I leave...or for when I come back... Am looking forward to seeing their reactions to vegemite, which I'm planning to stock up on while in Sydney!

       Well, I've been home a week tonight, and I'm starting to settle down and get used to my city again. 
 The place has changed for me now - having experienced something else, I notice more keenly the differences: the lack of decent coffee; the seeming passivity of the traffic and the people after the constant noise and movement of Catania... 
 Funnily enough, I really miss one of the things I hated most when I first arrived in Sicily. I've gotten so accustomed to the way people gaze at you there that it seems almost rude here in Sydney, where no-one wants to look me in the eye, return my stare, like they don't want to engage with me. 
 Walking through the city two days ago, looking around at the trees and buildings, the familiar streets, the people racing up and down the footpaths on their lunch break, made me remember the things that make this city home. There are good differences too: the huge racial mix that we have here; the easy availability and variety of international foods - sushi, oh how I missed sushi, and channa dahl, and laksa... The open spaces and sense of space even in the city centre; the calls of native birds in the park across the road from my house; aussie music being played on the radio; my friends and family and our stupid in-jokes from years of mucking around together. 
 At the moment I feel like I'm caught between two places. I'm happy to be home - but I'm happy also that it's only for a short time, and that I'll soon be back on that travel high, stopping off in London and the lakes district in northern Italy before heading back to my other, newer home. How I'll resolve the tug between the two when I return to Sydney permanently next feb I have no idea... but I'll work that out when the time comes.
