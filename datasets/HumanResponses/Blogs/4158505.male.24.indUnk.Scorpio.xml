       Went for The Bourne Supremacy tonite with S and her friend. It was pretty good. Besides, 007 and Ethan Hunt, James Bourne is probably the next best spy. The movie is slickly made and has one of the best car chases I have seen in recent times. Matt Damon fits the role perfectly. Overall, its worth the bucks I spent. Want to watch Collateral next. Tomorrow my friend Kapcy is coming down to Clemson from Columbus, Ohio for this weekend. I am sure it will be a cool reunion. Looking forward to it .......

       Today again I got stuck into two articles I happened to read on Rediff.... urlLink http://in.rediff.com/money/2004/mar/03guest1.htm  &amp;  urlLink http://us.rediff.com/money/2004/aug/10das.htm ..... Well, both these articles are written by the same gentleman, G V Dasarathi with an uncanny tone of sarcasm and wishful thinking. Its true that what he says is true to an extent but he has ignored the other not-so-rosy truth at all. It may be that today a lot of Indian Software Companies and thousands of Indians (count me in as well) are back end sloggers in US based interests. But with all our aspirations, dreams and ingeniosity we must not forget that our country earned its independence just 57 years ago. Before we churn out techie giants and entrepreneurs we must make sure that the country's poverty line is decreased and literacy increased. For a country like USA which was independent as early as 1776 and has a tremendous geographical advantage to that of ours resources are never an issue. Now its our time to consolidate and we are doing that. The country's economy is building up, we have a bright generation of young people- ambitious but careful, and the spread of the Indian diaspora. We should take a few steps at a time. It may be slow but I guess its a surer process. It just troubles me a lot when people start criticizing the Indian mindset by comparing it to that of an American without even considering some major socio-economic factors.

       Today as I was doing my usual news reading rounds, I came across this article on Rediff which states India is potentially poised for 10 medals at the Olympics. The rating was conducted by PriceWaterHouse Coopers based on several factos...  urlLink http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/aug/09india.htm ... But knowing PWC ratings this is nothing new or absurd (unless you believe that India is gonna bring back 10 medals from Greece!). If you happen to check their Rankings in cricket you shall always(at least, most of the time) find Sachin Tendulkar ranked 1 in ODIs. Well, I wonder with another lost cause at Sri Lanka can the Master Blaster ever win a crunch match on his own? It is a sad reality that the No 1 Batsman in ODI fails to have a substantial contribution in crucial ties. Is that because he is not the Batsman No 1 or something much more complex?   Whats with Times of India !

       Last nite's party was no different from the hundreds of other desi-parties that are hosted around Clemson....it had all the usual ingredients- a keg , liquor (kept hidden by the host) , mix-n-match of hindi and english dance numbers and the same faces...but I have become such a sucker for all these parties that I shall still go to the next one I am invited to without even thinking once.....

      Well, the last 24  hours was not too boring ....First after watching a typical AID concert- which was more pro for aiding the Tamil Nadu cause than the other Indian states.....Roshan, Utpal and Me went to Atlanta to pick up Yogesh.......Today morning there was the graduation walk and after a solid 2 hours sleep I carried my exhausted body over there....Bansal, Sahil, Iyer, Lonkar, Inder and couple of other friends did the walk....I guess its a life time opportunity and no one should miss such an occasion if they have the chance.....Everyone looked so elegant in their cape and gown.....It was their Walk of Life !  Now have a party to attend....so have to finish up some lab jobs .....adieu!

      Hi All ! I don't know whether its the herd feeling or sheer boredom that brought me here. But my first posting did not go very well with this blog-space, as I missed saving the draft and have to start from square one. Before any other thing happens let me end my first posting here. Well this is not even a proper post actually ! With better luck I hope to come back tomorrow with something more substantial.
