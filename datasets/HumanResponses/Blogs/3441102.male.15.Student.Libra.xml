      Yeah morrissey again, I think I need to shave again, fuck this I hate facial hair, i didn't mind the pubes but I have to shave this shit off. After cadets yesterday me and david (gender-bender) had a fight and I think its safe to say I creamed him. Nah it was fun and i have a bruised hand where he landed when he fell over. Whitgift is shitty boring damn trip to Croydon (WOW!) to do some environmental survey shit and they didn't have the quorn premier (I'm a veggie) at the McDonalds nearest to E. Croydon station, those butt nuggets. Watch the mighty boosch on E4, saw it last night and it was some fucked up shit. I was going to do something constuctive but hey looks like I'm doing this shit again. If you are reading this and I don't know you, go jump in front of a bus you fucking loser

      The gender-bender david brooke introduced me to this piece of internet highway so I am crediting him as the person who showed me this despite the fact that he enjoys being assrammed by brightoners, londoners, most -ers (especially benders) horses, sheep and most farmyard animals and domestic pets (like hampsters)

      This is my own opinion of the Osbournes and applies to Black Sabbath, Ozzy's own career, the merchandise, the series and most of all the entire family. Basically.............total shit. Forget the debates forget the music (which is shit) forget the family sticking together, forget the problems they have each had: Its total shit. Its so shit people think its good. Its the kind of shit that Satan has done right in the middle of the carpet of your living room stamped a name on it and sent it in to your mind via the airwaves and Satan's own personal implement of power (the tv). No arguments any complaints about this is because you are lying to yourself or you hang out with rockers who think the american music scene has enough to even be able to approach the british music scene with its ass lubed up and a rubber gag on its mouth. Don't even say shit about how he was born here and lives here. He spent the majority of his life in america, the family is american so basically he's american for fuck sake don't argue. Seriously no joke the Osbournes suck. There are no exceptions in the osbournes case of where this is not true. Blame the Kerrang magazine for there shitty A-list of whos rock and not because its wrong. Jack and Kelly are little incest loving drug fuckers for the record. Sharon has done nothing so she can fuck off as well.

      I went gliding this morning at 4 in the morning and I got to sleep at about half one. This gimp kid wouldn't shut the fuck up in the dorms. When everyone else was asleep my own insomnia and some fat fucks snoring kept me up. Gliding was real cool but right now I'm so tired I keep swaying, feels real fucked-up. I almost fell asleep but then one of my brother's friends phoned and no-one else was in so I had an argument that he should phone his moblile. Well I was pretty hyped up so I decided to play some bass. Wrote some lyrics for the "band" to view later and I brought my dad a father's day present. Damn I'm bored. Geoff Hurst biography. For my dad. I'm reading 1984 by George Orwell. Pretty good. Listening to Jam. Download Eton Rifles, Thats entertainment and down in the tube station at midnight. Genius songs.

      Dear all. I have not written for a bit because frankly I'm a lazy bastard, but somehow I doubt you give a demi-shit. I have been listening to the jam a genius punk band, and playing the bass. I can't wait until our band, schitzo facto, play at scream next. I prefer the name "in the flesh" but some (really stupid) bastards think it sounds death-metalish and this has influenced david's mind in to thinking it sounds shitty. Go to www.biggerdave.blogspot.com to tell him what a fool he is for thinking this. In The flesh means... we're here retards, not we are in your bodies for fuck sake grow a brain cell. If you think "in the flesh" means the latter your a retard and I'm not your friend so go away.

      Haven't blogged in a long time, and I'm beginning to hate this as much as messenger but hey I'll still use. Principle isn't a high point for me to give a demi-shit about. I'm the bassist in a band and if we can't find anyone else the singer (well joint with david). We are ok and have a total of one complete song (minus lyrics for verses 2 & 3 i'm not sure if we're assing with a chorus) and we have two others in the form of bass and guitar riffs  but nothing solid and the god chris (our damn amzing drummer) hasn't put anything to solid to yet. Can people please tell me if "Scitzo Facto" or "In The Flesh" is a better name for a band. You may be able to tell I'm in a better mood and I am I just woke (insomnia is a bitch) and I'm bored so good nite and good day all

      This guy walks into a quiet bar, carrying three ducks one in each hand and one under his left arm. He places them on the bar, has a few drinks and chats with the bartender. The bartender is experienced and has learned not to ask people about the animals that they bring into the bar, so he doesn't mention the ducks. He and the man chat for about half an hour before the guy with the ducks has to go to the toilet. The ducks are left on the bar. The bartender is alone with the ducks. There is an awkward silence and so the bartender decides to try to make some conversation. What's your name?' he asks the first duck. Huey, replies the first duck. How's your day been, Huey? Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. Oh. That's nice, says the bartender. The bartender then turns to the second duck and says: Hi. And what's your name?. Dewey, came the reply. So how's your day been, Dewey? Just wonderful. Fantastic day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. If I could have another day just like today, I would do the same again. The bartender turns to the third duck and says: So, you must be Louie. No, growls the third duck. My name is Puddles. And don't ask about my day.

      I was playing my bass guitar (electric) and I'm fucking strumming some amazing shit because, hey I'm so damn good I make my man Flea look like a little bitch with Parkinsons. So anyway Its some nice shit and theres lyrics and I'm having an almost orgasmic experience jamming this shit out when suddenly the amp goes: krrrrrputputpuzzzzzbrrrrrrrr. Exactly like that. So I'm thinking "Shit is the amp fucked". So plug in my electric guitar and perfecto. So now I'm thinking "Sheet". Unscrew scratchpad and yep one of the wires is fucked and so is one of the pickups. Goddamn son of a bitch I hate that shit. Now I'm begging for this sweet electric blue smooth ass piece of shit maverick from my dad but he probably won't give me the money as it does cost 500 FUCKING quid. Dammit I hate this shit.
