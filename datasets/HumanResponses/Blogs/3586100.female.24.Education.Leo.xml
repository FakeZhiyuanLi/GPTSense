      At some point in my four years at Denison, I remember making the (yes, I know, somewhat  dubious ) connection between Simon and Garfunkel's "I am a Rock, I am an I-I-I-Island" and the "cultural personality" of Great Britain.  Despite discouragement in attributing this song by  American  folk artists to a comment on the psyche of the British nation, I feel that at least the refrain of this song says everything about our ancestral maternal nation.    And now, when the entire European community is faced with the ratifying of an EU constitution, Groß Britannia is once again asserting her sceptical, biting sarcasam mixed with a grave and insistent fear that she will lose her sovereignty, not to mention her credibility in light of Blair's Iraq soireé, both of which she considers to be in a delicate, but--as in all things British-- gradual , decline.  A friend of mine from Berlin who is as fiercely critical of Germany as I am of the United States insists that Britain's role as stubborn, but nonetheless respected, objector to the "federalising" of the European Union into a model akin, frighteningly enough, to the U.S. Federal government is  essential  to the survival of a balanced and better Europe.  For a vast majority of the time, however, Britain's stubbornness in refusing to join the Euro has angered many of my other friends from the continent, in addition to a fellow countryman and friend, who characterised Britain as a nation "disobedient" and unwilling to understand the European ethos.  Of course, this same friend also spent considerable time in the UK and as a result of a number of unfortunate factors--one of which was a residency in the nucleus of racial violence and tension in the UK--he was moved to almost completely denounce this country.  Indeed, if I had lived there, or had grown up in the nucleus of racial and ethnic tension in Britain, I too, would have felt very much the same as he did and perhaps still does.  The truth is, I live in cushy, benign Edinburgh, a jewel in the island's crown.  But like all jewels upon closer examination, one finds a lack of interesting visual depth thanks to the blinding ricochet of light across all of its sides.  Edinburgh sparkles, and enjoys a vibrant history and tourism industry, but she lacks the passionate, and defiant, pride of herself in the face of over a century of industrial exhaustion like that of her oft-overlooked sister city, Glasgow.  Since I am doing my PhD at Glasgow University and live in Edinburgh (both cities linked by a relatively high-speed rail line that reduces an hour-and-a-half journey to forty-five minutes), I have been able to revel in the bounties and be disdainful about the shortcomings of both.    I love my sister cities equally, and for different reasons.  But I shall post on that in the future.  What concerns me in this post is the Anglo-American matrix of politics, culture, and identity.  Okay, so that sentence is way too broad and way too ambitious for a blog  topic , let alone a blog posting.  Rather, I should say, being the egoist that this blog somehow requires me to be, how this matrix affects me when I travel between what I now consider to be my two homelands.   The first time I came back to the States since I began studying and living in Scotland in  the fall of 2002 was last November.  A year and a half outside of my country actually caused me to be  afraid  of going back to face it.  I had thus far enjoyed--and still do--a long and beautiful relationship with my boyfriend, Daniel, along with the gradual formation of a few friendships.  Last September, Jimmy and I moved in with our third flatmate, Marcelle, into 69 Arden Street, and began to develop a sort of "Victorian family" as Marcelle jokingly referred to us when we first moved into the place.  Everything seemed to come together into a steady balance in my life after a year of difficult adjustment to the loss of my Denison community and the need to build a new, but different, one.  Why was I so scared to leave the country for what would be such a short amount of time--two and a half weeks?  Partly, I must SHAMEFULLY admit, my fear was due to that infintesimal part of my American psyche which actually listens to the fear-mongering reports of terrorist attacks to come...and transatlantic flights certainly bring these images to the furore, whether you agree with the presentation of the images or not.    Another reason for my ambiguous fear was certainly the idea of having to face a place with which I will eternally identify myself with, but also a place which throws alot of oppositional weight against me.  Now that I have lived in a culture where cynicism and intense scepticism seem, at times, to be a way of life, going back to the fresh-faced, moral certainty and die-hard optimism of the United States almost seemed like attending a farcical parody of my current life.  I suddenly cringed at the public "loudness" of people in airports, even though I have been guilty of worse "loudness" both in the States and in the UK.  When the immigration official stamped my passport for re-entry into the  States, he had obviously glanced at my visa stamps for studying in the UK, since he remarked, "Welcome Back".  When he said that very phrase, I almost wanted to turn back to him and say, "Thanks for the kind gesture, but I'm not back  yet ."  The resoluteness of his "welcome back" reminded me of the days in which my Mother's friends often tried to convince me to stay in Youngstown and pursue a career there, often decrying some sort of reason that Hubbard, my hometown, was "where I belonged."  Now, walking through customs, I felt both overwhelmingly flattered at such an unusual comment coming from a stern INS official, and yet almost angry at him for supposing that I was somehow overjoyed to be back "where I belong."  No more at any other time in my life thus far did I so desire to have a dual citizenship, a concealed maroon European Union passport burning in another sachel pocket somewhere, an emblem of my second, and secret, community across the water.    As I write this, I fully realise the elitist privilege that comes with my feelings.   I know that there are hundreds of people out there who deserve a British passport far more than I do...namely, the hundreds of asylum seekers who come to Britain's shores annually, with whom the British government still has no idea how to deal humanely and effectively.  But I must concur that my desire for this dual citizenship would not be so resolute in me if I felt that the U.S. was successful at participating in the international community.  For me, coming back Stateside, in the first half-hour, is like being shut off from the life that I've built across the ocean.  Instead of the BBC and the Guardian, I have to make do with CNN, and FOX on airport televisions, but in print, I do have my friend who I miss terribly in Britain--the New Yorker.  It's the bombastic style with which our news anchors "blare" out the news that always strikes me with the most annoyance when I return...that and the fact that unless it's connected with Iraq, most international news gets little coverage.  This is not to say that British media outlets don't have their own selectiveness, but overall, I get a much bigger glimpse of the world reading a British newspaper than I do when I read an American one (with the exception of the New Yorker).      However, after about an hour or so back in the Pittsburgh airport last November, I began to grow back into the comfortable spaces of my previous life in Girard, beginning with a huddle into the chilly passenger-side seat of John's enormous 1984 Oldsmobile Royale (more boat than car).  And when I spent that long weekend before Thanksgiving in Cleveland with Sarah, Tara, Katie, and Kara, I felt completely restored to my place on both sides of the Atlantic.  In fact, I felt  more  connected to both of my lives after reuniting with Denison friends in Cleveland and Columbus that trip.  As I have said numerous times before, and I hope I will say numerous times in the future, the friendships that I have made at Denison prove time and time again to be some of the rarest and most privileged friendships that I will ever experience.  I know that when I return to a country that can seem so alien in its familiarity to me, these are the people who remind me, who give me back, what my home is in the United States.  And this home does not heed boundaries.  That "welcome back" can be reappropriated for my entrance back into this home, this place that I feel envelops the very personal space around me when I encounter these friends.  This is the America I love, the America that lives and smolders underneath the cacophony of everyday stress and cultural noise.  It's the America that every American deserves to have, and deserves to  pursue , to borrow a worn-out term from our forefathers' documents.    It is also to this very home that I will be initiated back into when I land in Columbus on the 12th of July this year, and when I again land in LAX on the 21st of July.  I will be crossing borders, time zones, and yet, it will seem like a mere train ride from Edinburgh to Glasgow once I am in the thick of wedding plans and long conversations.    Before this post wavers from its focus any more than it already has, I shall end this submission, with the intent to expand--evermore, in reality--on my experiences as an inconsequential, but rather LOUD expat.  And please, PLEASE contribute.  Don't let this be a mere monologue.    I love you all.

      This Sunday, thanks to Daniel (my Scotsman, for those of you who do not know) and his sister's 3-hour-long wait in the queue outside of the ticketing counter this past January, I was able to attend Scotland's only performance of the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Murrayfield Stadium, which is the home court for Scotland's National Rugby in Edinburgh.  For the first time, I got to experience the jostle-jostle, huddle-huddle of the standing crowd...i.e. "the pit" in Shakespearean terms.  We were about half-way down the field, which was pretty decent considering that over 50,000 people were expected at this concert; however, despite the huge projection screens placed on either side of the stage scaffolding, I was blocked of any real view of anything in front of me besides heads and backs.  Still, one goes in the crowd for crowd-spirit rather than visual accuracy, but what I realised is that, well...I'm old.  Not only do I like having a seat to recline in, but I also really began to appreciate the privilege one has in the stands--to altogether avoid hooligans who drink as much as they are determined to push through the already health-hazardous crowd to get to the stagefront.  I have to say that both Daniel and I are pretty much set on the idea of seated tickets, even if it does mean that the drummer's head squashes nicely between your forefinger and thumb. ;-)  As far as the band goes, I have to admit that I was even more impressed with the lyrical intelligence and musicianship of a band that could easily have sold out to the mainstream without losing record sales.  Sure, the crazy stuff off Blood Sugar Sex Magik was most definitely "pussy-oriented" and over-masculinised at times, but it's that unique energy, that refusal to simply strum chords that sound fast and loud, that has given the Red Hot Chili Peppers their distinctive style and what also allowed them to make such an astonishingly mature and vital contribution to popular rock music.  We're about a bass guitarist here--Flea--who can play faster than the band's own lead guitarist, in addition to beginning his career as a Jazz trumpeter (and let me add an astonishing one--during the encore, he gave a five-minute trumpet solo).  John Fruscanti, the lead guitarist, also single-handedly does all of the high-falsetto back-up singing for Anthony Kiedis, and his falsetto, which you often lose when you listen to their studio albums, could put many tenors to shame (but not any of the ones I know, of course).   HOWEVER, I must admit that Daniel and I would have enjoyed Sunday's show alot more if we hadn't heard Chilis music on a weekly basis.  The songs are amazing--particularly off Californication--but like anything else, you can most certainly have too much of a good thing.  On the other hand, when I've seen Ani DiFranco or Tori Amos in concert, it was often during times in my life where all I mainly listened to were Ani and Tori--perhaps it has more to do with the venue than the music itself.  I was in the back row of my first Tori concert, and she was a microscopic speck, but I somehow felt immensely more connected to her performance than I did to the Chilis' on Sunday.  Or perhaps--and this is a good thing--I have grown past that stage in my life where I allowed my music to define my emotional and spiritual identity.  Or maybe it was simply the fact that I had to stand on my feet in one place for 5 hours straight. Hmmm.

      Because I am immensely jealous of those who have set up blogs that make excellent use of discussion in a responsible and interesting manner, I too, will attempt to evolve this meager blogspot into a forum that I hope will be not only useful in facilitating discussion on a variety of public (and semi-personal) matters, but also a place where I can ground aspects of my own PhD research through presenting it in a concise manner on the web.    I may or may not reach all of these objectives, but hey, optimism's always worth at least one try. ;-)

       This entry is disgustingly short, but is merely a reassurance that I am still intent on actively blogging...it's just that I landed in the States about five days ago and haven't really stopped running around, reading, eating, drinking coffee, and visiting since I arrived!&nbsp; (Not to mention that I had to use the previous two weeks to prepare for this trip in the midst of a fast-approaching PhD deadline.)&nbsp; But I will be updating soon, especially in light of the tantalising new features in the Blogger dashboard just recently added.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;   &nbsp; It's truly disgusting how much I love Lucida Grande.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And how excited I am to once again see Graham crackers and pretzels on the grocery store shelves.&nbsp; And  sour  kosher dill pickles.&nbsp;  &nbsp; All I need now to complete my "tastes of home" binging is three or four cobs of bright yellow corn, drenched in butter and salt... &nbsp; Just one brief thought in relation&nbsp;to Americans "returning" to America: Sarah Borron said the best sentence I've heard in days on Friday afternoon. &nbsp; "You see, I've developed a little crush on our country, America." &nbsp; Echoed in the lyrics of Scottish-born, but American-bred, David Byrne, "Can I afford to move above my station? I'm not the only heart you've conquered."&nbsp;&nbsp; ("Miss America", from Feelings ) &nbsp; (By the way, I feel it is only appropriate at this time to thank the Gingrich clan of Annville, PA for introducing David Byrne to me in the summer of 2002.&nbsp; Since musical knowledge and choice&nbsp;are often used as rubrics for one's cultural savvy and emotional/intellectual capacity, I feel it only fair to acknowledge those who placed such pivotal pieces&nbsp;in my reperatoire.&nbsp; However, basing one's judgement of an individual on their CD or mp3 collection is pretty shallow and lame...and yet, I feel that many of us at one time or another--particularly during undergrad, seem to have done it with someone we either adored deeply or despised immensely.&nbsp; In reality, I often&nbsp;conjure up&nbsp;my memories of specific people with the music they once&nbsp;introduced me to.&nbsp;  &nbsp; By the way, Brad, this is my que to thank you for permanently altering my conception of pop music...or rather, for  rescuing  me from my previous conceptions of pop music.&nbsp; And do I ever&nbsp;miss your radio show.)

      In the midst of attempting to find a USEFUL map of the United States online, Daniel and I instead found lots of information on cross-country RVing materials.  For those of you who are unaware of the American RVing culture (RV, meaning "recreational vehicle"), it's basically the concept of piling your entire immediate family--and perhaps a few non-smelly friends--into a vehicle that is neither truck nor trailer, but a huge, clumsy lovechild of the two.  The intention is that you and your squashed posse will venture across the United States--or at least over to Aunt Verna's 300 miles away, where she'll let you park the beast in her already sun-parched lawn--in pursuit of a cheap and somewhat "character-building" holiday experience.  Plus, you never have to worry about hotel or motel vacancies, but of course, when you carry your house with you, you do have to pay other people to put up with it on their property (i.e. campgrounds).    HOWEVER, a certain site cheerfully reports that for those RVers on a tight budget, over 3,500 WAL-MART stores across the nation will allow your tired and whiney family to spend the night in their parking lots for free: http://www.newrver.com/.  Wow.  And and if that offer wasn't enticing enough on its own, newrver.com offers their clientele a 195-page directory, complete with detailed driving directions, of practically all of the the WAL-MARTs one can find in the 48 continental United States.  Below is the description of this must-have for all avid RV adventurers.    (found on http://rvbookstore.com/shop/detail.aspx?m=2&p=185)      Wal-Mart Locator, 2004  Wal-Mart isn’t a campground, but you might think otherwise some evenings when the corner of a store’s parking lot may be occupied by a few or even a few dozen RVers who are "camped" for the night. Most Wal-Mart stores permit an overnight stay in a self-contained RV, and that’s where this directory comes in very handy.   While Wal-Mart sells an atlas that lists the addresses of its stores, the atlas doesn’t provide driving directions, which can make finding some stores downright difficult. The 2004 Wal-Mart Locator, on the other hand, does provide specific driving directions, enabling RVers to easily locate more than 3,500 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in the 48 states.   Most RVers stay at a Wal-Mart when they need a place to get a night’s rest and a campground isn’t handy. They don’t mind the price tag either: free. Others routinely plan their travels to include an overnight stop at a Wal-Mart store. Saving the $20 or $30 (or more!) they would pay at a campground can help offset high fuel prices.   The Wal-Mart Locator includes state maps, which provide a general idea of store locations. From that, they can find specific stores with information about which exit to take off a highway or Interstate, and where to go after that. The directory also includes store Zip Codes for use in aiming TV satellite dishes.   The authors of the popular guide are veteran RVers who found it challenging to find Wal-Marts as they traveled. So they decided to create an easy-to-use directory that would make the task easy. They succeeded. 195 pages. Published 2004. $19.95    Wow.  Imagine that one of your greatest ambitions in contributing to this "bustling" culture was to ease the "challenges" of finding a WAL-MART on one's journey throughout the States.    It certainly makes one re-evaluate one's thoughts on that trip to Vancouver, or to Paris, doesn't it?  I mean, with prospects of plopping down in front of that big, luminous marquis that is identical to the one that shines across the road from you at home, it just makes you wonder why you even venture to think about leaving the county borders, let alone the country.  In fact, there's a 24-hour Super WAL-MART just 20 miles away, with a perfectly in-tact marquis (and a mean crop of donuts in the early morning, I'm told) and clean restrooms (I should know, I use them at least twice a week), so why bother taking the kids to the Grand Canyon, when all they really want to do is wander around the isles first thing in the morning, chomping on donuts and slurping their sugar-encrusted slush-puppies?

      Indeed, Brad, you are correct to call me on my attempt to join the aesthetics of PJ Harvey and Virginia Woolf.  Actually, my intention was not so much to join their aesthetic causes as to point out that Woolf would no doubt be impressed by the fact that ideas of female independence, particularly outside of marriage, have infiltrated into the psyche of popular culture.    However, Woolf may also have detested a voice like Harvey's for the mere fact that Woolf hated "feminism" and those women who participated as social activists, even if she was supportive of their cause, like the suffragists (not to be confused with the more fanatical branch, the  suffragettes ).  PJ Harvey isn't a social activist, but she is a voice within popular culture that demonstrates one current definition of femininity to which women in Woolf's time did not have such easy access.    But you're right Brad.  I mean, Jesus, "Lick my legs, I'm on Fire"   versus    The trumpeters, ranging themselves side by side in order, blow one terrific blast:-- "THE TRUTH!" at which Orlando awoke. He stretched himself.  He rose.  He stood upright in complete nakedness before us, and while the trumpets pealed Truth! Truth! Truth! we have no choice left but confess--he was a woman. ( Orlando , Penguin Classics 2000 edition, page 97)   Clearly, we know who wins when it comes to literary prowess (not to mention the redefinition of femininity).  I've often thought recently how funny it would be to bring people from the last 100 years into our era if we had such a means to do it.  I think Woolf, who would be at first horrified by the polarisation of political opinion and the loudness and vulgarity of our popular culture, would eventually begin to laugh...and perhaps not stop for quite a while (which, apparently, she was known to do, in addition to having a notorious, and sometimes  disturbing  laugh).    I mean, just imagine Woolf and Orwell in a room listening to "Sabotage" by the Beastie Boys, or "She Lives in My Lap" by Outkast.    It's sad, boys and girls, but that image thoroughly amuses me.  (To be honest, the only popular musical artists of today that I can think of who would come even close to the literary sensibility and wit of Woolf would be Dar Williams, Joni Mitchell, and Aimee Mann, with a bit of David Byrne and Jim White occasionally thrown in there. Perhaps even the Pogues.   Definitely  Christy Moore.  And a few songs by the Indigo Girls, especially "Reunion":   All you pretty pretenders Negligent vendors Aren't you precious inside? I have no need for anger With intimate strangers And I got nothing to hide )

      After re-reading today's post a third time, I have finally come to realise my inadequacy in completing ANY LINE OF THINKING which I initiate at the beginning of any piece of writing.    If only I thought in spider webs rather than tree trunks and tree branches.   Yet another skill to add to the list of "blog aesthetics".  (No wonder I've never been able to write a coherent essay.)  On a final note, I'd like to clarify the passage in which I asserted that I wished this blog, partly, to be an exploration of "Marianne, the graduate student and person."  Perhaps a more lucid way of expressing this would be "Marianne, an apprentice to the academy, as well as to ideological tolerance, and Marianne, your friend."  Okay, I'm off now to listen to PJ Harvey.  Her new album sounds quite good to me, but of course, I do not have any knowledge of her work previous to "Stories of the City, Stories by the Sea" (save for the song "Rid of Me", which one of my friends once played for me in the hopes that PJ's anger growling through the words "lick my legs, I'm on fire!" would inspire my own rage-filled revolution of personal assertion).  My favourite song so far on the album: "Pocketknife":   Please don't make my wedding dress I'm too young to marry yet Can you see my pocketknife? You can't make me be your wife.   I think Woolf would be proud of our PJ.  Or be scared of her.

      I would like to take these few lines to express a sincere gratitude to Mr. Reed, who has a most excellent (and far superior and long-running) blog at http://www.livejournal.com/users/bradreed/.  His aesthetic recommendations will most certainly be heeded in the future, and in light of those suggestions, I must apologise to my readers for my lack of understanding the need for paragraphs.    So, let this entry be the beginning of a much more sound blog aesthetic.   P.S. I also would like to apologise for the rather scathing critique of other blogs which I included the email which I sent out to actually inform people of this blog's existence.  The critique was meant to be more ironic than seriously critical.  The great thing about blogs is that EVERYONE has access to publishing their thoughts--whether personal, political, or in relation to a specific project--on the web without the tangles and bureaucracy (not to mention the money) of traditional publishing.  What I meant to say was that I hope my blog can, eventually, develop into a resource of cultural, as well as personal, dialogue with all those who wish to read it and to contribute to it.    When you're writing a PhD, you often get sealed in your insularity, and especially with the "ghosts" of your authors.  For instance, I've been reading the gigantic tome that is Hermione Lee's comprehensive biography of Virginia Woolf.  Over the last few days, I am finally realising why some of those crazed feminist critics part of--but certainly not all     of--the American school of Woolfians who wish to canonise "St. Virginia" (as one critic referred to the process) really begin to feel as if they "know" Virginia, and dammit, how no one else does.  If there are any Woolfites out there, do pick it up if you can--it's a very compelling, but exquisitely balanced narrative of Woolf's life.    But back to my original point: this insularity really makes me wish to have a greater dialogue with others about my work, as well as about my position and identity as "Marianne, the graduate student and person."  And who better to have this dialogue with than the people who've known me best, as well as people who've known me fairly well, even if for a shorter period of time?    I've changed a great deal since I left Denison, and yet, I find myself evermore striving to reappropriate the experiences and knowledge I gained there to the spaces of my life here in Edinburgh and Glasgow.  I feel that because I now have a great gulf of two years between myself and our graduation, I can finally begin to put into words what happened to me, and to indeed all of us, while we were there for four years.    "Is it not possible--I often wonder--that things we have felt with great intensity have an existence independent of our minds; are in fact still in existence?  And if so, will it not be possible, in time, that some device will be invented by which we can tap them?  I see it--the past--as an avenue lying behind; a long ribbon of scenes, emotions[...]Instead of remembering here a scene and there a sound, I shall fit a plug into the wall; and listen in to the past.  I shall turn up August 1890.  I feel that strong emotion must leave its trace; and it is only a question of discovering how we can get ourselves again attached to it, so that we shall be able to live our lives through from the start."   Moments of Being , Virginia Woolf
