      I seduced the boy downstairs the other night.  I seduced the boy downstairs the other night and I regretted it immediately. I seduced the boy downstairs the other night and my body screamed it's opposition, its silent protest. It went numb and limp and I stared at the ceiling and talked to it, mouthing words in the dark. I seduced the boy downstairs the other night, at least part of him. The part of him I never wanted, the part of him I hadn't intended, the part of him that came with too much beer and the way my strategically placed hand had grazed his groin. Deliberate, slow, searching. My eyes pled, my words spilt. "Do you like it this way?" I want love love love love crazy love... not this. But I will settle. I will contort and be this broad. This moment. I will put on this mask and move my body in all the appropriate ways. I wil be lithe and you will want me.  I seduced the boy downstairs the other night and I regretted it instantly. I realized as he grew hungrier what I had known all along. I do not want this. Some man, grinding grinding grinding me to a fine powder. My eyes were hard and my body rigid. I do not want this- what I created, what I had ellicited.  He had turned his head, earlier on the porch. He had grown uncomfortable as my projections dribbled from me to a puddle at our feet. We did not speak the same language. He could not understand me and he wasn't interested in learning. He had turned his head and I tried to write it off... write it in words I would listen to. But I don't listen.  I had another beer and sang a song on stage in front of strangers... I seduced the boy downstairs the other night after he told me we weren't on the same page; hadn't been all along when I was at the beach with him, driving long car rides with him, walking in the rain with him. In my head, anyway.  I seduced the boy downstairs the other night but stopped it. Stopped it over and over in one mind-fuck of a dance.... no, again, yes, no, I'm leaving... his hands on my body were just that. I was aware that the mind fuck was ultimately on me. That pleasure of pleasures sake is someone else's construct; not necessarily fabricated, just something that never encompassed me. The words were stamped on my hands as I stared at them over his shoulder- this is not pleasure.  I woke up and my mouth was rough and dry. I looked over at this sleeping guy and noticed the imperfections on his skin. They glared at me like my own faults and I remembered this feeling from some other time, some other bed, some other room.

      The sky is so full it looks like you could walk right up to the horizon and slip into it. Unnoticed, unmissed. Today is Wednesday and that means a decision between debaucahery and the road less travelled.

      A Rainy Sunday Evening...Mama said there'd by days like this, there'd be days like this my mama said.Somehow I stepped outside of the bounds in the last week, and I've been tracing the same circle in the margins since... I found myself at a party last night, wondering loose in a crowd of strangers, seeking some sort of connection, some moment where it would all fit for one achingly static moment. I was looking for everything and nothing, knowing I would come out on the other end in the rain on this Sunday evening. Staring at my computer screen, wondering what the hell I've spent the past week trying to find.

      Are you in love with the men or the circumstance? because I've never met your men but I fall in love with the words. I fall in love with them because of the story. I know a man and our story would have been beautiful. Full of fires and friends and cuddles, and a gang of young cats out to take on the world. We would have made love in the morning before school, and he would have brought me a bowl of Vector in his pjs. My stories are frequently would haves. I have had our relationship in my head, and why couldn't he see how much fun we were having? I miss him and I've never kissed him.Truth.We will see each other when you come. I'm awaiting your arrival. The door is unlocked.
