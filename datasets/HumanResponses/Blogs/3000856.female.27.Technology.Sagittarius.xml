      Ok weekend I guess.  Brought Haley and Collen to see scooby doo 2.  Nightmare w/ a 4yr old and a 7 yr old that bicker constantly. LOL Sat went to go see Mike and the boys play w/ some AC DC cover band that totally sucked! Really thinking about this job thing.  Wondering if it will interfere w/ the band.  God, I hope not.  It shouldn't I was told I will only work Mon-Fri but may work an occasional Sat. Why can't anything come easy to me? That would be asking too much. Sent my resume to Loyola, so maybe I will hear something from that. I guess all I can do is wait and see.

      Ok so I have not blogged in a few days.  Here is my week so far. Viral infection in my eye, sinus infection and still have that f.ing headache! Blah! Found an apartment which is huge, probably going to room w/ Aaron and Mike if it all goes through but it is not available till May.  Don't think I can wait that long.  Jammed w/ Jetless.  It kicked ass although I was sick and this whole experience will take a little getting used to, but I love it! Found out I will not have a job after the next couple of months. (getting laid off) The good news is I was offered a job for ZT Technical Services, doing the NCV's and SSEP's and Spinal/Musculoskeletal Diagnostic Ultrasounds, the bad news is I am required to travel out of state every so often and being a single mom that will be difficult to do at times.  Hopefully my family will support me on this! I wish the sperm donor would help more. Hah I have good and bad things going on right now, but like I always do, I will get through them. I just have to keep fighting and look at the positives of everything. At least I have my health ( I hope) my family and my friends, right? That is all I need! Oh yeah we can't forget about the band. LOL

      So I had a pretty productive weekend I guess. Did some stuff to my car.  Went to Kevin's b-day Sat night. Have not seen him in forever! Lots of people we all had fun.  Did a lot of singing as usual.  Everyone is always wanting me to sing.  I love it though. Was out real late or early however you look at it.  I still have that guy from a band I tried out for calling me.  That whole band wants me so bad, but I just didn't feel it w/ them. (if that makes any sence) Although, this whole Jetless thing is really going nowhere presently. Can never get everyone together to jam.  The drummer is out of the country. I really want to be part of this, but truthfully I hope I am not wasting my time. I really get the feeling that Anne is not gone, and I am going to get brushed aside some how.  I hope that's not what is going on, but it is in the back of my head. I feel as though this has a lot of potential. I had a wake today. Yes another one! Mrs F, a old friend of the family.  She was 96. She saw it all let me tell you. Went to dinner w/ my parents and now dealing w/ this fricking eye infection that I have. Now I need to get to sleep.

      Crazy day.  Shopped, looked for apt's and had my car looked at.  Came home and slept for a couple of hours.  Seriously think I am coming down w/ something.  Worked on the songs that John gave me. I am getting so ancy cause I want to jam so bad.  I asked Mike to do a show w/ us on the 22 of May. He has to look and see what other shows he has booked.  Man that would be so weird doing a show w/ V90!  Cool, but weird.  Started writing a song.  The lyrics that I have been writing are very depressing though. Of course it is about the whole situation w/ Vic.  It was 2 months ago yesterday that all of this started and it still affects me like it was yesterday.  I so badly want to talk to Shannon, but I am sure we will never speak again.  I hope she is doing ok.  She can't handle a lot going on at once and w/ planning her wedding and her band and her son she has a lot on her plate right now.  Tomorrow is Friday and I am so glad. Going to be busy all weekend.  Will I ever get a day to just vedge? Yeah, when I am dead. LOL

      So today was the South Side Irish Parade and of course all of the drunks were out.  I got pretty loaded myself.  It was a good time though.  My brother-in-laws cousin was hitting on me right in front of his girlfriend so that was awkward.  I did not want to be a bitch but at the same time I wanted him to lay off.  Some people just get so stupid when they are drunk.  We had fun though.  My bro played the guitar while I sang.  By the way....I am in this band now.  Pretty exciting but very nerve wrecking.   The guys seem pretty cool and a lot of fun. I can't wait till everything really gets set in motion.  It looks really promising.  I miss Shannon as usual and I am scared that I will run into her doing a gig.  That would be very awkward and strange.  Eventually I will get over this whole ordeal. I have to get some sleep now it has been a very long weekend.

      What a shitty new year! If I could only go back and change things. Isn't that what we all say. So here goes my year so far. It starts off I was dating this guy. Amazing, sweet, smart, funny, great conversationalist, and damn good looking.(anyway) Everything was perfect and he said it was moving to fast and we needed to slow down. No biggie even though it was hard. Three weeks later I was PREGNANT! Damn, after going to the dr and all kinds of fun tests, I was told I had a mass on my uterus. This just keeps getting better and better I tell ya.  After telling my best friend I decided to tell him, and it was hard let me tell ya. Everything went to shit after that. I was trying to stay open w/ him but at the same time keep it a secret from my family. There was one thing I forgot to mention.  He was under the impression that I was on the pill. Not because I told him that, but because I never clarified. My bad I know. So when he reasked the question, stupid me lied to cover it up. I did not want him to think I in anyway tried to trap him or did this on purpose. Crazy I tell ya. I ended up in the emergency room and had a miscarriage, an apandectomy and had the mass removed. Now here is the kicker. Just when you think you can't get any lower right? WRONG! I told the nurses that I wanted no one to know about anything except the apendectomy because I had kept this a secret from everyone except a couple of people. So when my best friend went to ask how I was with the other situations they told her nothing. So from that point on she thought the whole thing was made up, and instead of her coming back into my room to figure out what was going on...... she left and never came back.  She emailed me a couple of days later and I emailed her back but she wanted nothing to do w/ me.  I had to come clean w/ my family and let them know everything that was going on.  That was so hard let me tell ya. I have since mailed her the reports so she knew that I did not lie to her. I emailed him to come clean and he wants nothing to do w/ me anymore. I can't blame him though.  I miss them both, but I miss my best friend the most. It has been so hard the past couple of months w/ out her. Will she ever speak to me again?  I hope so. If not well maybe everyone is right when they say maybe she was not that good of a friend in the first place. Is this a glimpse into the rest of the year. If it is I would just like to sleep through the whole damn thing! GOOD NIGHT!

      Ok here's the part where I panic.  I have been crazy go nuts lately.  Between moving, my ccd class having practice for their communion, my son was sick blah blah blah.  Anyway, I guess I am doing a show on the 14th and am scared I will forget the words.  Am I ready for this? Ready or not this is it! I am not telling anyone about this show.  For 2 reasons actually 1. We are doing the show as Cased not Jetless 2. I want to get the feel of everything w/ the band and 3. I am nervous as hell! Ok make that 3 AAAGGGHHH My cornea is still swollen, went to the Dr's yesterday and they gave me another drop w/ some steroid in it.  I would like full vision back thank you very much. Ok need to get back to work. Wish me luck this weekend.

      Ok here I go again..... Busy weekend, went to Malise's, worked on my car, shopped, bought a couple of new CD's, spent time w/ my sister and the family. This whole next week is going to be one big cluster fuck.  I have to get my car worked on, work, my 2nd grade ccd class that I teach has communion practice twice this week, teach, I am moving and I have to fit in practice w/ the band.  No rest for the wicked. What little sanity I have left will be gone this time next week. Oh yeah cubs won, won, won baby! Rawk on.  Jeff Gordon took first today w/ Jr at a close second.  Kick ass. Although my guy is #38 the m&m's car Eliot Saddler, he took 28th.  Boo hoo. Oh well.  I needs to get some sleep.

      Very pissed off right now.  After all the house hunting I have been doing, it looks like I am going to have to get an apt for the time being.  Can't find shit in the area I want to go to.  Sending resumes everywhere and still nothing.  Man what the hell is going on?  What is going on w/ my life right now? Why is it everything is in the negative and not the positive? Oh well enough about poor me. LOL Long weekend planned.  So much to do, so many appointments and lists of things to get done.  Yeah.  Someone told me they think I am going to give up my old friends for my new friends in the band.  WHAT? That makes me mad.  Anyone that knows me also knows that I never trade one for the other.  There is only one of me, but I will still divide my time.

      Man I have like no time lately.  Anyway....Good practice on Tuesday.  You know the book where's Waldo? Well I am going to have to make a where's Jeff book. LOL Work has been crazy go nuts! Having an issue w/ my single life right now.  In many ways I want and like being single because of my life and what it entails.  I can't handle many things that go along w/ relationships. On the other hand as I watch my married friends and some of my friends getting married I start to wonder if I will be alone my whole life!  Maybe I will be the cat lady! OMG. I can see it now. Right now my focus is on the band, my family and friends (not necessarily in that order) Although my friends seem to think I have fallen off the face of the earth.  I have not hung out w/ anyone in over a month. I saw Mike yesterday when I picked up my mic cable from Axis music.  He was so weird towards me cause I am never around. Oh well he will get over it. Need to get my butt back to work. Oh yeah and I will be putting my archives back soon.

        Awesome f...ing weekend!    The weather was beautiful, great practice Sat night.  Went and did the whole band politics thing.  You know have your face be seen, talk and meet others.  Anyway it was cool had lots of fun.  Drank absolute and cranberry....Note to self.  Bad hangovers the next day. :-P  John's birthday was Sun. (bass player) Old man. LOL Anyway If all goes well which I can't see why it wouldn't, I am doing the show on the 22 of May.  Woo hoo. Anyway had to take my archives down for a while cause someone read them who probably should not have and I think I may have gotten someone in a little trouble.  Anyway, if people were fucking honest this would not be an issue right now, but I am going to put them up again just have to let things settle down a bit.  I should find out about that house today also.  Keep your fingers crossed.  I have to go I am at work, but I will try and blog more later.

      I am in lots of pain, drugged up and can see only fuzz and colors right now so if my spelling is horrendous I am sorry.  I got something in my eye yesterday at work and me like a dummy kept rubbing my eye instead of taking out my contact.  One of the dr's finally told me how irritated it looked and to take the contact out and flush out my eye. Anyway, because I kept rubbing it I scratched my cornea.  I can barely open it and it is so sensitive to light.  Dr said it should be better in a few days.  I can't stand it anymore.  I am ready to gouge it out w/ a fork! LOL I know pretty boring stuff to read! Sorry I will make it more exciting soon.

       Happy Easter !  It has been a crazy weekend. Between getting things done for the kids and the regular every day activities.  I just want to relax for 2 min. That would be nice.  Went and saw Melissa and the kids for a bit today. Her and I have been friends for 17 yrs! We don't get to see eachother often, but we are always there for each other.  We have very different life styles, but we are still good friends.  I get to get up and face another wonderful day at work tomorrow.  Still looking for jobs and houses and no luck in either dept right now.  My luck of course! Can't wait to practice again.  I want to nail these songs!  I work on them a little by myself, but it is not the same as practicing w/ the band. Plus I love the atmosphere when practicing, it makes me feel really good. I guess that is why I love it so much. Need to get back to the family.

      Ok I am at work right now. Not really busy, but steady I guess.  It's Friday! Woo hoo! Going to look at a house and color Easter Eggs w/ Collen, Haley, and Joey. I am thinking about getting a boob job.  I feel I need them lifted and slightly bigger.  I wish I could get other plastic surgery, but god knows I will not be able to afford it. I want to get my eye brow pierced too.  Am I going through some mid-life crisis? I don't know. My family seems to think so. LOL Going to be a very long weekend.

      Damn I love Amy Lee's voice.  Amazing.  Anyway I had it out w/ my ex today. Imagine that. Yeah, like that is anything new. LOL If it does not go his way he freaks out.  Of course I am always the bad person.  I'll just sit there and take his criticism and insults. I have been dealing w/ all of that for 12 yrs and we have been broken up for 5 yrs. Go figure. I wish he would just vanish, but we have a son together so I am stuck w/ him in my life forever! Man that is a really long time.  Need to look for jobs and houses so I need to get my ass in gear. Me, Charity Marie Benevelli vows from this time on not to let the little things get to me and focus on what is important.  My son and family,my friends, the band, my job and what ever else that may come along that will be important to me.

      BLAH BLAH BLAH Ok freaking out right now.  I had John give me a dvd of Anne who fronted for their band cased.  I am now wondering if I can do this for this band. I don't have doubts about my talents, but the difference between her and I is crazy! I really feel I would let them down in one form or another. What to do what to do. I guess just be me is all I can do and hopefully that is good enough. I am going to be scared as shit my first show w/ them not because of the crowd but because I will be so worried about what is going through the boys heads during the show. I need to sleep. Lack of sleep makes me get all goofy!

      Practiced w/ John last night.  Went ok I guess. IF I WOULD NOT FUCK UP! I was just really tired and kept zoning, but anyway it's coming along I guess. I have to bust ass if I want to do these shows coming up which I do.  In the next couple of weeks any free time I have I am going to have to work on these songs. He gave me a DVD to watch of them w/ Anne.  Don't imitate her he says as he was leaving.  Imitate her? Man I don't imitate anyone, I am myself and always will be. LOL That could not necessarily be a good thing.  Ha ha ha Talked to Mr Mike on the way home, the group misses me. I don't go out much anymore.  I have like no time these days, and they wanted me to go out but they have to understand that if I have the opportunity to practice that will be first priority. They all should, they are all musicians. I just checked my email and he emailed me a simple note saying "love u" How should I take that? You never know w/ him. Not going to even ask him about it cause he will get all bent out of shape. Although I do remember emailing something to all my friends months ago about love and he replied telling me love was non existent! He really hurt my feelings, but it won't be the first or last time I'm sure.  We have such a bizarre friendship, but I love him anyway. Anyhow hopefully I will be practicing again this Sat night. We will see what happens! Laterz

      It has been brought to my attention that I need to just get over my situation. And ya know what? It is time, but first I need to explain how Shannon and I met to help a bit w/ this situation.  Shannon and I met under very strange and hurtful circumstances and I always thought if we could build a friendship out of that we would always be friends.  We met at the end of July beginning of August sometime.  I was dating someone who shall remain nameless and he walked in w/ this girl.  Of course my first reaction was (what the f..?) He assured me they were friends from way back and she was having man troubles.  Yeah little ol naive me! The next time I saw her was at this persons show. She came alone so I walked up to her and we started talking.  She was very sweet and we hit it off right away.  Well after many beers and lots of dancing, turns out we were both sleeping w/ him w/ in days of eachother and he was telling each of us the same f.ing stories.  Man it hurt, but for some reason we leaned on eachother and got over it fast.  During the process of all this we found out we had much in common. I realized through all of this that she had been cheating on her now fiance and was still very much hung up on this person, but I was not going to judge her.  She was a great person regardless. (in my eyes anyway) This whole situation pisses me off cause she is upset w/ me cause I lied but she has done it many times to me, friends and her fiance.  When he was on a ski trip she was hangin w/ someone she probably should not have until 4 am and I know if her fiance found out.  (OH SHIT) is all I have to say. Anyway, maybe one day her and I will talk again.  I still love her and want to be her friend  even though others tell me I don't need friends like her and she should have been by my side regardless.  I don't know maybe that is the case, but I still don't hate her.

      Ok have not blogged in a week, so I will try and sum the whole week up.  The DSL has been down so I have been going nuts w/ out internet access, but it is working again.  Still been sick.  Had a really bad Vic and Shannon week for some reason.  I miss them both and had some crazy dreams about both of them. Got my 2 inches cut off my hair, and put some funky colors in the front.  Collen (my son) has been acting up lately. I lost the job I was given, I got a modeling shoot, but it is in Colorado so I have to pass on it, and not sure what is going on w/ my apt because they called me saying the people who live there may be staying another year! F..ed up week I tell ya.  I have practice this afternoon, but don't know what will happen w/ that cause John just told me to sit tight because he got some message from Jeff (the drummer) I have been in depression mode again.  It does not affect me like most, but with me having Seasonal Affected Disorder I just wish we could skip through the winter.  This winter has been the worst for me yet. I am dealing though. I wrote some lyrics, but I am going crazy because the way I write is so different from the way John writes and I just can't grasp the concept of the way he writes.  AAGGGHHH! I am sure I am missing something but that is about it for the week.

      I had a pretty good weekend considering.  I was supposed to go camping w/ the guys but I was stuck on call the whole weekend at the hospital.  I got called in twice but I need the money so it's ok I guess.  Fri stayed in a chilled, Sat got called into the hospital came home cleaned and put up the shades and went out to Wrigleyville to hang w/ Jeremy.  I feel bad though cause I was so tired and I was really just blah. Sat got called into work again, went to lunch w/ an old friend, picked up Collen from Sean's, went to blockbuster to rent movies, went grocery shopping and was stuck in a horrible thunderstorm.  It was cool though I ran and played in it when I got home.  My son thought I was crazy! It was fun I had not done that in a long time.  I love the rain it just does something to me. I am waiting to hear from my sister right now.  My bro-in-law brought her to the hospital, possible appendicitis.  Man between her and I. I am supposed to go over their tomorrow to hang for the holiday. I am gonna watch my flicks I rented. Laterz

      This is an email from my sister Jen that I wanted to share.


 In a message dated 05/25/2004 11:52:34 AM Central Daylight Time, cbenevelli@yahoo.com writes:

I am going to get a second opinion before I take any meds or do anything else, but as of now I am fine.  I am doing my research so don't worry. All I ask is for everyone not to make a big deal out of this because I don't want this taking over my life. Thanks and I love u. 

Keep us posted, Charity.  Let us know what the developments are.
Something about your blogging too.  Since I spent thousands of dollars in therapy over the last couple years, I thought I might share some it with you.  I've learned that all of us have deprivations.  There are deprivations of some form or another in everyone's lives before the time they're 6.  If these needs are not met, you spend the rest of your life trying to compensate for those needs.  The trick is to know what they are and try to be aware of them.  Here, this part.....

 I have this rough exterior, but inside I feel like that scared little girl still waiting for her mom to come back and take care of her. Don't get me wrong my dad and my step mom did an amazing job and I love and respect them more than anything for being who they are and doing what they did. I just have this missing link that I am trying to find. The problem is I think I was a mistake not only to my young parents, but I think god made a mistake by putting me on this earth. 

This could be the area of your deprivation and whoever comes into your life might fill that for a time and then still leave you searching.  I don't know if this is the area, or one of the areas for you.  Everyone has them and everyone is searching to have those needs filled.  The person I went to for counseling said, "our needs are met perfectly, temporarily" and "our needs are met in relationships."  The second is obvious, but for the first it explained for me why some friends were sssssooooo important for a time and then stopped being so.  This stuff is just a springboard to finding out what the areas of deprivation are and how to deal with them.  And its ok that our needs are met in people - they have to be!  The idea is to be aware of it and that helps alot.  
       Is any of this helpful at all?

I love you.
Jen

      Not doing so well today.  Headache, hands shaking and tingling pretty bad.  Mostly nerves I think. Paying bills and figuring out when my sisters are coming in.  I am paying to fly them both out here.  I am very excited about meeting them for the first time, but I am gonna be so broke.  Between my vacation and flying them both out here and paying off a bunch of shit, man I am gonna be one poor mother fucker! I know I am gonna need a new car by the fall. That is why I am paying off everything I can now.  I am thinking about getting another part time job making cash for the time being.  I found out today I am secure w/ my job at least until the end of summer.  I am still looking, but at least I don't have to be in such a panic right now.  With all of this shit I need I have no idea how I am gonna pull this off.  Its not like I can get rid of anything cause I need everything that I have.  I payed off all my credit cards and my student loans so at least those are taken care of. Now I am just paying off stupid hospital bills and other bills that Sean left me w/ and I am still dealing with.  I should be fine by the end of summer.  Broke but fine. 3 more weeks till we leave for FL! Yeah I can't wait and Collen is so excited also. I have to figure out what I will do w/ Dena and Kelly when they fly in from Cali. They have never been to Chicago before.  I want to make it really cool for them.  Probably hit downtown, the zoo visit family and all that fun stuff.  I will figure it out, I have a little time left.  Time for me to relax and veg out tonight w/ a movie! Holy cow I can't believe I am actually gonna veg.  Now if I can have the opportunity to do it for a whole day now that will be a treat!

      Went shopping today after a short day at work.  Looking for clothes for shows and swim suits for Florida.  I am leaving in 3 weeks.  I am so stoked! Collen and I really need this and to be able to spend time w/ Jen will be cool too.  It will be Collen, me, Jen, Jim, Jens dad and her little brother Mike.  Her dad already volunteered to watch the kids at night so Jim, her and I can hang. Talk about a perfect vacation.  I am glad we will get to hit all the Disney parks and water parks and we are going to Universal for 1 day.  We have a full schedule. Can't wait. I am gonna relax and have a good time and not worry about my disease, work, fucked up people in my life that I give way to much credit to or any other stupid shit! I need a new digital camera though.  The one I had got stolen.  I will go crazy w/ out being able to check my email that week.  OMG My day won't be complete not being able to email stupid crap back and forth all day to John and Paul. Having those 2 in my life is really a blessing. I feel that finding that add and actually replying to it has changed my life in a way. Those 2 are becoming very good friends of mine and I am grateful for them both. EVEN WHEN THEY GIVE ME SHIT! Enough for now, need to continue job searching.

      So here it is.....I was diagnosed w/ a mild form of MS. How do I feel? Scared, yet ok, yet not. Make sense? Probably not. I don't make sense.  The Dr said it is mild and I may not get that bad.  They don't want to put me on meds right now cause the side effects from the medicine may be worse than the actual symptoms right now.  If my attacks or symptoms get worse they will reevaluate the situation.  There are 2 things that scare me right now. 1)The band starts looking for someone to replace me and 2) I turn into one of those helpless people that ends up in a wheel chair. I have always done everything for myself and if it ever gets to the point where I have to depend on someone else I think I would rather be dead. Moving on....We tried out a new drummer last night. He kicked ass! Very quiet though, does not say much at all.  I guess we will see how that situation turns out.  Other than that nothing exciting. I think that is enough excitement for one life time! LOL Oh yeah and I am trying to fly one or both of my sisters here from California at some point this summer.  I am very excited about finally getting to meet them.

      HANGOVER AGAIN! Holy shit I am getting too old for this. It is pretty bad when you wake up w/ a hangover 3 days in a row. Geeze. No drinking for me for a while. Anyway, the show went ok last night. I had a blast. Some of my real close friends came out to support me and there were a few there that I expected that never showed. Marcella was there. Man that chick fuckin rocks. She definitely turned the heads of a lot of my friends. She is beautiful and she has an amazing personality. I went to breakfast w/ a few of my friends and there was a group of older people at a table by us and they were looking at me like I was a freak. I was all dark and dreary looking last night. I got home at 5 and pretty much passed out! I go in for my tests Mon to see if I have MS. I don't think I have yet blogged about that. I have been having some signs and symptoms so I talked to one of the DRs at my hospital and she examined me. She said she wanted me to get a couple of tests done and one of the tests is one that I do on patients. That should be strange. Anyway, I am so sick of my body. Can I trade it in for a new one? LOL I had a brief encounter w/ cancer a few years ago, I had appendicitis and a polyp on my uterus that I had removed in Jan and now this. I have not talked to anyone about this yet because I am hoping it is nothing and I don't want to start freaking about something that I know nothing about. Although I have to say that is also why I have been so upset lately I just pawn a lot of it off on other situations.

      Last night was a good night w/ a really bad ending.  I was all happy and prepared for Shannons appearance, but at the end of the night when she didn't show (shocker) I was really down  REALLY  down.  I turned into that angry-depressed-sappy drunk and John and Jen witnessed it.  I guess I just want closure that I am never gonna get.  Oh well. Time for me to just move on and even if I do get the chance to just move on cause this has affected me so much in the past 4 months that it is changing the person that I am and not for the better. I am so angry these days and I hate it.  I have a show tonight. Nervous yet not. Just read Johns blog so that kind of upset me. He really thinks I am gonna sing flat. Thanks for the fuckin vote of confidence. I am gonna start working on me more and stop worrying about everybody else.  This is getting too crazy and I don't want to be that girl that everyone is saying "man that girl is nuts" Or maybe I was already nuts and it is just coming out now. From here on out I am worrying about me (and collen of course)I am going to take a journey of self discovery. That's it for now have to get ready to go.

      And now another episode of A DAY IN CHARITY'S LIFE! (music plays) LOL So here is the deal. Miss Shannon is still sleeping w/ someone who is  NOT  her fiance. It is none of my business, but the thing that pisses me off is, she is mad at me because I lied when in fact she herself is living a lie. Too much frigin drama. I have spent so much time w/ all of this guilt and remorse and for someone who I don't think knows what the truth is anymore! I am going to the show tonight. If she shows up well.... I don't even care if she shows up to be honest w/ you. Last night was interesting went to the Iguana after practice. Some of my friends were up there for karaoke. Jake kind of flaked on me and  put me in an awkward situation. He is a great friend and a good kid, but I could never ever date him for many reasons and how do I go about telling him this w/ out ruining our friendship? Yikes I hate situations like these. That is the only down fall of most of my friends being male.  There is a chance they may start to like you on a different level and could put you in a strange situation. Oh geeze. I just want one area in my life to be normal!

      I am so fucking sick of my job. Some serious crap went down today and I am not supposed to talk about it.  What it boils down to is the hospital fucked up and do not want a law suit so they are trying to pin shit on me.  I need a new job so bad.  I am thinking about going back to administrative.  I know I went to school for neurodiagnostics but the jobs are slim and few so I need to make some sacrifices.  I think I am just going to have to send my resume all over the place because this is ridiculous. I need a Mon-Fri 9-5 job. I like working my hours at the hospital though Mon-Fri 7=330 or 8-430. Either way it is sweet.  The only part that sucks is the being on call on the weekends, but it is part of the job.  I love my job and helping my patients but the hospital I work for is horrible and I would never send anyone there.  Pretty sad actually.

      All I have to say is WTF! I was gonna make an appearance at the V90 show Fri night since they are playing w/ Acoustically Challenged and pretty much all of my friends would be there, until..... I found out Shannon was going and she made it clear she would not go if I would be there. So w/ out being asked directly I was asked to not come in a round about way.  Man these are people I have been friends w/ for a while and I talk to on a regular basis and this little girl (and she is a little girl) who disappears and does not return people's phone calls at all (not including mine) all of a sudden shows her face again after 3 or so months and I have to fucking make sacrifices! What ever. The person who told me about it is the only person in our group who knows the situation so I am curious to know what will be said.  I should not go anyway w/ the way I have been feeling. It would only make things worse. Nothing good would come out of that, I am sure. Man, I make one fucking bad decision and I can already see I am gonna be paying for it 4-ever! Ok need to go to the other campus so I can leave early to bring Collen to the Dr. I need to focus on my show anyway and get the rest of the bullshit out of my head.

      Soooo.... How am I feeling? A little better I guess, not much but a little. I am not crying at the drop of a hat. It takes 2 hats to drop to get me to cry now. LOL Have practice tonight and have horrible cramps. Yeah I know u really wanted to know that. We have a show Sat and believe it or not I am not freaking out. I probably will be Fri though. I need to snap out of this depression. It is affecting everything I do. Have to get back to doing nothing at work today. It is so slow and boring today I can't stand it!

      Pain,loss, lonliness
Since the day I was born
Never had a chance
Where is my happiness 
Who are my friends
Where is my family
Some say they understand 
When they don't have a clue
Looking at the reflection
Fuck you 
I don't need you and don't want you
Anymore
This feeling has been here from the beginning
It will never go away
The older I grow 
The stronger I feel
This pain taking over me

      Everything is so fucked up right now. Fri we had a show. We never played though, long story that I really don't want to get into. Sat went to dinner and on my way home Mikee called to hang out.  We went up to the bar where Jen works and hung out there all night getting free drinks and beer. We then proceeded to drink through the morning. Drinking my sorrows away.  I am in this deep depression for the past couple of weeks and it has gotten much worse over the last few days.  I don't know what is wrong me.  John probably thinks I am an absolute nut case.  I have been acting like such a bitch at practice and he is probably tired of my shitty attitude already. I just feel so alone, scared,and helpless.  I have this rough exterior, but inside I feel like that scared little girl still waiting for her mom to come back and take care of her.  Don't get me wrong my dad and my step mom did an amazing job and I love and respect them more than anything for being who they are and doing what they did. I just have this missing link that I am trying to find.  The problem is I think I was a mistake not only to my young parents, but I think god made a mistake by putting me on this earth.  I still have not found my purpose.  I hate who I am.  I sometimes think back when I was 16 and tried committing suicide.  I don't know if I should thank Sean for saving my life or hate him more for putting me through my own hell! I know I can be a better person, better mom, better daughter, better sister,and better friend. I have amazing people in my life don't get me wrong, but I am petrified of getting close to anyone because I 
    ALWAYS loose the people that I care and love more than anything, and I am the person that seems to drive them away! Take me away from all of this pain and suffering in this fucked up world. Make all of this go away.

      Ok don't have a lot of time here but I had to get a couple of things off my chest. I have a show tonight not as Jetless but as Cased the previous band b4 I entered in. It is so last min w/ Jake filling for us, but we should have no problem pulling it off. (I hope anyway) Last night I was really getting freaked, to the point where I felt I could not even do this gosh darn forsaken show! I for some reason can not remember the lyrics to probably one of the easiest songs in the set (lyric wise)I need a security blanket, so I am going to bring up the lyrics and put them by my feet. Hopefully I won't need them, but at least they will be there if I do. Man I am getting big time jitters right now. Damn it! I have a totally booked weekend once again, but hopefully in the next 2 weeks I will get to relax.  I leave for Florida June 19 right after a show, that ought to be interesting. Ok I need to get back to work so I can get out of here on time and ready for the show. Wish me luck cause I need it. :op

      Jake practiced w/ us last night.  It went very well. We met up w/ some friends afterwards and did not get home till 2 something. Normally not a problem unless you have to be up 3 hrs later! Oh man am I feeling it today.  A can of worms were opened last night not purposely but they were and now I am dealing w/ that.  On the way home Jake said he was supposed to relay a message from someone, but did not want me to be upset.  Of course at that point I made him tell me.  Apparently he talked to Shannon and told her about the new band situation and she was really excited for me.  She told Jake to tell me congratulations.  At first it did not even phase me, but now..... Just replaying a bunch of bull shit in my head over and over.  Why? As soon as I feel I am doing better...... WHAMO! An emotional roller coaster all over again.  It's not Jakes fault. As far as he is concerned none of this is bothering me! BUT WE KNOW DIFFERENTLY DON'T WE? If I could just talk to her and I could get everything out there.  This has been such a mind fuck! The ball is in her court! I guess she is moving forward w/ the plans for the wedding.  I was supposed to be in that wedding, she asked me to sing in that wedding too.  Amazing how fast you can loose someone that is so important to you.  She came out of nowhere, and faded into the dark w/ out a trace. Maybe there was a purpose for us meeting.  Have not figured that part out yet. Maybe we met at the wrong time. I miss our friendship. As long as she is in the band w/ Vic it is a lost cause.  She won't jeopardize that. I really hope all goes well for her. I still miss her....

      My 8:15 apt did not show up, so I figured I would blog.  Totally stressing about the shows coming up and the whole drummer situation.  I kind of went off the deep end on John and Paul yesterday not meaning to.  I think all of us will be better after the 22 is passed and we can just focus on the future and not worry about if Jeff is filling or not! The ironic thing is after I said what I had to say, Anne sent out an email but that is a whole other story. Have to get a CD to that drummer in the next couple of days.  We will see how that turns out. Comcast is finally coming today to hook up my internet.  WOO HOO! Can't even begin to tell you how thrilling that is! Jake is riding w/ me to practice tonight and we will find out if he is filling for the 22 or not! I am getting this little twitch in my right eye.  Does that mean I am going coo coo? LOL I am back in the gym again working out hard.  I should be back into my summer shape by now, and I am just starting.  GEEZE! I should be ok in about 4-5 weeks. Yesterday was just an all together bad day.  I so badly wanted to walk out of work.  No appreciation no matter what I do around here.  I need to stop now, like Jer said yesterday, "this is not a pitty party for Charity" whatever! :-p

      I am at work right now. Yeah on Sat. I am on call and because my manager screwed up..... I get to pay the price.  No worries though.  Found out even though I am leaving the hospital I was supposed to get another raise, but because I had been reprimanded earlier this year I lost it.  Fucking bullshit.  Yeah I got reprimanded cause I was right and the Dr was wrong (literally) I did so much research after that happened and he was very upset so went over my head, and even though I was right..... I got bent over cause I challenged a DR! 
Hung out w/ my sis and the kids last night.  For once I didn't have anything to do.  There is a shocker.  I could have hung out w/ John but because I was on call I could not go that far from the hospital.  Amazing how dedicated I am to this place knowing they have screwed me time and time again.  Going to hang w/ my sis tonight.  Joe is gone w/ my dad up north and she hates being alone.  Man I love it I don't know why it bothers her so much.  So we are gonna chill.  Wow a whole weekend of just chilling, I don't know if I can handle it! Going to my parents tomorrow for a bbq.  I should probably go buy my mom something for Mothers Day.  I am a terrible daughter.  That's about it, gonna finish some bills and get the f   out of here! Laterz

      I got another comment from some unknown person about my blogs again pertaining to a situation I had previously written.  You know what?  I don't mean to sound like a bitch, but this is not my problem.  I am not taking down my achives again and they can threaten me all they want, anyone that knows me also knows I don't scare easily! Worked w/ Jake last night.  He may be filling in for our 22 show.  I hope so anyway.  This is all so fucked up right now! I have a ton of stuff to do this weekend and I am on call.  YIPPEEE! Can you hear the enthusiasm? Jeremy is throwing the sox in my face right now and I am about to beat him. LOL Sean called today and is being very nice.  Something is up and I am scared.  He is actually picking up Collen from school tomorrow to spend some time w/ him.  WOW! What else? Hmmmm Oh yeah did I mention my life sucks! Still job searching, no luck.  Like I have said before, if I didn't have bad luck I would not have any! :-p

      Oh boy........ Finally done moving, but still unpacking.  My class made their communion and that went well.  Having big time issues w/ the band right now.  Our drummer is MIA! Yeah we have 2 shows coming up and no drummer! I am so aggravated w/ this it's not even funny. We practiced last night to do the show acoustically, but I am really torn right now.  To the point that I got very little sleep. I really don't want to do this show under these circumstances, but I don't want to abandon the guys cause this has nothing to do w/ them. WELCOME TO RAWK AND ROLL baby! Jake said if we need a drummer, he could fit in a few practices to do the 22 show, but the 14 is a no go. John is doing everything in his power to fix this, but it's not him that needs to fix this.... JEFF? Yeah, I have already decided that I can't and won't work w/ him. What to do? I need to sit and make a decision about a couple of things pertaining to this band.  I just need some sleep.

      OMG! I spent so much time on the computer last night, my eyes hurt. I was talking to Mike (Boston)he was sending me a bunch of stuff to listen to and work on.  I surely have my work cut out for me. What's gonna happen to Jetless? WHO FUCKING KNOWS! Cause I am so tired of flaky people who like to take their bad attitudes and inappropriate behavior and dismiss it and take no responsibility for their actions. Hmmmmmmmmm......I wonder what that could mean. I don't want that project to be over, but in all reality it is presently going nowhere. We have not practiced in almost a month! Always something. Maybe we will find a drummer and come together as a band. Stranger things have happened. LOL So Dena (sister from Cali)is coming in on July 16 and staying through the 29th! This will be the first time we ever met! Nerve wrecking. Kelly (other sister from Cali)is coming in around X-Mas and Ray (bro from Cali)well I will probably meet him when I go to Cali next summer. This will be another chapter in my life. Ok busy day at work today, must get crackin. Laterz

It was a slow day, but after being on vacation it is hard to get back in the swing of things. Mike called today and he is gonna send me some stuff to work on. (Boston) This is so exciting!  Gonna go work on some lyrics and melody while I have it in my head still.

      I AM BACK! Like I promised I did keep a journal and I am transferring it to this. The weather was hot, but beautiful. The resort was absolutely gorgeous and we had a blast. Here goes my vacation......
 Sat. June 19 
Ok so it's 11:30 pm. Our day so far...We got in about 5pm. The ride down was not bad. We left @ 11pm last night. Even w/ stopping quite a few times we made awesome time. Once we got in we unpacked, sat in the jacuzzi for a bit, got dressed, went to dinner and did some grocery shopping. Now what my darling friends thought was so funny was they decided to park in the "expecting mothers" parking spot and because I was wearing a shirt everyone kept calling my maternity shirt they said I was the "expecting mother" Ha ha very funny. So of course we had to take a picture to laugh at later on. Ok enough for now. Have to go drink some Margarittas and chill out on the porch.
 Sun June 20 
Spent the day at Epcot. It went pretty well. Jen got into an argument w/ Jim and Butch so at first I thought it would be a bad day, but it went fine. Mission Space was awesome. You actually felt like you were going to Mars! It was a rush but my fav was the Test Track. Flying in a car full force into a wall like a test dummy. That was great. We got back, did some swimming. Kicking back right now, drinking a strawberry margaritta. We made our plans for tomorrow. It will be a long day. 
 Mon June 21 
It was a loooooong day. Spent the day at Magic Kingdom. I got my pic taken w/ Tigger so I am very happy. We went on Space Mountain 3x. That ride is soooo cool. Collen got a ton of Character autographs. The fireworks and parade at night was phenomenal. I have never in my life seen a fire works display like that! All in all the day was great, but 13 hrs at a theme park is very tiring. Off to bed now, we have another one ahead of us. 
 Tuesday June 22 
I have found the coolest roller coaster ever. The Rockin Roller Coaster starring Aerosmith was awesome.  MGM was pretty fun. There is a picture of me on Tower of Terror that no one will let me live down. The look on my face was priceless!  It was another long day, but well worth it.  When we got back I sat in the jacuzzi for a bit. Bed time.
 Wed June 23 
Today we spent the day at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon which is a water park.  I am pretty crispy right now.  We are gonna make some margarittas and chill, maybe go sit in the jacuzzi for a bit and wind down. This vacation is well needed and deserved I must say. 
 Thurs June 24 
Spent the day at Universal Studios. I really liked it. The park was only open till 9pm.  We hit everything regardless.  It's 945 and we are getting ready to go to Pleasure Island.  Tomorrow we hit Animal Kingdom and it looks like we are leaving tomorrow night instead of Sat which is fine w/ me.  I am having a blast!
 Fri June 25 
So we never went to Animal Kingdom which I am a little upset about, The guys never woke us up and we slept until almost 1.  It was partly mine and Jens fault.  We were out till 7am.  If the women are not up getting everyone in motion nothing happens.  I was still ready to go even though we were out that late.  Pleasure Island was cool as hell.  I actually met some people from Boston and the ironic thing is one of the guys was a musician who has connections w/ some producers. Anyway to make a really long story short...I was given an opportunity to be flown to Boston to do some tracking.  I have already written 3 songs! No music behind it yet, but he would work w/ it. The difference? These are being remixed to play in clubs.  I am gonna do this as a side project and see what happens.  I am so excited. We will see what comes of it and I will keep everyone posted.  
 Sat June 26 
We are home! Got in at 930 am. Unpacked went to visit my sis, niece and nephew and chilled. Now back to reality!

      Today I had a 4 yr old patient who touched my heart.  I have been doing some serious soul searching lately and have made a very big decision.  Even though I say I don't want any more kids I have changed my mind.  I don't think I want to give birth again, but I think I want to become a foster parent and adopt eventually too. Not now, probably in like 5 yrs or so. I have way to much going on and it would not be fair to Collen or that child at this point. It just amazes me what children go through and how durable they are. Nobody asks to be born and it is not their fault that they are abused or abandoned and it is about time that I try and help make a difference in some of these kids lives even if it's only a few, I want to know that I did make a difference in those few lives!

      I am exhausted! Just got done doing laundry, work was busy as hell.  I have so much to do before leaving for FL on Fri. I have not figured out how I am gonna get it all done. I have practice tomorrow night and I am gonna be a zombie by the time that is over. Damn I should just give up sleep for the rest of the week. LOL I have to get my motorcycle permit and my address change on my license, pay some bills, clean, pack, get Collen a hair cut, go to the bank to w/ draw money for the trip, and pay that frigin ticket I got parking by Jeremy's in Wrigleyville! I am still pissed about that, but it was my own damn fault. Speaking of Jeremy, talked to him earlier and he is having a really loooooong bad day. All my friends want me to go out w/ them Thurs night before I leave but I know that is not happening! I need to drop off some clothes to good will. They have been sitting by my door for the past month and 1/2. Ok enough babble. I need sleep.

      Marcella and I had a blast last night! We started off at Penny Road and I brought her to a biker bar where she had a blast. She said she felt so comfortable and definitely wanted to come back. Also find out she is getting a bike too so I will have another girl to ride with. VERY COOL! I have come to the realization that something that could have been really good is coming to an end. What am I gonna do about it? Keep moving forward baby! I will be alright I always am. Anyway gotta get a move on talk more laterz!

      So I had that wedding last night..... Had fun, drank too much. That was the first time I drank since the show.  The wedding was ok, my hands were shaking so bad yesterday that I gave up on trying to eat. From there we went to Gilhoolies to see Acoustically challenged for a bit.  Was so tired I felt like I was gonna fall over.  I miss Collen so much. He has been in Indiana since Thurs. He is getting home at 4 and he is leaving at 5 to go w/ Sean. My baby doll. I hate being w/ out him for too long. I have w/ drawls. LOL He is my life ya know? Going out w/ Marcella tonight. We will have a blast I can already feel it. Ok that is enough for now. I will post the wedding pics as soon as I get the disc back. Laterz

      Gonna be a looooooong day! Actually found a dress yesterday. I walked in, saw it, tried it on, and booya. There ya go. I hate wearing dresses. I feel so confined and I can't do shit.  There is still a little bit of tom-boy in me. I am so not lady like. I will be the first to admit it.  Growing up I was always one of the boys and I still am the only difference now is I have breasts and sometimes they get more attention then anything. LOL My roomate Aaron and friend of 14 yrs said that I still am one of the boys, but many don't see me as a boy anymore and have not for years! I hate when he says that. I will always be one of the boys now if only certain people will learn that we will all be good! Had to cancel some stuff last night cause a friend needed me. She is going through some stuff right now and can't deal w/ a lot. It's funny how many of my friends come to me for help and advise and I can barely deal w/ my own stuff. I need to take some of the advise that I dish out! Jess gave my resume to her boss and I guess she was impressed but confused why I am leaving the field I went to school for.  I am not leaving willingly I just need a stable job that is not gonna let me go because they want to combine the 2 labs! I have been looking at hospitals all over and no one is hiring in my field or they want at least 5 yrs exp and I only have a little over 1 yr. I only graduated in Dec of 2002! I hate this stupid crap of job searching. Maybe I should have just stayed at the railroad. It was stable, the money and benefits were great, and I would have had tons of seniority by now. It was just not me which is why I went back to school. Thinking about going back to school again. I think I have spent more time in school than anything. I don't think I have the time right now though. I should as Jeremy put it, quit my job and find a sugar daddy to pay my bills while I go back to school. LOL Not a bad idea Jer ;) Gotta fly I need to leave work a little earlier for this wedding!

      So tired! Need sleep. I am so busy these days I have to plan sleeping time in.  Pretty pathetic actually. Anyway, have a really busy weekend coming up too.  Fri have a wedding Jen and I are taking a limo so we don't have to worry about drinking and driving. Sat hangin w/ Marcella. Her and I are gonna get into trouble I can already feel it.  As she said, "we will play good cop bad cop and break some hearts." LOL Sun have softball and a picnic. 9 more days till FL WOO HOO I think at this point Jen, Jim and I are more excited than the kids.  I will make sure and post some pics after we get back. Collen has a dr's apt today after work and then I am off to the gym.  Once I commit myself I never stop cause I don't want to get lazy again.  I still can't believe how lazy I got after surgery.  I think it had to do w/ depression too though.  Enough about that. Anyone think they can handle working out w/ me? BRING IT!

      So I am back at the, as my friends call it "meat market" aka Bally Total Fitness. LOL I have not worked out since my surgery and I needed to get back into it.  I forgot how incredibly good it makes me feel.  Ran 3 miles and did legs and abs today.  I know I will be feeling it big time the next couple of days.  I love the burn! I have decided that I am going to get the people that give me negative vibes out of my life.  I don't need people in my life that upset me, stress me out and make me feel poorly of myself.  If they were good friends they would not have made me feel like that in the first place is what I say.  I have many positive goals that I am now working toward and plan on meeting and surpassing those goals. I will beat my negative feelings and I will beat the feeling of not feeling good enough.

      So here we go again.  Every time I think I am over a situation....it gets brought up again in a conversation. WHY ME? I thought I have cried my last tear and have wasted enough time on this, but obviously not. I still have to give them more of my time and more of my sweat and tears.  I fucking want them out of my head! I want to move on and I want to hate them w/ everything that I have so I won't spend any more time w/ this feeling of emptiness, loneliness, betrayal and abandonment. I am tired of certain people throwing this in my face and using it against me! I fucking want you to lay off! I am who I am and I did what I did.  It does not change me I am still the same person.  Take me as I am or BACK THE FUCK OFF!  I am tired of being that naive girl.  NO MORE! I will not let anyone walk on me, take advantage of me or make me feel like shit anymore.  I am sorry that I am only human!

      Harry Potter was awesome. Much darker than the other ones.  I spent a good part of the days at my parents, then I came home and made a huge dinner for my sister and bro-in-law. I was like Suzy fucking home maker. LOL My niece was supposed to spend the night and then she decided to go home w/ them. Which was fine. I have to do some errands and then go to my sisters so she can watch Collen while I work tomorrow. He does not start day camp till next week.  I have to figure out about school for the new year also.  Ok off to the gym. Laterz

      Bored! I am at my parents w/ Collen tonight.  We are going to see Harry Potter at the but crack of dawn pretty much. 9:30 am which means we will have to leave by 8:30 cause we are going to the Imax at Navy Pier.  He will like that. There is an issue I am gonna have to address soon and I really don't know how to do it.  I am really taking a look at my life, priorities and the things that highly upset me.  I am doing some serious soul searching these days and am working on myself for once w/ out worrying about everyone else. That has always been one of my main problems.  I have a busy schedule tomorrow and again Sun.  I have looked over my planner and I am seriously booked every day in the month of June and already many days in July.  How in the hell does that happen to me? I miss jammin w/ the band.  We took last week off.  I really need to know if we are going to be booking shows and working on getting a drummer or if this is all gonna just fade.  It seems like we are kind of slacking and I don't like the feeling.  This band has potential once we have everything set w/ a drummer and what not. Anyway off to bed.

      Why is it my irritation level is through the roof these days? Nothing used to get to me, but these days I have no patience. I think I have way too much on my plate right now, and I want alot in certain areas of my life and I am not getting them right now. I really need this vacation coming up.  I think if I did not get this vacation that I would end up having a nervous break down or something.  Sounds sad but true.  Leaving for FL on the 19th and wont be back til the 27th! THANK GAWD! Still looking for a job, still hoping we find a drummer, and still stressed about things I should not be stressed about. Have to go see a chiropractor, I was told that that would actually help my illness.  Don't know how true it is but I will try anything.  Collen has been sick he is complaining that his head hurts really bad.  If this is not better by Sat I am bringing him in.  He has always been a healthy child.  He was in the hospital when he was 3 for scarlet fever and they thought he had a bacterial infection. That was scary. They had my poor baby in a bubble away from everyone and everything just in case that was the problem.  Gonna get some stuff done b4 I leave.  Leaving at 1 today. YEAH! Oh yeah, Collen, me my dad and mom are going to see Harry Potter at the IMAX theatre on Sat morning.  He will love that! OK Tootles.

      WOW! That is all I have to say.  Have you ever felt pretty much set in your ways and someone or something comes along and tries to change it or maybe just confuses you and how you are feeling? That is what happened to me.  I have been seeing someone (nothing serious) we have hung out a few times and talk on the phone all the time. Anyway, he unloaded a lot on me last night. I mean A LOT! I felt very uncomfortable. I really don't know much about him at all. Things were said about future, marriage, kids.....WHAT? OMG! The thing is, I am set in my ways and what I want, and marriage and kids are not one of them. That might sound bad, but that is how I feel.  My son is all I want and need and I just don't think I am capable of loving someone so much that I would spend the rest of my life w/ them. That is a really long time. Talk about pressure. I don't think I can love someone at that capacity period! Man I sound like a bitch right now.  This is why I am still single and will probably remain so for the rest of my life at this rate! My luck has always been that there are like 15 guys waiting for me to date them and the ones I am interested in don't even know I am alive! That is no big deal, really. Why can't I ever be on the same page as everyone else?  I am either a chapter ahead or in a different book completely! What am I gonna do? Take it one day at a time. That is all I can do, I don't want to stress about every fucking detail in my life.  That is why I am turning into a complete lunatic these days. NO JOKE! I don't know how a lot of people are putting up w/ me these days. I sure as hell would not put up w/ me that is for sure. LOL

      My sister is doing ok.  Nothing major.  Went to hang w/ them yesterday, got called into work again, and Darin came over and we worked on some music.  We decided to write a song together.  Actually gonna be pretty good.  Very busy at work today. Got a little short w/ John cause of this whole July 10 show thing. I feel really bad about the situation, and was still willing to do it.  I knew I would be dead after that weekend though.  Then through all of the emailing back and forth John started taking things I was saying out of context.  It can be fun to email back and forth, but at the same time it can be bad because you can't read sarcasm and sometimes you may write something one way and someone will read it another way.  Anyway, I think it is resolved but I am just stressed out and I want to book more shows but I don't see that happening any time soon.  Exhausted need to rest.

        Yesterday was not a good day! I got home and it finally hit me that my sister was really gone! My son went w/ his father and there I was, all alone. I wanted to make a phone call but decided I probably should not cuz I would have gotten one by now if it mattered. I leave for Boston at 4. Yeah it is finally here! Thank goodness the political convention is over. I am packed and ready. Woo hoo! I bought a little mp3 player for the 2 hr plane ride and I am bringing my lyrics and music to work on also. I hate flying, I am a really bad flyer. LOL Ok well I will post either Mon night or Tues to let yas know how everything went. Laterz!

        Yesterday Dena and I went horse back riding. We had tons of fun. We went to go see baby Daniel. He is so tiny and adorable. By the end of the night it was pretty sad because it finally sunk in that she was leaving today. The time went by way to fast. There is still so much for us to catch up on. She does not want to go either. She said there is way more to do here in Chicago than in Fresno. Collen leaves tonight too. Man I don't know what I am gonna do w/ out him for 2 weeks! I have never been w/ out him for more than 2 days. I can concentrate on my music but it will still be hard w/ out him! I am so sad right now. :o(&nbsp; Tonight I have to finish packing and make sure my house is spotless ( I hate coming home and having stuff I have to do right away) 1 more day! Although I will have to deal w/ the whole political convention that is going on in Boston. Oh boy!

        Went to April's w/ Collen and Dena yesterday after work. We were there all night! They were looking through pictures and all that good stuff. It's weird when you have a sister and you have to catch her up to speed and catch up yourself. We have 18 yrs of making up to do. I can't believe she is leaving tomorrow. That time just flew by. My cousin Vickie had the baby yesterday. It was a boy. Baby Daniel was 7lbs 5oz and 21 inches long. Another baby to add to our gigantic family. LOL It was a good day in baseball yesterday. Cubs won and Sox lost. I actually watched the Sox game! I know can you believe it? I had my reasons for watching it. By the time I got home and cleaned a little and packed some more and hung w/ my sis, I once again did not go to bed till almost 1am! Oh and one other thing that happened is Mike sent me the instrumental of a song he wants to work on. I have been writing a lot lately so I had lyrics that fit perfectly and the melody is pretty much done and what I want to do w/ it. Damn that is probably the fastest I ever worked on a song. 5 hrs and I was done! Yeah me! LOL&nbsp;

        Yesterday was crazy as usual. After work I picked up Dena, picked up Collen, went to Malise's for dinner, got home around 8:30 did some laundry and finally got to go to bed at 12:30. I am tired we have to go to my sister April's tonight, we are also getting pictures and going horse back riding tomorrow and she leaves Thurs. I am upset about that. Who knows when I will see her again. It may be another 18 years. Geeze I hope not! I am already pretty much packed for Boston. Looking at my suitcase you would think I am moving there. I just don't know exactly what is going on the whole time I am there so I need to be prepared! I get my retainer in a few weeks. Oh boy at least it can be removed when I need to. Back to my boring day at work. Laterz :op

        Pretty busy weekend. Chopped all my hair and lightened it on Fri. Sat I brought my sister and son to Little Red School House. That place has changed so much, it is not what it used to be. Then I went and got my eyebrow repierced and brought my sister out to the bar. She got wasted it was actually kind of funny! Sun we went to Navy Pier all day. Spent lots of money. By the time we got home we were so tired. Had to do some shopping and get some stuff done before we could relax. She leaves Thurs, I can't believe it. I feel like she just got here and she is already leaving! I am having issues w/ someone else right now. I love him to death, but I think he is being very selfish and I don't like some of the comments he has been making lately. You know me though I don't deal w/ bull shit. Yes I miss him but there are certain things that are out of my control right now and if people can't understand that.....well as bitchy as it may seem I don't need them to bring me down. Enough of that a very good thing is that I am leaving for Boston in 4 days! I catch my plane directly after work on Fri! Busy busy day. That's all for now. Until next time.

        Yesterday was a crappy day. The storms were horrible.&nbsp; Dena and I went shopping and I bought her a couple of outfits. I bought myself one too. Really cute I love it.&nbsp; Cooked dinner, cleaned, picked up my new phone, did some grocery shopping and bought some stuff for Boston. I leave next Fri. Woo Hoo. Yeah me! Jeremy I called you back so no more grief for me thank you very much! LOL April, Joe and the kids are coming over tonight to meet Dena and have some pizza. Dena came to work w/ me today. Quite a few people say she and I look alike. We have different dads so they have to be traits from our mother.&nbsp; Talk more later!

         Man oh man what a day yesterday. After work I had a ton of running around to do and Dena was w/ grammy so I did not have to worry about her.&nbsp; After work I went to run some errands, went to the gym, came home, cooked dinner, took a shower and passed out. I was exhausted. Nothing exciting at all really. Collen is at home with Dena today cuz he did not want to go to the cubs game. (where did I go wrong :( )Ok back to work now.

         Everything is going very well w/ my sister. She went to the gym w/ me yesterday, but after cardio she was done. LOL She just talked to me while I finished my work out. It is cool her and I talk really easily and we totally feel comfortable around each other. She wants to be an RN, the only problem I have is she is thinking of dropping her fall classes and joining the Navy and getting licensed through the military. I really don't want her to enlist, but she is 18 and can make her own decisions. I will be supportive what ever she may decide. She is going to the museum w/ grammy today. I don't think she really wants to go. Just does not want to upset grammy ya know? LOL I am bringing her out Sat night and Marcella is probably going to meet us out. I am glad I have not seen nor talked to her in a couple of weeks. I miss her too. Ok enough for now talk soon.

        I have had a crazy go nuts weekend! I had classes and had to pick my sister Dena up from the airport. That was a task and a half. Her plane got delayed in AZ because of weather and she was supposed to come in at 420 am then it was supposed to be at 230 so I got to OHare at 1230 to find out it was delayed till 419pm. I was not happy. In the mean time my birth mother called my phone to see if she was in yet. That was so awkward for me. I have not talked to the woman since I was 5 yrs old. I was kind of off the whole day. Dena is cool as hell. She is 18, tall and skinny, beautiful and has a lot of energy. Kind of like her older sister. LOL Was busy running around and doing stuff all day. This is the first chance I had to rest and I need to get my butt to bed cuz I have to work in the morning. I have more to say but not much time so I will fill yall in tomorrow. Good night!

        As in the words of Madonna "Music makes the people come together" Hell yeah! Working on yet another song for Mike and Steve (Boston) Things are going pretty well over all.&nbsp; Although work has me ticked off.&nbsp; They tried telling me I could not take off Aug 2 because all of a sudden there would be no one to cover on that day. Oh fucking well...... I gave them a lot of notice and I already have my itinerary.&nbsp; So what they have to do as far as I am concerned is not my problem. Malise and I drank a bottle of wine last night. I got real tired real fast. That is enough for today talk more later if I have time. Dena comes in at 4:20 in the morning! GEEZE!

      Someone have a gun? Cuz I would seriously use it right now. I thought I was getting better, but by last night I could not breath at all through my nose. I woke up this morning and could not even get my contacts in cuz my eyes are so swollen from sinuses. Man this sucks. Yeah I worked out after work and probably should not have. I can be stupid at times, but I need to loose my winter weight! Ewwww... I feel like a big fatty these days, and if one more persons says I am skinny I think I will scream! Ok I am gonna go back to work cuz I really need to leave early and go back to bed and get better.

Here I am back at work on Mon morning. OH YEAH! Can you hear the enthusiasm? I feel a little better. I need to go to the gym after work so I don't get completely lazy! Nothing else exciting. Boring actually. Laterz

      I am protesting tanning beds. I will never tan again! Why? Because I have an infection that is traveling down my back because of the stupid thing. This is the place that I always go and I know they sanitize the beds, but for some reason I caught this thing that is making me itch like crazy. Found out from the dentist today that I have to get a retainer. This ought to be interesting. I have to get out of here and get tons of stuff done before bed time.

      Something is wrong w/ this blog. Everytime I post something it takes 1-2 days for it to show. Anyway, not much time have to get going. Nothing real exciting going on. Waiting to hear from Sean about Collen so I can make my plans for Boston. I should just move there and start over. Make things somewhat easier for me. Although it would be a bitch to do everything to move out there. Going to court for Collen, school changes, find a job, find an apt, move my shit from Chicago to Boston. Man oh man, don't want to think about it. The hardest part is my family would not be around and who would I have watch Collen for me? I would never have a social life again! Oh well don't need to worry about it so its no big deal. Laterz gaterz

      I had a very busy day even though I was off work. I worked out, grocery shopped, tanned, attempted to go to the dmv but because of the holiday....It was closed. I will have to go tomorrow after work. Have a busy schedule this week.  Collen and I went to see Spider Man 2. It was awesome! Can't wait till 3 comes out.  Trying to figure out plans for Boston. Sean needs to let me know when he is taking Collen and I will go from there. Yeah, can't wait. Dena comes in a week from Fri. I am nervous about that. Trying to make plans to show her around Chicago.

      It's close to 3am and I just got home from my sisters a little while ago. I had been there since yesterday after work.  The Cubs won Fri and Sat. YEAH BABY! I don't care what anyone says about the end of the game getting rained out. The Cubs would have won regardless, so all you stinking Sox fans can go cry to someone who fucking cares! LOL Laundry done, did some work on my car and worked more on the songs.  These songs are gonna make me go insane! Nah. I am just trying to find that final something! I got this crazy email from Matt. It was really funny, especially coming from him. I kept saying Mike was corrupting him! ha ha ha Mike emailed me in his defense of course! LOL I fell down the ouitside stairs at my sisters house. All I can say to that is .........OUCH! Man that hurt. My back is all sore now. I hope to god there is no damage. Ok well I need to get some shut eye. Happy 4th everybody!

      What I hate more than people who don't have a clue, are people who play games. Immature little high school bull shit. If I wanted that then guess what?......I would have stayed there! Worked on the song again yesterday for quite a bit. It is pretty much done, but now I keep going over and over trying to figure out what part does not sit well w/ me. Hmmmmmmm I will go over it w/ my sister tonight she will be brutely honest w/ me so hopefully it will be totally finished by Sun. I watched Ethan for Mikee last night. He is a good kid although he would not go to sleep unless he was laying directly on top of me! So I could not do anything until after he was asleep and then Collen got sick sooooo.......my night was not too productive. Didn't even have a chance to go to the gym. Jim stopped over for a few min last night to pick up some pictures from Fl. He was laughing his ass off at some of them. I am so ready to go to Boston. It's not fair, they are  (Mike and Steve) mixing and goofing around and having fun and I am on the other line of the phone well over 800 miles away! :(  Mike (boston) I know there are way too many of them! LOL Anyway, he was mentioning a possibility of going back to Fl in Sept sometime. That would be great although I would only be able to fly down for a couple of days. His place in Fl is huge and he says he can never fill it. Don't worry I'll fill it for ya! LOL Ok gotta go work it's Fri and I don't want to be here late for any reason. Everyone have a great Fourth of July weekend!

      Wow what a day! Pretty busy at work this morning finally slowed down. I am no longer in Jetless. I was sort of pushed out, but no hard feelings some people just have a lot of growing up to do.  Moving right along here...I am almost done w/ this song I am working on.  I must have changed it like 100x. When I am done gonna play if for Mike and if he likes it then I will fly out to track it.  I also started working on another song. Yeah I know I should finish this one first, but Mike gave me an idea and then some stuff popped in my head. I did not want to loose it or forget it so I started writing it down. Talked to Matt (Boston) through IM for a while. These people are really nice and I am so glad to have met them. I think the most important thing is that they are all REAL! I am so sick and tired of fake people I could just puke! LOL I am actually getting to explore a different side of music yet still do it my way. We will see if Mike and Steve like it. What could be the worst that happens? THEY HATE IT! LOL

        Oh yeah I totally forgot to talk about the irony in Boston.....Ha ha ha While I was in Boston I found out that the Cubbies got their shortstop Nomar. Woo hoo. The guys were not happy about that. LOL Yesterday I spent a ton of time on some more songs. I did not even go to the gym. I will be doing the same thing today when I get home from work except I will be going to the gym today. Talked to Jeremy yesterday after not talking for a while. I think we pretty much got things squared away and layed our opinions and feelings out so we are friends again. That is a good thing cuz despite what he might have thought, I did miss him. Matt called yesterday and he is coming to visit at the end of the month! He has never been to Chicago. I have to make sure he has an amazing time! Matt, if I have not mentioned him b4 is a friend of Mike and Steve's. (Boston) Mike and Steve will be coming real soon too. Yeah! They are such great people. I will post some pics from Boston later when I get home.

        Ok so this weekend you ask? OFF THE HOOK! I had a f....ing blast! This whole experience is unbelievable. We went to this club Sat which was kick ass! They seriously treated me like a queen. This whole project w/ Mike and Steve is going to be a good thing for all of us if this all goes well which looking at it now, I don't think will be a problem. I am contemplating moving out there in the next 6-9 months. I feel that in itself will be a good move for me also. I get to be right there working on music not having to worry about flying back and forth and I will get to start over fresh, w/ a clean slate. Not having to worry about drama or bs that I put up w/ here. I have also figured out that if a friend says they hate drama and don't deal w/ it......run the other way cuz they are the ones that cause it the most! Between the site seeing, the shows, expensive restaurants, clubs, and taking the bike out Sun night....I had soo much fun! I could really learn to live like that. I will bring Collen out there a couple of times and see what he thinks about it. If he wants to, we are out of here baby! Worked on another song on the flight home. It's amazing how you get all of this inspiration out of nowhere but when you sit there and try to force it out you come out w/ nothing! That's how it works though.
