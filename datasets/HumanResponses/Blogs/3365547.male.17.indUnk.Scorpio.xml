       deviant :  urlLink *ssilence   My Name is Tobi, im 22 years old, from munich (germany, Bavarian) and I really hate it to tell about myself. Few years ago I bought a little Cam, the Konica 300z. I loved this cam because it was small and I take it along every place. So I shot some things, small and meaningless, without a own soul. One evening a little feather fall out of my bed. I go down on my knees and take shots. Over and over. Thats my first macro shots. Thenceforward I see the world with other eyes, the beautiness in simple things, in what I see and feel, whats everytime around me. Jeah I know this sounds boring but its the switch in your brain who is changing yourself. Otherwise, day by day, Im a settled character, like programming and my fishes, like silence around me. And if I feel this Silence I take a shot of it!    ___/ Personal \___   -  You are a popular member of DA. Did that scared you?      No, that's so cool to get a so big feedback. Nowhere you get so much attention.  -  When and how started your photographer career ?      I started it on "Saturn". That's a big fat store for electronic things, in the near of the Oktoberfest in munich (just 5 minutes away) ;). I bought a small cam (later I get a small and fast cam :)  -  You submit a new work, and people look at you like if you where some kind of God. Is that talent a born mark or was something hard to achieve?       I learned really much by taking photos. Its not a born mark, you must simply use your time to do something. Then you will be good in this thing!  -  What do you think about yourself?      Im God! Nooo thats a joke, I'm a small human in a big fat world, and I enjoy my life, love every day and so I'm a chilling person!  -  It's art something important for you? What's your definition of art?      A minimalistic world around myself is important. My flat is simple and nice, I love this order. Its good for my soul ;) And I love blue, all in my sweet home is blue.     Art is one of the beautiest minor matters but the real thing is a fortunate life (for a fortunate I need my cam ;)  -  Have you ever imagined yourself working for a world famous photo magazine?      No, fame is nice but not really important. See my  urlLink website , its small and focused on the real things, thats enough.  -  And about career dreams, everyone has one, may we know what's yours?      I want to become a photographer! This sounds oddish but I will do this as regular occupation!    ___/ DA and Professional \__   -  Whats your fav work?      From other:  urlLink 'Saffron Skies'  from  urlLink Azhrarn      From myself:  urlLink 'Life Is Gone'   -  Can you comment  urlLink 'Rays of reflection' , one of your best works at DeviantArt. Was it a lucky shot or where you trying to get it a long time ago?         The day was fine, I had a walk with my girlfriend. Later on we reach a small wood. The bright sun reflected in the mist and I run through the forest (like a maniac) and shot and shot. Yeah that sunday morning was perfect...  -  Sea or Sky?      I think the Sky and the sea are the same, the reflection of the one is the matter of the other. I love skys and I would choose this. The contrast of an sky tells so much about an place, produce fear and aspiration. (Like at lord of the rings, the dark skys create a scary mood).  -  There are some new features that you would love to see applyed at DA?      I would love group accounts and the facility to order the pictures my views. But I love this site as it is (since version 1)  -  Soon as we get into DA, new friends are made. Can you tell us the first friends you made there? If you remember of course..         Yeah, the user  urlLink Gerion  was the first and so far the last. We started a internet community for roleplaying (which is growing, day by day)  -  Your top5 categories at DA ( photography, pixelart, indyart, wallpapers, etc, etc )         Photography :), Indyart (this style like azhrarn), Wallpaper (abstract ps work), screenshots, appskinz  -  Would you like to see your art exposed at some kind of museum or art gallery !?      yeah, sure :)  -  Any project in course? Top secret? Or can you give us a smell of it?      I made an illustrated book from my work (printed and bounded). I plan to upload this as PDF File.    __/ General Questions \__   -  What is your favorite photo(s). Do you remember of some?      Yeah sure! I love  urlLink 'New York Ballerina'  from  urlLink Darkgoth  or  urlLink 'Portrait of Elisa'  from  urlLink Kelt  or  urlLink 'The reflected muse 14'  from  urlLink Brightsoul . I love  portraits  and  b&w . Two sections I don't use and I'm not good in!  -  And your favorite photographer?      No, there are too much photographers with too much photos. Often I see photos, small and inconsiderable on advertising or magazines and love it so there are too much styles I love (thats like music).  -  Is there any digital or traditional camera that you would love to have, or you already have the one you desired!?       There are just one possible answer:  urlLink ">Canon EOS 1ds . But shit, I disbelieve that someone would take better photos with a better cam. Its the beyondness of things.
