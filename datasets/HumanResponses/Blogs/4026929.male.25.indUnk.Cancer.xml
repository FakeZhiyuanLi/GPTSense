      If you believe in god then it becomes one of those endless metaphysical debates(starting from the chicken egg analogy), because to acknowledge the existence of god&nbsp;is to deny the presence of evil which seems quite out of sort with practical life.  two ways out,  1.Minimise the powers of god, so god is no longer omnipotent/omnipresent hence an independent entity from evil.... which&nbsp;throws most religions into the bin.....  2.Become an atheist, which for me is quite funny because, how can u disbelieve something as abstract as that of a concept.its something like i dont believe in 2£@%&^%*...(say its a concept)...so we are entangled in choice either way....  The problem arises because science with its strengths and limitations(one of the most important of them being language) cannot disprove the presence of god.Mind you im not saying&nbsp; about not proving the absence of god.Most instincts of&nbsp;the masses prefer taking the middleground instead. 'both evil and good are needed for life like day and night'   Escape hatch? godel's theorem??? But again the fundamental question remains  what makes anyone believe?

      Ofcourse, as most of you have figured out by now,  nobody can promise the absolute fact for any interpretation, but what i can is a honest interpretation of a fact . Those words are unique as&nbsp;within &nbsp;them lie the arcane fundamentals&nbsp;of&nbsp;mother life herself.   first .... is, then 'it' is,&nbsp; then 'there' is......,  life conjures from space, time and matter through a flux of&nbsp; events&nbsp;, moments, experiences, memories, values, morals and finally&nbsp;to a premise which has a vague sense of familiarity-Déjà vu........i cant delude myself&nbsp; of being mortal,there is a choice  from   there on begins another choice.      To borrow kerouac's words, "What's your road, man? -holyboy road, madman road, rainbow road, guppy road, any road. It's an anywhere road for anybody anyhow" , &nbsp;&nbsp;I would be dishonest if i say i know where i am going , but i can say  what is my going  ...and this blog is the trail of  my road  !&nbsp; ah! i almost forgot,  welcome .

       What are my favorite moments? The moments which i cherish with a waning smile and wish to relive for anything in the world. Been wondering about this for sometime now and finally came up with this list...  when u see a stranger smile, when u just sit there trying to figure out what the hell is going on, when u know ur boss is nowhere near being right and u say i agree(with a smile ofcourse), when u sit there and think about all the possible pasts and probable futures, when u look at those squiggly spell check lineson the monitor with delight, when u feel the air ten minutes before it rains, when u just empty an almost overflowing bladder, when u exactly grasp what the writer intended to say in one go, when u close ur eyes while tongue deep in a kiss,when u uncap that pen late in the night to jot down something terribly trivial,when u wake up in the morning and realise that ur still alive............    definitely shall be updated        another one of   those supposed poems   Deconstructing life....   so like a mixture of million delights and absurd aches wound within a single horizon of unconscious pill i take another breath, just, like that.............

      picture this, a conversation between Frederich Nietzsche and Hermann Rorschach....(oh yes!!) R: so im going to show you some diagrams and you need to tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. N:ok R shows plate 1 N:'' '' R: prompts, 'yessssss.....' N:nothing came to my mind... R shows plate 2 N:'' ''  This continues all the way upto plate 10...  finally Nietzsche says '  grow up'  Rorschach says..'  have you '? Their eyes meet...in that moment probably they knew what made them different from each other,  in one word...  society  .

      What would you call that feeling which seizes u instanty the moment you bump into an ex and that sudden momentary deep look into his/ her eyes and  you feel a turmoil build within as if the world's vaulting into a miniscule meta picture in an illogical rehearsal of an unwanted tragedy! Whats more painful, is the substance of such a moment is left more for the memory to be haunted than to be enjoyed even by the most pathological sadists who ever breathed oxygen of this planet and all these wordplay fails to put across that squirming feeling with an eternal paradox of seeking for repetition and erosion at the same time.Such a  real shame for language. Its not fondness or envy... its beyond that , for those keen and willing to discover i must say , it is ''hmmmmmmmm........''..... its beyond the clutches of reason or emotion, beyond pain and pleasure....u just tend to say...''hmmmmmmmm........'' the rest is plastered by the mouldings made by your ego in time ,space and matter.....resulting in many people giving a thought about it later on, in grand futility of course !!! What gives me a tingle is that i havent had that feeling for sometime...!!!

        the stream that flows.......    Wrapt little secrets of hearts undiscovered, Vanish …..eroded by times delicate poison unending Once in while, a profound silence is recovered, A divine force …, beyond and beneath growing,  All the contours in times laughter are swallowed Into an ineffable void within… Nothing subsists, until all rains are washed into oceans Till All is forgiven and forgotten Only the stream still remembers … The persistence of disintegration of time Because The stream that flows only bends, Neither turns nor returns.....      wrote when young , for some vague reason felt like posting it ...

      Deliberation is a sign of a building disaster, speak of regulation in enchantment and it appears as democracy is  the sole right of humanity, which in all humility i disagree with; it  is  definitely not necessarily a disapproval , but a respectful honest difference in the point of view( let all the politeness be blessed for the masses). The ultimate of truths is that we are all unique and beyond comparison, so any tool of measure,for instance like life herself, is not beyond bias,  So there has to be rulers and there has to be the ruled and most importantly there has to be an hierarchy .  Democracy in real principle is a lie agreed upon.
