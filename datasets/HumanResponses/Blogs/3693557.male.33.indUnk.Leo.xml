      I gave in slightly and joined one site I was a member of a few years ago.  The site is  urlLink SFI .  In the past when I was a member I never really participated in it because I was new to all this internet marketing and MLM stuff.  At that time I kept getting e-mails left and right saying that people were joining in my line and if I wanted to make comissions on their sales I had to be MIQ (Multi-Income Qualified).  To be MIQ you have to earn 10 of their points each and every month.  People that are starting out have to pay to get those points by joining one of their programs or selling/purchasing some products.  As you grow and get people under you earning points you get points for their efforts.  At some point in time your line would be built up enough that you could easily be MIQ without having to buy anything yourself.  My team leader is in the top five members list with over 350 points.  I'm certain those aren't all generated by him individually.  The program is truely free to join, but until you get MIQ you won't really see any money from it.  So, at least for the beginning, you have to pay to get money in return.  You could always market their products to people or on your website.  If you have a blog of your own you could easily place a link somewhere and tell people about it and let them check it out.  I haven't given up my quest for that ever-elusive site that will allow me to make money without paying first.  But,  urlLink SFI  comes pretty close to it.  It just takes effort like any other site or business.  I probably could've gotten MIQ without having to pay for it myself, but I don't have a huge list of people to e-mail.  Nor do I have a large fan-base.  I don't even know if this Blog is being read by anyone.  Check out  urlLink SFI  and join it for free.  Then I can chat with you further and together we can see what happens with this program.  I know one thing for certain: They say by getting MIQ within ten days of joining you're guaranteed to get a check.  We'll see if one comes in the mail in the next couple of weeks.    urlLink Soon to be listed on Blogwise.

      Paid surveys online...WTF?  I see a lot of sites that say you can get paid for taking online surveys and participating in focus groups and other nonsense like that.  What a bunch of crap!  A good portion of these sites lure you in with prospects of anywhere from $5 to $150 a survey you take.  Well, read the fine print baby!  Those scammers (they may not really be scammers, but it's sounds fitting) insist that you pay something like $30 to start.  Again, you've gotta pay them money before you can start making it.  The ones that are free to join stink just as much.  I signed up for one free site.  In the past two weeks I only got to do one survey and haven't seen anything for my effort.  I was using a different one a while back and got to do a few surveys, but only got points for my time.  And it wasn't big points either.  I don't remember what the points were worth, but even ten points won't get you anywhere.

      Just in case you're wondering who Mithheru is.  This is a name I use when playing Neverwinter Nights.  My full character name is Mithheru Allaraan.  You can see what my character looks like and his stats at  urlLink my NWN page  on my personal web site.

      I haven't found anything good yet that's worth paying for.  One site says that the only way you'll make money on the internet is to spend money first.  I don't believe that one bit.  Here's why I don't believe it:  When you went to the interview for any job and got hired by that company did they ask for money up front?  Did they say that you have to pay them before you can start working?  I'm sure 99% will say no; the 1% are true suckers.  So, in the real world it doesn't take money to get a job and start making money.  Ah, you say that you had to pay gas or bus fare or even a taxi to get to the interview.  Well, you're on the internet and you're paying for that; aren't you?  I'm not talking about how you got to the interview.  I mean what happened at and after the interview.  That employer probably didn't care how you got there.  All they were concerned about was that you made it and were on-time and showed that you can be trust-worthy.  Now, again, in the real world it doesn't take money to get a job.  Why can't it be this way on the internet?  There's bound to be something out there that can be applied to and get a position in, actually make money without putting some out first, and do quite well with it.  I'll bet the reason it's so hard to find is because they just don't want anyone and everyone joining in.  It's most likey a select few who have been interviewed (like in real life) and offered a position or even a web site to promote and sell from.  I've seen quite a few sites that are free to join and everyone has done this.  Now, there's too many of those sites out there, too many from one group to choose from, and too many people pulling from the same chest of gold.  This is why I believe that there is an ever-elusive site to join free and make big bucks out there just waiting to be found.  And I intend to find it.

      I found a site while roaming through the endless pages of work-at-home pages.   urlLink http://www.ezau.com/  seems like a nice site with some good information and articles.  I haven't found anything yet that tries to compel me to buy something in order to get what is available there.  Check it out.  It's a good site because I've been spending a lot of time looking through it and didn't stop to look for a WTF for the day.

      I still have only the one sale from PalmGear and nothing from any other sites I've joined.  And I'm still finding an unbelievable number of sites that offer to help you make money as long as you give them some first.  I even found one guy's site where he has two 'directories' full of money-making opportunities.  The prices are anywhere from $10 up to $197.  WTF?  Who in their right mind would pay $197 for information.  I don't care how good it is; that's way too much.  I wonder how many of his suckers are making money themselves.  I can tell you that dude isn't getting any of my money.  Hey, if you're reading this and you know you're the guy running that site and you know I'm talking about you; I have one suggestion:  Lower your prices!  Or better yet, give some of that stuff away for free.  You know you're rich enough to lose a little money.  I'm also still waiting for someone to offer to help make me rich by showing me how to make money without spending any first.  There's bound to be a rich Yuppy out there somewhere who's willing to share the wealth.

      I made $10 today!  I made it not by getting suckered into another MLM scam.  Nor did I make it by sending money to some guy who charges a outrageous price for their stuff.  I made it by selling something I had sitting on my hard drive for over a year.  Something I have the resell rights to, but couldn't figure out how to make it unique enough for people to want...until now.  It's a set of reports on  urlLink Advertising  telling how to get advertising and how to write ads.  If anyone here's interested in reading it there's a plain text version included.  Oddly enough, this didn't sell on any MLM or affliiate site, but on PalmGear.  If you clicked on the link you'll have found that out by now.  The reports are in Palm format so that people who download it can take it with them and read it on the bus or train or anywhere else.  I've got a dozen more files like this to work on.  Hopefully this is the beginning of something really good.

      I just ran across a site promoting the Tightwad's 12 steps for online success. (It's not the exact name only because I don't see why I should help promote this site.)  This guy's talking about how to make money like the other sites do, but he says you can make money with limited time and virtually no cost.  Well, dude wants you to put out $97.  WTF?  I'm not going to give anybody $97.; especially someone I don't know.  What's to say his information is something I already have or tried?  How can I be certain it'll even work?  Here's a good line from his site: "It can help you to achieve just that ... without having to spend your hard earned cash to do it!"  Slight problem here; isn't that $97 he wants some of my hard earned cash?  If he was asking for $10 or $20 I'd be more forgiving, but $97.  Someone's been sniffing something bad...  It's things like this that really turn me off to online marketing and these MLM 'scams'.  I call them scams because only the people at the top make money.  If you didn't start it, don't join it.

      Hello cruel world...  This is my first post here.  I've created this blog to document my frustrations with money-making opportunities on-line and off.  Over the course of this blog I will reveal my attempts and failures to make money while I fight my demon called ADHD.  ADHD is a nasty little bugger that screws with you all the time.  It especially loves to let me get well into a project and then taunt me into dropping it for something else.  So, here's my whole delima.  To beat this demon I need to take medications like Ritalin and Stratera.  To buy these meds I need money.  To have money I need to make it.  To make it I need money to begin with.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not a slacker or a bum.  I do have a job, but like most people it doesn't pay very well.  I don't have extra money for extravagant things like medicines I need or new clothes.  In comes these money-making opportunities to save my day; so I thought.  For starters, I need money for these things to work.  I have tried several of these programs that promise thousands or even millions.  The only thing I can see happening is that the guy I paid money to is getting rich off of losers like me while I get no further ahead.  One good example happened two nights ago when a guy I'll name James called me about making money on eBay.  After talking for quite a while things started to look promising he asked how much I would be able to invest into marketing and merchandise.  I told him I have nothing and I'm starting from scratch.  He gave me his phone number and said when I have money to invest with to call him back.  He just pushed me aside and went onto the next sucker.  Oh well.  Until the next time I have something to gripe about, enjoy your life; especially if you're a rich Yuppy.

      Well, I did get a first check like SFI promised.  But, it wasn't what they promised it would be.  The check is for $2.29 only.  Not even worth the time to bring it to the bank to cash it.  Now, they're saying that I have to be MIQ this month in order to keep those two bonus shares or I'll lose them.  Well, they can have the damn things if they're not going to give them to me like they promised.  It will come in handy next week when I'll need some bus fare, but that's all it's good for. I'm still waiting to see if IAHBE refunds my $29.95.  As for searching for a real money making site; still nothing yet.  I just keep running across gimmicks, scams, and 'free' offers.  You've gotta give them credit for how thay can trick you into signing up; only to drop the bomb on you and tell you that you have to pay to get anywhere with them.  I've thought of starting a site like that. But, I couldn't live with myself knowing that I'm ripping people off and lying to them.

      I still haven't found that web site I'm searching for.  All I run across are scams and tricks to get you in.  Then, once they have your attention (and your money) they screw you over.  I also haven't received my huge check of $2.29 from SFI yet.  With some luck, IAHBE will refund my $30 I wasted on them.  I somehow feel I'll have to put up a fight to get it back.  Well, it's back to searching some more and hope for the best.  I'll find that site some day.

      Well, I looked at the SFI site today and it shows how much my check will be that I'm supposed to get.  $2.29.  WTF!!!  $2.29 is all I'm going to get for spending $29.95.  Those two shares for the bonus pool didn't show.  If they did then the check would be at least $36.  You've really got to read the fine print for these damn sites.  Even the print that's not there.  They didn't say anything about me having to get PTL to get those two shares.  All they said is that I'd get them.  Well, I have them, but I also don't have them.  They're not getting any more money from me.  Hopefully IAHBE will honor their refund guarantee; unless that's written in disappearing ink.  I did submit it before the 30 days are up, but that shouldn't matter. I don't like it and I want my money back.

      I'm still waiting to see if I really do get a check from SFI.  I'm not overly expecting it.  I've been busy fixing up my computer.  I got a clear case with some LED fans.  Today I'll get three cold cathode lights to put in it.  Once it's fully set up I'll have pictures available.  In the meantime I'm still looking for that ever elusive business op where I don't have to spend money to make it.  I haven't found anything interesting; just more of the same old nonsense.  One thing's for sure: Don't mess with these traffic building sites.  I did Traffic Swarm and didn't get a single hit to my site even though my ads were displayed about 200 times so far.  And NoMoreHits is useless also.  People do see you site, but they're likely just loading the page so they can get credit for doing it and not looking at the site itself.

      During the weekend I got what I thought would be my free gifts for joining IAHBE.  Instead, I get a book with coupons to fill out and mail back to get these "free" gifts.  And some of these "free" gifts I actually have to pay for to get.  Altogether it would cost $142.65 ($20.75 is shipping) to get everything in the book.  This just shows yet again how these programs work.  They lure you in with offers for free stuff and stick you with the bill.  And one good trick I found with them is their free leads.  They say you can get free leads each month.  The only problem is you have to call a phone number, and it's not toll-free.  So, as long as you live in that area code it's truly free; but I'll bet they try to sell you something once you're on the phone.

      Well, in that last posting I talked about  urlLink SFI  and how I joined it.  I got an e-mail this morning, but before I get to that a bit of background to set the scene:  When you get MIQ each month you're supposed to get 1 share in a bonus pool of sales for the month.  Also, if you fast-track (get MIQ within 10 days of joining) you get another share.  Well, I got MIQ and fast-track so I should have 2 shares in this bonus pool, right?  Wrong.  WTF you say?  I got an e-mail this morning detailing my account information which included: 'This message confirms that you now have 0 banked PTL Pool shares.  Last month, a share was $18.48. (0 shares would have been worth $00.00 to you).'  Now, if it showed my 2 shares I would have $36.96 instead of $00.00.  Hopefully this is some sort of mistake, but somehow I doubt it.  Also, there are other bonuses I'm supposed to get being MIQ.  We'll see what happens around the middle of this month.  I know for certain I'm not putting any more money into this before I start seeing some come out.
