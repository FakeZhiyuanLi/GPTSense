       Over time, I've Building my castle of loveJust for two, though u never knew you were my reasonI've gone much too far for you now to sayThat I've got to throw my castle awayOver dreams, I Have picked out a perfect come trueThough you never knew it was of you I've been dreamingThe sandman has come from too far awayfor you to say come back some other dayAnd though you dont believe that they dothey do come truefor did my dreamswhen i looked at youand maybe too, if you would believeyou too might beOverjoyed, over loved, over meover hearts, Ihave painfully turn every stoneJust to find, I had found what I've search to discoverI've come much too far for me now to findThe love what I've sought can never be mineAnd though you dont believe that they dothey do come truefor did my dreamswhen i looked at youand maybe too, if you would believeyou too might beOverjoyed, over loved, over me

       I'm so tired of being here suppressed by all my childish fears and if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'cause your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase [chorus] when you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me you used to captivate me by your resonating life now I'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase [chorus] I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone but though you're still with me I've been alone all along [chorus]

       Why can’t we wait till morning?We can talk about it thenBecause I had dreams too many and I am in troubles when I ain’t got anyWhy can’t it wait till day light?These things we will see so much clear of thenI am tired and my eyes are wearyAnd I just want you’re laying here with meSo close your eyes, I will make it ooh so niceNow I don’t want to think about what we’ve saidNow I don’t want to know why we hurt ourselvesBecause I just want to hold you so close to me…You know, it will take care of itself… and I want to sleep once moreWhy can’t it wait until next time?Because that time might never comeStay here with your arms to hold me because you are going nowhere without meSo close your eyes, I will make it ooh so niceNow I don’t want to think about what we’ve saidNow I don’t want to know why we hurt ourselvesBecause I just want to hold you so close to me…You know, It will take care of itself … and I want to sleep once moreWhy can’t it wait till morning?

       All I knowIs everything is not as it's soldbut the more I grow the less I knowAnd I have lived so many livesThough I'm not oldAnd the more I see, the less I growThe fewer the seeds the more I sowThen I see you standing thereWanting more from meAnd all I can do is tryThen I see you standing thereWanting more from meAnd all I can do is tryI wish I hadn't seen all of the realnessAnd all the real people are really not real at allThe more I learn the more I cryAs I say goodbye to the way of lifeI thought I had designed for meThen I see you standing thereWanting more from meAnd all I can do is tryThen I see you standing thereI'm all I'll ever beBut all I can do is tryTryAll of the moments that already passedWe'll try to go back and make them lastAll of the things we want each other to beWe never will beAnd that's wonderful, and that's lifeAnd that's you, babyThis is me, babyAnd we are, we are, we are, we areFreeIn our loveWe are free in our love

      I'm 15 for a moment Caught in between 10 and 20 And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are   I'm 22 for a moment She feels better than ever And we're on fire Making our way back from Mars   15 there's still time for you Time to buy and time to lose 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live   I'm 33 for a moment Still the man, but you see I'm a they A kid on the way A family on my mind   I'm 45 for a moment The sea is high And I'm heading into a crisis Chasing the years of my life   15 there's still time for you Time to buy, Time to lose yourself Within a morning star   15 I'm all right with you 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live   Half time goes by Suddenly you’re wise Another blink of an eye 67 is gone The sun is getting high We're moving on...   I'm 99 for a moment Dying for just another moment And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are   15 there's still time for you 22 I feel her too 33 you’re on your way Every day's a new day...   15 there's still time for you Time to buy and time to choose Hey 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live   by : five for fighting

       My love is on the line. A little late for all the things you didn't say. I'm not sad for you But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste 'Cause I learned the truth Your heart is in a place I no longer wanna be. I knew there'd come a day I'd set you free 'Cause I'm sick and tired Of always being sick and tired. Your love isn't fair. You live in a world where you didn't listen And you didn't care So I'm floating Floating on air. No warning of such a sad song Of broken hearts. My dreams of fairy tales and fantasy Were torn apart. I lost my peace of mind. Somewhere along the way I knew there's come a time You'd hear me say I'm sick and tired Of always being sick and tired   taken from Sick and Tired of Anastacia

       Only save,try to find another way,I’m taking what I gave to you again. Some new day I could understand your face,you could even hold my hand if you would like to. It came up unexpected,I had to follow throughand it’s hard when you were working like you do. It was easy when you were younger,you can put it back together,it was there if you ever wanted itbut you closed the door and said goodbye for good.   So this is a mistake,try to find a better way,you were never fond of anything I said. Can we begin again?Save it for another friend,I was happy in my life I won’t pretend, every time you were expecting to reach out and forgive this,I was hardened by the look upon your face.   it was easy when you were younger,you can put it back together,it was there if you ever wanted it,but you closed the door and said goodbye for good,for good…you were easy   taken from EZ by Pete Yorn

       holiday in spain  Ik kan nergens heen, maar in het zuiden wacht een vrouw nog steeds op mij alleen Ze heeft flessen vol tequila en flessen vol gin en dan neem ik mijn gitaar mee en mijn gouden ring Er zijn vliegtuigstoelen, miljoenen bij bedoeling en bovendien zijn er limousines en er zijn leugens over sterren die we toch nooit zien   Misschien Neem ik Spanje als besluit en laat mijn schepen achter Ik ga er stiekem tussen uit Een vluchtweg naar een nieuw begin   Hop on my choo-choo I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit If you dress me up in pink and white We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight She's my angel She's a little better than the one that used to be with me Cause she liked to scream at me Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree   I may take a holiday in Spain Leave my wings behind me Drive this little girl insane And fly away to someone new   Everybody's gone They left the television screaming that the radio's on Mijn schoenen zijn gejat Maar ik hoef niet meer naar buiten want er is nog wel wat   Happy new year's baby! We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day Or we could simply pack our bags We gaan meteen naar Barcelona want we moeten hier weg   Misschien  Neem ik Spanje als besluit en laat mijn schepen achter Ik ga er stiekem tussen uit Een vluchtweg naar een nieuw begin Ik neem Spanje als besluit en laat mijn schepen achter Ik ga er stiekem tussen uit Een vluchtweg naar een nieuw begin   taken from Holiday in Spain by Counting Crows feat.

      Hello? Can you hear me? Am I getting through to you? Hello ? Is it late there? There's a laughter on the line Are you sure ya there alone?  Cos I'm trying to explain Somethings wrong  You just don't sound the same Why don't you? Why don't you?  Go outside? Go outside?  Kiss the Rain Whenever you need me Kiss the Rain Whenever I'm gone too long If your lips fell hungry and thirsty  Kiss the Rain  And wait for the dawn Keep in mind Were under the same sky And the nights As empty for me as for you  If you feel you can't wait till morning Kiss the Rain   Hello? Do you miss me? I hear you say you do, But not the way I'm missing you Whats new? Hows the weather? Is it stormy where you are?  cos your so close but it seems like your so far So would it mean anything? If you knew, What I'm left imagining In my mind In my mind Would you go? Would you go?  Kiss the Rain And you fall Over meThink of meT hink of me Think of me Only me   Kiss the Rain Whenever you need me  Kiss the rain Whenever I'm gone too long If your lips fell hungry and tempted Kiss the Rain and wait for the dawn  Keep in mind Were under the same sky  And the nights As empty for me as for you If you feel You can't wait till morning Kiss the Rain   Kiss the rain Hello? Can you hear me?  taken from Kiss the Rain by Billie Myers

      Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain, ohLook for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved And She will be loved And She will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful  She will be loved (repeated) Please don't try so hard to say good bye.

       seven times have i despised my soul :   1. the first time when i saw her being meek that she might attain height  2. the second time, when i saw her limping before the crippled  3. the third time, when she was given to choose between the hard time and the easy, and she chooses the easy  4. the fourth time, when committed a wrong and comforted herself that other also committed a wrong  5. the fifth time, when she forbore for weakness and attributed her patience to strenght  6. the sixth time, when she despised the ugliness of a face and knew not that it was one of her own masks  7. the seventh time, when she sang a song of praise and deemed it a virtue.

       Groningen November 9, 2003   I Went to Eindhoven yesterday. took the second train early in the morning and it was not a very amazing experience riding your bike when there was still dawn and the weather was hell. it was cold to death and i wore my tshirt, sweaters and jacket as well. not to forget the scarfs. two!. and took like 30 minutes to get to the station from my flat but it was ok..   i was visiting the book festival there with many indonesian students who live in Groningen as well. they are nice people. we spent like 4 hours there circling around the building which very big and also tiring to walk around the whole racks.   there was nothing about the law book. all i can see was cookery, travelling bible, novels, dictionaries in many languages, etc. no law book! not even a single.   after we had done with the books, we went straightly to the station to catch the earliest train to Maastricht. it is a nice city with beautiful scenery. its a must city to go. we were staying there for about 4 hours. after having dinner we catched the train to go back home. 19.29 was the possible train to catch. but sure, we had to make several stops since there was delaying and the train ran a bit slower than it usually does. we had to make stops at utrecht centraal station and amersfoort before we got to Groningen.   we arrived in Groningen centraal station at 11.30 pm. and it was very cold and of course we were all like freezing to death. the temprature was like lower than 4 celcius degrees. so we rushly back home riding bikes as usual.   i got home at 12.00, i guess and i hadnt had my dinner yet so me and diana prepared somethng for both of us before i went to bed.   today, i woke up at 12.00.. so after 12 hours of sleeping i decided that i have to go to the library and make a little reading for the upcoming friday presentation. tomorrow i have an appointment with the politie and after its been done im going straightly to the embassy in Den Haag. another journey that i have to make. but its fun and of course takes money!   now, i have to go back with my reading materials. have a nice sunday dears!   i will put the pictures of the last journey on my photos site so you all can see the joy i had yesterday.   greetings,  Alia

       Groningen, 9 October 2003   this is the first day!   actually its a bit late to write about my arrival in Groningen but please.. this has to be done anyway... i arrived at Schipol Airport at 08.30 local time. with approximately 70 kilos of luggages i probably looked like someone who is going nowhere to go... a bit funny... i said to myself.. but then again.. god do loves me.. he sent me this couple and helped me out with my belongings which were not that heavy.. come on.. 70 kilos is like nothing... hueiahiea...   then again.. i which completely blind with how the system of the local train runs.. got another help from them... a long the journey... i wasnt very impressed with the scenery since i got a headache probably because i was soo tired but that was not a problem since i could see so many cows, sheeps, and miniature horses along the railway... huehuuhee.. yeah.. this country is rich with cows and sheeps for sure.. the weather the day i arrived was a bit friendly... compared to these days... but i can manage...   centraal station is impressive with the paintings on its ceiling.. its made of centuries ago i guess.. but have no idea about it.. i started my journey alone.. the very kind couple stepped down at assen station.. 15 minutes before Groningen... i hope i can meet them some day just to say how thankful i was for their help...   i was trying to look for the starter pack for the mobile phones.. but unluckily the woman gave me the refill instead of the new number.. so i might looked like an idiot but she realized that she was the one... hehehe.. and because of her fault i asked her nicely to call my faculty and ask someone there if somebody would pick me up here.. i was afraid that they were forgotten about my arriving... btw, they didnt forget about me!   so, i waited like 10 minutes before Kirsten showed up at the station and helped me with the luggages.. she was soo suprised with my belongings.. but hey.. i m going to spend like one year here.. maybe longer.. so many things i have to bring from where i belong then.   then, straightly went to the flat.. and didnt get the chance just to lay my head down on the pillow.. no way... i directly went to the faculty and being introduced with the faculty members was like a great compliment for me.. i am young and i met like incredible people who devoted their life in the name of education.. man... you should be very smart to be the kind of person.   at nite, i had typical dutch dinner. we ate pancake at the boat restaurant.. before having dinner.. we took the canal trip.. we were sailing through the groningen main canals for about one hour and it was great but it was soo rainy so i had to be very careful with the headache.. but meeting very friendly was like raining in the dessert.. i suddenly forgot about the headache.   i got home at 11.00 and met my new flatmate.. hes a polish guy. a very kind one. named konrad. he studies biology at the same university as mine. and also cindy, a chinese girl, who also takes law as her major.   went to bed early. i had class in the morning.. at 9.. woow.. already classes??   sweet dreams alia

       we had snow once again last night. hope it wouldnt be the last time. i like to see when it falls down and touches the ground. you feel the holyness and you become absolutely sentimental and melancholy. i have been there many times. being melancholy and sentimental is a circumstance where the loneliness inside you comes to the surface and sometimes you can not control it and in silent&nbsp;your tears drop and you feel the warm they bring on your cheek and go through&nbsp;your veins and your feeling starts tumbling down and mend into pieces. you remember someone deep inside you that you have been ignoring for long times. but still need its presence.   im tired but i feel the excitement inside me jumping all over the place. do you think i am lucky? i do not want to have the feeling but i can not throw it away since i'm not allowed to and what power do i have though. so much words that i want to tell, but is it worth enough to let them out?

       huaaaaaaaaa... today.. completely exhausted! woke up too early but went off the bed too late... huahuaua.. typical me... didnt eat breakfast so took the boiled eggs with me but suddenly i remember that eating eggs in the bus is not a very sophisticated thing to do! so.. i had to keep all the hunger with me along the day!   today, i visited boutrange. the location is near to German border. only 2 kilometres away. its a fort. an old fort built by dutch in the 16 centruy. 1580 for certain. dutch people created this fort as a defence from spanish army when they had the war back then. the fort was almost completely abandoned and the inhabitants needed money for the restoration. they asked for the contribution from the major of groningen but didnt succeed. they went to King William, king of holland, but also failed. so, they renovated the fort with their own money and hands.   the youngsters slowly went off to the city to get a better living by working in the big city, most of went to groningen. once again, the fort abondened. to save the fort and the inhabitants which gain their money from becoming farmers had to come up with the idea how to save their surrounding from tumbling down. so, they decided to renovate and open the fort for tourists attraction. this idea leads the boutrange as a place for the visitors to enjoy their times with families and the inhabitants find their neighbourhood as a place just like the old days they used to live in.    if you want to see pictures from boutrange just click   urlLink boutrange neighbourhood  ok?   now let me have a good sleep... let dream about you ok? ciao ciao..,  Alia

      there you are.  sitting on the bench that belongs to no one  waiting for the light to show you the way  where the happiness may not only be a mystery.   there you are  smilling to the pity of life you've been walking through  drinking all the sins that were made to be forbidden  imagining you'r loved one in heaven   there you are  regreting the shadow which is innocent  crying to the memories that&nbsp;are unbearable  trying to grab the rainbow for your own soul   early in the morning i hear you whispering  early in the morning i hear you screaming  at the very moment  i imagine that i'm in love with you.   groningen, at 09.30 am.  alia

       In a brief conversation, a man asked a woman he was pursuing the question   "What kind of man are you looking for?"   She sat quietly for a moment before looking him in the eye and asking "Do you really want to know?"   Reluctantly, he said "Yes."   She began to expound... " As a woman in this day and age, I am in a position to ask a man what he  can do for me that I can't do for myself. I pay my own bills. I take care of my household with out the help of any man...or woman for that matter.   Iam in the position to ask "What can you bring to the table?"   The man looked at her. Clearly he thought that she was referring to money.   She quickly corrected his thought and stated "I am not referring to money. I need something more. I need a man who is striving for perfection in every aspect of life."   He sat back in his chair, folded his arms, and asked her to explain.   She said, "I am looking for someone who is striving for perfection mentally because I need conversation and mental stimulation. I don't need a simple-minded man.   I am looking for someone who is striving for perfection spiritually because I don't need to be unequally yoked...believers mixed with unbelievers is a recipe for disaster.   I need a man who is striving for perfection financially because I don't need a financial burden. I am looking for someone who is sensitive enough to understand what I go through as a woman but strong enough to keep me grounded.   I am looking for someone who I can respect. In order to be submissive, I must respect him. I cannot be submissive to a man who isn't taking care of his business. I have no problem being submissive...he just has to be worthy. God made woman to be a help mate for man. I can't help a man if he can't help himself."   When she finished her spiel, she looked at him. He sat there with a puzzled look on his face. He said "You are asking a lot."   She replied "I'm worth a lot."   quoted from a forwarded e-mail, Groningen, filled with my self egoistic woman pride,  Alia

       To Every Woman in The World   By the time the lord made woman, he was into sixth day of working overtime. An angel appeared and said "     why are you spending so much time on this one?"       and the Lord answered "have you seen the spec sheet on her? she has to be completely washable, but not plastic, have over 299 movable parts, all replaceable, run on diet coke and leftovers, have a lap that can hold four children at one time, have a kiss that can sure anything from scraped knee to a broken heart and have two pairs of hands"   the angel was astouned at the requirements. "two pairs of hands! no way! and that's just on the standard model? that;s too much work for one day. wait untill tomorrow to finish. "but i can't" the lord protested. "i am so close to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart. she already heals herself when she is sick and can work 18 hours days."   The angel moved closer and touched the woman. "but you have made her so soft, Lord. she is so soft." the Lord agreed, "but i have also made her tough. you have no idea what she can endure or accomplish..."   "will she be able to think?", asked the angel.   the Lord replied, "not only she will be able to think, she will be able to reason and negotiate."   the angel then noticed something, and reaching out, touched the woman's cheek. "oops, it! looks like you have a leak in this model. i told you that you were trying to put too much into this one."   "that's not a leak, "the lord corrected, "that's a tear."   "what's the tear for?", the angel asked.   the Lord said, "the tear is her way of expressing jer joy, her sorrow, her pain, her disappointment, her love, her loneliness, her grief and her pride."   the angel was impressed. "you are a genious, Lord. You thought of everything! woman is truly amazing."   and she is! women have strenght that amaze men. the bear hardships and they caryy burdens, but they hold happiness, love and joy. they smile when they want to scream. they sing when they want to cry. they cry when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous. they fight for what they believein. they stand up to injustice. they dont take "no" for answer when they believe there is a better solution. they go without so their family can have. they go to the doctor with a frightened friend. they love unconditionally. they cry when their children excel and cheer when their friends get awards. they are happy when they hear a friend dies. they grieve at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think there is no strength lef. they know that a hug and a kiss can healp to heal a broken heart.   women come in all sizes, in all colors and shapes. they'll drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you to show how much they care about you. the heart of a woman is what makes the world keep turning! they bring joy and hope. they have compassion and ideals. they give morals support to their family and friends. Women have vital things to say and everything to give. women are amazing because if there is one flaw in women, it is that they tend to forget about themselves!   proud to be one!

       dear half,   i spent my whole last week in the library. at least 9 hours a day. for me, it was no biggy.. actually im starting to liking it. i never used to spend hours in the library just be with the books. i always carry my books home with me. but here, i like it. its much more convenient rather than study at home. too much temptation at my very comfortable flat. tv, internet, nice flatmates, and also the family. our bell never stops ringing. and the kitchen is always filled up with the family. so, library is my place i think.   silly i know i may be sound. but this is my life. this is how i can make a living. this is my future that someday i would gain a lot from it.   yesterday, my topic was approved and Prof. Verwey will be my supervisor. i really dont know how to thank this very kind prof. thank you, if you ever happened to read this blog.   but, today, my god.. i spent the entire day on bed, online. talked to mom lastnight. sound great to hear her voice again since long time. mom, you i do love you dont you?   in the afternoon, i went out with my new lithuanian flatmate. he needs to open a bank account here but again the bank system here is a bit annoying. they refused to open an account for him just because hes only be here for five months and their regulation is that one person only can have an account if he/she will stay in the netherlands longer than six months... what the heck is that??   i was like quarelling at the back.. told them that it is impossible not allowing him to have an account there... but of course no more you can do unless you provide yourself minimum required docs. bastard!   then, went to library to make copy of cases for tomorrow class. met an interesting nice smiling guy at the copy room.. hahaha... no kidding... but, i had to be hurry.. since i needed to take home my flat-tyre bicycle... huh...   it was raining like freak! i had to pump the tyre three times before got home... in the rain!!! hehehe... heck huh... but thats holland what more can you expect instead of nice weather!!   well, should continue my reading my cases now... bye half...

God, please forgive all the sins that have been made within the time being and may your soul be with me to shower me with your bless and may your spirit live inside me to help through the problems. may i see you within my eyes when i see my own reflection to guide me to walk within the paths and fragile bridges that should be crossed by me. let me hear your whispering when i hear someone talk to me so i can hear all the heaven's songs. let you be my hands to help me cope with the burdens and write all my works and my life so i can give the best efforts to the surrounding that live in the circle of life of mine. may you be my guidance till the doomsday comes to let me die in your bear. amin.   i celebrated idul adha feast in den haag, netherlands. i woke up at 09.30 at my friend's flat. should have been gone since 08.00. this was a major mistake! should have been went to bed earlier. but this happened already which no use that youre regreting all the past now. went straightly to my flat, had shower and drank milk, had a small breakfast and did the packing soooo fast!.. which i never could have been imagined for all this time.   it was rainy and stormy. groningen just like usual, always wet and windy. the weather is not very friendly for someone from a very beautiful tropical country such as Indonesia. where you only have the temprature between 25 - 33 degrees of celcius. but here, you sometimes imagined to have sun in the morning when you do the morning prayer, but no.. it is only live in your imagination and be a fatamorgana one may say...   left the key to my room to Luisa so she could use my connection and had shower at mine since hers was and is broken up to now. poor italian. had a small chat with her and ozgul, with the family.   bought the voordeel-urenkaart for 49 euro and a weekend retour ticket from gro - den haag - gro which costed me another 23,20 euro. i hoped it would be worthy.   missed the direct train and took the next train which was the stop trein and ran "berry berry" (LOL) slowly... felt a sleep indeed. changed the train at amersfoort and instantly took the utrecht - den haag centraal train. still confused with the voor - achter system here.. should be listening to ducth people instead.   arrived at violenweg in the afternoon and had a late lunch... hmm.. yummy... there were also students from nijmegen, utrecht and leiden.   the night was sooo windy and scarry. you can not imagined how the speed of this wind. went bed at 12.00. i was exhausted.   woke up at 07.00 and not directly took the shower.. ok, i still have another half hour to let my eyes rest, i was talking to myself. so.. this leads to another mistake. woke up at 8.10... and i only had 30 minutes before the driver pick us and take us all to the mosque.   after the sholat, went back to violenweg and had lontong sayur, etc. i felt like celebrating the real moslem feast back home.   in the afternoon, before leaving back to my home town, we went to the scheveningen. the only famous beach that netherlands has. it is a very nice place and people were everywhere since we had the sun at that day. you can not imagine how people were soo happy to have sun here....   took the 17.38 train and didnt have to do the overstappen anywhere.. so i could rest... got home at 8.30.. and made an appearance at my flat at 21.30 i guess.. had a small discussion with konrad about my trip and his journey to germany... it was not a very interesting travel of him. he had to pay 200 euro for not having the bus ticket with him... hmm.. poor flatmate no?   took shower and went to yohannes, watched for a moment and suddenly felt very sleepy so decided to have sleep in my own comfortable mattress. lay my head at 01.00 am   good nite darling... still missing your half?   alia

       Siti Noor Malia Putri   Siti :  Your name of Siti gives you a very happy-go-lucky, spontaneous nature. You see the humorous side of many situations and can laugh at yourself as well as at others. This name gives you a musical, artistic nature and you would do well in any occupation in the entertainment field. You have many friends because of your generous, happy nature, but if crossed you have a quick temper, although your annoyance does not last too long. You do enjoy an argument and will at times say things just to get others going and then you sit back and enjoy the debate. You lack system and order and find it very difficult to budget and save money.   Noor :  Your first name of Noor has given you the vision and foresight to be able to organize others and to hold positions of responsibilities with poise and self-confidence. This name creates an optimistic outlook on life and favourable conditions in your personal affairs. You have the ability to express your thoughts and ideas, and you are friendly, likeable, and generous.   Malia :  Your name of Malia gives you a highly sensitive, idealistic, and intuitive nature. You could be expressive and creative in the arts, music, or drama and you have a great desire to help others. Since you are not inclined to give due consideration to practical and business matters, you could miss out on reaching a level of financial success appropriate for your efforts and abilities.

       woke up at 6 in the morning. groningen was absolutely dark. no singing birds, the sun was still shy to let me see its morning smile, no bycicle rider, no car engine fuss, i wondered, what am i going to do in this early?   i remembered my thesis. i remembered my mom back home. i remembered books that need to be read. i remembered my sister just probably just arrived from her trip to Malaysia and Singapore to attend seminars there. i remembered a glass of water to sweep away my thirst. i remembered my friend. i remembered a nice song that i just recently like to sing it in every single minute. i remembered my anger, i remembered my previous day, i remembered my missing half, i remembered You!.   spent 6 hours in the library today. finished almost 3 chapters today. i felt the enthustiatic emotion running all over the corner in my mind... demanding to finish more chapters... but i knew i also have limits. i decided to stop and went home in calm. i tried to whisper my own voice to my ear.   i think i'm in love with chapters of my journey in life but my half still not there.   good nite lovely, never look back, only tomorrow will give you the nourishment of your journey...   groningen, 11.15 pm.

       Hari ini kau mengeluh   Bahwa makananmu kurang enak    Seorang anak memandang orang yang lalu lalang   Berharap ada yang mau disemir sepatunya   Demi beberapa suap nasi    Hari ini kau mengeluh   Di balik kenyamanan mobil, alunan musik dan dinginnya AC   Bahwa kemacetan lalu lintas seakan membuatmu gila    Orang-orang berlarian mengejar buskota   Berdesak-desakan, peluh mengalir dan kepengapan   Pengamen silih berganti mencoba mencari rejeki    Hari ini kau mengeluh   Bahwa rumahmu terlalu kecil dan jauh    Seorang gelandangan menggelar koran yang lusuh   Lalu merebahkan dirinya yang lelah   Beratapkan langit dengan sejuta bintang   Berharap hujan tak singgah malam ini    Tidakkah kau lelah mengeluh?

      If children live with criticism they learn to condemn.   If children live with hostility, they learn to fight.   If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive.   If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves.   If children live with ridicule, they learn to feel shy.   If children live with jealousy, they learn to feel envy.   If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence.   If children live with tolerance, they learn patience.   If children live with acceptance, they learn to like themselves.   If children live with recognition, they learn it is good to have a goal.   If children live with sharing, they learn generosity.   If children live with honesty, they learn truthfulness.   If children live with fairness, they learn justice.   If children live with kindness and consideration, they learn respect.   If children live with security, they learn to have faith in themselves and in those about them.   If children live with friendliness, they learn the world is a nice place in which to live.

       dear all,   today, 30 june 2004, is the day that i hate the most. my flatmates are gone suddenly. im all alone. no one to talk to, no morning greetings, no breakfast together, no traditional cookings, no fuss, no arguing, no crazy and wild laughing, no morning smiles. they left an empty hole within my heart. i had been living with Konrad Gorski, a polish guy, for not a very perfect 9 months. the first day i arrived in my flat, he was having a small party with people which later became my family here. the second day after arrival he made me a small 'only for the two of us' dinner in which i&nbsp;drank my first glass of wine. it was not (a bit) tasty but what the dinner brought me probably would be&nbsp;the moment that&nbsp;couldnt be&nbsp;kicked out of my mind.   with Konrad, i used to go shopping,&nbsp; went from one dinner to another dinner, went out, my first going out was to park house, pakhuis, in the centre, with him. he used to accompany me with my "late walking around the&nbsp;neighbourhood" habit. when we walk, everytime, anywhere, in any occassion, he always let me hold his arm. he is a very nice guy whom probably cant be forgotten for the rest of my life. i remember he always cooked vegetarian although hes not one. he knew that i hate cooking so we made a deal that he would do the cook and i would do the&nbsp;dishes. for my birthday, he bought me 60 red roses in the centre. so many things that cant be erased from my memory about him. now he left me... probably we wont see each other again.   with Marius, a lithuanian guy, i only spent 5 months together but he was nice and very friendly. hes a very talkative person with such a great knowledge.   the three of us had a big fight once and we are not going to regret it since it made us realize that we already lost our sense of togetherness that needed to be re-united.   i really hated to wake up this morning, hope i could just stop the time and let them stay a little bit longer but i couldnt. konrad left the flat at 10.00 am and Marius just left 20 minutes ago as i write this journal. i cried for them as they were too crying. now, i miss them badly. for sure this wont be happening again in the future.   guys, if you ever happen read this journal, then you do know how much i miss you... love and kisses for you dears...

       what the heck am i doing this late??? its already 3.00 but still im wide awake. ive tried to close this silly eyes but didnt succeed. so i was thinking, what should i do at this late?? knock on my friend's house and ask her out? thats simply impossible! the family has already gone back to their home countries. some are left here until the end of august but still got things to be done. thesis you name it!   i did turn off my television but couldn't handle it. so, i turned it on again. i wrote an email for my friend and ended up looking at people's profiles in friendster.com. hmm.. this late-asleep habit is getting serious i guess. well i made a huge mistake indeed. i slept for almost 2 hours this afternoon. so now im totally fresh like an air-freshner :(   i have no idea what to write but all i can think is just keep typing without knowing where this writting is going to end. probably i will go mumbling something kinky, silly, stupid or probably crazy and you just perhaps will easily get bored reading it :)   i saw a dead fish on MTV. saw a super-speeding train. saw a man taking pictures on it. holly cow, i relly am mumbling here...   should stop this now, otherwise people wont come back to read this blog any longer since it only contains junks huehuehue...   i will shut down every single thing that is shining, producing sound, or readable... hihihi.. i will try hard. btw, you guys should listen to keane's new single called everybody's changing... nice one.. when i have time searching for its lyrics i will put it in the 'senandungku' blog ok?   now, let me try and enjoy my battle to end up this horrible insomnia...   groningen, at 3.12 am, keane's singing everybody's changing,  alia

       Love   Because of you, in gardens of blossoming flowers  I ache from the perfumes of spring.   I have forgotten your face,  I no longer remember your hands;  how did your lips feel on mine?   Because of you, I love the white statues drowsing in the parks,  the white statues that have neither voice nor sight.   I have forgotten your voice, your happy voice;  I have forgotten your eyes.   Like a flower to its perfume,  I am bound to my vague memory of you.   I live with pain that is like a wound;  if you touch me, you will do me irreparable harm.  Your caresses enfold me, like climbing vines on melancholy walls.   I have forgotten your love, yet I seem to glimpse you in every window.   Because of you, the heady perfumes of summer pain me;  because of you, I again seek out the signs that precipitate desires:  shooting stars, falling objects.   pasted from :  urlLink http://boppin.com/neruda.html &nbsp; urlLink     groningen, 3.41 pm, kitchen,  alia

       'kangen' in english is a term that describing a situation when you remember someone and you are longing for his/her presence. kangen is indonesian. in english we simply say "miss" for instance i miss you (badly?). i am inspired to write this topic since i saw my friends status in yahoo messenger saying "dad, what is longing?" or "ayah, kangen itu apa?". her little daughter probably asked her husband the definition of this term.   when you type "miss" in google search engine, the first thing they will show you is missuniverse.com, missamerica.org, etc. but when you change it into indonesian it will fastly show you kapanlagi.com, and most of the rest are linking you to the mega pop-star indonesian band. they have a song called 'kangen'. im not going to talk about the differences of these two languages which is in fact having the same meaning in our daily life.   like i mentioned before, missing is a situation when you want somebody's presence to be near you at the moment she/he/they is/are away from you. if i may say this is a situation when someone is dependent on someone's. for example, i miss my mother like hell these days for having not been seen her almost a year since i have to be in the Netherlands and she lives in Jakarta, Indonesia. we are almost 16 hours apart by plane, devided by deep oceans and continents.   this missing feeling is indeed established by my inner emotion showing that i like my mother's companion. she raised me and watched me growing up. our togetherness and closeness have been built since i was still in her womb. she fed me indeed and gave me the air allowing me to breath my life.   when i was still in indonesia, even though i stepped out from my mother's house since i was 18, i went to a State University in Bandung, it's like 3 hours away by train from Jakarta, we used to talk to each other almost every day through the line. we used to ask whether each other was having a bad day or not. i can talk about almost everything to her. of course not my personal relations. i rarely talk about that even to my own mother. but since i got here, im not able any longer to talk to her&nbsp;as we used to do since it's so costly. so we had to figure out how to solve this problem. we found yahoo messenger as a good mediator.   i see here that people, they always looking for a way out. in this situation a way out to solve somebody's 'kangen' feeling to someone. you have to go circling around to the background why me and my mother extremely looking to find a better way to communicate to erase this 'kangen' emotion. i would say it dependency.   and as a human being, i would say that not only 'no man is an island' but also 'homo homini lupus' as having been said by Plautus, centuries ago, and again was popular in Thomas Hobbes life period. Hobbes mentioned this term in his book 'De cive, Epistola dedicatoria'. indeed he was right saying this term, since nowadays we like to defeat each other. war is every where. earth is no longer a heaven on earth for human being. not even to erase the simple thing called 'kangen'.   i am consciously aware that im lacking sources to write this journal. my only source is only what i have in mind. i am not hoping this stupid writting will amount such arguments since it is argueable. but if you want to share your thoughts here, please do. id love to hear anything from any of you.   groningen, at 3.21 pm, kitchen, unfortunately not missing anyone at the moment,  Alia

       not that i want to be bluntly sarcastic at this moment. after having viewed some of blogs and journals of some girls, now i am thinking why on earth that my own kind loves not only things that are blinking, shining and&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;and&nbsp;but also how&nbsp;they want to be as perfect as they can even&nbsp;to be one&nbsp;they have to spend some cash?   can't they just take what has been given to them?  can't they just think of some thing more useful?  can't they just be proud of themself for what they really are perfectly beautiful?   every woman is beautiful for every girl has her own character to be one!   wake up my friends!   groningen, at 10.13 pm, kitchen,  alia

       my connection is back! yep it went off this morning perhaps because of the bad weather we have here in Groningen. it was raining a bit and cloudy. i still have no sun till now. i hope the weather is going to be better compared to this minute.   today is a bit cold since the wind blows real hard. i had to close off every window i have in my flat. usually i let them open since i like to breath fresh air. well, i have to continue writing my conclusion. this thesis will be over real soon! i promise you, if i have finish this writing i will post you my travelling stories. yep, i have plans before going home to go somewhere, for sure paris and berlin. probably i will visit barcelona too and praag. but lets see what the future brings me. :)   groningen, at 12.52pm, a bit sleepy,  alia

       i woke up a bit early this sunday. suddenly, i&nbsp;had a feeling like i were&nbsp;in love. and jerry maguire the movie scenes&nbsp;were popped up &nbsp;in my head.   this movie is hillarious. i really love this enchanting romantic comedy one. this is the one that is not forgotten. i love every part of this movie. " you had me at hello " part tells you how you can so deeply in love with someone at the first sight. thou&nbsp; i dont believe love at first sight but this scene is sooo beautiful.   i love when cuba gooding jr. tells jerry maguire (tom cruise) how he has to tell&nbsp;dorothy (rene  zelwegger) his feeling about her, " she loves you... if you dont love her... you've got to tell her !" that part was incredibly touched my inner feeling.   at the men's room at the stadion when jerry&nbsp;screams to&nbsp;rod saying " help me.. help you, HELP ME... HELP YOU !", this scene is sooo human....   i love kids so much as i love myself. dont think kids can be taken away from my life in which i enjoy every moment that i share with kids. thou i dont have one yet. and jerry maguire shows me more how the affections they bring me. when jerry, dorothy and ray at the airport and ray was swinging between jerry and dorothy... that was awesome!.. when jerry was drunk and ray asked jerry " lets go to the zoo " and jerry went " the fucking zoo is closed " and ray gasped "  you said fuck.. i wont tell " that was funny!!!! and when rod (cuba gooding jr) calls jerry's mobile in angry and jerry let ray to pick up his call and rod nonstoply talking and ray only said " you talk too much " then he hang up.. bwahahahaha... i love kids!!   the songs in this movie&nbsp;are also great, and of course,one of them is&nbsp;secret garden. i always listen to this song over and over again especially at the moment when i couldnt tell my former boyfriends about anything i wanted to say to them. i just listened to this song hoping they'd understand about my feelings. i know i know that i&nbsp;may sound stupid but sometimes there are some parts that you better keep them with yourself.   here is the lyrics of secret garden :  She'll let you in her houseIf you come knockin' late at night  She'll let you in her mouthIf the words you say are rightI  f you pay the price She'll let you deep inside  But there's a secret garden she hides   She'll let you in her car To go drivin' round  She'll let you into the parts of herself That'll bring you down  She'll let you in her heart If you got a hammer and a vise  But into her secret garden, don't think twice   You've gone a million miles How far'd you get  To that place where you can't rememberAnd you can't forget   She'll lead you down a pathThere'll be tenderness in the air  She'll let you come just far enough So you know she's really there  She'll look at you and smileAnd her eyes will say  She's got a secret garden Where everything you want  Where everything you need  Will always stayA million miles away&nbsp;   i keep saying that men are bastards for they keep playing with my emotions but instantly this movie plays an imporatant role about my feeling to my men, i keep remember when dorothy says ""Men are the enemy, but I still love the enemy...". didnt matter how i see men as bastards but i did love my bastard... ;0)   i would end this journal by saying the best part from this movie was " you complete me "   Groningen, at 7.54 am, hoping i were in love,  alia

       Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.And he raised his head and looked upon the people,  and there fell a stillness upon them.And with a great voice he said:  When love beckons to you, follow him,Though his ways are hard and steep.And when his wings enfold you yield to him,Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.And when he speaks to you believe in him,Though his voice may shatter your dreamsas the north wind lays waste the garden.  &nbsp;  For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderestbranches that quiver in the sun,So shall he descend to your roots and shake them  in their clinging to the earth.Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.He threshes you to make you naked.He sifts you to free you from your husks.He grinds you to whiteness.He kneads you until you are pliant:And then he assigns you to his sacred fire,that you may become sacred bread for God`s sacred feast.  &nbsp;  All these things shall love do unto you  that you may know the secrets of your heart,and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life`s heart.  &nbsp;  But if in your fear you would seek onlylove`s peace and love`s pleasure,Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness andpass out of love`s threshing floor,Into the seasonless world where youshall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.  Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself,Love possesses not nor would it be possessed:For love is sufficient unto love.  &nbsp;  When you love you should not say,"God is in my heart," but rather,"I am in the heart of God."And think not you can direct the courseof love, for love, if it finds you worthy,directs your course.  &nbsp;  Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself.But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heartand give thanks for another day of loving:To rest at the noon hour and meditate love`s ecstasy:And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in you heartand a song of praise upon you lips.

      if you want to leave, just leave...  fly away to a place where the bird sings more beautifully,  where you can heal all the wound inside...  where you can let go all the burden freely...   if you want to leave, then leave...  for i do believe we have nothing in common,  don't push ourselves to the hill for it will hurt us deeper...  by telling each other lies...   if you want to leave, please leave...  i won't do anything to make you stay here any longer,  for every man has his own wings...  for every man has his own destination...   Groningen, at 3.27 am, please decide before its too late, Alia     ps: i was happy i won't pretend...

       ok, this is a bit difficult situation (according to me!). you may imagine yourself as in my position. i dont like this person and found this person lately a bit annoying. ive tried to hide myself away but still this person keeps coming back into my days. not that i hate this person or what.. but i just dont like this person's presence and makes my day. that's all. how can you tell this person to stay away without hurting this person's feeling???  room, groningen, at 6.59 pm, annoyed!

       i just got back from my 3 days 3 nights holiday... i left Groningen to Enschede in Friday afternoon. i was filled thinking that i had everything with me. i went a bit early having in mind that i need to ask some questions about the rail-plus card. unfortunately, in summer time, they close earlier than usual. so waited for more than half an hour in the station. my train left at 19.17 and it departed just on-time like usual. as i had sit there comfortably for 2 minutes, suddenly, i remembered that i forgot my passport. so, i made a quick move and stepped down in Assen Statation, only 15 minutes from Groningen and took the train that goes back to Groningen.  damnit! i waited for the bus that directly goes to my neighbourhood for about 20 minutes and to go back to the station i had to wait for about almost 40 minuten. i was sooo upset! it was already 20.50 am and missed the 21.07 train. so had to take the 21.21 train. when i arrived in Enschede it was almost mitnait. on the train, i sat next to a psycho guy who kept talking and turning his head like a puppet while talking. he smiled a lot. however he was nice. he knew that i was cold and the windows were almost open so he closed the one near him and smiled again. huehuehue.. we talked probably for 30 minutes before got to enschede. found out that he lives in enschede and had to travel back to somewhere he mentioned, but i forgot where exactly :), on the next day. he waited for me a couple of minutes but i felt a bit afraid so said to leave since i was in a hurry. went outside the station but didnt meet my friends who promised to pick me up there. tried to make a phone call but suddenly they called me from distance.. fuiiihhh.. i was relieved.
