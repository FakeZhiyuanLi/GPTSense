      I shot a 94, while Dave shot 91.  I was not really hitting very well until after number 6.  After that I settled down to par number 8.  I shot 48 for the front, which I think is more difficult than the back because you get a lot of bad lies.  I scored 46 on the back which should have been lower considering I parred 3 holes, scoring back to back pars on 15 and 16 and also one on 13.  Dave continues to hit very well, hitting sweeter and farther than myself.  He had a 43 on the front and was all set to break 90 except he was robbed with a 48 on the back.  He has consistency issues, (so don't we all).  It was a better round than Sunday when I played with the guys from grounds at Apple Hill. I scored 101.  I keep working toward my goal of consistent low 90's.  I am encouraged because I have finally been breaking 100 regularly over the last couple of weeks.  Practice, practice, practice.....

      One of the worst things in life is having your car in the shop.  Not only does in wipe out the budget for an entire fiscal quarter, it is also a madenning inconvenience.  Oi, maybe I need substitute transportation on my insurance policy.

      Oi, what a week... I am TIRED.  Instead of the usual 3:30 to 11:30, I've had to begin work early 3 days this week.  It really throws off my schedule.  I still managed 18 hole rounds on Monday and Thursday, shooting 97 and 93 respectively.  Not bad for me.  I thrashed Dave on Monday by 10 strokes, but he got the better of me on Thursday by 5.  At least I am finishing the week with a chinese buffet, courtesy of the Academy.  THANK YOU!! for our discretionary spending account!  And Thank You, Heather, of course.  The weekend is almost here.....weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!

      The subject of pitbull restraint was raised today in a  urlLink blog I frequently read.   The author was quite upset over the fact that she, as a pitbull owner, would be required to muzzle their pet while in public due to a hastily enacted city ordinance.  The whole episode stems from a  urlLink vicious attack  by an aggressive pitbull on another dog and several police officers.  The dog being attacked was killed and at least one of the officers was sent to the hospital.  While any dog that is mistreated can become aggressive and pose a public danger, we have seen time and time again that pitbulls, due to their tendancy for relentless attacks when provoked, are especially dangerous.  But is it necessary to single out a particular breed because of this tendancy??  This knee-jerk legislation does so, which is what has so many responsible pit-bull owners upset.  Why can't officials focus on individual incidents instead of punishing a whole group of dog owners?  When an attack occurs, the animal must be euthanized and charges of negligence considered for the owner.  Strict enforcement for individual offenses would be a better course of action than the shoot-from-the-hip antics we witnessed from legislators today.

      It's days like this when I think back to last January when it was -6 degrees.  I remember flying out of Logan one frigid morning and seeing the "arctic sea smoke" rising above Boston Harbor.  Now, here we are six months later and loving to be outdoors again.  Now if I didn't have to work so early I could be out on the golf course.  But there is always tomorrow of course, to be out on the course.  Sounds like a plan....

       Early to work on Monday....sigh.   Early to work today....sigh.   Early to work on Friday.....sigh.    &nbsp;  I'm losing the benefits of working my second shift job.&nbsp; I'm losing the freedom I usually expect to have the days to myself.&nbsp; I'm losing my mind.    &nbsp;  Well, it's not that bad.&nbsp; I have a good check to look forward to.&nbsp; Can never have to much disposable income, especially with vacation coming up an all.    &nbsp;  Off to work I go.....

      And the leaves that are green turn to brown.  &nbsp;  Yea, well, the sun came out today, finally.&nbsp; My gear is all set for diving.&nbsp; I got my boots and hood this week and, together with my new one piece wet suit, I should be comfortable in the chill New England waters.&nbsp; I still need to get my tanks VI, but I checked today and one of them is charged to 2800.&nbsp; I don’t know when I will find a day to make a trip, but I know there are only so many weekends of good weather in the summer up here.  &nbsp;  Golf tomorrow, I think.&nbsp; I am looking to play in Hudson at Green Meadow with Dave.&nbsp; I hope I do better than the meager 105 I shot at Crystal on Monday this week.&nbsp; Oh yea, Dave shot 90, the a..hole.&nbsp; Will the boat finally see the waters of Winnipesauke this weekend?&nbsp; We shall see.

      It’s just another rainy, cool day here in Massachusetts.  The boat stays in the yard.  The clubs stay in the garage.  But the lawn gets watered and soon I will need to get the mower out again.  Somewhere out there it's hazy, hot, and humid.  Why must we suffer through these incorrigible winters and not get the summer we deserve?

      More than once this week I have tried to take a day off from work, you know, shorten the work week and all that.  Either plans fell through or the weather wouldn’t cooperate, so, it has been to work every day, grinding away.  Soon however, I will be out there, on the trail, or on the water, or on the road.  I don’t know when, but the anticipation is in my bones.

      So I see this story about the Minnesota Twins promoting  urlLink a giveaway of GI Joe’s  to honor this country’s servicemen.  Then it’s waaa-waaaa-waaa from the liberal peacenik’s who don’t like it because it’s teaching our children it’s glorifying war.  How about teaching our kids that some things are worth fighting for.  That our country is a special place in the world where our rights are protected and many men have died for us so we can have that protection.  That there are people in this world who would, for whatever reason, attack you just because your American.  They have no respect for our way of life and will not think about killing innocent civilians, like on September 11, 2001.  That it is ok to show gratitude to those who have fought to protect our freedoms.  So sit down and shut-up you peaceniks.

      Well, you know, the  urlLink convention  was in town, so we left town, and then I did some scuba diving in Maine, and we took the boat to Winnipesauki for a day, and now we got  urlLink tropical storms and hurricanes  coming up the coast.....  But I'm still here and ready to blog again...  Below is a quote from V.P. Dick Cheney speaking against John Kerry's view that the use of our military in Iraq, and elsewhere, is driving terrorists to plan more attacks on us.  "He has even said that by using our strength, we are creating terrorists and placing ourselves in greater danger," Cheney said. "But that is a fundamental misunderstanding of the way the world we are living in works. Terrorist attacks are not caused by use of strength; they are invited by the perception of weakness."  Click  urlLink HERE  for the full article.  All I can add is that there were terrorist attacks aimed at us before September 11, 2001, and attacks on us planned for after September 11, 2001.  It may not seem like a war compared to  the World Wars of the last century, but make no mistake, we are involved in a struggle with consequences equal to that of these previous conflicts.  We did not invite it, but we must fight it with all the resources that were used to defeat Germany and Japan.  So you must decide, is it John Kerry or George Bush who will be the better Commander-In-Chief for this task.
