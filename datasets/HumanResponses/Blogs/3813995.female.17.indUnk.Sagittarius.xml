      It's Friday the 13th, and it's been an interesting one. Usually, I have awesome Friday the 13s, but today was a stero-typical one. I had the crappiest work hours, then my mom's car got a flat, and then I had to take my brother around North Texas. Ugh. And to top it off, today was the last official day of summer. Tomorrow starts the weekend before school. That means I have to worry about getting up early, homework, people, and more responsiblities. I just want summer to last forever. Swimming, vacations, few responsibilities, the Olympics, and guys. I like guys. It's a good thing I decided to pick a sport dominated buy cute, athletic guys.   Time to relax for once today.  Love ya more than today, Rach

      Not much could make me fell better about heading back to school. It means the return to homework, the annoyance of certain people, and stupid traditions such as mums. Maybe I'm just bitter about them because I've never had anyone give me one. That's right folks, Rachel has never had a boyfriend. Thankfully, there are a few things that can help me feel better. Those are clothes, friends, and slurpees from 7-11.   Clothes are the reason that I get excited about school. Usually durring the summer, I'm so busy with work that I don't have a lot of time to look cute and I usually just end up in either skirts or shorts paired with a tank or tee with flip-flops. Fall clothes look better on me, mainly because they cover up my skin that refuses to go from oatmeal colored to a nice tan. Plus, I just prefer cooler weather. It means time for hot chocolate, the possibility for ice to close schools, and cute red noses. On those nasty school tradition days, I just make the extra effort to look good.   Friends always make me feel better on those days too. Most of my friends don't have mums or anything like that, so it's not so bad. I usually laugh harder on those days too. Movin on to reason number three...  SLURPEES!! I just had one today and it was just as good as I remembered it. It was cold and frozen but not solid. It was Mountain Dew flavored and the best part was that I met this cute guy. Sadly, I didn't get his number because my little brother was walkin out the door without paying for his Slurpee. Oh well. C'est la vie. I figured I would never see this dude again, so why not talk to him. So, if anyone is havin a bad day, i recommend goin to 7-11. You never know who you'll meet there.  Time for me to go to class. It's more sword tonight, and that makes me smile.  love ya bunches! R

      I love vacations, but it's always good to come home. Even though Virginia is a nice state, it has something in the air that make my allergies blow up. My guess is all the tobacco smoke and such. I could never go out with a smoker. I wouldn't be able to get through any of the date without constantly blowing myself and poppin' allergy pills. But, aside from the tobacco smoke stuff, it's an awesome state, especially out in the mountains just a half hour drive from West Virginia. It never got a degree above 70 while I was out there AND there was rain. I liked the rain. It reminded me of Scotland. It was green, rainy, hilly, and everything closed at five o'clock.   But, for every good thing about vacations there has to be the bad. The bad on this trip: my grandma. Don't get me wrong, I love my grandma, but she's very uptight and proper and AGRIVATING. She's the reason my mom had an eating disorder. She's the reason why my little sister doesn't eat as much when we visit them. She's the reason I make sure to get small portions so I clean my plate and then she doesn't get mad at me. Oh! And she's the reason why we had to cut or conversation with the maitre'de short. He's been there 49 years and gets my grandparents the best seat in this high-class, fancy-shmancy dining room. We were walking back through the hotel so we could avoid the wedding that was set up outside, and we ran inot him. Actually, my grandpa saw him in the hall and decided to pop in. He's in shorts and a Polo and the rest of my family is in jeans and tees. To eat in this fine room, men must be in a coat and tie and women must be in nice skirts, dresses, or dress pants. No jeans. No tees. No "resort attire". It's a dressed up place and you can't wear anything casual to dinner. So, my grandpa then procedes to walk into the hall and shout across it to get the maitre'de's attention. My grandma then walks down the hall, not looking back when I call her, not turning around to see me, not looking at me. She leaves us and does not wish to be associated with us at all. So, we let her walk and the rest of us hang out talking to the maitre'de and getting some amusing stories  that he's collected over the years, and no one says a word to us about our attire. We then walk back out to the Great Hall and call the bus to take us back to the house. Grandma doesn't say a word to us the entire way. But, she's my grandma and I love her. no matter what she does.  Well, I think that about does it for this one. I need a self-updating blog or something. It gets too hard to remember to write in this thing.  love ya, Rach

      I just got back from picking up my schdule for next year and I have more reasons to hate my counselor. I already knew that she was slow and a robot. But, now I know that she hates students. It's the first day that we get our schedule and she leaves early. That means I have to wake up at seven o'clock tomorrow to talk to her by eight because I have to go to work early. I also have to suck-up enough so she'll sign my college application papers, saying that I'm a good person and then the college of my choice will accept me. Ugh....  But enough of that. I'm in a surprisingly good mood today. My parking space is a little farther out than I'd like, but it's close to the exit that I need to take out to get to work. For those of you who know the CHS parking lot, after you turn in, it's the second left and then the fourthish spot in. It'll suck on the days that are cold and rainy, but I'll beat all of you guys outta there.   And now, my schedule. I'll do another post-thingy to let you know what changed, because I'm nice like that. Here ya go-- first tri. flex (that will be changin') economics-patrick government-damrau pre cal.-black french 2- hanley (again, that will change as well)  second tri. office aide anatomy and physiology-mashe english 4 AP- pearce pre cal.- bourg flex  third tri. pathophysiology-mashe french 2- hanley (that'll be gone) english 4 AP- pearce medical microbiology- mashe  There ya go, folks. My year. My LAST  year. I am one happy camper.  Love ya, R
