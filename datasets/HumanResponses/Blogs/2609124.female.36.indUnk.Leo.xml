        I just found some photographs of some time ago... 2 years ago or something - I am extremely bad at doing the whole photo album and scrapbooking thing - and I got this knot on my throat.  Darn, have I let myself go to waste.  I am obese and old now... in a mere 2 years...  I blame it on the medication and stupid birth control pills (treatment for ovarian cysts), but that's not the cause... sure, I gained a lack of sleep (I was only able to sleep for like 3 hrs per night, and not all in one go) and as a result I would go watch late night TV and eat, but I also have not done anything to try to at least maintain my weight in order.  I completely stopped going to the gym, perhaps because the gym was 45 minutes away but mainly because I am not a gym person.  I am an outdoors gal.  Give me soccer games on rainy days, kicks to my knees, scraped elbows, and a slammed ball to my chest.  But still, even though I enjoy that so much, I have not pressed my husband to do something like that with me.  I just simply remain at home, eating, eating, eating.  Energy levels are at an all-time low.  I stopped taking the medication (the lack of sleep was driving me crazy and angry) and I have pain from time-to-time but heck, I rather sleep and not have to go vomit every night.  So I sleep more now, the problem is... I sleep too much and I still feel like it is not enough.  I go to bed at 10:30pm maybe slightly later if there is something good on TV, and then by 7:30am I still can't get up.  So even if I go to bed at midnight I still get more than 7 hrs but that is not cutting it.  Aren't adults supposed to be fine with at least 6 hours of sleep?  Only children need 8 or more hours!  Last weekend, Saturday night, I went to bed at 10:09pm and woke up Sunday at 2:00.... PM!  16 Frickin' Hours!  And I was still groggy.  So now I am a Fat, Lazy woman.  What's next?  Fat, Lazy, and Psychotic?  Hmmm... maybe.  Now someone tell me...  How do I troubleshoot that?!

        Special days like today's deserve a little special food.  And so I went out to eat with my husband and ordered a nice plate of shrimp, crab, and lobster while he got the yummy platter of fried seafoods.  Of course we ordered appetizers and refreshments.  It all came out to a flat 50 with the tip included - not bad.  Of course, we couldn't help but comment how much more less it would have been at our countries, but that was just table talk.  If we really think about it, for us to go to our countries to eat seafood would cost at least 3,000 each (well, that's to eat at my place... at his, the 3,000 covers only the one-way ticket). So we chatted, debated, and enjoyed our overly priced food (and rightfully priced as such!).  We filled to our tummies' content.   ^_^  and all was good.  Oh by the way - Beware of the  Swen ... It may be out to get you...  I'll comment my experiences with it tomorrow.

       Yep, it happens to everyone.  I had my blog in working order (and it is still on cyberspace) but I cannot edit it.  Remember boys and girls, do not click around impatiently or you may corrupt your template.   Bummer .  Well, now I have a new name. ^_^  so now testing... testing... again

        The day started pretty well.  I got a surprise call from a friend ( :X :X :X :X :X  ).  He had said he'd call last night once he got home but I waited and waited AND waited ALLLL night long but no call (hehe. Just messing with ya. ^_~  I went to bed at midnight as always).  So I figured something came up and such.  Well, whoa surprise! He gives me a call in the morning in my cel. ^_^  SP (I wouldn't want anyone reading this to suddenly be stalking him!) and I have known each other for over 2 years now, but only online (yes, I am a big geek.  Call me a Webbie) and it feels great to finally add the voice (and a very nice voice at that) to the face and mind.  * sigh * But days that start happy don't always finish happy happy.  Another one of my friends who was quite excited about recent news had a miscarriage.  Never having been pregnant myself (and since even the slightest scare about it drives chills down my spine) I cannot know how she possibly feels. However, I do know that she is a young, smart lady and that the next time, she will not be just 'nicely surprised' and that she will plan from day one so that she is extremely healthy and ready, for the coming of the new life.  Keep strong my friend, things happen for a reason and although these were unfortunate news, you and your husband's strength at this time will be rewarded more than double in the future.

        The guilt feeling?  I know, I know, there are just so many different guilty feelings.  Well here goes: One of my friends was going through some rough moments; everyday things as they appear to me, but since I am not the one living them I am not overly stressed about it, of course.  Well, in the couple of years that we've talked to each other I know he has a quick temper.  He gets stressed, he begins to cuss and get angry, and most of the time (as it happens to many of us) he lets it all out on whoever he is talking to - lately it has been me.  * shrugs *  But things go by quickly.  He gets serious, I get serious. He gets upset, I keep on being my unattached self (heck, he's my friend, I shouldn't get tremendously pissed at him, right?).  He begins to cuss and threatening to leave our conversation, I tell him to go ahead and good night.  One or two days later, things are back to normal; the happy happy people that we are.  But then... he or I say something that we would generally consider a stupid, non-funny joke (but a joke nonetheless) and the skies turn dark and the machines overload and there we are… tense at each other once more.  It used to happen once in a blue moon... but now it is every single time we get on line and talk to one another. >_  Why do I feel guilty even though he is the one to start the fault? ( It is hardly ever my fault.  I am just so great. Riiight. )  I guess... it's just... that he is a friend.  And perhaps I should be a little more lenient with friends, a little more sensitive even.  That, plus I get the feeling that he may not be coming online to at least talk because he may still be upset at anything. Of course it could be that he simply has not had the time but...    It makes one wonder...

           1 lb of shrimp (with or without tails, that's up to you)  2 cans of tomato sauce (8 oz each)  4-5 cups of water  1/2 onion, chopped  1 carrot (or 2 :D) sliced  2 medium potatoes chopped into cubes  2 tablespoons of oregano (separated, 1 tbsp, 1 tbsp)  1 tablespoon of garlic powder  1 tablespoon of olive oil  *Chipotle sauce (optional, but if you use it it will really give it a nice kick)  No salt necessary, but if you like it, go ahead.    *You find Chipotle sauce in the foreign food section of your supermarket.  I use  Del Monte . FYI: Generally, Chipotle sauce (blended chipotle) is less hot than whole Chipotle chile 'in' sauce.       Heat the olive oil. While the oil is getting ready, wash the shrimp.  Throw one small bit of onion into the oil. Just one. If the onion sizzels then it means the oil is hot enough to cook the onion. Put all the onion in, careful not to splash (or you may burn yourself).  Cook onion until it is glazed (becomes transparent) but not brownish.  If it starts to get brownish from the edges (burnt), lower the heat and make sure you move around the onion with a cooking spoon.  When onion is ready, add in the 2 cans of tomato sauce followed by 4-5 cups of water.  Add the chipotle chili (this one is hot, so make sure you can handle it), if you feel it may need more you can ad it in later, you do’t want to throw in a can of hot sauce because then it may end up being too hot to taste.  Stir the tomato sauce, water and chile and then sprinkle 1 tablespoon of oregano and the 1 tablespoon of garlic powder over the broth.  Cover the pot and let it simmer.  Once the broth begins to boil throw in the shrimp. Cover once more and let it begin to boil.  Check on it from time to time while you chop the potatoes and carrots.  You may add more water if you feel the soup is getting too thick, but that depends on how you like your soups – thick or watery. ^_~  Again, when the soup begins to boil, add in the carrots and five minutes later add the potatoes.  Sprinkle the last remaining oregano over the soup.  You can taste the soup and if it is not spicy enough you can add more chipotle.  The soup will be ready when you are able to easily split a piece of potato with the spoon.  Turn off the burners and let it cool down slightly.    Serve warm with a side of Spanish rice (or white, whichever) and a slice of bread.    Mmmmmm-mmmmm!

        Went bowling Saturday with my hubby and invited my parents.  We got beat both times but it's alright.  hehe. However, I made the highest score ever!  I made a nice 122, which is not bad at all for me.    Went shopping for the usual stuff and ate pizza afterwards.  Oklahoma State Vs erm... some school. Oklahoma won and that was my husband's college so he was, well... happy about it. ^_~  Today has been lazy as usual.  We did some laundry, watched TV, and took a nice 3 hour nap.  Made some shrimp soup and that's what we just had for dinner. Yum yum.  Recipe tomorrow!

        My dog (the one at my parents') was getting out of the property and going to the neighbor's yard to steal goose eggs.  In one of those, my sister picked up from her one of these eggs and after checking it for a while against the light (these things are HUGE! Like 2 tennis balls put together) she noticed a little dark circle inside.  She browsed the net and researched on the development cycle of the geese and decided to give a try at hatching the egg.  This was about 5 weeks ago.  Yesterday morning she gave my mom and I a call and said that the egg was cracking and that something that looked like a little foot was beginning to stick out.  We were pretty excited  but she said that it was early.  Apparently a goose egg needs 6 weeks to hatch... So we thought that perhaps the mother goose had been hatching the egg for 1 or 2 weeks before our dog stole it.  Well we were all happy and my sis went out to buy some chicken food (goose, chicken... What's the difference right?) and said she'd be close by just in case the thingy needed help getting out.  Later at night, around 8 pm, she gave me a call because she couldn't find mom.  I noticed a little accent in her tone.  She said that while she was doing stuff around the house she heard a crack in the kitchen.  She ran inside because she thought it was about time and the goose was trying to get out, but she was met by this ugly, rotten smell!  She checked the egg and noticed a long crack and something whitish coming out from it.  She wasn't sure if that was normal or not... Babies come out all dirty so... maybe birds do too.  Well, since it was already cracked she tried to open it up a bit and more liquid (this time grayish yellow) came out.  She said it smelled really bad and that she saw a little red something in it.  After fully opening the egg she could see the goose, but it just wasn't complete.  She seemed sad and asked if perhaps she should have left it crack alone. That maybe she had killed it when she opened it... :(    I told her not to worry. That her baby had probably died a while back.  It is like those dogs one finds along the road after a couple of days of being hit - they get bloated with gases.  So probably the goose had died a while back and the shell could no longer contain the fumes that had formed in there.  She ended up agreeing with me, but still was sad about it since she had spent so much time taking care of it.  She bought the lamp; measured the temperature; turned it as the notes online said; even had a calendar of what the goose was supposed to look like each day... I wonder what went wrong.  * sigh *  She was so excited about it... but it just wasn't meant to be.

        Some clients just do not appreciate the work that I do.  If they have a problem with my work then perhaps they should stop asking me to help them out.  One of these clients claims that "Nobody down here knows how to type! Not even you."   Excuse me?     A while back I typed some document for him and yes, although I proofread, sometimes I miss things - that is why I ask all of my clients to read and reread and reread their work before getting stuff printed.  Well, this was one letter and he made one measly copy of it (and it wasn't like a 50-page report either, it was about 2 pages only... he just doesn't know how to use a computer).  Well, he sat down with me, read it and said "okay make me a copy."    I did not make any typos, except that I wrote down something for other.  A swap of letters.  Well, I do not claim to be the best typer in the world... nor am I great at spelling or grammar, but that's why a client is responsible for checking their things.  If they find anything amiss, I gladly change it. No problemo - my mistake.  Well, we are talking 20 cents for the fricken copy and then my typing time (made him a favor and did not charge him a full hour even though he kept me busy for almost a whole one because the man isn't even capable of scrolling a page), so it was a total of like $3.20 (I should have charged 12.20, how nice am I?).  The next day he came back and told me about the swapped letters. No problem, I pulled out the saved document and made him another print - no charge (20 cents, no biggie right?).  Well... it has been about 2 months since that incident and he had never brought it up until today.  I was like.. WTF!  Well here comes the why:   I made a small site for him. Nothing big, he went for the basics because he did not want to pay much.  That was my mistake... I should not come to compromises with anyone regarding my work.  If they can't pay then I should not give them my time.  But * sighs * business is starting and we aren't doing that great so I said... why not?  A few extra bucks are better than none at all. His site had been up and operational since last December.  He is usually out of town and he had come on the 24 near closing time and asked me to please, please hurry and put 'something' because he wanted to have his site up and running that same day.  So I spoiled my Xmas working on his project.  It is March now... the End of March now so free updates have pretty much expired - I give 1 to 3 months of updates on pages depending on what type of site I make; his qualified for a month.  A week ago he walked into the store and asked me if I could give him a few minutes to make some changes to his site.  I said I could not on that day because I was very, very busy, but if he came another day (preferably scheduled) that it would be no problem.  He said it was nothing big just wanted to give me what to do, etc.  Apparently he needed it done 'pronto.'  I said, "Alright, but it still cannot be done today.  But whenever we do sit down to talk about it then I can go ahead and take down all information and pass you the bill.  Or you can just write it down and I will get to it as soon as I finish what I am doing at the moment."  Well, he got stuck on the word 'bill.'  Asked how much it would be and I simply said $75.  His eyes popped out.  "$75 dollars?!  It is just a little change!"  "Well, yes. That is my monthly fee for updates on existing pages."  "But I just need you to take stuff out and add some small paragraphs.  $75 dollars for that?!"  "It is a monthly fee, not a fee per change."  "it's too much."  "I do not think you appreciate what I am doing here, Sir.  I spent 6 years in schools for this."  That's right... Bachelors and a Master degree.  This guy is a truck driver, he gets paid $1000 a month for just sitting on his butt driving the thing.  I know this because he told me.  And he's crying for $75 a month?!  That's about 2.50 a day! HELLOOOOO!  "No, no. forget it. Leave things as they are." and he left.    That was then. Today he walks in at around noon and asks if I could give him a few minutes at around 3:30 - he needed to talk about the site.  I said, "3:30, sure.  I should be done with this machine by then."  I was troubleshooting a machine at the time.  He did not show until 5:54... We close at 6 p.m.  So I took my notebook and stepped out to check his site and take notes on changes.  He said he needed some changes, minor ones, and that if I could give him credit and he'd pay me later because he couldn't pay right now for the change. "No problem.  Like I explained last week, this fee is monthly."  "Oh, you are going to charge me every month?"  "No, just when you need it.  If you don't make any changes in three months then no problem."  "Ohhh! Okay then."  so he gave me all changes, etc., etc. and then asked, "Can I trust that you will make this changes correctly?"  Hmmm... what?  I looked down at my notebook and began to read my notes to him, while scrolled through pages to pinpoint where those changes were to occur.    "No, no. I mean, can I trust that you won't make mistakes?"  "Well I will do what you told me.  If it is not written here then I will not do it.  Make sure you give me everything you need done."  "Well, I am saying because last time you did that typo on that letter, remember?"  "Oh. Ohhhh! Okay, yes I remember.  Well, I always do ask that you proof read everything."   "But I am leaving today so I won't be able to do it."  heh... last time he didn't do it either and he wasn't leaving town just yet.  "Nobody down here knows how to type! Not even you."  O_o  I  laughed , "Everyone makes mistakes."  "Well yes you are right.  I guess you are one of the best down here but you aren't perfect."  That's right. I am not... I've never claimed to be; therefore my policy, which I give to all my clients before they ask me to do anything for them.  We are not responsible for misprints.  We make proofs before printing or going on the web.  A client is responsible for checking them. If they approve it, we run it.  That time with the letter, he pinpointed the typo and I corrected it.  Like I said, we had not run like 200 copies of it, we only made 1... which was replaced with the corrected one immediately.  "Are you going to work on this right now?"    I looked at the system clock - 6:13 p.m.  "Not likely.  I need to backup computers and close the store."  Perhaps if he had actually shown up to the appointment at THREE-THIRTY as we had agreed I would have been nice enough to do as much as possible during the remainder of the day... but he did not.  Plus my dad does the accounting for the day as soon as he gets there (generally at 5:30) and he uses my office for that.  "This weekend then?"  "I do not come on the weekends." I was going to say unless I have something unfinished... but he would have said his stuff was unfinished. But there is no way I would go to the office just to work on his site.  He isn't even paying me right now plus I have other sites... projects that have scheduled before his.  "I will do it as soon as I finish other things in my schedule."  "When then?"  "Don't worry. It will be done next week."  "But when?  Monday?" his tone was getting loud.  Geessssh.  "As soon as I can get to it, but won't go over next week."    "Make it quick. I sent several letters out the other day and they will be arriving soon so I don't want people to see the site info as it is now."  Well hello! Maybe he should have given me the notes  Before  he sent out those letters.  "Now remember, I have priority here. I was your first client!"  I was upset now. "Um... no you were not."  "Yes I was."  "No. You were not.  I have had clients with me for years already.  Your changes will be done when I can squeeze them in." Even if he had been my first client, right now he is not my Only client.  Others have given me work to do on their sites before this so this one has to wait its turn.  "Oh, okay."  I guess he finally got the fact that the world does not revolve around him and that I am not just sitting, waiting to see what gets stuck up his butt.  He got up, got some packages he had waiting for him and left.  ...I am not talking to him about projects unless he makes appointments and keeps them.

        Didn't go out. Browsed the web, chatted, posted under some threads... Found my phone and noticed that i had several missed calls and about 4 voice messages -  Ooops .  Several of our friends were having a barbecue at their parents' and wanted us to go over to share some cabrito (goat). That was for Saturday...  oops again .  Since we spent the entire day out on Saturday, the husband told me to leave the purse inside the car, under the seat so no calls for me that day.  I felt really bad... I hope our friends don't think we just didn't want to return their calls.  I did give them a call as soon as I heard the messages... but still can't help but feel guilty.   We mostly finished 'cleaning' the house and then watched a couple of movie rentals, Body Count (so-so) and Hard Rain (pretty good! Kept me into it the whole hours).  My parents stopped by and gave the hubby a set of drums.  Woo-hoo neighbor complaints here they come!  My dad taught me some basics to reading guitar music while my hubby set up the drums and played around with them a bit.   Overall it was a lazy Sunday, as it usually is.  We made kitchuri (a combination of rice and lentils) which resulted in my burning of the left hand.  Silly me, I should have known to pull out the oven rack before sticking my hand in to take out the pot. Now I have my wrist and the area where the thumb joins the hand all burnt and puffy.   * sigh * I miss my Mutt.  My pretty, wonderful, young, little one.   He is a teen friend from New Zealand whom I just love dearly.  I don't plan on having children of my own, but if the hubby ever convinces me, I sure would hope they turned out to be like this little boy.  We were so close for over a year... and then I started doing volunteer work at a local elementary and our times just wouldn't be coordinated anymore.  I was not able to talk to him as much as I would and now that I have my new job with my mom, which allows me to be online for the entire day, he just... doesn't say hi anymore.     I have talked to him in occassions but it just isn't the same anymore.  The talks just seem to be dry and then they hang to the point that he just leaves without even saying goodbye, something he just would never do before.  There was never enough rushing going on in his or my end.  There was always just enough time for him to say, 'I love you, Aunty.'  I guess there is no more time now.

        Woke up rather early for a Saturday - 6 am.  It probably had to do with the fact that I kept waking up in the middle of the night to puke because of what I ate Friday night. I just had waaay too much pop corn and then the food at the restaurant was a little heavy for 10:30 at night - Shrimp kaboob, grilled salmon, and spicy crab cakes with cole slaw, etc, etc.   Yes, it was the over eating... we've agreed that the  urlLink test  came out Negative (although, I am still waiting for final proof *crosses fingers*).      My hubby can't keep asleep unless I am next to him so he followed me to the living room and setup the dial up on the laptop (he'd reformatted and re-installed everything while I was reading the previous night) and I started checking posts at my favorite  urlLink group .  Not much had been going on so I started doing the laundry while hubby vacuumed.  Then I washed some dishes that had been in the sink since last monday (nothing ecky, just glasses and plates with cake crumbs... we don't do much cooking in this house) while hubby mopped.  ^_^ We have a nice system.  He does one thing, I do another.  Then we both sit down and watch TV.  We feel hungry we both get up - one does the chopping while the other cooks - neat neat neat.   I started getting ready at about noon and then we drove to Harlingen (city about 30 mins away) to have some breakfast at the Jerusalem Cafe.  Had ourselves a couple of Gyros baskets... not really Israeli food (I think it's Greek), but good nonetheless; they are thin pita bread with lamb slices and vegetables on them that you can roll up to a nice thick burrito ^_^.    Then we went to play some pool and a couple of games of bowling.  Hubby whooped my butt. *Mumble-mumble* darn cricket players and their accuracy.  By this time it was close to 5 pm and we made our way to my mom and dad's home to feed the pup.  They went out for the weekend so when they do that we are left with the task of feeding our dog. Yes Our doggie.  We got her from the pound several months back but since we moved to our new home (and still can't afford a fence) we can't keep her - strict leash laws.... heh... So anyway, we walked and played a little and came across this neighbor's lamb. Funny lamb.  It was tied up and when we would pass by the area the lamb would start  baaa-ah-ah-ahhhh ing. My husband and Leche (her name is spanish for milk) would get close to the fence and the lamb would run away.  Then they would turn their backs and the lamb would come back and be all tough, then they would turn to see it again and the lamb would run and hide once more. hehehe. They did this for about 8 rounds.  I was like... Don't temp the hubby little lamb... we just had one of your friends for breakfast. HAHAHAH   Ahhhh. Okay.  Then shopping for the week's food (HAHAHAHAHAHAHA As IF we'll be cooking!).  That's right, we got our bottle of grapefruit, bag of chips, 6 bottles of mineral water (we eat out so much that trust me, you want to have that and some anti-acid always handy) and um... shampoo.  Then drove out to find a beauty salon - we badly needed haircuts.  Husband changed his look and I got an appointment for Tuesday.  Then we went back to shopping.     Got him a nice little electric guitar with it's amp.  I expect no more complains about the price of my lipsticks for a while. heh heh heh. ^_~

        Yes.  Friday went alright. Work slow, did nothing but bum around browsing sites and chatting to online buddies.  I should have been working on a project but... I just didn't feel like it.   The hubby took me to the movies and we watched Master and Commander.  Kinda late, eh?  Well you see, we rate our movies the following way:     I'll defenitely pay 10 bucks to see that one on premier night!  Yeah, it will be worth 6 bucks for the matinee show!  I can't wait for it to get to the dollar movies!  We can wait for it to come out on pay-per view  Hmmm, I'll rent it some day.  Maybe when it's on the regular movie channel  I'll probably change the channel when it gets to public TV    Master and Commander fell under the #3 category.  Those are the movies that we feel are going to be entertaining but not to the point that we will spend 20 bucks to see it, nor 12 bucks for the matinee show at the 'new' theater.  So we wait for it to come out at the dollar movies ($1.50 all day and $2.00 weekend nights).  Most movies are at the expensive theater (the one inside the mall) for about 1 or 2 weeks and then they are sent to the dollar movies.  The more popular ones (ex., LOTR, Matrix, Harry Potter, etc etc) can stay at the big movies for up to 6 months sometimes, so we just wait and watch all others that Do make it there after a week ^_^.   Alright, so then we made our way to have some dinner at Benningams (the movie wasn't too great... got a little slow in the middle for my taste, but 3 bucks well spent.) and paid for overpriced food that was excused dut to the nice environment - live band made it kinda difficult to hear what we were saying but, hey, it's cool.   Got home... mhmhmhmmhmmmmm read a little, watched TV and that's that.

        I haven't been feeling all that well.  Started early this week.  I've been getting nausea and I don't really feel like eating much.  Sounds like a pregnancy, but it would be rather weird if it truly was one.  Anyway, I waited for a couple of days - nearing my 'days' - but nothing so I finally decided to just start by buying a home pregnancy test.   The test says you need two lines to assume a woman is pregnant, and this is visible after 1 minute of performing the test.  Non pregnant is 1 line and this is accurate (99.9%) after 3 minutes.  Dang, I gotta tell you... I cried!  After waiting for like half a minute I looked at the test's windows and they were like pinkish, both of them.  I felt tears just about to burst, and not from happiness.   Don't get me wrong, children are wonderful and I have a nice marriage and comfortable life but I am just not ready.  I've never really seen myself as mom material... may explain more about this some other time, maybe someone will help me troubleshoot that. Anyway,  I know what some of you are thinking 'Why didn't you take precautions?'  Well we do.  We are careful and clean too.  But things are never 100% sure.   Soooooo... 3 mins after, 1 line and another pinkish square.  The husband and I checked and rechecked - I should add he was all excited, although we are not planning for kids for a while... must be every man's dream or something, to pass on the genes.  Seems like the pinkish is normal on the windows, so just one line. *crosses fingers*     I will just wait for the monthly and then I'll schedule my regular appt with a doc (a new one since we've moved and my Women's Clinic is too far now) to make sure.

        Well, I am officially a housewife again... oops, I mean 'homemaker' (is that the politically correct version for maid?)  I get to continue working on my projects since I really only need a compy and a net connection for that, so it's good.  But I also get to take on the trivial jobs of the house.  I guess I have to manage after all I won't be making any real money, unlike hubby.  Hmmm, I may have less stress than he since now I can actually get up at 9 and work in my undies if I like... plus I won't have to deal with all sort of wandering people either.  So as long as I have stuff to do I won't get all depressed as I did my first year of staying at home.  I will cross my fingers.

        I told my hubby about the several dreams - there have been like 4 in these 2 weeks, all with friends (boys or girls) and my husband too.     Mi vida?    Hm?    I've been having weird dreams     What dreams?    You know  those  type of dreams...    You are dreaming with other guys!    and girls and you too... why do you think I'm having those?    You dream that because you are a Bad Baby. Now just come to bed.   Well as if I didn't know that already!  I guess I should be happy he took it so well... or maybe he was just too sleepy.   Hey, has this ever happened to any of you?    I have a friend and I dreamt with her a few weeks back - nothing steamy, thank goodness!  Just us sitting on the couch talking about things past.    Next day she exchanged a few words with me.  Yeyness!  It had been such a long time since I had spoken to her too.  ^_^   I think I was sending her mental waves or something while sleeping.  She called again today. yey!  ^_^ I think I know which book I am going to read next (or at least the subject of such book).  Later I may put up the dream I had last night... nah better not. It was boring... I was just sitting in front of my desk pushing around papers.  So frustrating!  I'd wake up and then go back to sleep and I would return to pushing around papers.    O_o Oh, I guess I already told the dream.  That was it... >_

        So why such a freak, I am?  (I think I better practice more of my Yoda...)   Had another one of those nights but not with 'Johnny' this time, but rather a friend who shall remain anonymous just so I do not get anyone in any trouble,  especially myself .  It was simply raw, rough, steamy material.  The sort you'd find at your 3 a.m. hotel ppv channel.  How do I know this?  C'mon, I've been an adult for a rather long time... and everyone's got to see one of those at least once in life.  I guess our way of saying, "I ain't doing it wrong after all."  I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling for a while, the blinking of computer lights drawing a nice greenish shine into it.  I realized that I had lost track of time.  My eyes had been tired and although sleepy, I had not wanted to wake up my hubby by getting into bed, so I simply decided to take a nap on the futon.  I remember thinking about what I had to do for one of my projects and then... there I was, screaming and squirming with glee.  There was no point, no introductory play of events, simply images, clips.  And it was me... I know myself.  Now, the fact that I was with my friend does not bother me much.  I find him cute... heh... actually he's rather sexy.  I just like to talk or surround myself with this sort of people... the type I just want to pound upon and force into submission while they whisper my name with that manly voice of theirs... or the wickedly flirtatious gal that I just want to coo and please until they lose themselves in my ministrations.  Dream or not, that is what I seek.  And that is what I find.  But...  why?    I live a normal life.  Normal to everyday standards - I study, I work, I make money, I waste money, I am of my home, I am of my husband... I laugh, I cry, I eat, I sleep, I bathe... and the more mundane parts of the day.    I do not feel overly disillusioned.  Marriage is good, normal.  We are better halves and understand one another for the most part.  Arguments are good too.  The stubborn kind in which we glare at one another only to end up cracking up about it minutes later.  Life is good...  so then...  why?     What is wrong with my putrid mind?

        I must be.  Or maybe I am just the typical woman with subconcious wants and frequent irrational dreams of which one blushes and squirms in the morning.  But what if it isn't typical, however?  Several days ago:   I was backstage, the pounding music and flashing of lights driving the entire crowd crazy as our 'heroes' continued to make what for us will be an impossible of times with no end.  I was pacing about, waiting for them to finish their number... not really sure why.  Finally, everything was over and we headed to the locker area of the arena to 'chill' and party.  Everyone was now nice and clean from the sweat of his or her activities and things were alright.  But not for me.  I was upset for some reason and so I left the room, laughs and indecipherable chatting going on incessantly behind me.  Gaw I was upset.  And the more laugh I heard, the worse it got.  Then it hit me... I needed a little attention for me.  So at the top of the stairs I did what seemed most reasonable at the time.  I gave a few steps down, skipped them actually, and then I shouted.  It was a short, high-pitched scream.  I was sure that it would not be heard with all the clamor going on inside the party room, or that it may just be mistaken for some other laughter.  Oh but surprise, someone did hear.  John C came from the end of the hall, apparently he wasn't inside the other room, may have gone out to... erm... for whatever reason, he didn't explain.  Well, I was at the bottom step, sitting all distressed and rubbing my ankle (left, right... it doesn't matter now, I just was).    "Yo girl," he punched my arm jokingly. It wasn't at all harsh according to him but sometimes men just cannot measure much about their strength.  I leaned to the left, pushed by his 'playfulness.'  It did not hurt, not at all, but I did feel it.  I frowned and began to move slightly so that he could either walk by or sit next to me... I was aiming at the latter.  He did none, instead he took my hand and yanked me to my feet before picking me up in his arms.  He was not wearing a shirt and as I placed my hand on his chest to steady myself (no... really) I was quite amazed that his skin was actually pretty soft over all that muscle.  Smooth too... he probably doesn't shave.  I bet he went under the laser.  I've gone through the procedure and after the first week skin is super soft, too bad it's so expensive...  John C kept walking away from the stair, the noise. He had this muck grin on his face and I asked what he found so very amusing.  I had just 'fallen' at the stairs.  "Sure you did. That's why I am going to have a look at it." and he turned his body around (still carrying me) and used his back to open up a door, somewhat careful not to knock me around the door frame.  I was then set on a table.  My hands moved to the hem of my dress.  I wore one of my favorite dresses, which unfortunately I have not used in a very long time... but for this event it seemed that I was.  It is a sweet baby blue color with tiny flower patterns, princess cut with neck and decent cleavage, nothing that shows anything at all... a typical V-neck with folds.  It is somewhat short; however.  It is 4 inches or so from the knee and when I sit it goes up to about 7.  So I fumbled a little and tucked it in the best I could under my legs so that it wouldn't ride up too much.  I do that every time I sit.  Most girls do.  No use.  His movement was deft and soon his mouth was pressed against mine.  It was quick, eager and soon we were engrossed on ourselves.  I do not know when or how, but my dress was untied and next thing I knew I was on my lacey undergarments while his hand rubbed my neck and moved to caress between my breasts...   So strange.  I was not the least excited.  Perplexed at such a thing yes, especially since I do not find him all that attractive, somewhat funny yes since he has quick wit.  *sigh* I was just watching all this unfold and is as if I had been sitting saying "oh whoopee do dah...  Next please ..."

        Ahhh Saturday made me tired.  We had a meeting with one of the clients to touch up on remaining areas of the project.  Hubby and I left home at around 4 am and arrived at 9am.  We took a quick nap at my sister's before heading out to the meeting.  It went well. We finished at around 5 pm, so it was a very long meeting, but we covered good ground.  So far he likes how the project is going and we just need to tighten up some stuff.  Good.  We returned to my sister's and helped her set up a computer that we took for her. HP 1.8GHz P4, 80GB, 512 MB, a small version of my multimedia station... actually that one used to be my station.  It was about time too, hers was a Compaq 500MHz 256MB (or was it 128?  I gotta check).  Anyway, although I upgraded the Compaq many times (I always end up putting more stuff into my machines) it was time to get her another one.  She generally gets my used computers, but that's not a bad thing.  I keep my things in top-notch condition with more stuff than they originally came with.  We got her hooked up to the net in a few minutes and set up her extra drives and camera and then we left.  We'll go back to her town next week with a wireless card for her laptop and then finish up her network.  I love the drop of prices on wireless stuff... when we first set up the network at my mom's it cost us a little over 100 for the router and then 60-some for the cards. Right now you get station and cards for about 60-75 bucks all.  Not bad.  Well anyway, we made it back home at around midnight and dropped on bed.  I didn't get up until 11 am today.  Husband's been watching the NFL drafts and I've been browsing the net.     That reminds me, I gotta check for RAM and a HD...

        It has been such a hectic week.  Mom's closing the store so I've had to terminate contracts, write letters, pack equipment, move furniture, so on and so forth.  Most of the things we would like to get rid of because they are simply too big to store in any of our houses.  While I can have 4 computers in my house, 10 is just a tat too much. Not to mention I'd also have to bring the desks, shelves, display cases, etc, etc.  So we placed a couple of ads in the newspaper and some people have come to check out the stuff.  Mostly people from businesses wanting to get more equipment at a liquidation price, which is fine with me as long as they don't expect me to just give stuff away especially since all our stuff is in very good condition (my mother is a cleanliness true believer) and fairly 'new.'    So far we have been selling to people that just walk in to get a regular service and then find out that we are selling the stuff.  For a business a couple of hundreds may seem to high to pay for a piece of office furniture, but for a regular person it's a sweet deal - I just sold our lunchroom wood table with 4 chairs for 50 bucks... The thing is dark wood and weights at least 20 lbs a chair! None of that economy store stuff.  Highlight of the day - I had an exchange of heated words with some guy in the back alley.  I took my mom out to eat and when we were turning to park in our area (behind the store there is a one-way alley to our parking) this guy had his big truck parked right on the street opposing traffic.  So we were 'going' and he seemed to be 'coming.'  So I stopped my car and we waited nose to nose with his truck.  He had our parking behind him (we have room for a bout 3 or 4 cars in there) and we had... The street with all incoming traffic behind us.  The guy takes his sweet time and then gets in the truck and turn on the engine.  We look at each other and he raises his arms as if saying 'now what?'.  I make signs telling him to back up.  He shakes his head vigorously and signals me to back up.  Here I am, looking behind at all the coming cars (weren't really on the main street, but perpendicular to it; T style) and decide that it is simpler for him to back up because he has no cars behind him and all the parking space just to scoot over so I can pass to My parking area.    So we keep up signaling each other to move back and my mother gets down to tell him.  He said something and she comes back telling me to just back up and I asked why?  Was he towing something that was not allowing him to move back on this somewhat narrow road?  He kept up making sign and telling me to move and I get down.   "Sir, that's my parking area. We work here."    "It's not important if you work here or not.  Move back so I can get out."      "It doesn't cost you Anything to move back."    "It doesn't cost you anything either."    "Well I am not going to.  You have no cars behind you and I have a the entire flow of 10 street!  MOVE BACK.  THIS IS MY PLACE, I PAY THE CITY FOR THIS ALLEY"    "I PAY TOO!"    "WELL I DON'T CARE. YOU MOVE NOW OR I CALL THE POLICE.  YOU ARE GOING ON THE OPPOSITE WAY AND YOU KNOW IT SO JUST MOVE BACK."    "Fine, I'll do you THE FAVOR-"    "You are doing No Favor to me because you are WRONG and you know it.  SO MOVE. ANDELE!" I snapped my fingers because by this time I was already super pissed. Then I turned and got in my car and waited for the guy to back away.  I parked and he went.   Pfft!  As if I was going to back away because he just felt like driving on the opposite direction of incoming traffic, park to check his frickn' tires and then expect me to wait for him and move back into the coming car so that he could just waltz to the main road.      As IF!

        I am not actually going to post here what I dreamt ( if you really want to know, contact me and I'll decide ).  It had to do with my husband going out with 2 exclassmates of mine (from different schools), then my husband and I talking about the meeting, and finally my going out for coffee with those same exclassmates.  Very strange.  Hmm, maybe I should just start a Dream log.  Hmmm.   Anyway, I got to wake up late this Friday because my husband had the day off. We got up and went to the store after 1 pm and were only there for a few hours.  Mainly we wanted to see if my sister would want to go to the movies with us for the release of The Alamo.  She did not for work related reasons.  So we left and caught the early show at 3:50 p.m.  Alright movie with a lot of history and various anecdotes.  Not for kids simply because they may find it boring.  I doubt young ones may care much about the history of Texas.  What my husband and I enjoyed most was the debate that occurred after we left the theater. We both had our different opinions on why things happened the way they did and most importantly what Would happen if Texas decided to get it's independence from the U.S.A.    I happen to be a Texan supporter while he remains a USA follower.  heh...

        Today I drove to work again and after closing, the hubby stopped by, talked with my mom while I closed, and then we each both got in our cars and drove back home. I had parked in the back so I had to go around a block and at the intersection I saw my husband in his car.  He had a green and I a red, so as he crossed he grinned and mocked me that I had to wait.  I poked my tongue out at him.  About 15 mins later I arrived home and he was waiting with his car on the side so that I would park my car first.  I drove inside while my husband parked behind.  I was singing along my Palominos CD and by the time I got out, husband was already waiting for me on the driveway.     Husband: You look so beautiful driving your big car.   I: eh?   Husband: Women look so beautiful driving.   I: ~_~ *gee... spoil the good comment by throwing other women into the mix. heh!*   Husband: But you are the most beautiful of all women.   I: You are lucky. *I joked*   Husband: Yes, yes I am.   Then inside the house we turned on the TV and started watching a little wrestling and he said if I wanted to eat some tuna.  He doesn't make it like me (I just add a dab of mayo and eat it raw).  He adds spices and onion and veggies and you name it... just mouth watering.  Well after I finished chopping veggies (because he insists that I do the chopping since I am the best vegetable chopper that he has ever seen) he began to do all the cooking.  I started drying dishes.   Husband: I can cook like this all the time.  I'll just buy canned meats and prepare them. Easier and it will last longer, unlike what we have in the fridge.  You just cut up onions and stuff and I can do all the cooking everyday.   I: Okay.  *That's usually what we do anyway...*   Husband:  As long as I am cooking for you, I really enjoy it.   I: *I smile while continuing to wash and dry dishes*   Husband: *gets closer and gives me a kiss on the cheek*   * giggles *

        So I woke up late today - 8:41 am. I figured I could sleep late since my doc's appointment wasn't until 10 am. I take my shower, dry my hair, put on my lotions and powders, get dressed, clean the kitty litter, feed Chiquita (my kitty), put on the make-up and make my way out to the car.  It was 9:53 am., the doc's office is about 5 mins away driving moderate to fast.  I turn on the car and... ~_~ Husband left me the one without gas. >_  Heh. But like I said... 5 minutes away - I could make it.  Passed several turtle-drivers and then hunted down for a place to park and made my way to his office. This is the first time I talk to this doctor; my mom liked him so she told me to give him a try. Generally I do not like to get checkups very often - I dislike the cold-meat treatment.  Yes, I know doctors are supposed to be unattached and not very friendly (wouldn't want to get a lawsuit from some lady that thinks he got a little Too friendly, right?) but C'mon!  Don't just poke me and then write stuff down without ever telling me what it is that you are doing!  I did not go to med school and while a lump here or there may be a very common thing in your line of work, it is Not For Me.  Tell me that it is nothing.  Tell me that you will push me here, probe me there.  Tell me that I should eat more vegetables... Tell me anything.  Well that said and done.  I was surprised that I was walked to the inside rooms as soon as I walked in.  The nurse was chatty and measured and weighed me. I have lost  7 pounds ! Woo-hoo Go Me!  Then took me to another room where she asked me standard questions - pregnancies, abortions, last ".", heart-lung-pressure-diabetic conditions, and why I was there.  She asked me to wait a moment and that the doctor would come right over. Okay so here I am thinking 'In this place they put you in quickly so that one doesn’t complain and THEN we do the waiting inside.  Nope, I was wrong, and gladly so.  The Dr. came in soon after and sat down to have a nice long talk with me.  Asked me things about my past medical history, any concerns I had, etc, etc.  It was nice.  Then he asked me to change into the paper thingies and stepped out.  No small paper shirts here... these were long, paper, but at least long.  I wore the ‘robe’, which went down to my knees and actually went all around my body.  Then I sat on the table and placed the other paper (like half a sheet) over my lap.  Several minutes later he knocked again and stepped in with the nurse.  Standard procedure, push and touch then probe and poke. ~_~  It hurt.  It always hurts.  He told me that it was best to check well rather than having to get to an operation room later. "Or don't you think, Renata?"  "Sure it is... but I gotta be honest. *wince* I didn't even want to come here in the first place."  "Haha.  Yes, I understand. *push-push*"  I screamed. Well, 'I yelped' was more like it.  It hurt!  But at least he was talking the whole time and explaining what he was doing and what he was finding.  So after all was done I get dressed and the nurse takes a blood sample.  She told me she should get results by tomorrow so I could call her around 3 pm.  Groovy, that's quick.  I got to the store at 12 noon.  Not bad.

        I was all by my lonesome today. Looooooong boring day, but I actually did quite a bit.  Finally troubleshooted that piece of code. ^_^  Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  After thinkering with the database and the code something got fixed  heh... yeah. that's how programmers fix problems.   And well, it seems like I am getting dragged to the doc tomorrow.  Mother had to make an appointment for me last week and everyone has been keeping tabs on the date, time, place, and everything. ~_~ Sheesh.  So I haven't had my monthly like in 7 weeks. Big Deal!  I remember once I actually went without it for 3 months, and several other times when I had it twice in the same month.  I am just like that.  But I guess... I might as well get the pressure, cholesterol, blood, and all those other tests done as well.   >_

        You are a normal angel. Innocent and pure. Full of light and hope. You love to be around others, and really know how to have a good time. You enjoy hanging around with mortals. You like ti sing, which you are great at, and like to have others near you. People are naturally attracted to your bubbly personaliy, and love to be around you. Normal angels are always popular, and have lots of fans. You are happy go lucky, with an interesting out look on the world.  Though you have experienced pain, that is all behind you now. You see the bright side to things, and are always there to help a person in need. You are quite pretty, with a childish air, though you know more than others think.  You are a really friendly person. But can be a tad selfish at times.  You are bright and full of energy.

        Spent most of today inside the office at mom's store.  I really wanted to keep moving with the project I am working on.  My husband went with me and we were both working on the site's code.  We were supposed to finish this site then end of March, but the client seems to be more interested in the e-commerce are of the site (which is not wrong, of course) than giving us the actual information that he wishes to have on the site.  So I send him templates and he tells me "Where's the text?"  Well... Perhaps if instead of having  me  make his calls to the banks and merchants he would make them himself I wouldn't spend 4 hrs a day on hold by the operators.  At some point I just stopped working on the project altogether.  He kept changing opinions on the site's content and asked my opinion on what type of marketing material he should use to promote the site.  Yes, I can recommend some things, but I am not going to be proofreading his letters.  I give him links of the service providers that I have been in contact with the past and that is all... It is not my fault if they do not offer what he has in mind. And just for kicks, I actually researched for a provider that offers just what he needs and did not find one yet.  I am not saying that there isn't one out there... Oh.. There IS.  But those are more likely custom made gateways and accounts for big companies like Toyota or WalMart, etc., etc., who pay thousands upon thousands to a complete team of programmers.  I do not think he can afford that at the moment, so I find him the alternatives... If he doesn't like them, then there is nothing I can do.  I won't program that for him because to put it simply, he'd have to hire me for a year and not with hourly wages.  Well, Z and I decided that the longer we wait for him to give us information, the more stuff he would ask us to keep adding or researching (outside of the original quote, by the way).  What started with a 200 page, database driven project has expanded to 400 with over 1500 dynamically created extra pages (and let's not talk about images just yet).  Dynamic... So no big deal... If we didn't have to capture the text data for those 1500+ pages ourselves.  He's supposed to give us that... But all he does is give us links and tell us to look in those.  We did that in the beginning, but it ended up that we would not exactly capture what he wanted on his site, so we told him... You give it to us.  Makes it so much simpler, that way we are not guessing at what he wants or not.  Plus, we do not get involved in copyright issues.  If the client gives me stuff, then I am to assume he got permission to use that information or he wrote it himself.  Well... Now let's hope I do not have to move my deadline again.

          You are going to Marry orlando Bloom. He will always treat you right and is very romantic. He will do anything for you. He is very polite and has deep brown eyes and is very good looking (which is another plus!). He can make anything cheesy look really hot(like sliding down stairs on a shield shooting arrows or wearing pointy ears for example).

        Things have gotten better with my buddy from the other day, RB, (you know... we got upset over nothing and stopped talking for several days).  We did quite a bit of talking today... our 'problem' was mentioned like for 3 lines then we went back to playing as usual, so that is pretty great.  I hope we keep it like that for a good while.        "What does your mouth say about you?"   You are confident in yourself, your opinions, and you are glamorous. You are creative and talk a lot. You always have important things to say but you know how to balance off your intense nature with a good sense of humor. You are dedicated and stay on task. You also keep your word, you never break a promise. Talented, intelligent, AND creative. Awesome for you!     urlLink What does your mouth say about you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     That's right! ^_~    And something that was kinda funny to me...

I really do.   LL: all I ask for is sharks with frickin' laser beams on their frickin' heads people!   LL: that Dr. Evil?   Kitty: yeah.   LL: groovy.   Kitty: "One.Million.Dollars!"

        Well nothing much to talk about; been at home trying to make a good wife outta me.  Wake up at 5am to get ready for excercise.  Thirty minutes of weights and 30 of laps... if I can call them that.  Mainly I do 50-100 meters at once, then I rest for like 5 minutes.  Then the lap distance goes to 50 meters with its same time for rest.  I can't believe I used to do on average 10 continuous laps with a 1 minute break followed by the same routine.  Well, at least I am doing something, right?  Feels good though... to feel hungry and to know that it is because I've been up and about since such an early hour.    I do most cleaning of my house, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, the bathroom.  Then I check e-mails, work on things here and there and then about 4pm I start preparing dinner.  He says it's getting pretty good.  Getting? heh. It's always been good, except maybe for my soups... I've been known to burn water. heheheh.  Oho! I watched Kill Bill Vol 1 on Friday night.  Pretty neat movie.  The fight scenes were highly dramatic and exaggerated, but heck, they were nicely choreographed.  Loved the fountanous blood spraying.  And this Saturday I watched Hidalgo - what a great horse man!  The trainer did an awesome job. And we stayed to watch Starsky and Hutch – stupid funny… the sort you want to just see to laugh your head off.    And now I am tired. Me’s out!

        Saturday.  Went to my friend's graduation ceremony - Bibi's ceremony.  We had to get there super early (5pm) in order to save seats for her family members.  So 2 of her cousins, her 2 little brothers (little meaning in their late teens early 20s... but since I've known them since forever, they are little to me), my hubby and I.  We each took a row and sat at the first seat and last seat to make sure we didn't let anyone in to take the middle chairs. hehehehe.  Oh... people get maaaaad.  * shrugs *    Family members started to arrive and the ceremony started at 7 pm sharp.  After hearing the dean and guest speakers talk for about an hour about... erm... stuff -  you know all that about the hard road they took to be where they were but that none of us cares about?  - then the graduates began their walk to get their diplomas.  She got her BS in Mathematics with an extra Associates degree.  Right after she walked, she met us at the chairs and we went to her house to celebrate with burgers!  We got out late and restaurants close so darn early down here.        Hubby, Bibi, and I    Overall it was very nice.  The family is just so nice and my hubby loves to chat with her dad.  He is a very down-to-earth, hard-working, decent man, and both him and his wife, Mrs. L., raised a very fine family.  I went to school with 3 of the 'kids', the 2nd oldest whom I affectively call my Bro (1 year older than I), my friend Bibi (same age as I, both graduated together in High School), and the 4th oldest and youngest girl in the family (about 2 years younger than us... yeah, she was a Sophomore when we were Seniors).  The baby boys, one went to school with my little sister, same age, and then the baby baby, who's been out of HS for about a year and a half, or is it 2?  Him I met well... you always get to meet your friends' baby siblings.  Such a lovable boy.  The only one that I know very little is the eldest, who was already out of High School when I got there and met them all.   Well, the graduation party is this coming saturday.  They will be making a big fajita cookout.  They made the best brisket, chicken, and fajita that I've ever tasted!  Ohhh and the potato salad...      Sunday was all right until I got a call from another one of my college girlfriends, Magda.  She had had a rough weekend.  Had problems with the significant other - the bastard - and was just in tears.  We talked for a very long while and I shared my opinion on the matter with her.  Not trying to make up her mind for her, but simply telling her how I saw things.  It is always so much easier for those of us outside of the problem to see reasonable solutions to situations, but of course, easier said than done.    By the end of our conversation she was laughing a little and even said she was getting hungry, which was a big plus! since she had not eaten anything but nibbled at some crackers since friday.  * sigh * What heart ahce does to a person.  She's such a smart woman; has more degrees under her belt than any of the guys she's dated... She probably holds as many as all of them together!  Maybe she is just so intimidating because of it that they just can't keep up with her.  Heh... well, their loss.     Monday - spent the day with mom.  We went to a public swimming facility, checked it out and decided to make it a daily habit to go there.  We subscribed and went to purchase our equipment.  She will be doing Aquaerobics from 6:15 to 7:00am, while I do free-style swimming for about the same time.       Tuesday - what a crappy day.  woke up at 5:15am to get ready for my first day of swimming.  Mom and dad picked me up at 5:45, we took at quick shower at the center and she took her class and I did laps.  I am out of shape... big time.  But eventually I'll be able to do my 50 laps non-stop, I just have to take my time and get the technique back.  It's all about endurance and breathing.  After that, ma took me home and we walked for a bit around the block and then she went to her house.  I got a call from dad like 45 minutes later telling me to go with mom.  We had a break in...  again  and the bandits took garden equipment, an expensive mower that my hubby and I had just bought my dad about 2 weeks ago (by the way... that was to replace another mower that had gotten stolen too), and they took my parents' new puppy!    Bastards.  One of the local Constables was able to recuperate a mower (which we ended up discovering was the very first mower that got stolen) but after a chase, the guys escaped with the other mower and the little dog.  It's like they already targeted their house, and oh man.. I just get such bad feelings about the neighbors.  They do nothing... the girls go out to work while the guys stay there at home... probably just waiting for government checks... good-for-nothing, uneducated, beer-drinking, lazy people.  Big coincidence... they always notice Everything that my parents do (one of the guys gets near the fence and comments on anything new that my dad may be using) but when bad things happen, oh they don't know anything, they are always out.  Whatever.     What sucks even more is that yes, the constables saw the guys, saw the car, read a few letters from the plates, chased after them... and they say they'll keep looking but... I know that they'll forget soon.  It's happened before.  I really think my parents should move.  That block is no good anymore.     Wednesday - After swimming, mom and I went to all the animal shelters and vet offices that we could to leave off posters of the puppy.  She was a nice, full-breed rottweiler, 2 months old.  My dad had given it to my mom last week.  If we can find the puppy, we may be able to find the robbers... or something.  Chances are slim, however.  If they leave the puppy anywhere and someone finds it, I doubt they'll turn it in to any shelter, the dog is worth quite a bit... and even if they take it to get vaccines, it probably won't be until several months later, the doggy will be much older so it won't be that easy to recognize it... and I doubt that veterinarians or the city shelter officials will are about a stolen dog after this weekend.  I just hope 'Beauty' is bought of found by a nice family that will feed and treat her right and not just left to wander the roads until it gets ran over by a truck.      Beauty       Thursday, today... I was super exhausted this morning.  I did very few laps and I found that it wasn't because I was sore or anything... but my breathing just did not seem to be enough.  I was just getting tired quickly.  So after like 10 laps, which took about 45 minutes to do (dang that was slow) I went to the showers and began to get ready.  Mom arrived minutes later and she took began to get ready.    After the make-up ritual We headed to get her checked up at the doc's and we were doing all that for... dang... 5 hrs or so.  Gaw, Mom says I chose a wrong major. I should have taken medicine - there are always sick people in need of doctors!    I was dropped off home at around 1:30pm and decided to take a nap instead of just cleaning around the house.  I was just soooo tired.  Some time later hubby was pushing me so that I would scoot over and he joined me in the nap.  He got off work early today ^_^  I snuggled against his chest and was out again.  I got up at 6:30 something and I could already smell good cooking going on. We watched TV and well... now I am here.  But I better close it up.  I am still tired, must be from waking up so early this week, something I haven't done in forever, and then with all anger from Tuesday and oh well... Me's off to bed again.

        "Psychologists in Canada have finally proved what women have long suspected - men really are irrational enough to risk entire kingdoms to catch sight of a beautiful face.   Biologists have long known that animals prefer immediate rewards to greater ones in the future. This process, known as "discounting the future", is found in humans too and is fundamental to many economic models.  ... Margo Wilson and Martin Daly of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada decided to investigate discounting behaviour and see if it varied with sexual mood.  Male students, when shown pictures of pretty women, were more likely to opt for short-term economic gain than wait for a better reward in the future.  ...Wilson and Daly found that male students shown the pictures of averagely attractive women showed exponential discounting of the future value of the reward. This indicated that they had made a rational decision. When male students were shown pictures of pretty women, they discounted the future value of the reward in an "irrational" way - they would opt for the smaller amount of money available the next day rather than wait for a much bigger reward.  Women, by contrast, made equally rational decisions whether they had been shown pictures of handsome men or those of average attractiveness."    "We have not elucidated the psychological mechanisms mediating our results," says Margo Wilson. "But we hypothesise that viewing pictures of pretty women was mildly arousing, activating neural mechanisms associated with cues of sexual opportunity."  Tommaso Pizzari, an evolutionary biologist at Leeds University, offers another possible explanation: "If there's the prospect of getting a very attractive partner it may pay a man to take more risks than if an average partner was available."   He told New Scientist: "If this is a response to sexual selection then you would expect men who are less attractive to take more risks. If you have many attractive potential partners then it does not pay to take risks. If you are less attractive, with few potential partners, then it pays to take risks."   Source: NewScientist.com  ... Moral of the story: Stick to average-looking guys.

        … or 5th of May, the Battle of Puebla.  Several of you may have heard about this day… a day celebrated by most Mexican and Mexican descendants (and friends that tag along).  Contrary to what people may believe, Cinco de Mayo does not  celebrate Mexico’s Independence from Spain.  Not at all.  Cinco de Mayo marks a day in Mexican history when a small group of soldiers, armed with rudimentary weapons (compared to the high-tech stuff used in the mid 1800s) overcame a much larger French army in the small city of Puebla in 1862. That day has ever since been remembered as the day that Mexico began the overthrow of foreign rule in its lands.       It is also my daddy’s birthday. ^_^   *skips off to get ready for the special dinner*

        I saw a most beautiful boy today.  He sat at a table across from me... sideways.  He was hunching over a blue plastic bowl, eyes gazing at a slice of cooked green pepper that he had pulled out of the soup with his plastic fork.  He seemed bored, worried, sad?  Made me wonder what he had on his mind. Could anyone help?  Did he need a friend?  I was engrossed with the scene, admiring the straight nose, defined jaw, and the small brown eyes that continued to peer into the bowl.  For the first time in my life I wished I could draw... really, really draw so that I could forever hold the image of this young, pretty man. So that he would never age, never die.  His large hand took the bowl and thin fingers helped tilt it to his lips, thinned and tanned.  Another boy came over and they exchanged words while turning to look at one of the windows.  The pretty one quickly finished his meal, covered his Tupperware and then got up, following his 'friend' to somewhere... I just didn't think it right to continue to stare as if to make it any more obvious.  And unfortunately, I was not able to get a glimpse at his name tag...  *sigh*  My pocket will suffer from now on.     Burger King, you now have a new daily customer.

        I should have been working but... lazy, lazy day. Did part of the laundry, however, and cut up some vegetables for my husband's dish.  It's has been raining part of today, surprisingly making it a semi chilly morn.   Had an appointment with a buddy of mine online at around 5.  Missed it 'cause I fell asleep and when I woke up I had to rush to S.B. to feed my doggie. ^_^  Got back at around 6:45 and then was able to give him a call at around 7 something.  Yeah, it had been a while since we'd spoken.  ^_~  Pretty voice.   Did I make your day? Did I? Did I?   Oho!  I also got an invitation from a friend of mine who is graduating in a few weeks!  Yeyness!  Another gal that goes into Mathematics – now I have 2 friends in that area.  Geesh, I have these geniuses girlfriends and it just makes me all warm inside.  =^_^=  I gotta get her something neat as a gift, but I don't know what!!!  I was thinking of a personalized desk item... like a pen set or something... hmmm.  Necklace?  hmmm, she's like me and I haven't seen her wearing much jewelry.  Oh well, she is into tech too... a package of mini CD-RWs for her cool CD-mavica camera?  >_

        Mom was restless all morning... the nurses are super nice, but so very busy.  They told us she'd get the 'pee' tube taken out of her early in the morning, but it wasn't until around noon.  My sister came over and then, after getting trained on how to help her up and to walk.  Sis and I took turns on going to get breakfast, well.. it was more like lunch for me - I went at one thirty-something.  After I came back we helped mom get out of her room to start walking.  We gave like 5 turns around the floor and then spent quite a bit of time watching the newborns.  Such cute little wrinkled things... very pretty.  Such lungs too!  Again, I left when hubby got out from work, my sister stayed to take care of her and then after taking a 2 hour nap at home and showering I went back to the hospital, took over sister's post and stayed overnight.

        Mom underwent surgery. Hubby and I arrived before 5am to meet with my parents and sister. They arrived a little after 5am.  Mom was taken into her private room right away and dad stayed with her. Around 6:00 she was taken in for surgery. It was a C-section to remove a cyst the size of a 5-month-old fetus.  Her cut was made vertically, as opposed to the less noticeable horizontal.    Shucks, now she can't wear bikinis at the beach no more.   Bummer.     Well, it all went great.  She got out of surgery at around 10 something. She was under the effect of the anesthesia and could barely talk.  She said her tongue felt so thick and heavy.  It sounded like that as well.  Her face was so swollen, as were her hands and legs.  She fell asleep pretty quickly and we left the room to allow her some rest.  My sister and I headed to mom's house and watched a movie while we waited for my husband to get out of work so he could take me home.  Got home at 6pm, took a 2-hour nap, and then showered and we headed to the hospital.  Dad and my sis were just waiting for me to take over.  I spent the night with her at the room.  It was a tiring day and night.  Every hour we would awake; nurses had to check up on her and I would then give her massages on her feet, legs and at times on her back. Being lying on her back really began to cause her pain.  No need to walk her to the rest room yet - she had a tube that would take care of that for her.  Looked painful, though. >_

        I e-mailed everyone I had to e-mail and I won't be checking e-mails or handle any projects for the whole week.  Today we spent most of the morning at the docs.  Mom will have surgery tomorrow and she is having last minute checkups on pressure and heart condition.  She is in top shape, but it's necessary.  She seemed a little nervous but it's normal.  She has never liked to go under the knife, or rather, under anesthesia.  She says that it was terrifying to be somewhere and then blink and suddenly awake at a bed, all patched up.

        I jut realized that my pseudo-coding sucks.       Pseudo-code for a category listing... notice the donkeys...    If I were working with a big team, my notes woudl be all typed up and I would have comments on why I write what I do, etc, but since I only work with my hubby... well, let's just say that for the most part, we know what we are trying to say (even if we don't know what the other is writing').  Been a pretty good day. Slept plenty, ate sandwiches, finish beautifying one piece of code, wrote tons with my buddies!  Been a good day, good day indeed.  Well, nothing much to say really except...  WOOO HOOOOOOOO!  Mexico won 10-0 against Dominica!   Although, by goal 7 I was really wishing the other team scored at least once!   Okay, okay these are late news... Mexico played Dominica on Sunday at the Alamodome ni Austin, Texas.  Mexico won.  This ensure their ticket to the World Cup that will be held at Germany in 2006. ^_^  So it's all good!

        So very tired.  Eyes burning.  Legs and arms feeling wobbly.    Need sleep... more than five hours.  But. Must. Finish. New. Sub site.  Brainstorming done.     BLISS!   Hopefully tomorrow I get to setup queries and begin programming the whole thing. Yey! ^_^  That's nice enough to give me a splash of awakening if even for one more hour.   Woo hoo!   PSEUDO:  Person logs into account. Page loads current hired services. Services can be 1) edited, 2) deleted.  PSEUDO 2: Person registers Customer Information gathered From shopping area we get hired services  BRAINSTORMING...    Different databases must be linked so that the 1st above is possible.

        Morning went pretty good; the hubby washed the car, I cleaned the house, we watched a soccer game on TV and so on.  Then suddenly, I was angry out of nothing.  The cat started getting very anxious and doing mischief and I was just sitting on one side of the sofa, waiting for the slightest thing to jump out screaming.  I am not even sure how things happened but husband took one of his drumsticks and began to wave it around playfully but I was already in a bad mood and I took the other and I slammed it against his leg because I didn't feel like playing.  He let out an 'ouch' and looked at me frowning. He began to say something but stopped himself, shook his head and turned to look at the TV.  We didn't say anything to each other for a while and then I went to the kitchen to dry dishes.  The cat followed me right away and began to cry out so that I would give her something to eat.  I didn't and she just kept at it until I found myself screaming at her so that she'd shut up.  The cat just looked at me for a few seconds and then resumed her whining.  I proceeded to ignore her.  In one of those I walked close to her to get the dishes in the pantry and she bit me.  She started to run away immediately, because she is not dumb... she knows biting is wrong, but I was pretty fast (anger makes me jumpy and fast) and I bent down, put my hand over her back and gave her like 4 slaps on her butt while I kept telling her that I was in no mood and to get the hell away from me.  I let her go and she ran to the window and just sat there looking outside.  My husband didn't say anything, and I stayed in the kitchen defrosting meat.  When I went out I went to open the window for the cat... I was feeling guilty.  Yes, she was a bad kitty but I was already angry to begin with so I was just waiting for anything to reprimand I guess.  As soon as hubby saw me he began to tell me to leave the baby alone and to never slap her butt again. I told him she had bit me and he said that it was because I had bothered her first.  I repeated myself and he said the same thing again.    I just turned around and got in the kitchen area and just started cooking.  I felt like pasta so I began chopping and measuring ingredients to make a simple meatloaf.  I put it in the oven, washed the dishes I had used and went inside the bedroom looking for my purse, which I didn't find.  Husband began to make his way along the hall and I hurried into my study and locked myself in.  I didn't feel like talking.  He asked something about food but I did not answer.  I spent 30-some minutes reading web comics and then got out to check on the meatloaf.  I took it out from the oven, poured tomato, garlic and oregano sauce on it and put it back inside the oven.  I placed some water to boil.  I noticed a BK bag with 3 burgers and fries... I guess he went out while I was in the study. He had already fed Chiquita too.  I went back into the study.  I got out like 15 minutes later and he got up from the couch to talk.  I just moved into the kitchen and took out the meatloaf and placed it in a wood table to cool down.  I don't even remember what he was saying, I was busy preparing the pasta, but he left back tot he living room after he felt ignored for enough time.  It was done in like 5 minutes and after draining it I put it in plates and mixed it with a little butter, oregano and garlic powder and accompanied it with a slice of meatloaf.  I took it to him and he asked where mine was... He always asks that and I often tell him that I only have 2 hands and that I can only bring his plate and utensils, not both.  This time I was too edgy and I yelled at him.  And by the manner I did it one would have thought that he had told me he didn't like meatloaf or something.  I prepared my plate and took it to the table.  He walked over with his a bit after, saying he didn't like to eat without me.  We talked a little more and he told me France had won it's match against England.  When we were done he took the plates and washed them. I sat to watch some TV and shortly after I went to the study again.  Chiquita followed me in and I shoved her out of the room telling her I was still angry and I didn't want her in the room.  The other day I found many of my cables chewed up.    He went into the study several minutes later and just lay down on the couch there and fell asleep.  I woke him up about an hour later and made out.  We watched a movie on TV at seven and things are fine again.  What the hell was all about today then?  I can't even remember why I got so grouchy.  I know it was my fault; I started it... but why?

        The hubby and I took a nap after having dinner.  I made something very quick - just some ravioli soup (from a can) and then scrambled eggs with ground beef. Nothing fancy... It's Friday and I have very little stuff in the fridge by Fridays.  I either have meats but no extras like veggies or bread and drinks, or all the extras but no main dish meat. * shrugs *  So the nap, the nap... I guess it was like 3 hours long, I am not sure. I slept awkward and woke up with this neck pain so I just lay there, feeling uncomfortable and stiff, but with images in my mind of the small dream I had.  I do not dream about him much, but this time I did.  So I raised my hand while he sat next to me on the bed and I stay with my hand outstretched for what seemed the longest time and he never gets it.  I had to make this noise for him to look at me.  I have my hand out to him and he just stares at it until I tell him to hold it, which he does but in some sort of 'whatever' way.    I begin to tell him that I dreamt with him... and he talks about being hungry.  I kept talking to him and describing my dream - it was short and simple, in which we were in a strange home's backyard and he was cooking something on a grill; I remember watching him as I leaned with my shoulder against a glass sliding door; we talked about something while he teased the carbon, but I cannot remember the words.  Well, I did not get to tell him all of this.  He suddenly gets up as I begin telling him the dream and walks out of the room.  He came back some minutes later and I told him my whole body hurt - it was weight lifting training today and O really stressed my muscles.  He didn't really say much.  I was hoping maybe he would sit next to me and at least rub my shoulder or anything.  I know, perhaps if I wanted that I should have told him... but... why can't he just do it from himself once in a while?  When he says his whatever aches I try to hold him, rub his aching muscle - whether he lets me or not is a different story; he does not like to be touched much.  But just because he does not like to be touched it does not meat I do not like it either.   I wished I didn't have to spell out everything to him - it gets frustrating.   Well, there I was telling him how my body hurt and again, he just leaves... I heard some rattling around of pots and such at the kitchen so I figured he was making something to eat which is fine with me, as long as he is careful when he does his cooking... But as it is imaginable, he was not.  He made some barbecue chicken wings and left the doors open, stinking the entire house of an aroma a do not like much.  I am not a bbq-smell fan. My whole bedroom stinks of it now... my clothes, my freshly washed sheets.    He should be more careful... this I tell him.  This I do not keep and hope that he will someday just get it.  I tell him.  "Be careful with how you do things because I clean this house everyday; just be considerate."  It sticks to him for a few days... then he takes it for granted again.

        Woo-hoo!  I increased my weight level… no, not my ‘mass’ weight, but my… lifting weight – I am still trying to lose weight. Heheh this is confusing.  Since Monday I started with what is called ‘strength training’ in the world of bodybuilding.  I am following a smiple routine, where I do a small set of repetitions at a very slow pace and with as much weight as possible until I reach muscle fatigue.  That’s what body builders do when they want to get buffed!!!   Yum yum   It would be much better if I could do free weights, but there are none at the swimming center.  Most of the machines there are for aided weight lifting, and most are the basic ones used most by swimmers.  Standard stuff such as a Bowflexes, leg presses, assisted weight chinups, and several other Nautilus machines (tricep, bicep, thighs), oh oh oh and this super neato machines that are inclines that slide front and back while you pull yourself with the aid of strings, so it’s like a simulated rowing machine but inclined… TOUGH!!!  Anyway.  I used to do the standard 6 sets of 8 reps for bicep, tricep, shoulder, chest, calves, and thighs with average weight of 30 to 160 lbs accordingly.  This weeks I have managed to do 2 sets of 8 reps each of the same body areas but with almost doubled the weight.  On the arms I managed an average of 50-80lbs (depending on which area of the arm I was working), inner and outer thighs I did 65 & 120lbs, and for claves and leg presses I managed 220lbs.  Boy I was beat.  My limbs were quivering like crazy after I was done with all the stretching.  I’ll continue these weights until I can do the reps in my sleep, then I shall increase 10-30 lbs.  I get to rest tomorrow from weights, so I’ll only do laps and then practice with mom on her breathing.  * yawn * For now I am sleepy…    Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

        It's been taking me a while to get my mom back-floating.  At first I tried teaching her the most basic way I know how: let yourself go back... arch your head back, the back of your head touching the neck, and the water will probably cover pass the ears (but not into the eyes or nose).  Then the body will just... float up.  It didn't quite work with her.  She was tensing up too much so that her legs would just fall down and take the rest of her as well. She was nervous.    The next step was to get her some floaters so that she could hold with her feet. That helped a lot more, but still she would start falling in after a while.  So then we went into teaching her to thread water while on her back.  With that she also became aware of how she could push her body up or move it about the area, which is nice.  Little by little.  She just needed to get comfortable and while she's still not 100% floating, she can hold the relaxed position for about 2 minutes.  ^_^  Now she practices with a styro board too.  It's all about kicks.  Well, it has been a little over 3 weeks now and she can swim Front Crawl style (yey!).  She still cannot put her head down in the water too much.  She starts it fine and gets quite a distance in about 5 strokes, but when she starts getting in air, it looks as if she misses the coordination between strokes and breathing.  She gave me quite a scare Monday.  In one of those, she took in some water that went the wrong way and she couldn’t breathe even after she stopped.  She calmed down once I had her by the edge of the pool and she began to breathe again.  Hmmm... I may get into some water rescue courses one of these days.  While I know how to swim 'alright' and how to get a person out of the water, I do not know exactly what to do when someone is in a 'safe' area, but that has just swallowed water and is 'nervous' (therefore making themselves choke even more).  Gotta research more on what to do there.  I will take the next 'class' in a different way.  Nothing but kicks for a while.  I have to get her comfortable with the head under water while she gains a balance of how to inhaled and exhale for swimming.  In other words, I need to teach her how to let her breath out under water.

        Somebody stole my mower.  I last saw it on tuesday evening... after I came back from swimming at around 9:20am on wednesday it was no longer in my back yard.  Bastards.  I wish I knew witchcraft.  I'd place a spell on all my things and if anyone did anything wrong with them or stole them the spell would make them blow up on their faces!  How I wish I could do that.  Sorry story about this mower:  We bought it for my parents to replace another that had been stolen before (I think I may have mentioned earlier... yes, yes I did).  Well this 2nd mower was in their possession for about 2 weeks when it too was stolen along with their new pup Beauty.  The constable was able to recuperate the machine (chase activity and all) but not the puppy.  Well, it's been 2 or 3 weeks since then.  My mother brought me the mower so that I could fix something on it (seems that it was bandalized by the robbers so that they could perhaps sell it without too much trouble, posing it as an old and used mower).  Well it is gone now... again... I doubt we'll get it back this time.  The police didn't really make me feel with good vibes about how interested they were on following up with the case.  I don't blame them.  They must get a lot of calls for yard robbing.  * sigh * Nothing ANYWHERE is safe.    I live in the city as opposed to my mom who lives in a ranch area, so we figured it would be safer here.  Riiight.  It is realy uncomfortable.  We do not know who is watching us... when... and more importantly Why.  I like to open up my windows and get some light inside.  It helps avoid 'kitty' and 'housewife' depression.  Heh, now I am concerned about people looking inside and 'wanting' my expensive stuff.     Juveniles and Bums are greedy for electronics.

        I was without phone and cable for a while.  I had satellite but I don’t really watch it – the cable is for Internet connection, satellite for TV, phone for my future alarm.  Anyway, Husband and I have wanted a fence for a while now, but had not made the time to get some quotations.  We finally did and the monthly payments are not all that bad: 78 bucks a month, that’s what we spend in a week of eating out so we went for it.    Monday we filled out the application, Tuesday it was submitted for approval, Wednesday we received the go, Thursday the workers came to start putting up the 4x4s to make the frame and hold them with cement, etc.  These wood posts have to go at least 2 feet under ground and they did it rather quickly.  I had mentioned to be careful with the cables and such, and according to the salesperson the guys had come to inspect the property beforehand to make sure they isolated the phone, light, and other cables.  Well, they finished setting the posts and left.  Next morning, Friday, I go out to do several errands: pay some bills, etc, and my mom calls me at the cel.    “Are you in the Internet?” she asked.  “Me? Nah.  I’m outside. I’m driving. Why?”  “Because I’ve been calling you several times in the morning and your phone is always busy, so I thought you were on the Internet.”  “Oh we don’t use the phone for the Internet mom. We have cable net.  Hmm. Maybe I forgot to hang up a phone or something… or… owwww I hope they didn’t break my line.”  “The fence guys?”  “Yah… I’ll check when I get home.”  So I did.   I arrived home and picked up the phone at the kitchen and yes there was no dial tone.  So then I went to the bedroom and noticed the same thing.  I got my tool set and unhook a phone set and went outside, where the main phone box is.  I disconnected the RJ that makes the round circle for the whole phone system and hooked up my phone.  That’s what they people at the phone company always says to do:  Before calling us, check that all phones are hooked up.  Then plug a receiver outside and make sure there is (or isn’t) a dial tone. If there is a dial, then the problem is in your phones or home jacks and you may easily troubleshoot yourself.  If there is no dial tone then it’s a different problem and give us a call.       No dial tone, so I gave them a call (via the cel phone).  I was told that service would be restored by Saturday at 7pm.  Alright… it was Friday 4:30pm… hmmm... okay, I could leave with no phone service for a day.  I started doing my housework and then my dad came over to take me shopping.  When we got back, I gave him dinner and then went to his house to help him pack because he was taking a short trip to go to my sister’s at Laredo.  Mom is with her, so he was going to come back with her.  Well, when I got back home I went to check my e-mail and… Page not found.  O_o Uh-oh… I looked at the cable modem and one light was blinking and 2 others were off… The only solid green was the Power one… ~_~   NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   I CAN LIVE WITHOUT PHONE, BUT PLEASE DON’T TAKE MY INTERNET CONNECTION!!!  * sigh *  I shut everything off, tried restarting the modem.  I reset it a couple of times, but it was the same results.  I turned stuff off again and went to wash the bathroom.  I’d give a call the next day.  So, now it’s Saturday.  The fence people came over at around 9am and I went outside to talk to them and asked if they had come across some wires while drilling the holes because… well, I was without phone and cable.    “Oh.  Did it happen after we left.”  “Yep. I had not noticed until yesterday afternoon, when my mother game me a call and said my phone was just busy, busy.”  “Hm. Well, we saw this cable…” he began to walk over one corner of the lawn and I followed him, “but it was already broken so we thought it was some left over or something.”  He scraped the dirt and yes, there was a torn black cable.    I looked at it and recognized it to be like the one connected to the phone box… and then I asked, “and an orange cable?”  Good thing that each service has their own colors, eh?  “No. We didn’t see that.”  I kinda shrugged, “Yeah, well. I am expecting the technician from the phone to come over sometime today.  He’ll check the stuff.” I smiled.  Heh. No need to get all upset and stuff. It was an accident.    “Oh we’ll work quickly. All he’ll have to do is reconnect wherever the wire got broken.”  “Yeah. I hope nobody gets interrupted in the work.  But yes, like you said, it shouldn’t be that difficult…” the phone power area is actually on my side of the fence, so it was easy acces, The cable may be a little more difficult since the main power box was at the neighbor’s property.  Ooops.  Oh wells.  But now to the important part: “If there are any charges for fixing the line, if it was from the drilling… I just forward you guys the bill?” Tutututuuu.  “Yeah. Sure.”  Alright!  So I left them at their work and I went to feed Chiquita, then gave a call to the cable company.  They did not have a slot available until Wednesday morning and I took it.  Oh man.. so many days with no internet.  * weeps * Anyway, at around 2 the phone technician, Andres, came over and went straight to work. I saw the truck so I went outside and introduced myself.  We chatted for some time while he worked.  “Yes, when I saw that there was a fence being built I knew it was a torn cable problem.  Yeah, they cut it when they made the holes.” He was clipping tiny little red and green cables and hooking them up to the motherboard,   “I had not noticed until my mom called yesterday noon.  If she hadn’t I still wouldn’t know. Hahaha. We just never use the phone.  It’s just here because…well, everyone needs a phone.”  He laughed and nodded, “True, true.  I am almost done, see?  With these” he had two little pliers thingies that he was connecting to the wires to check the reception, “I am checking your line.”  I was nodding and going ‘oooooh’ all airhead-like.  Techies love that, so be nice, make their day.  “Yep, it works. Now I’ll just connect the main line at your box and in 3 or 4 days somebody will come and bury the new line.” He showed me the cable.    We continued to chat and then I asked about the repair cost.  “Oh it’s nothing.  When it comes to these type of problems, we never charge the client.  It’s not your fault.  And if we were to charge anything we’d charge the fence company, but we don’t do that either. ‘Cause you see, if we do, then the fence company may charge the client in some way, and well, that’s not fair because it wasn’t your fault.”  “Nice policy!”  He then said that in a few minutes he’d ring the phone and then would go around to give me his card, so I left him at his work.  On the way back to the house I saw the fence guys and I gave them thumbs up.  “I’ve got my phone back! Yey.”  They kinda smiled and nodded while I walked inside.  Minutes later Andres gave me a call and asked if the line was fine, I said yes so we hung up.  Then he went to the house and gave me his card. Told me to call him at his pager if anything was odd with the line in the next few days.  “You know how a pager works?”  “Hmmm. I dial the number, then I leave my own number.”  “Yes. Pager, beeper same thing.  Just leave me your cel phone number… otherwise if I call…”  We said the next thing together, “there won’t be an answer ‘cause the main line is down.”  “Got it! No problem. Thank you very much.”  I waved his card and then he excused himself and I closed the door.    A couple of hours later and my neato fence was done. Came out pretty good ^_^ AND… when I came to the office, I noticed my modem lights all solid green! YEY!!!  I guess the cable company was updating something in the block. Still, I will wait one more day and if everything is still working fine then I will call the cable company to cancel my Wednesday appointment with the technician.  ^_^

        Alright, so what was the whole plane ride post all about yesterday?  My sister-in-law is sending our niece down here on vacation for 2 weeks. She is ten (or is it eleven?) and due to regulations she cannot travel alone, nor would we want her too… it’s dangerous out there with so many twisted people around… So anyway, we had been planning this for a couple of months and my husband gets to go to New York to come back with Bashma (pronounced Baah-sma) on Sunday.  In the process he also sees his parents who are visiting the country and staying at his sister’s apartment.  After the 2 weeks are done, my sister-in-law flies down here and then goes back with my niece.  Nice arrangement.  I hope Bashma doesn’t get bored while down here. We have the beach at 30 minutes travel and also plenty of public pools and 2 water parks.  Then there are the parks, Peter-Piper’s, Chuck-E-Cheeses, and the city’s recreation area. We don’t have much in the area of ‘cool’ museums, except for the historical places (well… historical for the area). Oh yes! We have the Zoo!  You know, that cool place where all the animals are always asleep inside their cages?  ~_~  Now, I don’t know how many places I will be able to take her.  My husband will be working all day so we’ll probably do the whole-day-long activities (water park, beach, zoo, etc) on the weekends and I’ll take her around the smaller places on the weekdays.  I’ve been getting tons of kiddie anime (the one with nothing censorable or questionable) to keep her busy in the mornings or before bedtime.  These 2 weeks should be good for me as some sort of training. Ehhhh.  We’ll see what happens.  Well, for now, I think I should give a call to my in-laws. I still haven’t… I really should… really,   really   should…   I have an excuse on why I did not call yesterday when my husband arrived. ^_^ I did not wish to bother them because I knew they would have so many things to talk to him!  Yeash, that’s it.    Truth is… I was upset.  They called yesterday, probably looking for hubby to find out how the trip was going.  I answered the phone (remember that I gave him mine because he forgot his at home) and they hung up on me.  I said, maybe, since they were calling his cel phone and a girl answered (yes there is the probability they still do not recognize my voice) they thought that it was a wrong number.  So I said, they’ll call again… but they didn’t.  I had given my number to his sister (when she called his cel phone) so that she could be informed of his whereabouts and she surely gave it to her parents.  So, if they dialed his number and then hung up thinking it was a wrong number, why did they not dial it again?  Easy. Because they already knew that my husband was using my phone, so they probably dialed that number then.     They could have at least said ‘hi.’

        My husband left for New York at 5:45am, but things would have been less stressful in the morning had we woken up at 3:20 as originally intended.    We have one of those alarm clocks that can have different times set for weekends and weekdays.  He generally plays around with the times, depending on how tired he is. Most of the time he changes the times by 10 or 15 minutes.  Well, last night he changed the settings for 3:20am and before going to bed he asked me to check it.  I turned it on and saw the 3:20, no pm next to it, so I told him it was fine.  It was a little before midnight and I told him I was not sleepy, that perhaps he should just let me stay awake and then after I dropped him off the next day at around 4 that I would come back and sleep all the way through.  He insisted, ‘I cannot sleep without you’, etc, etc so I turned in.  I remember stirring up and kicking the covers aside and I pushed him a little while doing it.  The next thing I hear is “oh no! Shit!”, so I pick up my head and I ask, “What’s the matter?!” , “It’s FIVE!”  I checked the clock; the alarm was set at 3:20… but for Sunday.  Darn. We’re talking… Five am… plane leaves at 5:45, gates close at around 5:30-something and we’re about 20 minutes away, driving fast... and the truth is that we didn’t really wake up at five - it was like 9 after.  I pulled up jeans and a blouse while he was running around tucking in his toiletries (he was supposed to wake up early enough to take a shower and then pack those bath items).  Well, we got out the driveway and the car clock said 5:22.    I dug my nails onto the seat all the way to the airport.  He was going over 80 in the city, cursing at every single driver that dared to go the actual speed limit.  Finally we got there 3 minutes after 30.  He took out his bags and ran inside.  I began to circle around thinking that there would be the probability that the airport people would not let him in, since he still needed to get boarding pass, check in the luggage, and then get the whole checkup thingy at the gates… plus the lady on the speakers was announcing that gates to flight 2728 were ‘now closed.’  I went around the front once more and he was coming out, I thought they had refused him so I was already taking out my wallet to make some sort of last minute changes to the ticket and hopefully get him a seat aboard the next earliest plane.    Nope. He just needed the cel phone.  I handed it to him by the window and he shouted a hasty “I love you!” while I shouted back, “Yes, yes! Go!” and he ran back inside.  I parked, just in case.  At 5:56am I left back for home…   Husband called me at 7:20am from Houston.  I was waiting for that call since 7am.  Things went okay and he was going to the next gate.  He said that here in Brownsville, gate check still made him wait longer before boarding… They made him take off his shoes, belt, went through the entire luggage, phone, PDA, and his documents.  He was laughing as he told me, the stress already gone.  I reminded him to please find a bathroom and to at least wash his face when he had time.    Oh man… I had bought him this really nice shirt to wear today so that his parents wouldn’t see him all crappy… Darn, the first thing he got was the shirt that he had used at work yesterday.  ~_~  Now they’re gonna say I don’t take care of him…  which I don’t, actually… but still… that’s not for the in-laws to know.

        Whoa! Now that’s an action movie!  The trailers and commercials say “They should have left him alone.” And I say: Thank goodness they didn’t!!!  The movie rules!  It has a good length, and you do not wish it were any shorter. It moves at a fast pace with unexpected happenings around most all corners.  Special effects are normal as are the fight scenes… but what makes it very good is that they are … pretty real.  Matt Damon as Jason Bourne does his kick-butt amnesiac super-CIA agent role in which he does nothing out of the ordinary… well… for a CIA Super agent that he is.         Matt Damon as Jason Bourne    The movie is shot in India, Germany, Russia, and USA. Chase scenes are sweet, with such nice camera angles that you believe you are at the passenger’s seat… ohhh yeahhhh I could feel my eyes popping out every time there was a 360-degree spin.  Some people may get a little confused, a little nauseous – just as if you were in the chase yourself. ^_^ The main chase is so good that pretty much it is at the same level as the chase scenes from  urlLink Gone In 60 Seconds  or  urlLink The Italian Job  (mini coupers are soooo cute).               And if car crashing scenes aren’t your thing… then do it for this guy: ^_~ You will see this young actor in movies such as  urlLink The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King . He played Eomer, the Rohan Warrior… you know, Eowyn’s brother… (she kills the most powerful of the Undead Evil Kings in the 3rd movie because   She’s No Man  ).                 Wow Looks different, no?              Karl Urban as Kirlill;     Go watch  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy . GO GO!

        Yesh me likes it a lot.  You get a nice little catalog to your door; samples of the new stuff, if you don't know much about their items you can always ask the local representative to give you some. You place your order with your rep and 2 weeks later you get your items delivered to your door. It's just great.  Of course... only buy from catalogs when you are not in desperate need of the products... so gotta make sure you're not close to the last drop of make-up when you order.  Two weeks without blush... eeeckkk!    My favorite stuff from Avon are its hair products. The oil treatments are wonderful.  They leave your hair shiny, soft, and smelling sweet.  Eye shadows, eye liners, and nail polish are a few of the other products I buy from the catalog. I stick to earth tones, and the occasional frosty pink or violet for the eyes, but brown and golden suit me best.  Lipsticks have to be golden, sand, light coffee, anything light brown to natural lip color. I do not feel I look good with red, oranges, or bright pinks - my lips are not thick enough... and they're crooked so those colors make it too obvious ~_~.   See piccie on profile  Nail polish colors: clear, clear with sprinkles, tan, light brown, mauve rose, those tones that are not too obvious, but that still show a little if you pay close attention.      Pretty color!      So very me    A couple of fragrances are good too, but I don't buy fragrances from Avon often, except for the aromatherapies - Avon has some nice orchid and lavender ones. When I buy my perfumes, I only get one, which does not happen to be an Avon one.  It's a perfume I have been wearing since the teenage years. It mixes very well with my skin and my natural scent.  I do not give out my perfume brand. ^_^ Wouldn't want the whole world smelling yummy like me!  Too bad it is getting more and more difficult to find. So I guess I better start trying out new fragrances.  I tried patchouli once... nice but not me.  I also bought this bottle of Acqua di Gio for women... it smells wonderfully on other people. With me it's just too sweet, but darn it, I paid close to 70 bucks for it so I have to wear it from time-to-time.  Oh yes. And I used to sell Avon when I started college. ^_^  I would make nice little comissions ranging in the 100s.  Paid for books and gas for a semester with this part-time job.  I no longer do it, though; I do not like to order things for people when I don't get the money up front. Hehehe. You can't always trust that everyone will have money to pay for everything they order once it gets here.

          I am almost done with a project, remember that one I put some pseudo for? Yes, that one.&nbsp; I am missing the shop entrance for the cart.&nbsp; Hmmm… I am slacking a bit on that one.  &nbsp;  I have another project underway, a much smaller one. Yes, I know I said I would not do any others but my it’s like a favor.&nbsp; My dad asked me to do it for an acquaintance of his, so how can I say no to that?&nbsp; It will be a small little site, just to quickly summarize what the industry does, etc. Something sweet and to the point so I should not have much problems. I have basically finished it… except that it’s empty.&nbsp; I need to get the ‘meat’ from the company so that I can input all the text into my layouts.&nbsp; So me’sa waitin’!&nbsp;     &nbsp;Colors chosen are shadow green (or so I call it that), hazy blue, and red. A border company that houses 3500+ employees, so it’s gotta be borderly-like.&nbsp; No database programming… unless I want to be mean. But I don’t, so I’ll keep it at simple HTML and stuff.

        Dear Friend,   sounds a bit generic infomercial to me, but alright...    This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met.  I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium .As you  read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone  will die someday.    Ahum, well if you don't know me really you could not be contacting me any other way. Now get to the point!    My name is HAKEEM SADIQ, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I  have been diagnosed with prostate and  esophageal Cancer that was discovered  very late  due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has  defiled  all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live  according to medical  experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really  cared for  anyone not even myself but  my business.   Boo hoo... that must suck.   Though I am very rich, I was never  generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my  business as that  was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know  that  there is more to life than just wanting to   have or make all the money in the world.   ... and that's why you got the cancers...   I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I  would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my  time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one  of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some  charity organizations in the U.A.E,  London and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members  of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have  there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to  themselves.   Well, family needs money too. Isn't it good to give money to people you know and love as opposed to total strangers who won't give a damn where the money came from?   Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the  huge cash deposit that I have with Financial Firm Abroad .I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let  them know that it is I HAKEEM  SADIQ  that is making this generous donation.   So you don't trust family members... but you trust Me, a total stranger. Riiight okay.    I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my  time to come.   I didn't know doctors allowed laptops inside rooms, but even if they did... ever heard of wire-transfers?  I know you're using the Internet, otherwise I would not have gotten the e-mail.     I pray that God  uses you to support and assist me with good heart    God be with you. HAKEEM  SADIQ.   NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the task is accomplished as I dont want anything that will Jeopadize my last wish. and Also I will be contacting with you by email as I dont want anybody to know cos they are always around me. Do endavour to send your phone as well as your fax  for easy communication.   Umm... No.

        Mexico defeats Ecuador 2-1 and for the first time passes to the next round without a single defeat and 1st of it's group.   GROUP B - POINTS  Mexico - 7 Argentina - 6 Uruguay - 4 Ecuador - 0  The game overall was okay.  It was almost one-sided and seemed easy.  By the first half Mexico had already scored 2 goals and the game was going down in pace.  Goal 1 was a giveaway because the ref counted a penalty against Ecuador when it truly wasn't one (not like I'm complaining... :d gave Mexico the advantage.)  The 2nd goal cam on minute 42, near the end of the first half, Mexican player Bofo completely gets rid of the men tracking him, nobody guarded him, gets the pass and strikes with a right leg slamming that ball into the net.  Ecuador's goal came on minute 26, it was a nice two-man play, finished with a head shot, there was nothing for Mexican goalie to do, it was a very well executed goal.  Mexico's play could have been a little more aggressive, while Ecuador's could be said that it was the best they played in the entire cup.  Now on to the next round... We either play Paraguay or Chile, I'm not too sure...

        >_  The next game I watched was Argentina and Ecuador.  >_  So yeah, we’re waiting for the Saturday game, Mex-Argentina, and Ecuador-Uruguay.  Then it will be Mex-Ecuador, which should (BIG SHOULD) be the easy game.  Ecuador, while not the greatest in technicality has very physically powerful players.  Tall, fast, rough.  Finally, Argentina-Uruguay.  This is definitely the Death group of the cup, Group B.  As my sister says: The final will be played this Saturday: Argentina-Mexico.  Argentina will go out to get Mex and Mex will go out to kill Argentina or they won’t make it to the next level.  We are really hoping to see these 2 play again in the Final.  ^_^ Mex should win it.  Anyway, Paraguay plays against Costa Rica tomorrow and afterwards Brasil-Chile… uff. Nice nice nice games – I hope.  Sometimes we the fans get such disappointments.  The players come to these cups, wanting to take care of themselves too much.  They don’t want to run fast, kick far, or slide hard.  And yes, while we do not wish to see them get injured and then completely miss them on the bigger cup (the World Cup) we don’t want to watch mediocre football either.

Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.  51 TO 60 POINTS: Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, one who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.   41 TO 50 POINTS: Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.   31 TO 40 POINTS : Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful and practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest. Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return.  Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.   21 TO 30 POINTS : Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder. It would really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.   UNDER 21 POINTS: People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisi ve, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions and who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything! They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist. Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't.

        Hubby dropped me off at mom's early today.  I was reading 'Bloody Bones' by Laurell K. Hamilton (Anita Blake Series) until I heard my mom and sis waking up.  We ate cereal and watched soaps for a bit and then I started cleaning the house.  The usual stuff: dishes, vacuuming, washing toilets, sinks, clothes, no mopping today... mom didn't have pine sol and I didn't want to use soapy water. I was afraid that I wouldn't rinse it out completely fromt he floors, especially the bathrooms, and that she may slip.  Sis took care of the lunch.  She made rice, beef with veggies, and then more veggies. yum yum.  More dishes.  Well, we took mom shopping after that. She now has pine sol... well, Fabuloso, a Mexican brand for floor cleaner. It smells great and is what I use at my own house. ^_^  I use it for everything, floors, commodes, sinks, tubs, the kitty's litter box, man it's great, economic, and the bottle lasts for month and months.  I gotta love Mexican products.  Got back to her house, watched a movie, Hubby and Dad got back home and then Hubby and I left.  He took me to eat at a Mexican restaurant and then I went to the beauty salon to get a haircut.  hehehe... can you say 80s punk rocker?  It's SPIKEY!!!

        Mom was released today!  Doc came over to see her again at around 8:30 am and said all was aaa-okay!  Said that she was super healthy, in good shape and that all the nurses said that all she did was walk around over and over and over.  Yeah, you would think she didn't have a 6-inch slice on her abdomen!    Gaw, that's when we see how much her training helps her.  Have I ever mentioned that mom is a half-marathon runner?  Gaw, she runs 3-5 miles daily, and that's for mere training.    ^_^   We left the hospital at around noon.  I stayed with her at the house until hubby got out from work.  I made sure to clean her house and all so that she could be comfortable.

        Alrighty. I got a call from Hubby at around 7am and he let me know that their plane back had been delayed due to bad weather conditions. Originally Hubby and Bashma were supposed to leave the Philadelphia airport at around 8 something but all flights were delayed by 2 ½ hours, approximately.  Uff.    So the plan to pick them up by 1 at the Harlingen airport was off. I would wait until they called me from Houston so that I would leave to pick them up. At around 2pm my husband called and said that they had just arrived to Houston and that they would arrive in Brownsville, not Harlingen. Since their first plane was delayed so much, they missed their connection flight in Houston and they were given another plane, which luckily made its flight all the way to Brownsville. All good for me!  Harlingen is another city about 40-some minutes away, and we live in Brownsville so that would work nice.  He told me that they were scheduled to arrive at around 3:45pm, so I left home close to 3pm.  At that airport I found out that the flight from Houston-Brownsville had been delayed as well and was running about 25 minutes late.  Okay, no problem… everybody was waiting and waiting. Finally it arrived at 4:10pm.    My niece stretched up so much!  She’s about a foot taller… and she’s not 10 or 11. She is actually 9!  Ooops.  Heheh. I received her with a small baggie with a teddy bear and drawing utensils: sketch pad, markers, color pencils, Disney No. 2 pencils, Disney blue and black ink pens, rulers, glue, and Barbie and Hello Kitty stickers. All materials swiped from mom’s home. Heheheh.  She’s got her garage full of notebooks, pens, pencils, markers, PRISMACOLOR pencils (wow… I was like… WOW… each set is worth so much and she has like boxes full).    Well, next we go to pick up the luggage…  the belt goes and goes… and goes and goes… and goes and goes… but no luggage.  Seems that in the change and re-change of flights, the luggage were sent somewhere else.  Hubby’s got all his stuff at home… but Bashma was only wearing what she had on.  Ehhh.    Oh wells.  We went home, ate some byrianni that Hubby’s mom made (nicely packaged in topper ware, which husband carried with him in the plane).  Then my husband had to take a nap while Bashma and I watched cartoons. We have the same taste in shows. ^_^  So after my parents came over (they came from Laredo and before going to their house they stopped at ours to say hi to Bashma), gave me some pillows and cases for Bashma and then headed to their home.  Zulfiker, Bashma and I went shopping for some pajamas and a change of clothes for her, while we got her luggage back.  A couple of hours later we received a call that the airport had located the bags and they would be delivering them to us at around 11pm.  ANNNDDDDD the people from the airport just knocked on the door… it’s 12:21am… Well, better late (or early!) than never!    I’m out.
