      I'm bored so I'm now going to rip on people that have stupid car decorations -If a see a girl with a license plate cover that says "princess"- there are 9 to 1 odds that she's gonna be fat.  Now thats not me talking, that's the satistics talking. Princess of what Hostess?  -If I see a girl with a license plate cover that says "daddy bought it but i got it"  there are 9 to 1 odds that she's gonna be stuck up.    - What the heck is with "spinners"?  Ok I get it, you paid three times as much as I did for rims that spin an unnecissary amount.  And thats retarded.  eeeeewwwwwww, look it, the wheel is spinning but they aren'g going anywhere.  Big friken deal.  Couldnt you have spent the money on something else like a college education or something?

      All right- so on May 5th, I was driving to school and this car in fron of me started to swerve back and forth.  I was like "Looks like someones drinko-de-mayo started a little early."  Regardless, I wasn't gonna stay right behind a crappy driver, so I decide to go around it.  I'm driving around it and look... It wasnt a drunk person, it was a stupid girl doing her make up!!! I was like "I know how important it is to look good for Jonny's football game honey, but you gotta do that crap some place else."  Im thinking that they should count people that do make-up while they drive as just a serious of offence as a DUI.  What he heck it up with people.

      Why do I try? Why do I care?  What if I'm like the other guy next to me, looking to the cross and going to church so I look good and "normal"-whatever that is.  I used to struggle with this and then I realize- that is what separates true believers from people that are living in the world still.  We could be going to church performing miracles in Gods name and not necessarily doing anything wrong in our fellow mans eyes and not be Christian.  A true Christian doesn't do things so he can fell better about himself he does it for the glory of God.  He doesn't walk around all tough because he does the "right things", he admits that he's not perfect and that's why he seeks gods help.  So many times many of these 'cosmetic Christians" have made me doubt my faith.  We need to seek God.  Not the right actions.  This is why I care- for the glory of God- Gloria a Dios.

      faith, mmmmmm.  I used to struggle with the fact that I thought that Christianty was a uniquely western thing, and since I was a westerner that it was just another fascet of my culture that explains how I behave.  It caused me to question everything: my beliefs, my prayer... basically it flipped my world upside down.  I have to ask myself, "what makes me different, being a Christian, than the next guy? Is that what I'm supposed to do because I am an American"  I questioned this for days.  It was actually the most agonizing three days of my life.  Eventually I learned that Christianity had something different than everything else, first, I didnt have to actually do anything for it, just recieve it.  and two, I have a tangeble thing that non-Christians don't have, the Holy Spirit.  Finally my evidence.   My point in writing that is most christians that go to church all their life, or at least call themselves Christians, don't come to this conclusion.  Then I started thinking thamaybe what I percieve as Chrisitanity is what a lot of people percieve.  I'm under this crazy idea that maybe, just maybe, we are supposed to be living by the spririt and trying to glorify God.  Through this, then we prove God to others, through what the Holy spirit has done through our lifes.  I started looking at what God has done to some of my "On-fire" Chrisitan friends and that was my proof.  Some of them, there was no damn way that they would change accept for love of God.  So how Chrisitan is societies "Chrisitian"?  This is where I began to truely realize that things arent nearly what they seem and there is the higher struth out there.  Sorta like in the Matrix, accept I didnt fallow any rabit, and Im not even close to learning Kung-Foo.

      The most amazing and unbeleivable part about this is that a youth pastor said this.&nbsp; Maybe he was racist or just enjoyed saying extremely stupid and uneducated things (which would be funny because he had a Masters in Divinity).&nbsp; This is the gem that came out of his mouth: "I can't believe it.&nbsp; Black people are faster, funnier, and way more athletic.&nbsp; I think they where put on this earth&nbsp;to entertain us."&nbsp; This is by far one of the stupidest things that came out of anybodies mouth.&nbsp; His attitude toward black people is reflected in his youth group.&nbsp; Out of 200 kids, there is maybe 4 or 5 black kids.&nbsp; mmm, but thats funny, none of them are singing or doing any other form of entertainment.&nbsp; I guess they aren't the side-show that&nbsp;he thought they were.&nbsp;

Do a Triathalon, maybe Ironman. 5. Go streaking on a cold night. 6. Be an effective teacher or whatever I'm meant to do with my life. 7. Watch "Chariots of Fire". 8. Visit the Subway Lounge in Jackson, Mississippi. 9. Go to a Super Bowl (Hopefully with the 49ers playing in it) 10. Share Christ with BOLDNESS with more people, but not while streaking.

      If I were stranded on an island these are the top 5 movies that I would bring with me.  These aren't all necessarily the deepest movies, just the ones I can watch over and over again. They also aren't in any particular order of "favorites".    1.  BIG FISH- this movie is extremely wierd yet captivating.  It has to be one of the most creative movies ever made.  At the same time it also had multiple deep messages that one can only get if they think out side the box.   2.  TOP GUN- This is the first movie i ever bought.  I know I can watch this movie over and over because I have while growing up.  The sadist part is that it never gets old.  Cheezy? absolutly.  It also has slightly homoerotic themes while it can only laugh at, but it is a great movie that I am glued to when ever its on.    3.  ABOUT A BOY-  This movie hardly makes anybodies list, at least not any Ameircans.  It is extremely British, and Hugh Grant plays his usual "I'm a shallow British playboy who suddenly discovers a higher meaning of life."  Its dry and friken hallarious.  Plus- every time I watch it- I speak in a slight British accent, even if I try not to.  4.  BILLY MADISON- The Panguin alone can make the list.  This whole movie is filled with random pointless jokes that make my stomach hurt from laughing.  I swear every scene is memorable.  How can this movie not make my list?  5.  ROCKY IV-  This, like Top Gun,  I grew up watchin over and over again, so its also time tested.  I sing along to the 80's beats and I am still on the edge of my seet in the last fight.  I only hope my mother doesn't walk in when I'm shaddow boxing, pretending that I'm betting up the Russian.  Movies that came close- Momento, Orange County, The Power Of One, and The Program.

      1. Dashboard Confessional Fans- The band isn't so great but the fans I can't stand.  They cant be anywhere at any time on any occassion- if they hear a Dashboard song they will sing along. (and most of them are completely tone def!)  The worst part is when they close their eyes and sing along (also usually accompanied with crying).   I just wanna throw something at them and laugh when they do that.  I just pray that I never have to drive next to a Dashboard fan on the highway because that is an imediate threat to my life if they close their eyes.  2.  When people leave songs on their voice mail message.  I hate this.  Yesterday I had to put up with this for like over 2 minutes.  I can somewhat stand maybe ten seconds but not the whole freaking song.  If any of you does this, trust me, NOBODY wants to hear the new song for whatever crappy band you listen to.  We just wanna leave you a message so dont punish us.  3.  Seperatist Christians. By this I mean the Christians that say that in order to be saved you must: not watch rated "R" movies, be republican, only listen to Christian music, and have absolutely NO non-Christian influinces.  Get real.. How are people going to know the message if you stay in your freaking bubble, just because you might get contaminated.  We learn by messing up, not trying to be perfect.  And putting a buber sticker on your car isn't evangalism.  4. Ann Coulture- By far one of the most annying things in the world.  People like this is why other countries hate us.    5. Youth pasters that are more obsessed with being cool not the gospel (they would usually fail at the "cool" part anyways).  I don't want to be asked one more time if "You down with G-O-D? yeah you know me."  I couldn't stand it when they used to tell us that we needed to be listening to cool "christian bands", that were usually second class rock bands.     6.  Ralph Nader.  This guy is a jerk.  Enough is enough.

      I have something to confess, and some might consider it a sin.  I'm a Democrat.  Yes, I said the "d" word.  It has come to my attention that many people that go to church and some that go to my church believe that in order to be a "good" Christian- you have to be a Republican.  Many of these Jerry Folwell types go as far as to label any non- Republican a sinner.   first of all- I all ways thought that Politics was something that has, more than anything else, split up brothers and sisters in Christ. I distinctly remember one time having a conversation with my pastor, at the time.  He started talking about politics.  We had never talked about politics before so he never knew my "southpaw" tendencies when it came to politics.  He said "Oh, you are into politics? What party are you?  Wait wait, I don't even know why I ask caus' if you're a Christian, you must be a Republican."  Now, I always knew that there was always a right leaning tendency when it came to the church- especially Baptists, but I didn't it was to the ridiculous point to where one's faith would be questioned if they weren't a Republican.  I believe this is why our founding fathers had a separation between church and state.  They didn't want to the two inner-mingling because, has history has shown as a fine record, things an an often get really ugly.  This is why I don't talk about politics in church, because church is a place for fellowships with fellow believers- where you worship, love and pray with one another.  It is not time, nor should it be, a platform for Republican or Democrats.  Christ never talked about platform politics.  He talked about loving each other and being a devout follower of God.    Also, unlike many of my American counterparts, I do not think that the GOP equals GOD.  There are a lot of things that I find wrong in both parties, so I'm not saying that Democrats are angels.  So it is not tha I think that the Democrats are truly the ritcheous party, because I don't agree with everything that the Democrats do.  But if you were to put all the issues out on the table (i.e. abortion, taxes, social programs, gay rights, war policy, trade policy, education etc.)- I definitely with out a doubt have more issues over all that I agree with the Democrats on.  In reality I am more of a "center left" person.  Sometimes I totally agree with Republicans.  But for the most part I am shamelessly with out a doubt a Democrat.
