      OK I'm not supposed to be on blogger but oh well. Heather hasn't been on here in a while and she can't get on every day like I -almost always- can so, I'm officially back ahead of scheduale. Candy wants to be interviewed, but she's on vacation. -_- so we'll pick that up next month when she gets back.  ~Cara~

      u know u missed me! So, "our" first interview was with Sahara Stewglimer, of California. I think we should interview Samantha Holdenburg next, since she's become so popular so quickly. Don't you think? Come by next time when we will have the 411 on one of our dearest friends. And now a word from our sponsors:   ".........................................................."   I think we need to get some sponsors... yeah we'll get right on that. o:)  ~Cara~

      ... well  not really. But what I mean is that HEATHER is  on her own  on this talk-show all weekend! B/c obviously I won't be in town. U all already know this so I won't bore you w/ details *again*. I know you're getting tired of it. Yeah OK so,    Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow. That I shall say goodnight, 'til it be morrow...  I'm taking a cue from Skye Sweetnam when I say, "4get Billy S.!!!" Ok well, Heather, the show's yours for the rest of the weekend. I'll be back either late Sunday or on Monday. Tell u what I'll make it Monday so u can have a full weekend! ::blows kisses:: Luv ya, miss ya,   SEE YA!!!    ~Cara~

       ::really annoying 6'o'clock news music plays loudly::   Good evening and welcome to the very first episode of BackTalk, the talk-show that covers all the really "important" aspects of a teenage girl's life. This is Cara reporting alone, because my co-host Heather is not yet aware that we are on air. Sometime in the next few days we will be fully up and running. ((WOW don't I sound official... commence eye-rolling... now)) HA well, until I confer with Heather, I really have nothing 2 say 2 any1 I guess. So, TTYL! Byeness!  ~Cara~   The first episode of BackTalk was brought to you by: 2grrls. Also known as Cara & Heather. Tune in next time for an actual discussion ((!)) on BackTalk.
