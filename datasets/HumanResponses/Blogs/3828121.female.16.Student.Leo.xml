      i'm so sleepy. no one decided to wake me up today, so i slept til one.  i have to start waking up at a decent time. i hate the feeling that you slept all day and wasted it. and since we all know i have no life when night falls, well.....the daylight is sacred.  i have to unpack today. i have to say, that is the only part i wasn't looking forward to about home. but i'm glad i'm back! my own room, my own bed, my own stuff. my own kitchen with my own food. bwahahaha....and we HAVE food here. *no offense caitlan*  but, i suppose i need to go and actually get dressed and pull myself together....i look pretty scary upon first waking up. and all i've done this morning is talk to people online and thumb through a seventeen....i lead such an eventful life, don't i? lol

      2:07 a.m.....can't sleep....too hyper...  i read sam's latest entry...nathan had me read it.  interesting. part of me can see exactly where she's coming from, being a chick and knowing the mind set. but part of me....well, part of me is pissed off at the whole thing. some of her comments...i dunno...   She claims he'll regret it when he's with "some girl he doesn't want to be with and he'll cry when he sees her with guy." and she deosn't know how he can "just throw away people."  no he won't, he'll be with me....and no one throws me away....HA! but i know she's just venting and it makes you feel better, but....i am not some girl, by God.  She claims that everything about him is fake, and he deos things only to look cool.  then why didn't you say something or stay with him if it was that bad?   "and he made me feel like i treated him horribly: and I didnt ...I didn;t : he needs attention constantly, he needs to be the center of attention.. either by being way too hyper, or way to depressed : and when people get in the way of what he wants to be and who he wants to be he ditches them: and here I am, ditched: and I do not have to feel like this: he called me fat before, he cheated on me.. and I felt like I treated him wrong.... what was i thinking?: my self esteem dropped so low when i was with him: he made me feel like i couldnt talk to my guy friends because i was giving them more attention than him and that was bad: I was jelous when i was with him, i was unhappy when I was with him."  i can see exactly where nathan would come off as needy....i really could....but....my stars....you didn't have to dote on him all the time. you didn't have to give him the attention. i know i sure as heck won't. if i want to go somewhere with david or one of my guy friends, i will. he can be upset. no one ever said she had to put up with it. and if you were so unhappy, why didn't you leave? i bail out or "ditch" people when i'm unhappy. but then again, i can see where she's coming from if she loved him. i wouldn't bail out on anthony for anything, and he made me feel like i was nothing. but she didn't have to but up with it.  see, if i were in this situation, knowing myself, i would prolly feel the same way. but since i'm not, and i like nathan, i'm just kidna like, suck it up, move on, there's other people out there. but she didn't have to be used as she said...just b/c you love somebody does not mean you have to let them use you. i learned that the hard way. and i've done my share of using. and neither scenerio is good. but i'm going to try and change his insecureness. i told him that we were going to be different from he and her's relationship. but if he's not secure enough on his own, then maybe he doesn't need a relationship....but like i said....changing all of that.....  but ya know, thinking about it, he says he stressed out partly b/c of her...why? i can see where she still calls him...but why does he even bother to read her journal? he knows it will only stress him. *anger* see, my reason is right here. i don't want to go out with him until this whole thing with her and him stops. i'm already all pissed off as it is.....and we're not even going out....

      hmm....what did i do today? nothing!  actually, i went to the mall. i got a free pair of undies form victoria secret. *happy little pony*. altho, i did get quite depressed wen walking into the bra section at jc pennys. i picked up this bra that looked absolutely huge, like the cup size was just unbelievable....that is, until i put it up next to me. covered me very very little. i almost cried. i hate my "blessings". no 16 yr old should be as big as me. *sigh*  then, for bethanie's 10th birthday we went to Chuck E. Cheese. i actually had fun. the little warning signs on the  "ticket muncher" amuse me. did you know you weren't supposed to put your hair in those things? yea, i got a new wrinkle in my brain tonight. *snicker snicker*.  but, alas, i gave my tickets to my brother, so i didn't get some cheap horrible prize. i'll prolly have to have therapy now b/c i didn't get a crappy prize. *sigh*

      well, i went out with nathan tonight.  nothing too extravagant. no ballroom dancing, nothing like that. we went to eat. twas good. food is always good.  came back to my house. played this game that made me feel like a total moron. I swear, if i had to hear about Detective Shadow or Sim Shady or Sam Spade one more time....ugh....and i lost too. and we know how sara gets when she loses, lol. no actually, i was good about it. for once.  but, i guess that's really it. nothing really happened after the game. watched cartoons. took him home. now i'm eating and writing this. and talking to him on teh internet. fun fun.

      eh.....first day a cheer camp....i feel like someone beat me with a baseball bat, like 20 friggin times. it even hurts to lift my arms enough to type this. meh.  but it was fun. alot more fun that going to camp in fayetteville and having like 10 other squads there, and all the girls are smiling and wanting to play little sally walker a million times. i thought i was going to kill them all.  i got my slipknot tix today. *happy baby pony* pit, at that. i thought that the pit would be all gone, but it wasn't. tehee.  ha....mom made up a new word today. she tried to call me a skank and.....i don't remember....but another insult, and it came out "skantch." it twas funny.  the inside of my thighs feel like someone is taking to muscle and pulling it as hard as they can. it hurts...*sniffle*  i want to go hang out with nathan tomorrow, but i don't think i can. i think we're going to shelly's after camp, and then i'll come home and have to go take a shower and all that. *sniffle* but i miss my nathan...i want to see him...i haven't seen him in like....3 days. and i don't like it.  ok....i can't believe i just said those words.....it's official, i like him. *cheesey smile*   but, anywaz, i'm off to babysit.

      i must take some pills! i need to go to sleep fairly early tonight. I have to be at the school at 8:30 tomorrow morning. meh....the earliest I've woken up all summer was 6:00 am to get in the car to leave denver, only to fall right back asleep. but i can't sleep. from 9am to 4pm, it's nothing but running, jumping, stunting, cheering, dancing, and smiling. oh joy.  nathan got his hair cut. i really really really want to see it. he said he got 7 inches taken off in some places, so i'm a curious little pony.   i think i like him. hehe...guess it's not much of an improvement, but i'ts better than "i'm pretty sure i think i like him" or whatever i posted before.  the only thing is, i'm hoping that in my pain of being a single a year, and wanting a boyfriend so bad, that i'm not jumping at the first oppurtunity to say that i'm no longer single, and that i truly like him and want to be with him. that i don't just want to be able to be secure and say i'm taken. know what i'm saying? did that make any sense? it did to me, but i'm not the best at translating the thoughts in my brain into words. *sigh*  but i still won't kiss him....tehehe *wink*

      this has got to be one of the top ten worst days in my history of bad days.   so my mom finally talks me into going to see the notebook with her and heather. i wanted to read the book first. but, against my better judgment, i went with them anywaz.   horribly sad movie. i cried almost the whole time. then, in the middle of the movie, i suddenly got the thought "i hope shawn and ashley aren't here." i didn't know where it came from, and it was extremely random, so i dismissed it quickly.   as we were getting up to leave, i felt like such a girl, b/c i had tears streaming down my face still. i told heather and mom they had better not ever tell my guy friends about this, or i'd kill them. i'm exiting the theater, and i hear this low "sara". i turn around to see shawn and ashley. but it's not shawn. it's the preppy clean-cut person i dunno. all the sudden i lost my breath and felt like collapsing in the floor. it literally felt like someone had taken my heart of my chest, filled it with pointy, sharp objects, and stuck it back into me.   thank God i was already crying b/c of the movie. i kept my head down and didn't let either of them see me dying. i didn't even say much to them.  to make matters worse, i walk out of the elevator, and see david and reid satnding there. so i saw my (thought was old and tired and dead) crush and his perfect perky girlfriend and my best guy friend and my other guy friend. all the while, black mascara and eyeliner is polluting my face.  i don't know what went wrong there, but i was totally fine with their relationship about a month after they started dating. i don't know what happened to me in there. i guess it was seeing him totally different. that's not the person i saw on the last day of school.   don't get me wrong, i love ashley to death. she's way too adorable to hate. believe me, i've tried. but i don't like the person he is when she's around....i bet he won't even go to slipknot....  once again, i dunno why it hurt me so bad. it's not like he's the same person i started liking in the first place....he's someone's toy and someone i don't know....

      Nathan's online! yay! *happy little pony*   jeez, i don't think i've ever been that happy to see anyone sign on in a long time.  I'm still not totally sure of what my feelings for him are yet. I'm kinda confuzed. I think i'm pretty sure i like him. does that make ANY sense? "i think i'm pretty sure"? well, it does to me, so deal with it!  *sigh* the only thing is, i don't think my mommy would approve of it. it's another shawn situation. my mom had no problem with shawn, but she had a problem with me dating him. i think that's going to be the case with nathan. that's why i plan to take no action on this crush for a long while yet. atleast not until she kinda sorta forgets the whoel reason i wasn't talking to him....she's nto as forgiving as i am, and i'm a ruthless B.  oh well.....it wouldn't be the first time i've dated someone she didn't like. but hopefully she'll learn to like him...but it won't matter for a while, b/c, like i said, i won't be dating him anytime soon....  well, i guess i'm going to talk to him some more...*smile*

      you must be kidding me.....on the little box of hair dye it says "put a quarter-sized spot of hair color on the inside of your elbow to make sure you're not allergic to it" or something like that....mom actually said she was going to make me do it.   screw that, matey  one, i bought the hair color so i could dye my hair TONIGHT. secondly, you must be crzy if you think i'm going to walk around with another huge brownspot on my arm. i already have my birthmark, thank you...  *angry little pony*   why does my mother have to abide by the rules? they're only purpose is to be broken....well, not really...but they are in this case

But it was very tiring and very very hot. not a fun way to spend fourth of july  then, mom and me went to the store. we bought some fireworks. i dunno knwo why, b/c neither of us really care for them.  I went by Best Buy to get the new Breaking Benjamin cd. It was on sale for $6.99....of course, i get up there and they're sold out. *angry little pony* and the stock boy said that when they get more in, they'll be like $15 or something *livid little pony!* yea, sara deosn't pay that much for ANY cd, no matter how bad she wants it.  but their was a REALLY fine guy in the parking lot...*smile*  we're going to dye my hair tonight. back to dark brown. yay! no more blonde!!!!

      i made it last night. woo-hoo! that was the friggin awesome-est comcert i have ever been to. there are no words.  God Forbid was pretty good. last night was the first time I'd ever heard any of their stuff. Hatebreed, a pit broke out, and i got knocked around a bit. I thought I'd lost Shawn and Billy, but I found them again. that scared me. I was like, omg, I'm alone now. but if I'd only known what was to come, that would have been the least of my worries.  Slayer was when I got pretty much all my injuries. I got impaled in the side with someone's spike bracelet. I have a minor cut and bruise now. Shawn elbowed me in the boob, then hit me in the nose with his shoulder. Somebody grabbed onto my boob, and absolutely would not let go. i finally managed to escape.  i also got punched in the mouth, which caused me to bite my lip, whihc caused me to bleed.  but Slipknot...oh beloved Slipknot. yes, during the first song, i totally lost Billy, and i pretty much got "effed up the a" by someone behind me. I'm pretty sure I know who it was, but....yea....something was ramming itself into me, and it was pretty weird. i lost Shawn by the end of the second song. I could see him most of the time, but I couldn't get to him, so I gave up. then this 30 or 40 year old guy kept putting his arms around me like I was his girlfriend or something. it was a little freaky. but yea. I could tell Shawn was having a good time. I'm glad he went.  Next time anyone like that comes thru here, I'm taking him with me. He's fun to be around. and I realized how much I'd missed him over summer. but yes, it was great. except when i got home. I couldn't sleep b/c i hurt so bad. it sucked. but still, it was worth it.  JOEY JORDISON...........*drool*  oh yes, and i saw Jimmy, John's brother. he was bleeding out his mouth, but he was smiling. I was kinda like whoa.....  but yes it was highly enjoyable. i was dehydrated by the time the night was finished, but i didn't care. i was the happiest person in the world last night....

      omg, i love that song. i have been listening to it, until the day i die, and she will be loved all morning. i'm turning into an emo lover! stop me! hurry,quick, put on some disturbed! oh well...  i have come to realize i am not a writer. i am, when it comes to poetry. but even that sucks. but i mean...i was reading some other people's blogs and diaries. i write like i would talk. like, if i were speaking to you right now, this is what i would say exactly.  some other people....well, i know some of them really do talk like that, but it's like other's try to incrediably hard to sound smart of elegant or something. and i'm left thinking, who talks like that, honestly? *who throws a cupcake? honestly?* hehehehe  well, that, but it also sounds really good, and brought me to the conclusion that i'm not a writer. i can't go into vivid detail. in my opinion, you should just have a imagination. that's much more fun anyways. but they go into detail with things, but subtlely.....and they use big words to do it. or even small words with complex meanings. what is the point of that? you're writing how you feel, so why try to make it into this big intelligent thing? people prolly don't read my blog for lack of details and anything exciting, but that's alright. i'm writing what i'm feeling and using generic terms to do it. so i mean.....meh....but yes, i'm not a writer. well.....rephrase....i'm not an exciting/cultured writer. i'm me. but sometimes i guess i wish i could be. i wish i could describe things in tasteful manners and make complete sense. when i try to describe things, oyu have to think about it for a minute. b/c it makes perfect sense to me, but i'm not usually on the same wavelenght with people......  *sigh*  vino's tonight. temper effect is playing. *drool* Devin*drool* he is such an awesome singer. and incrediably hot. *drool some more* i love "plans to murder." i love that song. you all should check the video out. it's at a live show, that i happened to be at that night.  urlLink www.tempereffect.com  oh yes, and check out the pics of them. you'll see what i'm talking about. major hottie.....*sigh* now it would be great if i could just meet him....  yea, like that'll ever happen.....  but anywaz.....i suppose i'll go....

      i'm amazed at how quickly i can jump from subject to subject. i just posted that last one, like what, 4 or 5 minutes ago? oh well, i'm special.  yes, in a desperate attempt to block out their anger, i just started thinking about things. little things, big things, you name it. i realize that i have never had a healthy relationship with a boy. i think that i never will. either i've been treated badly, or i've been treated very good. too good.  i already knew to some extent, but now i really know that i sabotage things. subconsciously at first. but when i catch myself, i start really thinking of ways to break up with the guy. i don't know why exactly. i think that b/c i've been treated badly by most of my ex's, that i have wound up thinking that that is the way i am supposed to be treated. and when a guy treats me well, i don't know what to do. it embarrasses me for some reason, but then i end up being embarrassed for the poor guy. but when i'm treated like i should be, (yes that's right, should be, i'm a damn princess and don't you forget it) i think that there's something wrong. that there's a catch. that if i let myself become too fond of them, they will do something to hurt me. and why not? everyone else has. but then, when i find a guy that isn't really nice to me at all, i find myself clinging to them. "falling in love" in two seconds.  and how do i know i sabotage? like, take mitchell for instance. like, when i started being unhappy, i got really mean towards him, hoping he'd get sick of it and dump me first. so i wouldn't have to feel bad. but that's how you know you have a good guy.when you can treat him like he means nothing to you and he still sticks with you. unfortunately, i didn't want him to stick with me. so, after i realized what i was doing, i started looking for any little flaw in him. anything i could catch him on that would give me good enough reason to break up with him. of course, i couldn't find one. then came the night nathan spent the night with philip. i didn't plan for that to happen, i swear. it just did. but afterwards, while thinking, i realized that that was my excuse. that i was bad and i shouldn't be with mitchell b/c i'd cheated on him. of course, i have no balls and couldn't tell him. i just broke up with him for no apparent reason. but i had every intention of telling him. only someone, who will remain nameless, told him first. and yes i know who you are. mitchell didn't tell me, but i know. and i will get you back for that some day. mark me.  but, yes, that's just an example. i did the same thing to charlie, minus the cheating. poor charlie. i used him. i know i did now. before, you couldn't get me to admit that. but i did. but now i know how it feels, and i'm sorry for it. really really sorry for it. but i don't expect forgiveness outta him. i don't deserve it.  and now, with nathan. ehh.......maybe he's right about us not needing to go out right now. something still doesn't settle well with me. really doesn't. i know this, b/c i'm already sabotaging! i won't say how, just in case, but i am. i dunno why either. it's not like he treats me like the princess i am. of course, he's not the dog some of the other guys i've dated are. ok, maybe a little. i know he has a history of cheating, b/c i was involved. therefore......something does not seem right. but i don't want him to be a dog. i want to be able to like him and him not hurt me, or me not ruin everything with my scheming. but no.......something tells me that won't work. and unfortunately i'm a jealous person. i wouldn't be with him prolly if that llittle incident hadn't happened. *sigh* what you don't know won't hurt you.........but i am glad that i know. that way i can keep an eye out, and save face later. it always sucks to have someone cheating on you, and everyone knowing it but you. makes you look like an idiot. *sigh*  now that i don't have the chance, i wanna kiss him.....  damn me and my conscious! damn you conscious! damn you Jiminy Cricket!!! why?!?!?!  meh................................  my burfday is in *counts*.....mmmmmmm..................6 days! woo!  well, that was fun....but now i guess ima go. i dunno what i'm going to do....but something....i guess....  hmmm....time went by quickly....

      Gah. they're fighting again. loudly this time. i'm in the kitchen typing this, the tv's on in the living room, and i can still hear every word they have to shout at one another. *sigh*  sometime's, i wish they would just divorce. but then that would mean i would prolly have to move back to oklahoma. and that's means no more philip, nathan, mel, david, reid, caleb, richard, shawn, ashley, heather, sara, rachel, lauren, staci, chelsea, tasia, shelly, john, bryan, holly, carlie, mitchell, brittany......none of them. bye to them, hello to hell.  as much as i can't stand dennis sometimes, i'd rather be around him than those pricks from back home. atleast i can go in my room and keep away from dennis.  but yes.......i wish they're was some place i could go when they do this. like a friend's house or something. like, someone who lived very close with a car, and i could just call and they would come pick me up and take me away from this stupid house. ugh......  mom's doing most of the yelling. imagine that?  *sigh*  *it's hard to wake up when the shades have been pulled shut. This house is haunted, it's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all. i'm ripe with things to say, the words rot and fall away. if a stupid poem could fix this home, i'd read it everyday.............their anger hurts my ears.....rather than fix the problems, they never solve them, it makes no sense at all. i see them everyday. we get along so why can't they? if this is what he wants, and this is what she wants, then why's there so much pain?*  *And now she's turning off. Now he's shutting down.........These fights, they climb through my veins like it's mercury rising and these nights i seem to remember a home that was better.......this family's breaking down.....*

      well, i just got home from nathan's house. fun fun. nothing tp exciting. we "lounged" (i'm going to  eat you!) but yes. it was ok. we snuggled. nothing is as good as snuggling. and he kissed me too. *giddy-ness, massive amount of giddy-ness* i wanted to kiss back, so i did for a couple seconds, but then realized that he didn't deserve it and i told him so.  so he asked why i was kissing back. i replied that i was only being courteous and returning the favor....  .....................  and yes, as we all here know, that was the biggest friggin lie i have ever told. but i can say it on here, b/c he is tempo-rare-o-lie without the interenet, and can't read this, and when he gets it back....well....it's not like he makes it a habit to read my blog....or does he?........hmmm...........  but yes, it kinda wasn't good at the end. my bitterness got the best of me, and i almost cried. but i refrained from doing so, and i won't do it now, so....good good....but it was good to see him again....i missed him.....and i still miss him. if i could've i woulda just stayed the night there. i liked being cuddled with. twas fun......except for the fact that his face was about 2 centimeters away from mine most of the time. it makes me quite uncomfortable. but that's ok. it was worth it.....*happy little pony*  the other reason i won't kiss him is because i'm out of practice, and he's obviously had some in the last few weeks, so i know ima suck. and i know, i know, i won't get any better if i don't practice, but he just doesn't deserve it right now. and besides, we're still not going out. i don't wanna take all the fun outta it already. plus, i'm damn good at being a tease and playing hard to get. i rule at that little game. guys usually don't find it that much fun, but i LOVE tormenting them. bwahahahahahahahaha. it just makes it all the more fun when i do finally give in. but anywaz, ima go watch this dvd. mom bought me the old school version of how the grinch stole christmas. like, we're it's just pictures outta the book with voice-overs. i liket.

      le de da de da. boy that was fun...  i have done absolutely nothing with my day. i've sat around and done nothing. i hate that. but i really don't have much to do. I talked to nathan for like an hour and a half last night on the phone. it made me quite happy.  but i'm still so amzed with myself. i read back on these entries, then look at how giddy and girl-ish i was last night. amazing. he somehow makes everything all better. how does he do it?! he's got that freaking charm about him.  i hate it, but love it all at once. i wish i had charm. or grace, or tact, or any of the things girls are supposed to have.  alls i got is the physical things girls are supposed to have. not that you all didn't know that. they're hard to miss.  but *sigh* i really wanna see him. i haven't seen in him in almost three weeks. wow. three weeks. i'm such a baby. lol  but yes. i got on matchmaker.com today. yes, yes, i am pathetic and i do go there. quite often... i'm a curious little pony. there are some interesting guys on there. and some are quite cute. but they all live a thousand miles away (literally) but i bet they'd be fun to atleast talk to. heh....i doubt anyone looks at my profile. i have no picture up, so everyone overlooks little ol' me. but that's ok....i'll upload a picture when i'm just totally deperate. not that the people on there do that....but yes....anywaz...  meh....i have to clean my room. i've been saying that since i got home. i haven't even unpacked yet. i've been living out of my suitcase.  i talked to mel today tho. it sux, she's leaving for dallas tomorrow. i wanted her to go to vino's with me on friday, Temper Effect is playing.  i want to see them. they look so good. *drool* and they rock. i love musicians. Musicians are the shiz.....*drool*  but anywaz, ima go. i have to make myself look decent. and i'm wearing this Systematic shirt that's too small, and litle hoochie shorts. heh...it would help if i straightened my hair and all that too...

      well, today was an ok day. i woke up about one when mitchell called. he was bored so we went out today. it was good for me. i hadn't been out in a while, and it made me froget about nathan for a little while.  we went to coldstone. yummy. i'm sooooo glad little rock finally got one of those. now i don't have to wait to go to colorado to have my cinnimon cheesecake ice cream. then we went to his house for about an hour and a half. he tried to teach me how to drive in the golf cart. lol. i didn't want to, so he scooted me over in the drivers seat, pressed the gas and said for me to turn. i was totally freaked out to say the least. the whole time i was driving aroudn the field yelling, "take the wheel""I don't want to drive!" and "mitchell!" yea...that was interesting. but it was fun.  we went back in the house. we played manhunt and enter the matrix for a little bit. then we decided to go to sonic over on otter creek. since he works there, we got free drinks. i saw matt bell. lol. freak.  on the way home, tho, he wanted me to show him how to go from my house to wildwood by going thru the neighborhoods. somehow, i got turned around in my directions, and ended up on nathan's street. kinda made me sad. but i got outta there real quick and we made it wildwood. we drove up to north hills and turned on to jfk to get back to my house. i didn't wanna go the way we came. bleh..  but yea...i called nathan earlier. he was out . with friends. of course. what else? so yea...i'm supposed to call him back...not sure if i will or not. i feel almost as if he doesn't want to talk to me. yea, happy i was home.....uh-huh......i'm being so cynical. i still do like him, don't get me wrong. but when i feel like someone is dicking me around, at first i get all depressed (like before) and then i just get very friggin angry. and usually i end up pushing the person away and being bitter enemies....i hope that doesn't happen.  be nice sara, call him back, and be nice walst making conversation with him. and if he pisses you off in some way, then you can be mean....but be nice for the time being.  *sigh*  and i still miss him. i've decided now that i really want to kiss him. only i don't know if i'm gonna. does he really deserve it? hmmm........prolly not....  oh yea, i wrote another poem last night. you have to read it a certain way in order for it to rhyme. you have to read it kinda fast.... but i like it ok....   Too much too take I can’t bend anymore, I know I’m sure to break. But do you care? Does it bother you? You wouldn’t dare tell me no, or could you? And I know that you’re not thinking of me, but that’s ok, I think about you always and you have me smitten, and I’ll fall hard, I hit the ground, I’ll break my heart, but it’s all for you, so it’s alright. Another night of endless worry, I’m so sorry I haven’t been so happy lately. You make me happy, but you haven’t been around. The sound of my crying is all that fills the air this time of night. And the clicking of the keyboard as I write. I write for you. Will you even glance at this? Will it even make a difference? Will it help my situation? There’s a tiny complication with the way I feel for you. You’re tainted it all, and I’m still trying to believe you when you say that you’re sorry.  Polluted heart and littered wrists; defines me to a tee. Between the sobbing and the typing, I’ve made a mournful melody. But it’s beautiful. Kind of like you, only twice as sad if that’s possible. And I want you to be in love with me. I bleed for you, will you bleed for me? I take this too far every time, but I don’t know what else to do. And I’m so confused, you leave me totally powerless, and to be quite honest I don’t like it much. I feel like such a dummy, a fool. I should of left you be, kept you far away from me, but you’re so alluring. And now I’m consuming all this sadness. It’s become so habitual. I want you to be dreaming of me. ‘Cause I know that I’ll be dreaming of you, I always do. I’ve misconstrued this whole entire thing. I’m struggling and fighting back my tears. Ignoring the words I know I true. I’ve gained nothing when it comes to you….       boo-yah biotch.....ok, sorry, i just read that the way it's supposed t be read, and it rolled off my tongue so perfectly, i had to say that. ok, anywaz... i guess ima go now. ooo...i making a new art project. it should be awesome when i'm done. the epitome of teenage love. bwahahaha....i am an artist. bow down to me....yea right! ha! but anyways my loves, ima go. *muah* (since i have no one else to say it too *sad little pony*)

      gah.  philip came home. talking loudly....how pleasant. well, nathan talked to me for alittle while. nothing of any interest was said. then he just had to go. pshh....  after he signed off, i went back to my room and cried for a good 15 or 20 minutes. i had to stop. crying gives me headaches, i don't wanna cry over him anymore, and i always look so ugly after i cry. i'm not a pretty cryer....lol....  i don't know what to do about him. part of me wants to call him tomorrow and just be like, y know what? forget it. forget the whole damn thing. but then again, part of me wants to call and just ask him out myself. but i'm too afraid of what his response would be.....  i'm going to call him tomorrow night and we're just going to set things straight...if not, then i'm just going to lay off the guys for awhile. their like drugs to me. i have to have them, but they leave me so empty and depressed. i want him. i want him so bad i can't stand it...part of me feels like taking some sleeping pills right now so i can be out in 30 mintues and won't have to think about him anymore. i think i just might....

      ok...i was supposed to call him tonight.  i did so. he didn't answer. i IMed him. once again, no answer.....*sigh*.........i'm starting to wonder...  i'm already getting to where my happiness relies alot on him. i need to stop that now. you should never place your happiness in someone else.  it only means that in a short while, you will be totally unhappy.  i don't know what to do. i feel so.....just empty and powerless....i feel like nothing is in my control, nothing. not my weight, not my life, not my happiness, not my feelings for nathan. nothing.  i just wanna see him. i could be in the same room with him and not say anything to him, and i would be content. damn.....why me? why again? this makes 4 guys this year.....four....and not damn one has wanted me. and i can't figure out why. nathan claims that he wants me. so i'll believe him. but i wished he'd just hurry up and ask me out. tho i'm not quite sure if either one of us needs to be in a relationship right now. neither one of us seems to be happy. but i think i would be happy if i were with him. i think my problem right now is not knowing where i stand. he's told me, but it doesn't seem to be good enough. like, if we were together, i would know for sure. right now, i feel like i can be tossed aside whenever he pleases, and i'm powerless over it. of course i'm not. i could get out right now. tell him i didn't want to be friends or "friends" or whatever. but i can't do that for some reason.   but i'll act like i'm ok. it's all i know how to do.  i play this role quite often. nothing's wrong, i'll cry on my own time. i feel like crying right now. i feel so overwhelmed. i miss caitlan. i can't really talk to anyone else. nathan's got his own problems, i don't want to bother him with mine. not that caitlan doesn't have hers either, but....she just always seems to make things better. i miss her.  i miss him....damnit! stop it you stupid girl! you're not going to marry him, you're not going to fall in love with him, so quit acting like it's such a big damn deal! argh!  ................  well, that did absolutely no good. i'm still here, still missing, and still needing to cry....  wrote some more last night at like 2 in the morning...  "so unhappy with myself i would change but the walls are too thin everyone would hear my pain but feel no sympathy only digust.  so unhappy with him but nowhere to vent there's no room left on my wrists too many other boys have taken up residency there. but i'm not unhappy with him when i'm with him, that is to say. his face suddenly makes everything so much better but his actions do so much damage cause so much hurt and when i fall, i fall hard and i'm obviously smitten I just want to be loved.  I just wanna be happy."

      Not the way i wanted to spend my day. ok, first i'm awakened by terrance ringin my doorbell looking for my mom. i couldn't open the door all the way, since i had little clothing on. but i made him go away and took off my skimpy shirt and but on a button-up one, that i didn't even button up the whoel way, so it wasn't much of an improvement.  then, as i was trying to do my make-up and straighten my hair and all that, jeremy comes to my door. i haven't seen him in forever, and i hate looking like crap in front of people, but i had to answer the door. my shirt was half-way unbuttoned, i was trying to hold it closed and look for philip's cell phone number at the same time. i didn't do a very good job.  then after i finally get dressed and all that, i walk into the living room only to find the couch and floor covered in vomit. apparently, chloe got sick, and just threw up all over everything. i'm the only one home. so guess who gets to clean it up? you guessed it. i can deal with blood, no problem. i can deal with the sight on blood and internal organs and all that, but vomit i cannot handle. so as i'm trying to clean hers up, i'm gagging and trying to keeps my chucks down.  so yes, this is how i spent my day. cleaning up vomit, trying not to vomit, trying to not give people a free show, and i had to go with mom to take her to the vet. fun huh? now, i have to clean my room, do my laundry, and attempt to make myself skinnier. and no, i'm doing it the right way this time, i promise. i'm actually getting my fat self off the couch and working out. amazing, huh?

      gah.....i feel so dead right now. why i do not know. well, i do know. i'm unhappy with myself, with other people and with nathan.  i've started feeling the need to purge again. i feel so fat right now, and i feel like that's the reason i can't get a guy, even tho i sorta kinda have one, but i would like to keep him, so i feel the need to be thin. i hate that feeling. i can't shake it off, and it makes me depressed, which only makes me want to lay in bed all day which will only make me fatter. i can't win with this, i swear.  people........i don't like them. my 16th birthday is in 11 days. mom wants me to have a party, since you know it's 16 and all. i don't wanna have one. there is absolutely no one that i care to see enough to invite over. i don't wanna have to deal with them. i mean, there's some people i prolly wouldn't mind seeing, llike heather and mel and david, but everyone else....i just have no desire to even be around them...  i don't even know how to feel or what to do about the nathan thing. i really really really like him, and i want so badly to think that he feels the same way, but he tainted everything when he did what he did. totally ruined it. like, i still like him a whole whole lot, but now when he says sweet things, part of me is all girly about it, then part of me goes back to that and wants to say something hateful in response. i talked to him tonight, and i still don't feel any better like i thought i would. i asked him if this was going to be a reoccuring thing, he said no. not like he would admit to it if it was going be, but i'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt on this one, just because i feel like i may go off the deep end if i don't. i want to be with him. i really do. i don't wanna have to let him go. I'm not ready to i don't want to. i want it to work. i don't want to be hurt again. he's already hurt me once, and i took it really hard and we weren't even going out. what's going to happen if we start going out and i really start to fall hard for him and he does it again? then what? i don't think i can deal with anymore of that. i just wanna see him. i really do.....i miss him so bad, and the hurtful part is that i don't know if he truly even missed me or if he only says that. once again, i really want to believe that he did. so i'm going to humor myself and say that he did. yes.....he did. *sniffle* i wrote another poem sort of for him today. it kinda goes into other guys too, but...i'm going to post it on here b/c i posted it on my website, but it screwed up and didn't update, so.....here it goes   Another night wasted on razor blades and tears   Over nothing, always nothing.   Too much to handle, another person to let go that i don't wanna give away.   Stressed over a truth thats yet to be proved   but it will surface, it will always surface.   And then, once again, I'll be hurt   when I knew all along that the pain was inescapable.   Too much hurt for someone who's not worth it.   But oh, how he's worth it   They're always worth it.   If not, I woulnd't have so many scars littering my wrists.       i dunno what to do anymore. i've been listening to "She Will be Loved" by Maroon 5 for the last hour or so. I want someone to feel that way about me so badly. i really do.....
