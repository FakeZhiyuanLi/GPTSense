       The anesthetic state produced here does not fit into the conventional classification of stages of anesthesia, but instead produces a state of unconsciousness which has been termed "dissociative" anesthesia in that it appears to selectively interrupt association pathways to the brain before producing some asthetic sensory blockage  TGIF  :)

       The tendency to complain is habitual and opportunistic. There is also definitely something in general human nature that causes this to happen.    For example………If poor unsuspecting person #1 shows any measure of sympathy or commiserating body language, the complainer will file a subconscious mental cookie and return to the scene of the crime to assail the poor unsuspecting person #1 time and again with cracked pearls of unwanted opinions, theories and sometimes even paranoid delusional musings.     &nbsp;  Short of offering a clinically approved meds dispenser at the opening of one’s work cube, there is no polite and effective way to deal with the complainer, once said cookie is firmly established in complainer’s psyche. I imagine some crime scene tape and a nice chalk outline might deter the complainer, especially if they also suffer from A.D.D, but it will not solve the long-term problem.    Poor unsuspecting person #1 can sometimes be unjustly lumped in with complainer’s destructive deeds, as well…guilt by association. &nbsp;Should the complainee come into certain confidences and over-hear or learn of the complainer’s antics, taking note of the quantity of time complainer spends with poor unsuspecting person #1, then the resulting raised eyebrows and angry looks will catapult poor unsuspecting person #1’s general mood and even affect their work flow.     As a defense mechanism and for possible consideration as an overall treatment of CETCS (Chronic Exposure To Complainers Syndrome) I recommend mindless Blog chatter.

       Well, of all places I found this site it had to be a CNN story on Google. They don't usually include actual site addresses when they mention web sites so that surprised me a little bit. I liked the name of the site and thought I'd check it out. It looks fun!   I have no idea what I'm doing yet but it's not like I have my mouse pointed at the big red W.O.P.E.R button from the movie War Games, right? So, here goes................

       You know you are in Cube World when:  Cuber CEO is frequently overheard mumbling, "eeeeny meeeenie miney moe."    Cuber Hypocubriac keeps asking you when she can "show your cubicle."    Company dental plan now consists of pliers and string and an "IBU800"    Cube Commando Zeus swipes 12 Krispy Kremes and spends all day in your cube tootin' away    Cube walls are too close together to set up hammock    After a few hours on your desk, the people in your family photos stop smiling.    Instead of calling a pest control company you come in on a Monday to mosquito netting around your cube      * . (\ ---- /) . *

       Spur of the moment meetings are to Cube Life what pop quizzes were in the 9th grade. I’ve made a mental note that, going forward, meetings are not an ideal time to teach myself how to doodle tweety bird. One such meeting was called (with no time to even get a soda) and ideas bounded to and fro. When everyone agreed we were all on the right track, our Cuber CEO dropped his MOAB and said, “Great! Let’s all create our own policy revision listing everything discussed here and meet back tomorrow to compare formats and styles." I immediately kicked my brain into retro-gear and tried to piece together, in some kind of organized rough draft, the bits and pieces I’d actually paid attention to and absorbed........8th day of the month...hurricanes and postal service routed thru Atlanta....6 days from approval, twice a month, I miss my chair in our old conference room........I wonder what happened to the squirrels that used to live at that building.......those are cute sandals.......have to utilize the requirements and guidelines stated earlier.........processing and mailing timelines....  I wonder if Worker’s Comp. accepts A.D.D as a work related disability. It is a very debilitating affliction and I still don’t know how to doodle a tweety.

       No unauthorized pretty greenery. Please use plastic ficus trees and faker flowers instead. Ugly greenery is permitted for advanced level person’s only. Minor infractions are allowed if Cuber has formed unhealthy attachment to said pretty greenery but management may require a doctor’s note.  Disgruntled employees will be blogged immediately  Please limit your Cube comas to mornings and afternoons. Preferably right after lunch…..and feel free to drop into a coma at any time during meetings.  Promptly reporting for duty on pizza day is mandatory, any digressers will be blogged without delay  Strategic monitor placement is encouraged. Cube guards don’t really need to be able to spot monitor activity from every angle.  "Stop surfing and get to work, punk" is actually Cube Guard code for, “Job well done”  Cube Karaoke is permitted. Don’t be shy, let it all out     It is not necessary to solicit management approval before having Cube sleep-overs    Over-emphasizing your ability to use the copier isn’t necessary but faxing skills need to be broadcasted daily    New Cuber’s are encouraged to swipe as many supplies as possible from their old job to help supplement office inventory. This affects all Cuber’s Christmas bonuses     Parking is free, but anyone can validate a Post-It note for you.  Management frowns when asked if you can spray paint your own ‘reserved for’ parking space. Don't ask, show some initiative......    Measure your cube weekly and keep a running log posted on the outside of your cube for any building inspector’s that might wander by.

       Out of state contractor's are a very distant consideration. Temporary out of state contractor's even more so.       Should this be the way it is?    No, not at all.    Is it?    Yes, very much so.       Case in point: Angry contractor calls mellow Cube Life employee (who is very busy blogging and still waking up) and immediately settles into a 10 minute barrage about the postal service, not receiving paychecks promptly, being a single parent, living pay check to pay check and needing direct deposit..........  I am not a single parent, nor do I live paycheck to paycheck but I do get irritated when I give myself a wicked paper cut opening up the envelope that contains my paycheck. Can I use that experience to put me in a place to better help Angry Contractor? No, I tried and it didn't help either one of us.  I am compassionate enough to understand where Angry Contractor is coming from. I can even appreciate that Angry Contractor wants to contact everyone in Cube World in a crafty tactic to bring as many people on board as possible. This will ultimately work well in Angry Contractor's favor. The more people the better, especially since West coast muffin's and coffee's haven't kicked in yet.  I've noticed that people on the East coast tend to grow impatient waiting for West coast office hours to catch up with their world. This affects how they interact with West coast Cuber's.    I wonder if Cube Life would be a much more mellow place if East coaster's just timelined their caffeine intake to directly mirror those in the West coast.       Then we could all get worked up about the mailman together.

       I heard a duck holler ( yes, ducks holler, especially when psycho puppy is hot on their tail, trying to herd them in the house, thru the French doors)      I set the laundry basket down on the floor to investigate and run interference just as psycho puppy darted into the house, hopping and bouncing, paws and legs and undercarriage as muddy as can be and launched himself right in my basket of clean towels.       He even burrowed down into the warm towels wagging his tail in unrestrained puppy delight.       You can bet he got a time out.       Well, after the bath and cookie, of course.       I'm sure he learned his lesson.

       Quite a few meetings in Cube Life are nothing more than grandstanding exhibitions where self-serving bold statements counter more self-serving bold statements in this frenzied verbal rally, creating an atmosphere that keeps everything chugging along in a scattered and unfocused pattern.       This leads to interruptions, mindless doodling (on my part) and people talking over people until Meanie steps in and engages his own unique brand of volatile, aggressive tactics to hammer into everyone's mind just how silly everybody on the planet is except for Meanie, himself.  I believe we should have all of our future chaotic conference sessions from the comfort of our own cubes and we could use MSN messenger.       This would work out well for me because when I feel the need to doodle I can use the smileys or inject things like (_\_) as an expressive way to call everyone's attention to Meanie's other nick name.     urlLink  \\\\\/////      ( o o ) ------oOOo----U-----oOOo-----

       What comes around, goes around.  Cube Life can be a dangerous place. A hostile jungle full of Meanie's cooties. Meanie will spread cooties all over the place and then blame someone else for making him sick after they've caught what he has.  One of Meanie's victims from earlier this week still hasn't returned to Cube Life. I wonder if she caught the cooties while he was yelling at her. Maybe she is Cube Hunting for something new and cootie-free.

       My puppy finally found a friend in the one place I never thought possible. A duck. Ever since we brought him home he has wildly charged all the other animals with that rev'd up, ears flapping,  hopping, bouncing run he has perfected and all the animals look at him like he is demon spawn.  Yesterday I wandered out onto the patio and there was my puppy, all crouched down in the grass, squared off with the mallard. My first instinct was to rush out and break up the unauthorized critter formation and head off any possible altercations but I stayed put instead and watched them.       Puppy charged duck and duck shrank back a bit but didn't run. Then puppy crouched again and duck charged puppy and puppy shrank back a bit. They did this 3 times before I finally figured out they were playing. For all I know they could have been in some weird animal joust, fighting for control of the back yard, but puppy's wagging tail told me otherwise (unless puppy is too loopy to figure out hostile environments).........you never know. But it looked like fun.  The mallard wouldn't play the crouchy-charge game with me though.

      I think it’s a gravitational law in Cube Life all things smelly have to congregate around my cube. It doesn’t matter where the odor occurred or what caused it  because the way the air circulates here it all winds up circling the top of my cube anyway, like some freaky invisible air tornado.  No amount of Jasmine spray helps either.

       Some people care about things outside themselves and then there are those certain people who can’t stand being bothered. Some people want to share happiness and smiles and then there is a  “Meanie” who would rather you’d just die and get out of his way.      Cube Life, ( which should be a weekly newsletter but is just my lame-a$$ code name for where I work) like everywhere else, suffers from at least one of these mean people. And, as a rule, he just doesn’t get along with anyone unless that person can advance him in some way, help him along, or provide something the meanie needs.  However, in Cube Life, we can always hope that the meanie will leave us alone. This is very unlikely since there are flash points and triggers at every corner. Meanie cannot control stress or frustrations in normal, calm ways and must explode on the more docile and pleasant people  that he comes into contact with.       There is a cure for the meanie though, it’s manners.      There is a reason for manners. Contrary to all those old maxims about base social lubricant and such, it’s a simple thing. People who take care when they speak to you are interested in your reaction. They want to avoid alienating you. They want to continue the social transaction. They want to share a mutually beneficial outcome with you.      So here’s the earth shattering revelation I wanted to share so badly: stay away from people who don’t put in the extra effort. Don’t talk to people who make light of your efforts to keep peace. Walk away from those who shout that their rights outweigh all other considerations. Learn to tell potentially useful and rewarding people from selfish, inconsiderate people.    I’m not suggesting we spend our time tossing people aside based on whether they were nice to us. I’m suggesting we learn to see the difference between people who couldn’t care less about anything but themselves, and those who at least take a moment to listen to what we have to say. It doesn’t matter so much if they like what we say – just that they actually wanted to hear it in the first place.

       A young executive was leaving the office late one evening when he found the CEO standing in front of a shredder with a piece of paper in his hand.     "Listen," said the CEO, "this is a very sensitive and important document here, and my secretary has gone for the night. Can you make this thing work?"     "Certainly," said the young executive. He turned the machine on, inserted the paper and pressed the start button. "Excellent, excellent!" said the CEO as his paper disappeared inside the shredder. "I just need one copy."

       What is up with those cuddle parties in New York? I guess you pay $30.00 for a cuddle with other pajama-clad people spending $30.00 and the creator’s say,    “it’s a good way to meet new and interesting people.”     Hmmmmmmm…. I guess you would find out immediately if you had spooning chemistry but a good way to meet new people? Let me try it on for size……..Hi, my name is Kimberly, I’m a Pisces, spoon me.    They do have one rule though, the PJ’s stay on. I wonder what the rules are about the types of PJ’s allowed. I don’t think anything you buy in a pretty pink bag is appropriate.     “……..In case things get too steamy, a small chime is kept on hand. Before the cuddling begins, the chime is struck several times so everyone gets the message.”      Is mace available? Can I have a pair of bunny flip flop slippers, some pepper spray and 1 admittance ticket please?      I   wonder if it’s random spooning or preselected, or by choice or first come first serve. Is it collective spooning on some giant bed, monitored by cameras (uh oh, who else sees a lucrative adult film contract coming up?) Can you predetermine your ideal spooning partner. Can you order one and get mood lighting and candles, too?        “……….Participants team up into pairs, and to ensure the boundaries of what is permissible are clear, they practice saying "no" to the question, "May I kiss you?” An introduction to cuddling ensues, first by hugging three people. People then get in a circle on their hands and knees, rub shoulders and moo like cows. After a bit of swaying, everyone falls to their side, which puts them into an easy cuddling position. Cuddle parties are intended for people who are emotionally sound. People in therapy or who are seeing a mental health professional are asked to consult their doctor before signing up for a party and to tell organizers of their situation.”      Yeah, most people not in therapy moo on all four’s and sway around.         “…..A repeat customer who called herself a born-again Christian said it was good to cuddle up to another person, albeit a perfect stranger, after a hectic week.”     Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s pillow?     urlLink  http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/08/09/cuddling.parties.2.reut/index.html

       I can please only one person per day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow, isn't looking good either.      I love deadlines. I especially like the whooshing sound they make as they go flying by.  I don't suffer from stress. I'm a carrier  Some people work up steam and some only generate a fog  Give me ambiguity or give me something else.  It's frustrating when you know all the answers, but nobody bothers to ask you the questions  I believe five out of four people have trouble with fractions.      How come you never hear about gruntled employees?      I don't have a solution, but I admire your problem.      Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines  Doing a job RIGHT the first time gets the job done. Doing the job WRONG fourteen times gives you job security         :)

       I wonder if a strategically positioned taser would help deter late afternoon cube infiltrator's who bring me too many problems and dump way too much work on me that just has to be done ASAP.  Don't they see that it's like 3:05 PM and all Cube naps should start at precisely 3:10PM.

       I have ducks. 3 of them. 2 Pekins and 1 Mallard. My husband got them for me as a surprise  to put in our pond.       The Mallard is a total poser. He positions himself for the best lighting in almost every instance. He is also the only one who actually follows me around when I have a camera in hand.       My husband named all three ducks before I got home that day. He named the Mallard "Tape" (Duct, get it?) He named one of the white ducks, "Aflac" (Yes, after the insurance company mascot) and the other white duck he named, "Froi Gras" (groaning)      He isn't allowed to name any more pets on his own.

       Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to get old is when we're kids?    If you're less than 10 years old, you're so excited about aging that you think in fractions.   "How old are you?" "I'm four and a half!"    You're never thirty-six and a half.    You're four and a half, going on five!      That's the key.   You get into your teens, now they can't hold you back.     You jump to the next number, or even a few ahead.     "How old are you?" "I'm gonna be 16!"    You could be 13, but hey, you're gonna be 16!   And then the greatest day of your life . . . you become 21.    Even the words sound like a ceremony . . YOU BECOME 21.  YESSSS!!!   But then you turn 30.    Oooohh, what happened there?    Makes you sound like bad milk.     He TURNED; we had to throw him out.     There's no fun now, you're just a sour-dumpling.    What's wrong?  What's changed?    You BECOME 21, you TURN 30, then you're PUSHING 40.      Whoa! Put on the brakes, it's all slipping away.    Before you know it, you REACH 50 ...and your dreams are gone.   But wait!!!  You MAKE it to 60.  You didn't think you would!     So you BECOME 21, TURN 30, PUSH 40, REACH 50 and MAKE it to 60.   You've built up so much speed that you HIT 70!     After that it's a day-by-day thing; you HIT Wednesday!     You get into your 80s and every day is a complete cycle;    you HIT lunch; youTURN 4:30; you REACH bedtime.     And it doesn't end there. Into the 90's, you start going backwards;    "I Was JUST 92."   Then a strange thing happens.    If you make it over 100, you become a little kid again.    "I'm 100 and a half!"    :)      (G.Carlin)

       You are driving down the road in your car on a wild, stormy night, when you pass a bus stop and you see three people waiting for the bus: 1. An old lady who looks as if she is about to die.   2. An old friend who once saved your life.   3. The perfect partner you have been dreaming about.    Which one would you choose to offer a ride to, knowing there could only be one passenger in your car?       This is a moral/ethical dilemma that was once actually used as part of a job application. You could pick up the old lady, because she is going to die and thus you should save her first. Or you could take the old friend because he once saved your life, and this would be the perfect chance to pay him back. However, you may never be able to find your perfect mate again so you might want topick that person.         One  possible answer- Give the car keys to my old friend and let him take the lady to the hospital -- thus saving the old lady and giving my friend a chance to be a hero. I would stay behind and wait for the bus with the partner of my dreams

       Laughter is contagious as long as you express it in the company of people who are jovial by nature.       To those rigid, morose observers, that you may come into contact with, it is a social conundrum of epic proportions.       They can't handle unchecked joy and have a tendency to freeze up, in a very painful looking way. Here are (2) tell tale signs to spot the non-jovial natured subjects in your proximity should you find yourself laughing too hard and feel compelled to force personal self control of said mirth  If you get a squinty look and a snort/smile head shake - This is a dead give away that the person you've busted a hoot in front of has no concept how to enjoy the moment  If you receive a Spock-like eyebrow glare with a head tilt and hear "hmmmmm" - You may want to direct your twinkling, happy bursts toward someone else, they are clearly wasted on the Vulcanator.  :)

       Each of us is given five balls.    One is rubber and four are glass.    The rubber ball is work. If you drop it, it will always bounce back.    The other four glass balls are family, friends, health and integrity.    If you drop them, they are shattered.    They won’t bounce back
