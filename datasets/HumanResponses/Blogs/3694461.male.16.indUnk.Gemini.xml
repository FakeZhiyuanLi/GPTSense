      I have decided to go back to my writing roots.  This means that i'm not gonna worry about it being deep or depressing or ultra intellectual.  I'm ditching all that for amusing.  If it's amusing, then it's better.  Well alls i need now is something to write...an idea...WHO WILL BE MY MUSE?

      Okay so i just realized something...i have been spending these past few years trying to emulate people who i considered "cool."  I have been doing this to make more friends or something, i don't know.  I now see that i honestly and fully just need to be my weird and quirky self....that'll be the best thing for me.  I DON'T WANNA BE THE SHEEP NO MORE!!!!!!

      Okay i'm officially a mess.  I stay up late (i was up til nearly 5 this morning), i dig myself deeper into a hole that i am finding it harder to get out of, and i just don't know what i'm going to do with my life.  I'm a shiftless loser right now who can't muster enough whatever to get out there and do something.  I am just a mess.  Nobody, not even my mom, seems to fully realize this.  Oh well...time heals all wounds i guess.  YAY FOR WHIPPEE POOP!!! (anyone who fails to quickly see the reason why i laughed at it so much obviously isn't immature enough, sleep deprived enough, or goofy enough)

      Memories of you  That i just don't have right now  I'll make them up  One cup of wanting you  Two cups of hoping somehow  These things come true  While I'm staring at pictures of you  While I'm staring at pictures of you  Yearning  longing  Making up memories of you  Making up memories of you  For now your picture will do  Dialing you up in my sleep when the nights wearing thin  Won't make it right  My reasons to want to  And 100 reasons to lie  When i don't want to  While I'm staring at pictures of you  While I'm staring at pictures of you  Yearning  longing  Making up memories of you  Making up memories of you  For now your picture will do  Memories of you  That i just don't have right now  I'll make them up  One cup of wanting you  Two cups of hoping somehow  These things come true  While I'm staring at pictures of you  While I'm staring at pictures of you  Yearning  longing  Making up memories of you

      Looking down the beaten path watching him fade away like a ghost she knew the war was over and that he had won he had succeeded in taking her heart from her and destroying it  Oh, she cries out in the pain she wants to know how to be normal again but it's not possible this stranger stole her heart from her and he won't give it back  at night she just needs a good scream because she can't even dream without him appearing she can't go nowhere in this life without him appearing it's all to nightmarishly surreal  Oh, she cries out in the pain she wants to know how to be normal again but it's not possible this stranger stole her heart from her and he won't give it back oh and he won't give it back he won't he won't he won't give it back it's too late for that

      Some people, i swear, must eat asshole flakes for breakfast.  I say this because some people are just plain dick heads.  I just don't understand how people can be such bastards...and i now feel the need to apologize to anyone who i've hurt or been a dick to because i'm about to go on a tirade about how people are pretentious assholes (well a lot of us are...there are those good people out there).  Okay so one of my friends just had a personal affront on him...by some unknown dick head who had too little spine to tell my friend who he was.  Yeah you're really brave and cool by insulting someone anonymously.  You have less spine than a jellyfish you ass clown...and yes thats kinda from a song by a group i can't remember but i know i don't like.  At least have the courtesy to identify yourself instead of hiding behind a faceless mask you fucking monkey.  i dont' know, but people never cease to astound me.  Instead of being a sneaky little manipulative terd, come out and identify yourself.  Some people just don't have any tact.  They are chicken shit and they always will be chicken shit.  WHOEVER YOU ARE YOU ARE A NO GOOD PIECE OF SHIT.  You are no better than the shit pigs eat, you worthless bastard.  People just dissapoint me.  As soon as my optimism comes back, this shit happens.  Hey thats really cool...this is an anagram for shit...i never noticed that before.  Interesting...okay back to the tirade.  The people that are nice, have spines/some backbone, and have a heart are gonna be the people that will make a difference in this world.  Everyone else can go fuck themselves (i don't care if this sounds hypocritical because i never claimed i was one of the "Good" people...maybe i am, maybe i'm not...oh well)!

      "you probably shouldn't be digging in your ass"-Marcus (the midget from bad santa)  I'm sorry folks but i just love this movie bad santa.  However i will stop going on and on about it.  I think i need to write something, like poetry or something.  I doubt it will be any good, though.  Sadly i haven't had much of a creative streak lately.  Oh well.  Oh yeah, something utterly fantastic happened to me today.  I found out that i passed my AP World History class for the year (which was sadly unexpected).  You see, i didn't do any of the work, and i kinda slacked off.  However, i pulled it together at the end of the year and i inched by with D for the year (not so great but it's passing... i could've done better though hmmm...however, this year has been hard for me... BUT I PASSED...YES YES YES YES!).  Today has been good to me.  Oh yeah and my new sandals are finally broken in.  These sandals have been chafing my toes for the past few days worse than a fat man wearing a thong for the first time (sorry for the bad analogy).  It's all good now, though.  Some people really need to get a clue about how to drive, too.  I mean i may only have my learners permit and i may do some dumb things (not that often of course...haha), but some people drive with their head up their butt.  Some people just don't think.  I almost got into an accident the other day b/c i was in this persons blind spot and they didn't check it before entering into my lane.  Luckily I was paying attention.  Some people just need to get a clue.  I just hope i never have to drive in Florida, haha.  Speaking of which i am visiting Florida in July.  We are taking the train down, which should be fun.  We've takent the train before and it was fun.  However this trip isn't any vacation, it's a trip to visit my decrepit relatives.  Oh well, it'll be nice to see them again.  Next year is going to be hell/heaven.  It's all the work that's hell, and all the theater that's heaven.  We are doing shakespeare next year, which ought to be fun.  I'm just looking forward to it all actually.  Next year should be good.  Have you ever looked at your fingers when you are typing.  It's the most bizarre thing i have ever seen.  They know exactly where to move and they look utterly mechanical while doing.  It just looks fascinating/weird.  Oh yeah, and they cancelled Lollapalooza!!  I can't believe it because i was really looking foward to seeing Morrissey, but i guess not getting enough ticket sales is a valid excuse.  Oh well, i guess this just means that i'll be going to the Curiosa music festival, which has the cure, the rapture, and muse.  That should be good.  I am still upset about lollapalooza, but being upset isn't going to change anything so i'll stop.  I am happy, though, that Franz Ferdinand got a good review in the Washington Post.  The Postal Service is genius (so is Death Cab For Cutie) and anyone reading this who hasnt' heard of either of them (or any music groups/artists on this post) should download them immediately or buy one of their cds.  Until next time.

      Okay so it's 3:30 in the fucking morning...my night has not been the best in the world.  I go to the ER at 10:30 tonight b/c i'm in pain and some medical books we had said my symptoms were serious.  I wait for an inordinate amount of time only to find out it's just an infection...nothing too bad.  However, the redeeming thing of the night was that i got my first ultrasound which was kinda cool...but then again, i'm kinda weird.  Okay so they put this weird warm jelly on me which apparently is to fill the gap between my skin and the machine b/c the ultrasound can't go through air.  It was an interesting experience at best.  THEN i leave at like 1:20 in the morning (yeah that was fun), but my mom and i stop off at a gas station to get some sweets (yay).  Well by this point i'm not very tired, so i stay up and watch Bad Santa for the second time.  That is the only movie that can make me laugh hysterically AND sorta want to cry (it's at this one part where his character is becoming nice...kinda like when the grinch becomes nice to all the people in Whoville, or wherever...but he is becoming nice and then he gets shot by the police...shooting an unarmed santa on christmas eve...he describes it as being more fucked up than rodney king...anyway it's sad and it makes me want to cry...but then i don't b/c it's ridiculous and funny stuff happens right after that).  Anyway, it's a great movie that i love.  I guess my true sense of fucked up humor finally comes out, or it's just 3:40 in teh morning and it's time for me to go to bed.  No it's the former.  Haha.  Okay well this evening has been majical but it's time for me to go to bed.  Night.

      Man last night has got to be one of the best experiences of my life.  Being with friends at an awesome concert at the 9:30 Club is a garaunteed good time.  THANK YOU FOR THE TICKET PARKER!!!!!!!  Okay so i went to see Franz Ferdinand...they were seriously the best i have ever seen...which really isn't saying much considering i have only been to three concerts....well hfstival should count as multiple concerts b/c we got to see multiple people.  Anyways they seriously fucking rocked...and i am secure enough in my manhood to say that the guys in franz ferdinand were very good looking up on that stage...dare i say even sexy...haha.  They had the most amazing set in the world.  The greatest though was dancing like an absolute fucking spaztastic crack addict.  I danced the night away people (dancing i.e. moving my arms, bouncing my head to the music in a cool fashion, semi-jumping or only get part of your feet off the ground, and fully jumping off the ground).  I also sang to the words...i was kinda hoarse afterwards, but not too bad.  They were utterly fantastic live.  The whole night was kinda surreal.  I really wish i was back there again b/c it was so cool...i also got to spend some memorable time with my some of my graduating buddies...Lexi and Kai that means you, haha.  The whole evening was fantastic.  Riding in on the metro was fantastic.  Waiting for it all to start was fantastic.  Listening to Delegate, who by the way fucking rock as well...and they are homegrown (that sounds really weird) b/c they are from Richmond, VA...was fantastic. Getting food was fantastic.  Listening to the Sons and Daughters was FANTASTIC...not b/c they were good...in fact they are awful...i felt like i was at an irish hoe-down...they were fantastic b/c they made me laugh...i mocked them oh so much...i yelled at the stage once like an over-enthused frat boy "YOU GUYS ROCK. YOU FUCKING ROCK." (or something like that) One of the singers of Sons and Daughters looked like a chubby lucy lawless and whent the two singers sang together i cringed b/c it was like nails on a chalkboard (well maybe not that dramatic).  Franz Ferdinand played just an amazing set...haha during the song This Fire, matt held up parkers lighter (lit of course) and parker lit a match and held that up...i shamelessly followed their example and lit a match but i guess those "lighting" festivities were over by that time. Oh am i excited for their new cd b/c i liked the new songs that they played, they were really good.  Also trying to fit SIX people in a FIVE seat car, with four people in the back (one had to sit on part of a person) was great fun. NOT. It was okay...haha.  Also it didn't help that we smelled like dirty ashtrays and partially like sweat. I swear i could smell the smoke in my hair as i was washing it today.  But we all smelled like we had been ashtray diving, haha.  OH the evening was filled with great laughs and fun. I love spending quality time with friends.  I met a new character for the first time and i really like him..he seems like a cool guy...in fact i met two new cool guys.  Oh and if you count lexi's grad party the other day, i have met three new guys that i think are cool...all of their names start with a j...fancy that...and two of them are named joe...fancy that.  Okay another fantastico thing about this concert was that they were filming it...IT'S GONNA BE RELEASED ON A FUCKING DVD...WE WERE RIGHT NEAR THE CAMERA MAN HOW COOL IS THAT.  Oh it's good times.  Good times.  i'm gonna miss these good times, these grand times with you, it's all i have left.  OKAY SO I LOVED THIS CONCERT.  and lexi's grad party...what can i say about taht other than it was utterly awesome.  I met joe for the first time.  He's really weird but really cool at the same time.  He's an awesome guy.  But hey, lexi wouldn't be going out with him if he wasn't awesome, haha.  He likes Family Guy, too. YESSSS FAMILY GUY RULES.  Another hilight was seeing the cat on a leash in teh backyard, how bizarre? haha.  Oh and then seeing the leash lead into the bushes and following to the leash to find out that the cat is in the bushes.  What a cool cat.  Another highlight was Paul lighting stuff on fire...and to think that next year he'll have to become certified as a fireman.  haha. oh well kiddies this has been fun but i am tired, so i'll stop now.  DAMN MY CAT LIKE REFLEXES SH-SH-SHA!

      this is going to sound really weird and all but i think i'm going crazy...i don't know what it is...maybe crazy's not the right word...maybe i'm just getting weirder...who knows...Eh what are you going to do?  Haha.  I'm actually going to attribute it to the fact taht i've been listening to a lot of old muse lately which is really weird.   Especially the songs micro cuts and screeenager.  They are just really weird songs and they make me feel weird/crazy.  I can't explain it.  Whatever haha.  I'm a different person lately.  I'm much happier and i kind of attribute it to the help of my friends.  I've been hanging out with them more and i've been talking to people more.  I've become somewhat extroverted nowadays.  I attribute it to a few friends imparticular.  I'm not gonna list names or anything so yeah.  Dave Chapelle "cuz fuck em thats why!"  I just had to throw that in there.  I'm a much happier person right now.  I think it's because i've come to terms with some things.  You know whats interesting?  For how simplistic i can seem at times (i can amuse myself with a ball of yarn...or at least i wouldn't be surprised if i could...and i am easily pleased when it comes to music) i'm actually pretty complex.  Not very many people "get me" or understand me.  I'm so random, yet it all ties together.  There's a method to my madness.  I don't care, though, i'll let people think of me what they want.  Haha i like freaking people out i think.  I honestly think i make a lot of people think i'm really weird or that i bother a lot of people.  Eh deep down i'm a nice guy (i think).  It's surprisingly dark outside right now...thats b/c it's gonna storm....woop woop.  Well i'm tired and i've got newspaper print on my hands and i'm cold and i'm gonna go and this is a terrible run-on sentence.  Haha.

      WHY DO I HAVE SUCH A FEAR OF BEING EXTROVERTED?  HUH?  Can anyone tell me why?  No you cant' but i can tell you why.  It's b/c society doesn't fully accept those who speak their minds from the heart.  That's b/c the hearts of some people would scare the shit out of you.  Now some may dismiss this all as the insane ramblings of a lunatic.  Some people just may not care what i have to say.  Some may just say "whatever".  Well let me tell you something from the heart of apathy, evil spreads.  Being apathetic about life only leads to bad things.  I have personal experience with this, i know.  Okay anyways society doesn't fully accept those who want to say things from the heart because it's probably not what other people want to hear.  Well i don't care...but i will remain introverted for one reason...i fear our society today b/c it's going to hell in a handbasket (pardon the cliche expression) and that really scares me.  Our society is becoming a quickly deteriorating piece of junk where people don't give a damn what happens too others.  People our society is becoming like the cold and impersonal waste receptacles at a hospital.  No one cares what happens to other people anymore and that makes me cry.  Why can't people be more emotional.  It would spread a lot more caring around the world.  You know, fuck the manly bullshit b/c it doesn't mean jackshit when your fellow men are dying.  BUSH DO YOU HEAR THAT?!??!  OUR MEN ARE DYING OVER THERE IN IRAQ FOR YOUR STUPID VENDETTA WAR TO TRY AND COVER UP YOUR GLARING INADEQUACIES!!!  IT SICKENS ME TO THE VERY PIT OF MY STOMACH THAT YOU COULD'VE PROFITED FROM 9/11.  YOU HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE OF A PEA BUSH.  HOW HAVE YOUR TAX CUTS STIMULATED THE ECONOMY?  THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING SO FAR.  OH AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON YOUR BUDGET CUTS.  ANTI-TERRORISM DEPARTMENT HAD IT'S BUDGET CUT BEFORE 9/11.  THAT'S REALLY FUCKING SMART.  OH AND YOUR $200 MILLION BUDGET CUT FROM EDUCATION....ARE YOU INSANE?!?! YOU KNOW NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO GROW UP AS BRAINDEAD AS YOU BUSH!  HEY AND GREAT JOB IGNORING THOSE REPORTS THAT SUGGESTED BIN LADEN WAS GOING TO ATTACK WITHIN THE U.S. WITH AIRPLANES.  OH I'M SORRY I GUESS I FORGOT THAT YOU WERE ON VACATION ALL OF AUGUST.  TOO BUSY HITTING THE GOLF BALLS TO LET A LITTLE TERRORIST THREAT RAIN ON YOUR FUCKING PARADE.  OH AND GREAT JOB SITTING IN THAT CLASSROOM IN FLORIDA AFTER YOU KNEW THAT THE TOWERS HAD BEEN HIT...YOU COULD'VE AT LEAST PARDONED YOURSELF AND DONE SOMETHING.  OH AND TRYING TO STOP GAY MARRIAGES...WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE WHO GETS TO MARRY WHO?  SINCE WHEN HAS THE TITLE OF PRESIDENT MEANT THAT YOU COULD JUDGE PEOPLES LIFESTYLES...OH AND I'M SORRY IF I'M BEING UNPATRIOTIC RIGHT NOW...THANK GOD THIS IS AN ELECTION YEAR.  I PRAY THAT KERRY GETS ELECTED.  I AM SO ANGRY.  I'm not sorry for this rant...b/c it's how i feel right now.

      two humans produced from a mold of clay from clay thats absolute gray they molded into something beautiful and pure something beautifully demure and innocent totally devoid of any impurities or taints they entered the world unflawed rising on the eagles wings they did soar till the eagle broke and spiraled to the to the earth crashing down on the pavement their untainted beauty was shattered it lay in a thousand peices beside a kiln they waited to be reborn but when it happened they werent' the same for their new flame was filled with the evils of the world when they were reborn, they weren't the same they weren't as tame and pure as beatifully demure they came out grotesque and ugly tainted for life

      Paranoia to the MAX  Drake: close the door mack! it's too late for you to be entering into my domain.  and i pity the fool who enters my domain, because i know kar-ah-te!  Why did you come so late?  I demand a response.  Allen: First off i'm Allen, your best friend.  Second of all it's nine at night.  It's not that late...  Drake: BUT IT'S MY DOMAIN THAT YOU'VE JUST ENTERED.  YOU AND YOUR MIND TRICK REMARKS DON'T FOOL ME MACK.  I know your game, and believe me...your mind tricks don't fool me.  I know it all.  Did you bring it?  Allen:  My names not mack!  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  Drake: If you don't tell, then I'm not KNOWING YOU!  Do you hear what i'm trying to say mack?  It's not about who said what, it's about what you feel in your heart.  That's what matters the most because your heart is what leads you.  Sex should not be what you're all about...NO SIR!  Allen:  Are you okay?  Drake: Who the devil are you?  I'm telling you i know kar-ah-te.   i'm sorry for wasting your time but it's really early right now...i don't know where this is going....ahaha

      okay now this is nothing resulting from a melodramatic depression trip...this a direct result of me being up way too late for too many days and then listening to death cab for cutie and then reading a cool post by a friend...check it out...if you like it leave a comment...someone else already thought it was depressing  look at you now you're just another ripple in this sea of idyllic dreamers you're drowning under the pressure where are your bouyant dreams now mr. dreamer?  oh it's all a fantasy it's a round a bout fucking world hello johnny come lately glad you made it to the party the party of reality it's a fucking trip ain't it?  ohhhhhh it's a fantastic life we live wrought with commercialism and whatnot and a president thats been caught with his pants down asleep on the job running us into the ground like a submarine submerged in a sea of dreamers  cadence against cadence we beat always moving forward some taking the time to look back only to be trampled by the driven go getters they become the dead letters at the post office it's all just a dream anyways how can this possibly be a reality?  cranberry juices flowing like the blood through our collapsing veins carry me on to the next life please mr. dreamer can you do that for me? whats this life worth living anyways? it's just one big happy fallacy millions of dazzling streamers to be burned when they hit the ground just one more round? why not we all die anyways so live it up my fellow dreamers live it up
