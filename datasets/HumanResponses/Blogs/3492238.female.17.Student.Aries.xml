      "Do you work at a mushroom farm?"

      Okay. So my dad comes home today and tells me and Holly that he saw a sign on sidney saying how the WELLINGTON MUSHROOM FARM is hiring students for the summer. Holly hates her current job at Maxtech, and so far NO POOLS have called me yet, so you get the picture.  No? Do I have to say more? Alright.  So Holly wants us to work there.. Apparantly she's phoning tomorrow to see what exactly we have to do at the WELLINGTON MUSHROOM FARM. I wonder what the pay is at a mushroom farm. It's hard to take a job seriously when it's called a mushroom farm.. She better not ditch me... working at a MUSHROOM FARM is bad enough.. WORKING ALONE at a MUSHROOM FARM.. well that could be an experience..    (How much does Holly hate her job? lol they gave her a raise today ... now she makes minimum wage. You do the math).  WELLINGTON MUSHROOM FARM!!!! (fresh mushrooms daily)

      Funny how things work out. Funny how people don't talk to me at all and then get mad because they don't know what's going on with me. Funny how I find things out about what's going on in my house through Marilyn, who lives in Trenton. Funny how I'm the last one told about things 2 days after they happen. Funny how people leave. Funny how some people don't support others. Funny. Funny how they're never here. Even when they are here, they're still gone. Funny how they wonder why I'm upset. Funny how they don't understand me. Funny how my ankles aren't getting better and constantly keep going out. Funny how there's nothing I can do about it. Funny. Funny how I feel. Alone. Funny how marks drop. Chemistry and how many moles I don't remember. Funny how things work out. Funny how life passes you by. Funny how if you're lucky, second chances do come around. Luck. Funny.

Funny how I pretend everything's is fine. Funny how I know I might break down and never get up again. Funny.

      tonight was the first night of my 2-weekend hardcore hours course NLS (national lifeguard service) there are about 14 of us, i know a couple people already, everyone is so friendly! its actually a very interesting course.. includes things you wouldn't normally think about. i like that. think of things you gnerally would not think of unless asked to think about it. for instance, the difference between life savers and life guards and just how important being a lifeguard is.. some poeple go to high school and then train to be a life guard as their chosen career path.  for some people, it's a summer job opportunity. for others, its a dream career. interesting.

      We have the right to be loved unconditionally, and our goal is to love you the same.   We have the right to speak our minds, love ourselves, feel our feelings, and strive for our dreams.  We have the right to be ourselves. We have the right to be confident in everything that we do.   We have the right.

      Bottled up inside are the words I never said, the feelings that I hide, the lines you never read. You can see it in my eyes, read it on my face; trapped inside are lies of the past I can't replace. With memories that linger - won't seem to go away. Why can't I be happier? Today is a brand new day. Yesterays are over, even though the hurting's not.  Nothing lasts forever, so I must cherish what I've got.  Don't take my love for granted, for soon it will be gone - all you ever wanted of the love you thought you'd won.  The hurt I'm feeling now won't dissappear overnight, but someday, somehow, everything will be all right.  No more wishing for the past.  It wasn't meant to be.  It didn't seem to last, so now we are free.

      When I ask you to listen to me and you start giving me advice,  you have not done what I have asked.  When I ask you to listen to me and you begin to tell me why  I shouldn't feel that way, you are trampling on my feelings.  When I ask you to listen to me and you feel you have to do something to solve my problem, you have failed me,  strange as that may seem. Listen! All I ask is that you listen. Don't talk or do - just hear me. Advice is cheap; 20 cents will get you both Dear Abby and Billy Graham in the same newspaper.  And I can do for myself; I am not helpless. Maybe discouraged and faltering, but not helpless.  When you do something for me that I can and need to do for myself,  you contribute to my fear and  inadequacy. But when you accept as a simple fact that I feel what I feel, no matter how irrational, then I can stop trying to convince you and get about this business  of understanding what's behind  this irrational feeling. And when that's clear, the answers are  obcious and I don't need advice. Irrational feelings make sense when we understand what's behind them. Perhaps that's why prayer works, sometimes, for some people - because God is mute,  and he doesn't give advice or try  to fix things.  God just listens and lets you work  it out for yourself. So please listen, and just hear me.  And if you want to talk, wait a minute for your turn - and I will listen to you.

      aggghh. Baseball was rough last night - no pitching, played short all game. Wasn't the fact that I was short all night that bothers me. Nlo back up. Ball hit between 1st and 2nd - 1st stays&nbsp;on first, 2nd gets the grounder, short covers for the tag out on 2nd. This is how it should have worked. I was covering 2nd, ready for the throw, when the left fielder had actually run in to 2nd, to also get the ball, which made everyone look ridiculous. Agggghhhhh. Why don't they know what they're doing? I also don't understand why SH and DB put CS back in to pitch for another 2 innings. I mean, at least put SS back in. When yu pitch like that for 3 innings you have to do something about it. I mean, if yu're not going to let me pitch, then thats fine. But you have to prove to yourself that you're good enough to be put back in, something CS didn't do. I work my butt off for nothing, or so it seems. We have another practice on Sunday. I hate knowing it's going to be very frustrating only there's nothing I can do to prevent it, just go.   Uninvited. Can I say anything? No. Because you invited yourself. You wonder why I can't and don't talk to you. This is why. I just can't. There'd be no point. I'm not putting myslef up for a huge blow out. I don't want that. But then I also can't pretend everything is fine forver. I tried that one. Didn't pan out so much. The one day I'll have in 2 weeks to actually talk to MI about anything, and it's already gone before it comes. I don't think anyone quite understands. Invited yourself. But I can't stop you. You can stop me. I make the plans, and you take them away.

      agggghhhhh! Why. That's my question. Why do I work my butt off when there's no one there to back me up. Why... I don;t know. Why do I manage to hurt myself every game? I fell down toay. Total face plant on the stairs. It's a tough day. I hate the grade 9s. Stop complaining, you're so small. Sooo young frosh..&nbsp; I didn't get to pitch. Even though I practiced. SS pitched well, CS wasn't as good, she is really inexperienced. Needs to lose the windmill so she can get her accuracy I think. If she's lucky she'll get a strike if the ball drops but after walking 5 for 2 innings, she still got put back in. So frustrating? I mean, if you're not going to let me pitch, fine. Put SS back in then, but that is just plain ridiculous. AGGGGHHHH. I think I pulled a muscle. That really isn't good. I hope it's okay. Ack. I want back up. Back Up! Back Up! ....nothing.

      aaaaaaaggghhhhh!  there. that feels better. Although my jaw still hurts. How is it every game I play I manage to hurt myself. I blame the ball. That thing is nuts. Maybe it likes me.. hahaha. No? Okay.  It's like I work my butt off to make a play and there's no one there to back me up. 4th. I guess we deserve it as a team, NO PRACTICES!! Hmmm. I wonder why we can't work as a team... fuck. I just want it to be done so I can be with people my own age. So frustrating. I'm seriously trying not to lose it. I didn't get to pitch tonight either, they put CS back in, even though she walked 5 the fist and second innings she pitched. That doesn't make sense to me. I mean, if I'm not pitching fine. But put SS back in then. She was fine tonight. I hate grade 9s! agggghhhh. Stupid ankles. Stop swelling up!

      I'm happy today. Makes sense I suppose. It's a good good day. I wonder.  So what happens now? I wonder. What happens&nbsp;later? I don't know. Who does really? Nothing is ever for certain. Life is what you make of it, so I guess it's all up to me. If I'm not having fun or am not happy, something must be wrong. But not today. I am happy today. Baseball? We'll see. Go and make the best of it, what other choice&nbsp;do I have. &nbsp;Only a couple more to go. I wish I was on KK's team, but that didn't happen. CL rigged her team so of course her team is better. KK is lucky, but in a way she's not, not just KK, CL's team in general. I think it helps to put 13 year olds with a bunch of different ages and experienced players so it helps them. It helped me when I was 13. But not this. Not when her team is purposely good. Extremely good. Good to begin with, not to mention there's always room for improvement. How are they supposed to get better when they don't come to practices? How are they supposed to get better when they don't observe the more experienced, and stick to their own methods? Closed minded. Immature. Have no idea what theyr'e talking about. I think it's even too late to begin.&nbsp; I don't think SH and DB are very good coaches. Not very experienced. And because SH and JB are younger, SH and DB may have experience, but this is a diffferent league now. Age group change. CL is good, well at least I thought she was, but then look at what she did this year. Exactly what RH did last year, and she was the first to complain about that. Yet she has no problem doing it herself. I didn't think she was the type of person to rig her team. Unexpected. I hope I get to pitch. Probably. Yet it's so frustrating when they hit it, and there's no help whatsoever in the field to back you up. It's like at times a one man show and you just hope someone will be there to back you up. I don't feel I have the trust with my team mates that was there last year. I think we had better players last year. A better team. More experienced. I don't understand why CL would do that, especially when she knows what it's like to be on the other end of it, as she was with RH last season. I wonder if I'll play nexxt year. Maybe. Maybe KK and SW will play. Hmmm. I don't know, just get through this week and next week and I'm done. It's like SH doesn't even feel the need for the practices, we called the one last Sunday because I asked for it and I pushed for it. I guess it worked, but ONE good practice is not worth it. We may as well give up. I feel the playoffs are a way of showasing what you're learned as a team, and even how far you've come, as individuals as well as a team. Not this year. My pitching gets better every game - but does SH always put me in? No. I feel he sometimes gives me a chance, but definently favours SS. He would. Makes sense. SS is the kind of person who is aware of it, just because of her situation. Likely. I don't know what else&nbsp;I can do. Push for another practice? Would people come? Would they be willing? Or is it too late.  Make the best of it.

      Birthdays. I like birthdays. I'm the type of person who doesn't get bummed out if someone forgets my birthday - because if they eventually remember and send me a card or something, I get to have a birthday moment all over again. I know some people aren't birthday people - they don't like the attention, or they don't see what the big deal is. But there's one thing about birthdays you can't deny - they're a mark in time worth paying attention to.&nbsp;Each one is like an official acknowledgement that you did, in fact, live another year. And even if it wasn't a happy year, all the more reason to be proud or even dance on a table, if you're really excited. Because you got through it. And I think that in itself is an accomplishment.

      Today I called a little girl "big guy" and an old man "sweetie". I guess I got into a routine with the kids, and i didn't look up to see who was next so I said "Okay Big Guy, go ahead." (down the slide) She just stands there and gives me the stupidest look and says "I'm not a boy".  Once again, I didn't look up to see who was next (you'd think I'd learn from these things, but apparently not) and I said "Okay sweetie, go ahead" (down the slide) and I look up and it's this old man looking at me.. he was pretty excited, I don't think anyone had flirted with him in a while. I also think he thought I was actually hitting on him, because when he came back up, he started hitting on me back, even though mine was a complete accident.  Why is there always no one to witness these things?

But now what I need is the stuff to STOP the peeling, since&nbsp;it has already started. I think I was too late with the peeling prevention plan. Yes that's it. I think that's exactly what happened. Peel it off? I guess so,&nbsp;&nbsp;keepers! Not cool. Sure, I'll have a tan now, but it comes at a price.   Lick! . . . &nbsp;Gulp! . . . Suck!  &nbsp;

      Don't give me no lines and keep your hands to yourself! Suncreen is your friend, no matter what!&nbsp;I like the boats better than the sea doos.&nbsp;I didn't think&nbsp;I would, but I do. It's nice to be dry and warm at times. If we had the seadoos anyways we wouldn't have even been out on them yet. M&B's boat is nice. Really nice. And I had fun, which is always good. I miss that. It doesn't happen that often anymore. I wonder why that is. Life is what you make of it, so maybe it's just me. Hmmm. Interesting. Very interesting. I miss Sara. I can't wait until she comes home. But then I keep thinking of how different next year is going to be, and everyone who will be gone, and how much I will miss everyone. I'll still see them though, no one is going to stop me. That will be my mission. Mission Unstoppable. haha like the movie, only not. really not.  heigh ho heigh ho  to the pool again i go watch the kids come down the slide get hit on by lots of guys heigh ho heigh ho..  i like the beach. it has to be hot though. i think florida is the best for that. one year ago right now.. hmmm. nice.

      so busy last night, the damn kids don't leave! not even for the firworks. hello?? fireworks! one kid thought it was fun to "pretend he was frozen like an iceburg" in the pool and saw nothing wrong with this concept when i talked to him about it. later, the same kid also thought it would be a good idea to stand at the top of the waterslide, pull his bathing suit down, bend over, and stick his finger up his bum. NOT COOL! time out in a chair for that one. i had to walk one kid down, he was crying, "didn't wanna go down that slide". and then when it wasn't as busy, i got to finally go swimming, it was so hot! ah, the perks of my job.

I am a human doodle.   I can't date you, or have a hot plate in my office.   Always no bunny at all!   You're Blursela!   You know what? If we were in prison, you guys would be like my bitches.   Monica bang.   We were on a break!   We can eat the wax, it's organic. Ew. Not the used stuff. Because  that  would be gross? The line is a dot to you!   Oh, cool boat..aghh! Dude, rearrange your bubbles. Honey, cover it up with the boat! Strip Happy Days Game!   No, I'll do something nice. I'll refill her ice trays.    Oh! Do you see any vaseline? Lotion, I have lotion. Will that work? Sure throw some of that on there. Okay hold on...sounds like it's working.. Joey, the lotion and the powder have made a PASTE!  Really, what colour is it?  What difference does that make?  Well, if the paste matches the pants, then you could make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!  Chandler's not there huh..  How cute is the on-call doctor? So cute I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye...  That's not how your dad used to do it..  I mean, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.

      I cannot choose my family.  I cannot change how people are.  I cannot make them see how they are behaving towards my family. I can choose to accept it, and move on.    I can choose my friends. I can be myself. If they don't like me or our lifestyle then fine. If that's how they're choosing to behave, then there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. No one talks to my mom like that.   I can accept my grandparents for what they are and move on, perhaps een laugh about the ridiculousness of theur so choosen behaviour. I am not going to pretend everything is fine when it is no where close to being fine. I can however put it out of my mind, and when it chooses to come back, I will be ready for the rush of emotional feelings that will follow.   If she calls, I will answer and talk about nothing in general.. smile and nod.. on the phone.. if in fact that is possible..   As for visiting the rest of the family, nana and uma included, I honestly do not see myself ever going back there. Why put myself through that? It's not fun to go there and be glared at. Its not fun to walk into a room, and everyone stops talking. You walk into another room and hear your 'beloved cousins' speaking of no one else but your sister, and why she would ever go into engineering, let alone dye her GPA purple. They simply do not understand.   If they cannot accept the fact that Holly and I are growing up and are living our own seperate lives, then that's their problem. They dont come here ever, so they will have no chance to really get to know us again.   You think you know someone, but you have to realize that when you're that close to them, everything seems normal. But once you move away from it all, you also take a step back and realize.. man this is one fucked up system we have here.   If they choose not to talk to me, then they're the ones who are missing out. I will no longer beat myself up with the question of why. There is no explaination for their chosen behaviour, and I have to admit I will never understand what's behind it all. I now have to fill my life again, and also fill the now empty voids my family and my grandparents have created with friends, my parents, holly, marilyn and bill, and most importantly uncle ken and aunt joan. i can't explain how happy and greatful i am that they moved here. they're more like grandparents to me than nana and uma have ever been.   I am moving on. With or without nan. It's that simple.   I am moving on.

      I talked to Buck last night before the game. I figured he would actually take me seriously, rather than Horn would. I don't know. Maybe Horn would have taken me seriously, but I don't know. He's iffy. So I explained to him how was was really upset and stuff, I felt better. He understands me better I think. He knows me that's for sure. I felt better.  Oh and I got 3 up, 3 down! Sweet! I love it when I do that!!

      i am happy to go to work tomorrow in that i wont have to be at home all day. my mom is driving me nuts. she tells me and holly that she doesnt want to be a mother anymore. cool, thanks mom. only not. when we go for supper she sits alone at the end of the table and says nothing. its like she's perpetually upset/pissed off, and nothing changes her mood. none of us actually want to be around her when she is like that. yes i fight with holly about the car and shit, but no it is not a big deal, we get it sorted and no, i do not hate my sister. the whole situation is on crack. my family has no major problems or issues but my mom acts as tho we do. if there was an actual problem, my mom would not be able to handle it at all, so i hope there never is one. wow, i would never say that to my kids. "i dont want to be your mother anymore". oh well..... ps. they've been lecturing us on how to be adults...man i want out of here.

      maybe seeing is better than beleiving. maybe it will fix things if i go tomorrow. i don't want to hurt. i think i'll go. that is the plan. keep it simple. catch up, figure out what's going on.  POKER RUN! This weekend! I'm so excited! Really can't wait. Work tomorrow then I'm outta here all weekend, back in for 4 on Monday. Sweet. It's SM's birthday today. She's out all weekend too. 19. I should call her tomorrow. 19. I know where she is...  Done! All done. Next year, if I'm not on a good team with people my own age, or with KK or SW, then screw it. Where's the fun? I couldn't seem to find it this year. I don't blame Christina for leaving after one game, I mean, she was 20. I'm young to her, not to mention the rest of those children. That's exactly what they are, sooooo young frosh!  Dance shoes today! :) I'm happy I got them. One less thing to do on Friday, so now we don't have to stop in K-Town..that would have been crazy with out boat and everybody else's boat...bah. POKER RUN!! It's supposed to rain on Friday..oh no...we'll have to sit in the Tavern..god I hate it when that happens... lol. Yeah right. The return of Billy and Rodgie.. haha. Erich I can handle, but that Normand scares the shit outta me!! lol. We missed Rod Stewart! Good times. It will be this weekend. Can't wait!  Stirling tomorrow, 6. Tell your friends! lol Wait a minute..your friends are my friends.. (This land is your land..this land is my land...) Spread the word. Need to talk to LB! Straighten things out.  To Bed!

      We were busy at work tonight. Colborne Boys Rep Baseball Team and a 7 year old girl's birthday party..it was quite the combination.  A couple of girls bothered me. Three in particular. One was going into grade 8, one in grade 7 and the other was 8 years old. . . . All wearing string bikinis. The one in grade 7 had black make up running down her face, I seriously couldn't look at her and keep a straight face. The 8 year old had nothing, completely flat, and was acting like she had boobs. This really bothered me. Why can't kids just be kids? When you're 8 you're not supposed to try to look like you're 18. You're supposed to look 8. And that's exactly what it is. Little girls dressing like big girls.

      Maybe AM was right. This morning was like that anyways. I don't know how it happened, things were going well. Or so I thought. She's like that sometimes. Maybe AM was right.  I'm calling SH tomorrow. I'm still really upset about the whole thing. This is just ridiculous. RB thinks I should wait until after the finals so I can talk to him about the whole season and not just one game. They're so young. MI thinks I should go over and talk to him today, before work of course. I don't think I can do it face to face, I'll lose it. This is ridiculous. Why am I letting myself get this bothered? It really does bother me. So young. I'm not calling SH before work, that's not  a good idea. My head needs to be at work when I'm at work. Call tomorrow. But what good will it do? Maybe I should talk to Buck. He'd understand more than Horn would, Buck knows me better. I don't know. I have to talk to Horn at one time or another, Buck will tell Horn anyways, so I may as well talk to Horn. Would Buck take it sesriosly? They're so young. I don't know what to do.

      Water+Slide+German Child=M A D N E S S  We tend to get a lot of germans (and also french come to think of it...) come to stay at the Ramada. I am not sure why, they are just there. Most of the time, at least one parent speaks English, so they can then translate to their children the waterslide rules, however, the kids almost never speak English. As I discovered last night...  We were busy to begin with, our limit is 42 people max, and we had been at about 37 since noon. ("Why can't we sit here in the hot tub again? There's only 20 of us in here..." "Yes. That is exactly it. There are 20 of you in there. There is supposed to be 8!" - How is that even ccomfortable? Don't get me started. lol)  It is now 5:30. You have a nervous German kid, unsure of what to do... What will you do??  So we finally come to the conclusion that his father will catch him at the bottom of the slide, and after using a wide variety of hand gestures I got him to sit down on his bum and go down the slide. (No, you do not want to know the hand gestures I used! lol)  Well, I guess his bathing suit was sticking to the slide (This happens with some synthetic materials.. lol that was very technical.. thank you! lol *bows* -lol that was for you Mark.. lol) and I think he got scared, because he stood up (IN THE SLIDE!) and started grabbing the side of the slide, and kept looking down the middle, preparing to jump or something..and proceeded to WALK DOWN the slide (because apparently that was the answer...)  By this time, Adam is also at the bottom using a wide variety of hand gestures, trying to get the kid to sit back down on his bum to go down the slide. This didn't pan out so well.. (You think??) because there's water shooting down the slide.. when you add a kid walking down all that, it's not good.. so I had to shut off the slide and Adam had to climb in and get him. I was so worried he was going to jump.  Why are all these Germans here anyway?

      I had fun today. They were okay. I like doing my own things. I didn't think they were going to be okay, and in a way I guess they weren't at times, but you can't have it all, I have to accept it like. Back tomorrow. Double header tomorrow night, I hope the practice went well last night. In a way I wish I could have been there. I don't like them, but you can't make the best of it if you can't come. I hope he got it. Probably. Either way I guess it doesn't matter that much. Very laid back. In fact,  too  laid back. I had fun today.  I fell down a lot today. Maybe it was one of those days. Maybe it was the sun. Maybe it was the jello shooters. Perhaps. lol Total face plant in the sand...very very  very  embarassing! Slipping in the boat, standing up and turning around? More so funny rather than embarassing. It's a falling day.
