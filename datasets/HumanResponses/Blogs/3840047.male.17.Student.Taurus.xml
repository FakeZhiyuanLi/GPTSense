       What happens to a heart unanswered.  Does it throng evermore louder, till its call is undeniable Or does it wilt, with the sorrow of emptiness Unrequited, will it blacken with bitterness Can it harden like stone, so it may never  ever be unanswered again So the hurt can not wound Yet the wound does show Through  cracks of granite flow despair and it beats no more Does it die, does it bleed Unanswered, it is a heart no more.

      It is said almost to the point of cliché that history is destined to repeat itself, that ingenuously mankind is destined to repeat, and relive the mistakes of the past. The people of this age are the very paragons of this notion. This nation was galvanized into political uproar after claims were made that praise to a deity had no place, held no currency, in the pledge of allegiance. The unilateral rebuke was swift and strong, and this movement was soon silenced. In this age, in classrooms and workplaces across the nation, millions of citizens recite the mantra of the pledge. They are inculcated with these words, yet they have little if no comprehension of the magnanimous connotations behind them. This pledge is a promise to indivisibly protect and promote liberty, and to insure justice for all. Tell me of liberty whilst the government of this nation promotes legislation that blatantly curtails  the civil liberties of its people. Tell me of justice when the government of this nation incarcerates one thousand men without right to basic representation.There exist forces in this nation that willingly sully the name of freedom as a means of relinquishing the rights of this populace, who are ingenuously unaware that they live as slaves only by their own acquiescence. 228 years ago to this very day, perhaps to this very hour a people, not bound by race, nor bound by decent, yet united by creed, by the ferverent pursuit of the inalienable, immutable rights of life, liberty and justice for all, struck out against the imperialist forces of the world and built upon the foundation of hope perhaps one of the greatest nations ever to grace this earth. Ask yourself would these same founders smile upon the state of the union today, or should I say the state of the American Empire?

      I am not a self professed poet, and I do know that it is most definitely not my forte , but here are a few samples of poetry I have done this year in English.  Ineffable words do you no justice like phantasms they are empty, devoid of the light that is you they scrawl across my page, unaware to the futility of their facade for they are not you, nor can they ever hope to be for you are ineffable   The Music of Nat King Cole   Refined A vintage wine splendidly aged Untainted Anxiously I sample this pure spirit Jubilation Euphoria, I feel its golden rapture disseminating throughout my being Crisp Sparkling, tantalizing, a refreshing indulgence Sensuous Intoxicating, alluring, seductive, I whole heartedly succumb to its influence Need I long for more.  Sorrow  Sorrow is as the January wind, abstract in its very essence, Invisible, ethereal, elusive yet existent Deadly, at its worst a chilling viscous entity, depriving us of vitality Its presence is felt by all, undeniable, irresistible At our backs it thrusts, and we in turn run, hoping to elude At our front it scours the exposed extremities, those which we have left unprotected There is no shelter; no haven from its touch for it is natural, essential At times its commanding concentrate is tangible, overpowering, terrible At times it is gentle, crisp, a refreshing reminder of life We learn to live with its cold presence; we steel ourselves,  Encase ourselves in sheets of cotton; we cope with its angry squall,  Continuing with our lives.

      Here is a speach written by David Adewumi, Russel Kracaw, and myself. In English we where given the task of writing a persuasive essay,on any given contraversial topic, regardless of personal belief. We chose capital punishment. and here is the result. Enjoy ...                                                                                          					           			  In this age of wonder we have arrived at the very apex of technological advancement, we have pondered the inexplicable intricacies of creation, and presumptuously we take pride in the establishment of a civilized society. Yet have we indeed reached the pinnacle of our societal potential? The history of man is embellished by achievement, yet marred by atrocity, and whilst we acknowledge these superficial achievements, we pay no heed to the blatant abhorrence that has been incorporated into the root of in this nation. What age do we live in that advocates death in place of a chance at repentance, that establishes vengeance as an integral factor in its judiciary system, that zealously supports the practice of legalized murder in the name of personal retribution? We have erred. We have staryed from the path proposed by the founders of this nation. Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, these ideals embody the aspirations of our forbearers. This nation was founded upon these immutable principles; this nation founders gave their lives in the hope that their children would realize, would actualize these three essential principles. Instead we have tarnished their legacy, tainting such magnanimous an institution as Justice with the barbaric, anachronistic practice of capital punishment.  The morals of America have been sold, replaced by inherently capitalistic ethics. We are governed by the dollar; it has infiltrated our minds erasing our ethics, replacing them with capitalistic greed. So it comes to no surprise that some would dare to measure the significance of life, in terms of dollars, and of cents. It comes to no surprise that some would weigh the significance of sentient human life, in terms of tax dollars. It comes to no surprise that the leaders of this nation would dare to place a price tag on life, on liberty, and on justice. Yet let us for a moment address the issue of cost, as it seems that some are governed more by the pocketbook than by logic. The supporters of this depraved institution proclaim that their hard earned tax dollars should not go towards sustaining the life of one deemed unfit to live in our civilized society, that the upkeep of these miscreants drains our tax reserves, therefore the cheap butchery of these malefactors would indeed be a sound solution. Yet in this fallacious, unfounded argument lies the greatest deceit of all. In a compilation of data by the state governments of the United States of America it is estimated that a single case warranting the death penalty, from point of arrest to execution ranges from $1 million to 3$ million. Other studies have even estimated that this figure is as high as 7 $ million. Cases resulting in life imprisonment average around $ 500, 000 each for a 60 year life sentence.  The American public has been fooled, you have been indoctrinated with lies, the backers of capital punishment have insulted you with their treachery and still you rally blindly behind their cause? Not only is life long imprisonment much less expensive than capital punishment, but state spending on capital punishment is directly linked to the degradation of funding available for expenditure on essential public services. It is Ironic that 500 police officers where laid off in the state of New Jersey as a direct effect of the implementation of the death penalty. It is Ironic that the very entity that stands between the upholding citizens, and the criminals, between the single mother in a low-income development and the neighborhood thug, between your children, and the pernicious, predatory rapists, is being directly weakened by capital punishment. Yet let us embark on a theoretical tangent. If in fact it were cheaper to execute these offenders, does this validate the taking of a human life? Can any value be placed on a human life? When did we decide that that money is the equivalent of the pursuit of happiness? Or more importantly when did we come to the audacious conclusion that we could balance the scales of life with money, and negate a God given right. It has also been stated that capital punishment acts as a crime deterrent. That by instilling the fear of punishment by death will deter a possible offender from committing their crime. By making such a presumption we presume that the people who commit these crimes are in full possession of all their capacities, that murder is always premeditated, and that these criminals stop to access the pros and cons of such an act. Yet the basis of many an argument supporting capital punishment is that by committing as irrational an act as homicide, it is clear that the criminal, has lost the ability to discern right from wrong therefore, they have relinquished their status as a human being and deserve to be slaughtered as animals. So in affect the two arguments are antithetical, conflicting and nullifying one another in such an obvious manner. How does a society that has established itself as the moral standard for the rest of the world, which esteems itself as the most civilized and advanced, still practice such a primitive, ineffective, obsolete means of crime prevention. Why does our country still at the dawn of a new century linger upon the ethical relic of an eye for an eye? It has been argued that the homicide rate has dramatically decreased since the reinstatement of capital punishment nation wide, yet there exist a plethora of external factors that could influence this decline. Would we rather believe that practiced barbarism is an effective way of instilling fear into the public, or that we as a people have matured, have grown and have become more civilized? It has been established that capital punishment is an inadequate means of crime prevention. Therefore what is the purpose of capital punishment? Does it exist as a means to gain personal retribution for the victims loved ones? Taking the life of another cannot possibly fill the void of the loss of a loved one, of a father, a wife, of a child. Capital Punishment should not be used as a tool of vengeance to punish murder with murder. The existence of the death penalty derails the purpose of our criminal justice system that exists to rehabilitate, not condemn. We must strive to find more humane ways to make these people repay their substantial debt to society, if in case reintegration is not a plausible option. We the people of the United States, have a direct obligation to uphold the highest of moral standings on every last facet of our society as we embark on a quest to usher less fortunate nations into the role of democracy, of liberty, of justice, and of freedom. We cannot afford to seem hypocritical in the eyes of our international peers. The United States should exemplify that rehabilitation, and repentance takes precedent over condemnation and death. Let us be a source of moral clarity for this earth, not a detriment to morality.  The very concept of capital punishment is in itself, morally redundant. It is true that one cannot seek to condone the reprehensible act of murder; it is a sordid affair, and perhaps the most deplorable action ever partaken by man, yet to punish a murderer by murder? There can be no gain in this. One could argue that by supporting Capital punishment we are aiding society by ridding it of its unwanted elements, and in effect improving the general welfare of the common man. In theory this concept has its appeal, in practice this concept had once before manifested itself in the history of mankind. It was known as the Holocaust. We are human, we must be humane lest we live as beasts acting purely on stimulus, propelled by the need for immediate gratification, constantly striking out in retaliation, abandoning the notion of preconception, of thought, of rational. Rationalization, after all this is all that separates humanity from the lesser beings, the ability to discern right from wrong, to take action whilst perceiving consequence. Where in case we might falter, our ingenuity has created a failsafe. It is known as Law. By incorporating this practice into the law of the land, we set an extremely nefarious precedent to the actual concept of law. Is the purpose of law, and the criminal justice system to preserve order, and stem the occurrence of vigilante like action, or does law exist to facilitate the concept of vengeful retribution? If so we have indeed created a fascinating paradox.  	I do not deem it necessary to continue refuting specious arguments, nor do I find it necessary to point out the multitude if reasons why capital punishment cannot be allowed to continue in The United States of America, or in the entire world. I trust that we acknowledge the struggle that our forefathers, the oppressed and disaffected of many a nation, who embarked on a perilous quest to establish a land free of the evils that they had left behind. A land that advocated three essential ideals. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I trust that we the people make the right decision and appose this immorality indivisibly as one nation, with liberty and justice for all.

      I love to write. Its what i do so yeah here is a little somthing i pumped out at the end of 11th grade. its not my best but i am proud  of it. SOOOO enjoy .  “ We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.” 							- Ralph Waldo Emerson   Through these words taken from the Self-Reliance, the definitive work of transcendent thought, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the forefather of the transcendentalist movement  sought to liberate his brethren from their self-imposed regression. Emerson  sought to erase this stain of  mediocrity, of… from the hearts of mankind, and open our souls to the ignored unlimited potential inherent in the heart of  every man, woman, and child born unto this earth. We, the children of Eden, the generation of tomorrow have made this world our sanctuary, a haven for cowardice. Humanity has grown to fear, to loathe its very nature, supplanting the intrinsic sprit of ingenuity, of individuality, of identity with suppression, stagnation, and the desire to  preserve the status quo. Stemming from the basest of  inclinations, we have created a totalitarian entity that deprives us of our divine nature. We have created Society. A dictator, guised as a benevolent force. Society does not protect, it oppresses, Society does not dream, no it’s thoughts lie stagnant, deteriorating in its presumptuous comfort. Perhaps the most frightening aspect of society is its absolute power over its populace, who are unaware that they live as slaves only by their own acquiescence. 		We are born into this world as was ordained by the creator. We  are born with the unique ability to appreciate, to adapt, to analyze, and most importantly to ponder. As a youth one strives to make sense of earth, searching reverently for truth and understanding.  This precious time is short lived. Society deems that there exists an age where individuality holds no currency in its domain. Systematically inculcating the youth of the world, with societal norms, instilling them with morals which have no significance or application, simply  because one cannot find significance in a given, one must be able to derive in order to comprehend. Society trains the progeny of  hope to be , harbingers of despair devoid of nature. By gearing our future to revere the lessons of the past above all else we destroy the truest part of our being, the ability to dream. For what are dreams but manifestations of our aspirations, our hopes, fears, the subconscious. 	Man has been neutered, we have been made to apologize for who we are, and strive to become what we must. This perverse institution has taught us to ignore the voice within for fear of being ostracized by our constituents. For fear, fear is the driving force behind this machine. Fear is the universal power source that galvanizes every component of society into fluidic motion. Spawned from  the fear of change, the fear of the unique spark of brilliance that radiates within the heart of humanity. The fear that not a select few, but everyone has the indiscriminate power to contribute, to make their impact on this planet. The fear that intelligence is not selective, that potential is abundant, this is what motivates our society to enslave us.  	The individual has been subjected to persecution, since man tasted the nature of evil. Initially those who chose not to conform would perish or suffer not as a direct result of the will of society, but as a result of not being part of a society that provides warmth, and shelter, the physical needs. In this, Society usurped the ultimate power from the individual, the power of self-determination, and ordained that to live one must conform. Those who did not, who realized their individual potential, and used this to manifest the divine, those who looked outside themselves not for comfort or protection, but for understanding and truth, where indeed struck down. Society crucified Jesus for daring to propose a spiritual life, for declaring himself a law unto his own, for advocating the existence of a being more substantial than itself. Society assassinated Dr Mr. Luther King for his civil disobedience, his defiance of its insatiable presence by leading a revolution of freedom. Society slaughtered Millions of Jews, for the simple fact that their existence did not concur with its ordained plan. Everyday society bludgeons the soul, the heart, and self-worth of a child by deeming it unfit, whether due to race, class, or nationality.  	It is inevitable that we will one day realize our divine  potential. It is inevitable that we will learn to look to ourselves as a standard, to look into our deepest conviction instead of ascribing to the values of another. Yet what frightening is the fact that we are comfortable living in this perpetual state of mediocrity, that we willingly ascribe to this mentally languishing doctrine. The longer we allow ourselves to see human law as an absolute, the longer we allow ourselves to be subject to this mental bondage. To subjugate a man one need not break his body it is ephemeral, the pain cannot sully the mind. To truly subjugate a man one must break the spirit, for in their lies the key to his power. We must not allow the spirit of humanity to be broken, but rather strive to awaken the spirit in our hearts.
