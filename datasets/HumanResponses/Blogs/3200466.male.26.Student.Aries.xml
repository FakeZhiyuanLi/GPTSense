      Hey everyone.  Just a quickie today, lots of work to do here in the orbiting HQ.  I'm going to cut the grass and TRY to setup some lights that I purchased a few weeks back.  These are the kind of lights that you see in a persons yard that make their sidewalk look like a model airplane runway.  ALSO, comments are now turned on, so anyone can comment on each and every blog I post... and I redesigned the template.  So tell me what you think....

      Well, another day, another big FAT $0.00!!!!  Hopefully business will start picking up and I can take the kids camping somewhere OTHER than my moms backyard!  Speaking of my mom, she had a run-in with a popular fat lady's clothing store this weekend, and she came out the loser.  It makes me wonder how many other people have frustrations like this?  Let's see, how can we put something together, like a bulletin board, where everyone in the known world can access it, and keep it cheap?  *gasp*, the internet!  Will investigate what domains are available, more news to follow....    BTW,  Love ya honey..... Hope The Boy's ok...
