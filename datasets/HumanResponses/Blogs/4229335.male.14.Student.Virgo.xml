       I finally gave in. The temptation of posting my opinion on the world-wide-web is simply too much to resist. Yeah, I know I said that I hated blogs. Well, I still hate them. If you have to go to the bathroom, do it now. This is going to be a long one.  At first, there was one. Then two. Then many many more.  Blogs are everywhere now. On the news, in books, and in movies. Everyone seems to have his own opinion on everything and everyone seems to think his life are important enough to warrant a website dedicated to him. I  hate that. I hate the seemingly conceited nature of bloggers. Who gives a fuck? Who gives a fuck what you like or dislike? Who gives a fuck if you think orange juice is better than apple juice?  I thought that blogs were a fad. Instead of enervating, blogging grew stronger and stronger. I was surprised but I guess it was inevitable. America is all about expressing yourself. With the growth of the internet comes the growth of free expression. Blogs provide an outlet for "creative" minds. Too bad...I still hate blogs.  I feel guility looking at blogs by people I don't know very well. I get an inside look on somebody's life while remaining anonymous. Kind of like a stalker. Yeah, I overthink everything. It's a curse. Blogs are also a waste of time. Especially chick blogs. Goddamnit. wHy tO deY tyP3 lykE diS? Enough to make me want to shoot myself. Why do people reply to their own jokes by typing "hahaha" in their posts? Don't insult my intelligence by telling me when to laugh. The hate continues...  Yes, I'm from Temple City. No, I'm not a Christian like 99% of the town. I will go into the Christianity issue some other time. The point is, I don't agree with many people and I'm fustrated that I can do nothing about it. An one-sided battle is unfair so here is my weapon. My own blog. Fuck you all.

        I stay up at night sometimes. Inevitably, I would turn on the television. Late night programming consist of talk shows, infomericals, and those "Girls Gone Wild" commericals (which I thoroughly enjoy watching). But now, there is the Olympics. Surprisingly, it manages to capture my interest in the, otherwise, dull sports. I would never watch swimming or gymnastics during the rest of the year but everything seems more interesting when different country are involved. I guess I was just tired of seeing black people dominate every sport. But that's just me.  Opening Ceremonies         Two words: Huge blunt.  Swimming  There are some things I don't understand about the sport. Why are there 4 different types of swim styles? What is the history of all the styles? The breaststroke is probably invented because it is so versatile. Breaststroke is not particularly tiring and it can get pretty fast. It gives the swimmer a greater view of his or her surroundings. The freestyle is pure speed but the swimmer have no idea where the hell he's going. The backstroke is not very useless unless the swimmer wants to look at the clouds or something. And then there is the butterfly. I bet the person who invented the butterfly is a complete dope fiend. The butterfly is the hardest stroke to learn and it drains your strength. It has no practical applications whatsoever. If you are stranded on an island, don't try to swim off the island with the butterfly. If you are trying to rescue your drowning friends, don't use the butterfly because they would be dead by the time you get there.  Is it just me or does swimming look extremely slow on television? The damn commentors too. They always tell you who the favorite is to win the race and guess what? The favorite wins. Those damn people are too smart for their own good. Nonetheless, I can never get sick of hearing the commentor say that one swimmer is a better "breast-stroker".      Gymnastics  Painful. It is disturbing to see someone hold their own weight with just their arms. I feel that at anytime, their arms might just snap off its sockets. Then again, they all weigh like five pounds.  A particularly dangerous "apparatus" is the pummel horse.               I find it surprising that anyone have the confidence to swing their legs (along with their testicles) so close to 2 metal bars. Several times, the gymnist will miss and land on the horse, using their crotch to break their fall. I wonder if anyone ever miss and land on their crotch into the metal bars. I have a sick mind.  Basketball  I watch so much NBA basketball that I lost interest during the Olympics. But I did watch the game against Puerto Rico. Watching that game, I can't believe that the United States was previously undefeated. There are some fundemental problems with putting together a team full of NBA players. NBA players are greedy bastards. They get paid millions and millions of dollars a year to play basketball and they still cry when they get a slight paycut. Professional athletes should be paid. It's their job to entertain me and they do it well. Other players from other countries will jump at the opportunity to represent their country at the Olympics. But not the United States. Many NBA players actually decline the request. Why? Because they are not getting paid. When they do get paid, it's not enough. Patriotism is strong in USA but obviously not among basketball players. Another problem is the lack of unity. These players on the US team are from different NBA teams. They have no experience playing together. The other countries have players that played together as a team for many years.  Greedy bastards + showoffs + stressed coaches - cooperation = USA basketball team.   I will enjoy the 2004 Olympics as much as I can now. After 4 years, I wouldn't even remember that there was an Olympics that took place in Athens.
