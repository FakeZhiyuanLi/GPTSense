      Hello, all! I've been cleaning a bunch all day, so I'm writing now!  I've been making a bunch of dolls today, and I still need to make a site for them!!! Again, if you can't wait until I make the site, my email is  urlLink melmel12889@aol.com !  To name the dolls I've been making, I've been using a place called babynames.com. It shows what some names mean, so I'm going to put up all my friends' names' meanings. I will have comments in parenthesis.  Jordyn - Descendant (of what? i have no idea...) Lauren - Crowned with Laurel (awwww! Lauren has a crown! she's a princess!!!) Tawny - Tanned Hide (poor, poor Tawny! moooooo! sorry, i had to do that) T.J. - A Twin (there's TWO OF YOU?!?!?!) Elisa - Consecrated to God (you go, Elisa!!!) Erica - Honorable Ruler (MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!) Jeff - Gift of Peace (i'm not too sure about this one.... LOL JK!!)  And my name!!!!! Melanie - Dark Beauty (how IRONIC!!! i'm not dark OR a beauty! it should mean pale ugly)

      Hey guys! I know I haven't written in a while, but I've been so busy! We've been working on my room, I went to see a movie, and last night I slept over at my friend's&nbsp;(Tawny) house!   Tawny's new sister, Kate, is sooooooo adorable! She is such a little bity thing though! I think if I just barely touched her, she would break into a million billion pieces!   I was talking with Tawny about how I thought TJ was avoiding me, and she kept smiling and looking suspicious. I knew she knew something, so I made her spill the beans. She said that TJ told her that he's afraid of asking me to be his girlfriend, because he thinks if anything ever happened to where we'd break up, that we wouldn't be close friends anymore! I think that is so sweet of him to value our friendship so much! ::dreamy sigh:: It makes me like him all the more! But, he should really have confronted me about something like that. I mean, I'm totally crazy about him, and I could have told him that I wouldn't ditch him as a friend just because something stupid came between us. I'm not that kind of person! I try to be a loyal friend to every friend I make, and it wouldn't be like me to not be friends with someone over a stupid argument. I just wish he had told me about this and not Tawny, that way I wouldn't have gotten so irritated with him! I seriously thought he was avoiding me!   Okay, I've been working on a bunch of dolls lately, so I'm going to try to send them to you again! Let's all cross our fingers and hope it works! ::crosses fingers::&nbsp;&nbsp;   ::uncrosses fingers and starts crying:: Sorry guys, but it's not working! Again, if you' d like to see any of my dolls, email me at  urlLink melmel12889@aol.com ! Also again, I'll post and tell you if my email changes! I may get a site going where I'll put my dolls up and I'll give you the link, but for now, you'll just have to email me!  Hugs and kisses! I'm goin' to bed!

      Okay, it's really wierd. I think TJ is avoiding me. (TJ and I like each other, but we're both&nbsp;not allowed to date yet) He hasn't replied to any of my emails,&nbsp;and every time I'm on the internet he signs off. I have no idea what's going on, and I would like to find out. If he doesn't like me anymore, he could at least tell me to my face instead of being a coward. And he should know I wouldn't care if he doesn't like me anymore. I mean, we could still be friends. Why do guys have to be so much trouble? &nbsp; Anyways, I went running errands with my parents today. Kyle (my 7-year-old brother) was such a brat. Every store we went into, he threw a fit because he wanted a toy. He is soooo annoying, but he can still be cute sometimes. (sometimes meaning when he's sleeping) Oh well. I still love him. &nbsp; My mom and I got ribbon to use as belts at the store. It's a great idea (and the style is coming back from the 80's), but I think we got the ribbon too short (1 1/2 yards). Oh well. They were only 74 cents each. We can always get more for real cheap. &nbsp; I made dolls earlier of me and my friends at prom (in the future). I'm going to try and send it to you guys................ &nbsp; &nbsp; Okay, well it's not working, so if you'd like to see it, email me at:&nbsp;  urlLink melmel12889@aol.com   But, I may change my&nbsp;email address later, so I'll update you if it does. &nbsp; Hugs and kisses!

      OMG! I got back from this play/musical last night called Red, Hot &amp; Cole. It was SOOOO good! It was a musical about Cole Porter's life, and it had a bunch of his songs in it! I really liked it, and I recognized some of his songs. I've been&nbsp;looking at the lyrics a bunch on the internet. &nbsp;  Mah Jongg was a bunch of fun! Haley (my sis) won&nbsp;on a closed hand!!! (just know that a closed hand is very good) Also, the news filmed it, and......... MY HAND WAS ON THE NEWS!!!!! lol! But it's true! It was a ton of fun! &nbsp; When we were at Chocolate Camp one night, we watched a movie: Fiddler On The Roof. It was really good! It was so sad and funny at the same time! The music was great too! I love old musicals! They're so good! &nbsp; Okay, well I just got home today, and I'm really tired, so I'll write more later! &nbsp; Hugs and kisses!

      Okay, to fill you guys in I'm going to tell you what Chocolate Camp is:  Chocolate Camp is when my siblings and I go to my grandparents' in Tyler and we spend a couple of days there. What we do is we eat TONS AND TONS of chocolate. I'm at Chocolate Camp right now, and we just made a triple chocolate cake. It's in the oven and it smells soooooooooooooooo good! Anyways, we'll also do stuff like go to the lake, get manicures, go shopping, work at my aunt's mother-in-law's jewelry store: Katie's for merchandise, and we'll bake, and bunches more! It's so much fun! My grandmother, Nana, and my grandfather, Granddaddy, are so cool! It's fun to talk to them about stuff, and they tell me the funniest stories about my mother that I can taunt her with! ;)  I haven't written any other poems yet, but I'm planning to soon. Just, nothing has come to me yet. Sounds cheesy, but that's how it works for me. Maybe I'll write a poem about Chocolate Camp! lol! I'll be here until Friday, so I have plenty of time for inspiration! I bet Nana and Granddaddy would enjoy it too!  I feel so sick... I just licked the bowl of melted chocolate for the cake. Good. But sickening. My Aunt Julie and baby cousin Cate will be here soon! I'll talk more later!  Hugs and kisses!

      My sister and I have been playing a lot of tennis lately, and we're getting pretty good! It's also great excercise, and it's a fun way to keep in shape.  I've been trying to get in shape a lot lately. I've been drinking lots of water, stretching every night, playing tennis, and roller blading. Also, I'm REALLY close to doing the splits! Go me! And, I've lost about 15 pounds since Christmas! The only bad thing is that I keep gaining pounds by giving into my favorite foods like chocolate. Once I start eating it, I can't stop! I really need to start learning to grab a fruit or another glass of water every time I get hungry. But, it's nice to know your accomplishing something out of your hard work!  I'm really excited about starting High School a little now. I'm taking Dance next year as a PE credit, and I think I'm really going to enjoy it! I'm also excited about meeting new people and starting classes and stuff. The only thing I'm really afraid of is the hard work and the thing that I may choose things like electives that I'll regret in the future... I hope I made the right choice! OO! That reminds me! I need to tell the High School counselor that I'm taking Spanish! I've decided to nix Theater, because I can always do extra things like plays at Frisco Community Theater. I just hope I'm not loading myself up with work for school! I have a problem with procrastinating. I always put my homework off to real late at night, and then I'll play on the computer or watch TV during the afternoon. It's real bad, and I need to stop so I can do well in High School!  On Wednesday, I'm leaving for a Mah Jongg Tournament in Tyler, Texas. Mah Jongg is this really funky, challenging Chinese game with a bunch of tiles and stuff. It's confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's second nature to you and you can start tricking other people up.  I really need to start getting back to writing poems. I used to write poems all the time, but now I'm really slacking. I think I'll write one tonight, but I need to get some sort of inspiration. I adore writing poems, and it's wierd not writing them for so long. If I write one tonight, I'll let you see it tomorrow.  I think this is probably the longest entry I've written. Hmm. That's funny. I just started babbling on here and I got all this! Oh well! I guess I'm just very luquacious! (luquacious = very talkative)  Hugs and kisses!

      My aunt let me drive her car twice down the street when she was here! I went a whopping 15 miles per hour! lol!  Other than that, there is really nothing to say right now!  Hugs and kisses!

      IT IS SO HOT OUTSIDE!!!! I swear I'm out there for 5 seconds and I'm sweating. And my baby cousin wants to go out there a bunch. Also, the whole yard is swarming with misquitoes! I have a bite on each foot!  I'm gonna watch 7th Heaven now. I LOVE THAT SHOW!  Hugs and kisses!

      Yeah, sure I'm tall, blonde, and (as other people say) skinny. But my life is totally not perfect. I have got to be the most clumsy person I've ever met. My feet are gigantuous (if that's even a word). Also, I have stupid braces that are keeping me from having my most beloved condoment: mustard... ::dreamy sigh:: I'm also wierd. I've been known as the wierd girl ever since I can remember. I'm usually really shy when I first meet people, but once I get to know them.... Well, let's just say that I become very, uh, perky? I just become my normal self, which really isn't that normal. Anyways, I'm starting High School this fall, and I'm so nervous. It also kind of sucks, because I'm not even sure if I like the class choices I'm going to take. If you guys could help me out, I'd really appreciate it. I can't decide if I should take Spanish 1 or Theater Arts.... I'm already taking Choir, which I love. And I adore Theater, but I really want to get a start on Spanish! Please help me!  Hugs and kisses!
