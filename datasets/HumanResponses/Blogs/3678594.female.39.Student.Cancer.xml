      This morning, I came online specifically to hunt around for yummy recipes for my Lughnasadh dinner on Sunday. All was going well until I ran across a Nigella forum ...... a couple of hours later, I'm still egrossed in the forum, my pen idle and my paper blank.    I would feel a bit guilty about frittering away the morning if I didn't adore Nigella Lawson. I am thrilled, quite frankly, to find this wonderful forum, not only because I can chat with others who adore Nigella, too, but also because the site posts some of the recipes from her books that I am not lucky enough to own at present.    Of Nigella's cookbooks, I own three: How To Eat, How To Be A Domestic Goddess, and Forever Summer. I actually have two copies of HTBADG - both paperback and hardcover. I purchased the paperback copy just recently. My reasoning being that the hardcover edition, along with FS, is packed away with most of my cookbooks at my house in Ontario and I don't have access to it at the moment. I justify my actions with the rationale that when I do get all my books shipped here, I can give the paperback copy to my cousin.     When you are a compulsive cookbook addict, any little excuse will do. Hehe.    I am now looking forward to getting Nigella Bites and her new book, Feast, which is coming out this September.    If you love Nigella as much as I do, check out her great forum -  urlLink Nigella's Kitchen .

      Well, I think summer is finally here. The temperature has been hovering in the mid- to upper-twenties all week, although the humidity has made it seem much warmer. I look forward to summer so much during our long, cold Canadian winters, all the while [conveniently] forgetting that I don't really like hot weather. Now that it is here, I find myself lying prone on the couch with no plans to move until autumn rolls around.     One thing I do love about summer is the food. I love going to the grocery store and seeing the big bins full of watermelons, the wonderful displays of berries and cherries, the lovely fresh herbs and leafy lettuces, blushing peaches, and stacks of farm-fresh corn. The lush produce available now makes my weekly trip to the market a pleasure ....... the air conditioning is a welcome treat, too!    There are certain foods that I always associate with summer. I was thinking about this last night and I find it amusing that so many of my fondest memories are tied up with food and cooking. My summer foods are:        Rhubarb - my father's all-time favorite dessert was rhubarb pie. We had a big rhubarb patch in our backyard that was THE local hangout for the neighborhood cats. Whenever anyone approached the patch, cats would explode out of it and run off in all directions. It was enough to give a person a heart attack if you weren't expecting it. LOL     Lemonade and iced tea - I think the reason I am partial to lemonade is because I love the Country Time Lemonade commercials ...... 'summer will be a short 54 days this year' [unless you're in Canada, then it's only 27 days, lol]. I like my lemonade with mint and there is a fantastic recipe for Pineapple Mint Lemonade in The Vegetarian Gourmet: Easy Lowfat Favorites by Bobbie Hinman.     Corn on the cob - I remember having corn with my father one night when I was young. My cob had a hole in it and I told my father I wasn't eating it because there was a worm in it. He insisted there wasn't. The corn had been boiled and if there had been a worm, he was dead in the bottom of the pot [lovely dinner conversation, eh?]. I went to take a bite and out popped a little worm. Needless to say, I did not finish dinner that night! Years later, I repeated this story to my children. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of telling it at dinner while we were having corn. I thought it was really funny. My kids were not amused and neither one of them would eat the corn!     Peaches - my son's favorite fruit. Not a summer goes by that I don't make something with fresh peaches. Peaches are also my cousin's favorite for pie. Pastry-making is not an art I excel at; yet never does a summer pass without someone asking me to bake a pie. What is it with people and pie? Why can't they all like crumbles or cake or anything that doesn't involve pastry?  Black Forest cake - now this is not a food that most people would associate with hot summer days, and you're probably thinking it's a misprint, but it isn't. My birthday falls in the middle of July and when I was growing up, my father would buy me a Black Forest cake every year for my birthday. Now I make my own fat-free, low-sugar, vegan Black Forest cake. I think it's even better than the bakery version, and I look forward to it so much that I don't even mind turning on the oven and heating up the kitchen!    I do have many more foods that I and my children enjoy all summer long, but those five stand out in my mind. I wonder which foods my children will have fond memories of when they grow up?

      This is a very curious dessert - despite the large amount of bread, it seems very light. At the same time, it is very filling because of the bread! The berry flavor is exquisite and intense. A small portion goes a long way.  My recipe is loosely based on a recipe by Ina Garten [the Barefoot Contessa]. She uses 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 2 tablespoons of Framboise, and a loaf of brioche bread. She also uses more raspberries than I do, but, hey, I'm a single parent and raspberries [not to mention Framboise] are expensive!  Summer Pudding:  1 quart strawberries, sliced 2 cups blueberries 1 cup raspberries 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup water 13-15 thin slices of white or whole wheat egg-free, dairy-free bread, crusts removed  In a medium-sized saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil. Add the strawberries and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the blueberries and raspberries and simmer 1 minute more. Remove from heat. [If using the Framboise, add now.]  In a medium-sized bowl or souffle dish, ladle in about 1/2 cup of the berry/juice mixture. Arrange a single layer of bread over the berries. Continue layering the berries/juice and the bread, cutting the bread to fit, if necessary. End with berries.  Place plastic wrap over the surface of the pudding. Top with a plate and set a heavy can on the plate to weigh everything down. Refrigerate overnight. Unmold the glorious  red pudding onto a plate to serve.  Makes 6 servings

      I did end up buying some local strawberries when I went grocery shopping this week - two quarts of smallish, brilliantly red berries that look like they are just bursting with flavor. They look so nice that I feel compelled to do something special with them other than the usual shortcake.  This is where I hit a culinary roadblock. I'm not a huge fan of strawberries [gasp!] and my preparation of them is limited to shortcake and fruit salad. I have a peculiar aversion to baking strawberries into things and shudder at the very thought of strawberry muffins or strawberry pie. I don't mind them cooked into a topping for cheezecake or non-dairy ice cream, though. Call me weird.  While I was mulling over ideas for something that was different, yet easy, I happened to catch The Barefoot Contessa on Food Network Canada. She made a gorgeous summer pudding with strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. I found the recipe online and it got very good reviews. This looks like something I would like to make [and my kids would like to eat!]. Ina's recipe is on the rich side with brioche and framboise. My version will be simpler, but I hope, just as tasty!

      The blueberry pudding cake, my experiment from earlier this week, was polished off in short order by my son about ten minutes after it had emerged from the oven - he ate the entire thing, save for a tiny bit I managed to squirrel away for my daughter and I to share.   He really liked this, and so did I. My daughter found it too lemony for her taste. She likes her desserts sweeter than I do. I used a generous amount of blueberries in this recipe because I was lucky enough to have a large container of them on hand. This produced ample sauce, which I later realized, would have been lovely over a big scoop of non-dairy vanilla ice cream.   I will have to remember that next time!

      Blueberry recipes have been on my mind a lot lately - maybe it has something to do with the quart of little blue gems that took up residence in my refrigerator over the weekend. I thought about and discarded the usual muffins and pancakes. I craved something different, but I wasn't quite sure what. This morning, while surfing recipe sites on the web, I came across a blueberry pudding cake. I was intrigued. It looked good, but I felt it needed something .... like a good shot of lemon. I never could follow a recipe.  Lemony Blueberry Pudding Cake:  A light lemon cake topping with a luscious blueberry sauce underneath. I don't like my sweets very sweet; so be forewarned, this is on the tart side.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees C.  Lightly spray an 8" or 9" square baking dish. Tumble in 2 1/2 cups of blueberries and spread evenly over the bottom.  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, stir together:  1 1/4 cups flour [I use 'whole' white flour with the wheat germ left in] 2 teaspoons baking powder A good dash of salt Grated rind of one lemon  Stir in 3/4 cup of water or soymilk. Pour the batter over the blueberries and spread to cover. Batter will seem sparse and berries will peek out, but that's okay! Sprinkle 3/4 to 1 cup of sugar over top [I use the lesser amount].  Squeeze the juice of one lemon into a measuring cup. There should be about 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Add boiling water to make 1 1/2 cups of liquid. Pour this hot, lemony liquid over the sugar-topped batter. DO NOT MIX! Carefully transfer the whole sloppy-looking mess to the oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the cake topping tests done.  Let cool slightly and then dig in!  Serves 4

      I just heard on the radio that the local strawberries are finally in stores. They've been delayed this year due to the cool weather here in Cape Breton. Everytime it occurs to me that we are actually into July now, I am amazed. It sure doesn't feel like July!  Nothing says summer quite like berries [even if you are wearing a parka while enjoying them]. While many people will no doubt be scrambling to Super-Valu tomorrow to grab containers of fresh strawberries at 1.99/qt, I have to admit that I'm not all that crazy about them - the strawberries, not the people. My heart belongs to blueberries and blackberries, both of which, I think, have much more flavor.   The blackberries have come and gone. Their appearance tempting and all too brief. Despite the fact that I am relatively poor - full-time university student ... single mother of two ... no child support [you get the picture] - I broke down and bought a precious half-pint for 3.99. The smart thing would have been to make them into a dessert with a multitude of other cheap ingredients to lower the cost and provide a treat for everyone, but in a moment of selfish abandon, I ate them as they were, straight from the container, slowly, savoring every delectable, juicy morsel. I was in heaven until my daughter said to me - 'In the movie, The Good Girl, someone died from eating blackberries.' My enjoyment waned. That was my punishment for being greedy.  I've been more generous with the blueberries. They are cheaper than blackberries, yet still more expensive than strawberries. I find them more versatile though, so I don't mind paying a bit extra ... pancakes, scones, muffins, buckle, cobbler, tarts, slump ... the possibilities are delicious and endless. At this very moment, I have a quart of the little blue treasures tucked away in my crisper waiting to be transformed into a yummy, heartwarming dessert.  As for those strawberries, I'm sure I will be among the shoppers picking up a container or two, because what is summer without at least one serving of strawberry shortcake? Even if you are wearing a parka while eating it!

      Just when I thought I knew all the ways to indulge in my passion for food .... cookbooks, food magazines, television cooking shows, recipe websites, grocery shopping, cooking, and of course, eating .... I stumbled across yet another -  the food blog .  I am no stranger to public blogging; I keep an online journal at LiveJournal. Food diaries are new to me though, and it was at LJ that I first discovered the food blog. I have since come across many fabulous food blogs that have me sitting in front of my computer for hours, completely entranced, as only a true foodie can be. What a wonderful concept!  I have noticed though, that there are very few vegetarian blogs, and I haven't seen any vegan ones outside of LJ. As a long time advocate of vegan cuisine and living a healthy lifestyle - I think I was a Seventh Day Adventist in a previous life - I am disappointed. Where are all the vegetarians and vegans?  My search for vegan blogs continues. When I find them, I will post links so that everyone can enjoy them. In the meantime, I hope you'll stay and visit awhile, have a cup of Earl Grey and a piece of homemade cake ....  in a vegan kitchen .

      Being the food lover that I am, I own many, many cookbooks and I am always buying more! I am also a frequent poster and visitor to many Internet food communities. I love reading about food and other people's cooking adventures.  Needless to say, I am a big fan of  cookbook projects . Not only is it fun to read about people's experiences with recipes, but it's handy if you have the book and want to know which recipes are 'must tries' and which are 'avoid at all costs'!  Lately, I have been thinking about doing my own cookbook project. The book I have in mind is  How To Be A Domestic Goddess  by Nigella Lawson. It is a gorgeous book filled with mouth-watering goodies, and my daughter is really big on baking right now, so I thought it would be fun for her, as well.  I do have a couple of challenges though. It is definitely not a vegan-friendly book, so the recipes I choose will require tinkering. That's okay because I'm used to playing around with ingredients and I have a pretty good idea what works and what doesn't. The other possible stumbling block is that I have the British [metric] version and not the American [Imperial] one. To be honest, I'm much more comfortable with cups and teaspoons than I am grams and ounces.  But, hey, that's part of the fun! Right?

      These three recipes are good with or without Yves Ground Round! I will admit that most of the time I make them without, but if I am feeding company, I will make them with. These dishes are easy and fast [and delicious!]!   Beans and Pasta :  This is a staple dish in my house. I make it at least once a week!  Combine in a large skillet with a lid: 1/2 [19oz] can beans - cannellinni, black or kidney beans are all good 1 cup kernel corn 1/2 pkg Yves Ground Round 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon basil 1/2 teaspoon oregano 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1 [8oz] can tomato sauce 2 cups water  Bring to a boil and add: 2 cups dry pasta - I like fusilli or penne  Stir well. Bring back to a boil. Cover, and simmer over low heat about 15 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed and pasta is tender. This makes a 'dry' pasta dish. If you like your pasta saucier, add a bit more tomato sauce or water.  Serves 3   Taco Soup :  This is my own version of the Taco Soup recipe in The McDougall Quick &amp; Easy Cookbook. It can be as hot or as mild as you like!  Combine in a medium saucepan: 1 [19oz] can black beans 1 cup kernel corn 1 cup cooked brown rice 1/2 pkg Yves Ground Round 1 [8oz] can tomato sauce 1 cup salsa - your choice of heat A couple of teaspoons of taco seasoning Water to cover  Bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer over low heat for about 15 - 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serves 3 - 4   Sausage Chowder :  This, again, is my own version of LoriM's Sausage Chowder, which periodically makes the rounds of the McDougall board at VegSource. This is the perfect, savory cold-weather meal and is superb with corn bread!  Combine in a medium saucepan: 1/2 pkg Yves Ground Round 1 large onion, chopped 1 [19oz] can red kidney beans 2 potatoes, diced 1/2 [28oz] can diced tomatoes 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon leaf sage 1/4 teaspoon marjoram 1/4 teaspoon thyme 1 bay leaf Water to cover  Bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes, or until potatoes are soft. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serves 3 - 4

      Because vegan meat analogues tend to be expensive, I usually use them in small amounts in recipes with other ingredients. This helps to cut down on the cost and provides more servings per person. It also improves the flavor because, no matter how much you might want them to, meat analogues never taste exactly like the foods they are imitating.  Having said that, the following two recipes feature my favorite Yves Ground Round as the star player. The first recipe is from Deborah Wolfe, who hosts the vegan recipe board at VegSource. The second, I got from a Yahoo! cooking list. The source is unknown.   Salisbury Steak :  1 8oz. tube  hamburger-style  GimmeLean 1 cup Yves Ground Round 1/4 cup bread crumbs 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder Your favorite brown gravy  Mix together the first five ingredients. Form into oval burgers. Brown the burgers on both sides in a lightly sprayed, heavy frying pan over medium heat. Add a 1/4 cup of water, cover, and simmer gently for about 1o minutes, or until heated through. Water should be evaporated. If not, uncover and cook another few minutes until water is gone. Add the prepared gravy and cook gently for 5 more minutes.  Makes 5 - 6 steaks.      SDA Mini 'Meatloaves' :     1 cup dry tvp mixed w/ 3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons hot water OR I package Yves Ground Round 'hamburger' crumbles     Add and mix well: 1 cup tomato sauce 1 cup fork-mashed potatoes [can use cold leftovers, too] 1 cup rolled oats 1 tablespoon dried minced onion or 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon oregano or Italian seasoning 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder Salt and pepper to taste     Pack mixture into 8 lightly-sprayed muffin or custard cups. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 25-30 minutes. Wait 5 minutes before removing from cups.     *Note* - I use Yves crumbles to make this recipe and I don't add any salt because I find the crumbles are sufficiently salty.

      This is sort of a continuation of my last post.  I've been thinking a lot about my own use of meat and dairy analogues, mainly because I have a tube of  hamburger-style  GimmeLean in the fridge that needs using!  My cooking tends to be very simple. I seldom experiment with strange ingredients because I feed two children and I don't have money to waste on dishes they probably won't eat. Plus, I'm one of those rather boring folks who likes ordinary food. When it comes to the cuisines of other cultures, I am not embarrassed to admit that Mexican and Italian are about as exotic as I get. You won't find any tempeh, dried seaweed, lemon grass, or weird-looking mushrooms in my kitchen.  What you will find are dried and canned beans of all types, grains, pasta, potatoes, vegetables, and canned tomatoes. It doesn't sound exciting, but people are always amazed at the variety of recipes I can prepare with those ingredients. Occasionally, I do buy meat analogues, but they are expensive and tend to be more of a treat food. My favorite is Yves Ground Round and I can usually make a couple of dishes from one package.  I do buy soymilk regularly for cooking and baking, but when it comes to vegan cheezes, I make my own. I can't buy commercial vegan cheeze where I live and even if I could, I probably wouldn't. From what I hear, most of it doesn't taste very good. Fortunately, vegan cheezes are so easy to make at home. I tend to only make them once in a while though, and they, like the meat analogues, are treats. They make meals special.  Tomorrow, I will post a couple of my favorite recipes that use my favorite meat analogues. I hope you will enjoy them as much as we do!

      The other day, I was reading a few vegan cookbook reviews at Amazon and one in particular caught my eye. A person was unhappy with how an author chose to name recipes. She thought meaty sounding names weren't appropriate for vegan recipes. I wondered if she had a problem with only the names or also the fact that some of the recipes were imitations of meat/dairy/egg dishes.  Is this really such a bad thing? I don't think so. Many, and in fact I think it's fair to say most, people are not vegans from birth and come to veganism after years of eating meat and dairy. Just because they have decided to stop eating animal products due to animal welfare, environmental, religious, or health reasons does not mean that they automatically stop liking the flavors of these foods. Knowing that there are vegan options that provide the tastes they remember and enjoy can help them to not only make an easier transition, but to stay with it in the long run.  Honestly, if you were a new vegan, which recipes would sound more appetizing to you - Manhattan 'Clam' Chowder or Vegan Seaweed Soup? Barbecue 'Ribs' or Barbecue Wheat Protein? 'Chicken' Stew w/ Dumplings or Bean Curd Stew w/ Dumplings? No matter how good the recipe might be, no one is going to try it if they are turned off by the name!  Personally, I like familiar sounding recipes. I like the tastes they provide and the memories they invoke. I have very strong associations with certain foods from my omni days - recollections of my father, in particular - and I would hate to give them up just because I choose not to eat meat anymore. Vegan analogues, whether store-bought or homemade, ensure that I don't have to. I can still have my Huskies In A Drift [Brit: Toad In A Hole] and remember my father and the dinner with the sausages and the axe.  But that's a story for another day.
