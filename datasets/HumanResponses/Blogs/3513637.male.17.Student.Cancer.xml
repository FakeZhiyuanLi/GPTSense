      Is it just me or do timings come awkwardly? The first weekend of the holidays and i planned to go out on the saturday, but what happened? I had to stay at home and wait for the french student to arrive at my house and to welcome him. I waited a whole day not knowing when exactly he would arrive at my house and so i wasted a whole day when i could have gone out and watched a movie. That's ok though, i guess... what really annoys me is this weekend was the one weekend where my parents wanted to go to the snow, and that could possibly mean taking my sister and my parents, which in turn could mean i would be home alone free to do whatever, free to have whoever come over, but noo.... -.- I am in my current state of mind annoyed, but i must say i was errr well i wasn't so sure i wanted to meet the French student because well Iv never had a french student stay at my house before -.-. Anyway the French student seems, "sympa" as he said to me or, "nice" and well he does seem quite nice, but it appears his friend doesn't like chinese people. This i gathered after his friend asked of me to stand in front of the webcam his initial reaction i would have no idea what he said, it was way too slang, but he eventually got around to saying j'aime pas chintook. This i would take as being i dont like chinese but then again i don't like those ppl who stereotype 0.0 damn stereotypers -.-

      The date is the 24th of June and 5 boys from Haileybury College began their day with the following thoughts on their minds; 1. OMG another day of school 2. WAIT NO! theres something on today 3. OH SWEET maths games 4. omg i didn just say that did i -.- Amazingly enough these 5 boys arose from their warm beds to enter the challenging day ahead of them. As these boys headed to St. Michael's for the maths games they all wondered what the outcome of the day would be.  As the day began the competition was thick and the competitors were ticker -.- the boys slowly climbed their way through the competition with one real goal in mind, to beat the team that so solemnly beat them the year prior, MLC.   Halfway through the day the boys were beat, their minds had worked on overdrive except maybe jun -.- Jun had somehow guessed his way through a whole challenge and he was happy, but realised how retarded he was -.-  The final event was what separated the two teams, MLC and Haileybuy, the relay... Through continuous taunting and bantering the boys pulled through with a first in year 11's and a  team content with their overall place of 5th and 1st in yr 11 rejoiced at the outcome.

      Well it would seem that everyone is having a go at Ben lately and well... whY? :S Well it would appear as if everyone either has something totally against the poor guy and there are those who are in love with him?!?! (john)  Well after all that i just have to point out a small incident that involved Ben a corroded post and a lit teacher on the wrong side of old. Ok maybe not the corroded pole that was just for effect >.> ...  Well last year or so i was led to believe (note: don't believe everything anyone tells you, or is that don't believe anything everyone tells you?), anyways back to moment. Ben, the man, the moment, the hour, the ... well anyway Ben clearly stated that he liked his lit teacher, Mrs Strawn. There is clear evidence from certain people that state that "he was checking her out".  The concept of a guy "checking out" a girl would make sense and would be quite a natural thing, if it isn't then err... somethings wrong. This particular case though, it is errr... well lets put it this way. Ben is arrogant and he's wait i dont even know 16? 15? hes a teen lets just say. Now on the other hand, Mrs. Strawn... the age category that she would fall into would be better suited as bens... grandma?  However you put it, it is quite wrong. True you shouldn't judge someone by their looks, but um... when someones old enough to be your grandma the idea of "checking her out" would place ... Ben, in an awkwardly WRONG situation. Ben if you are reading this, it would be a good time to considering counseling of some sort.

      Out of pure boredem i have decided to create a formula that could possibly model the majority of some events described by this formula. This will come in separate parts, and this first part will be an introduction to the formula that the value theorem will be based around. (note: this formula is not proven, it is merely an observational release).   Introduction:  How many times have you come across a situation where you have been newly introduced (or re-introduced as the situation may be) to something and then you begin to notice this everywhere, but before this instant you never noticed? As an observer this "thing..." i would relate to my theorem of value.  Basics: The basic idea of the value theorem is that the value of something varies directly to amount noticed. In other words, the value placed on something will increase as the amount of notice of that item increases. For example if you suddenly begin to notice something more often than usual then it is implied that the value of that item has increased by a certain amount.     I shall finish this later  Notice:  Now the part of this theorem that is errr harder to agree with... is notice. Now the idea of notice isn't a unit of measurement like CM or M, most obviously, but our "notice" is just what it sounds a measure of notice. The amount u notice something will be measured in times. Notice is a discrete number and should be dealt with accordingly as a discrete variable.

         TERRORISM     Terrorism has been a major problem in recent times and suicidal maniacs are rising from the shadows to the cause. A small look at these suicidal maniacs can let us see why we deserve what they are trying to get...  Firstly each suicidal maniac is given the choice of life or death for a cause somehow magically greater than any other. Terrorists these days have developed a sense of ego that seems way too big for their turbaned heads, they just cannot find the sense to forgive and forget.   The numbers rising to join this so called holy cause has jumped exponentially, it is amazing to think, people out there are dumb enough to blow themselves up along with some poor little chaps on the side, hoping for a chance to get into a joyful afterlife.  The whole world would almost be forthcoming and giving towards these militant groups had they not become "militant groups", their ideals would be given more consideration and their propositions a definite look into.    The only reason iv ranted and raved on and on about all this crap is simply due to the fact that Asad in belief of his own superiority now calls himself a terrorist =.= Asad if ur reading this, there will only one thing that needs to be said, why on earth would you want to be a Terrorist? that seems like a childish way of trying to annoy me -.-

      Haileybury College, a well sought out school that sticks out from amongst the many other schools that parents flock their children to. Heileybury is well reknowned for its great campus space, lush green ovals, over-populated teams who almost never win and teachers who just can't seem to get their strikes together.   Contrary to popular beliefs not a single bit of information that you, (apply own name) may have heard about Haileybury, I can say now, they are all lies. Let me firstly clear something up, Haileybury is not a school where dreams become reality, if any were to ever tell you that my suggestion would be kick them cause they have mental inconsistencies.  Secondly, Haileybury may suggest to you that they offer the greatest number of subjects, but be careful who you listen to and make sure you read the post scripts, they tend to contain more information (the important bits they don't want you to read).  Haileybury is a school, where the belief of success is what governs us, most people at Haileybury are within the vain belief that Success is merely an arms length away, poor them, such naivety. Haileybury prides itself on the success of its students and each year the decimation is at hand and the hand of reality is always ready to whip some sense into the people of this school.   When will the naivety of Haileybury blow over...

          News!    Recent Sightings have erupted into panic as headlines state, "The creature from the gay lagoon" has arisen.    Care should be taken when heading for Bradshaw house area, Music school, tuck shop and other places of sightings. At these locations, there lurks a creature, foul, vile and strange enough devoid of nocturnal behaviour (though it does belong there), unlike his many ugly predecessors. The creature I speak of is Ben, Benjamin Be, he is a mystery and it is believed that his mind has become mentally inconsistent.   Benjamin Be is a shroud of mystery, no one can explain how he arrived at the name of Be, was it because he was lazy or was it because he thought capitalizing his surname would bring him fame, sadly, no one will ever know... One this is for sure, however he came by his name it has brought about many Mental inconsistencies that have left him retarded and screwed up in its wake.  The vile creature that is Ben has become popular talk around the county of Haileybury, but for what reasons, one should not become curious as they may become lost in a shroud of grope. Ben is a dangerous creature and caution should be taken when sighting has occurred, eye-contact should be avoided, approach shouldn't cross anyone's mind and most certainly DO NO FEED IT! IT MAY GROPE!
