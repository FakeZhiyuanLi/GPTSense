						   ...and terrible too. First, the electrical system in my work car went out and I had to drive home without turn signals or brake lights. I drove slowly, carefully and with an eagle eye for cops even though my car is a marked government car. Then, i switched to the truck and drove over to K's to pick up Jr and, wouldn't you know it, an officer clocked me at 45 in a 30 MPH zone. Stupid girl! Now, just a speeding ticket is one thing, but I am two days into a 90 days suspended license due to driving w/o insurance 3 YEARS ago. I was involved in an accident that wasn't my fault, but nonetheless, poor and stupid I didn't have insurance. It took the state 3 years to catch up with me. I have maintained insurance ever since that accident (scared me and I thought I had gotten away with something-I should have known better-I never get away with anything. My lawyer says my "problem" is that I am too honest). Anyway, back to this black cloud day, the officer was extremely nice and didn't give me a ticket for the suspended lincense (which would have changed my sentence to 1 year suspension), just the speeding. And, he post dated the ticket so to give me more time to pay it. I am not getting off to a very frugal start here, though, and now I am very scared to venture forth with the homestead. Is fate trying to tell me something? When will my karmic debts be paid?

						   ...is not as simple as it sounds. I have 7 years of crap stuffed down in the basement, drawers, closets, my head and anywhere else I can cram it. I worked yesterday on the basement and found a bunch of books I had forgotten long ago. I realized I haven't read anything non-textbook oriented in a long, long time. I used to be a chain-reader. Couldn't get enough written material: magazines, novels, short fiction, non-fiction...currently I am obsessed with blogs. In particular, I spend many minutes reading the archives of www.madameinsane.com since I have only recently discovered Lisa's life from a link on path to freedom site. I swear we have been living parallel lives: vintage dresses and doc martians, thrifting, wrong men and finding one that is right, children, gardening, wishing for 5 acres...because of her writing I have been rediscovering music loves of my past. I have in Nick Drake at the moment. All of this thinking about my own past has made me realize that I have transcended to a different place in my life. All of the striving and personal pressure to be an "original person" has moulded me into an agglomerate rock of ideas and interests and dreams. As a kid I wanted to live on a farm. I wanted chickens. I read a lot. As a teenager and young adult (college years) I wanted to be an urbanite. I lived in San Fransico and Tucson, AZ and loved the city. Gathered things around me. Read a lot. Somewhere around 28/29 I started yearning for a simple life. I wanted chickens and a farm...I came full circle in many ways.  ...And back to all this crap I have maintained. I am searching for the valuables in all of this junk and finding that I have always possessed all that I have needed to make a full and interesting life.

						   Sr and I are moving ahead and discovering that our dreams just may be realized. It's not much area, but 8 times more land space than we have now. The yard is overgrown and neglected-I'm sure a couple of pygmy goats would do the trick. I am holding my breath until we are unlocking the door, though...so much pessimism has invaded my soul and I am hoping that the bugs and the birds and the stars hidden for so long from my eyes in the city will brighten my spirit. I have Big Dreams. I see myself gardening and canning and raising my livestock and living lightly on our tired earth. I see Jr running around, exploring nature and growing into a secure and vibrant person. I see myself enjoying the silence. There, I hope I can unfold my compacted bones and stretch...

						   This evening is cast in yellow and a strange dusk is settling in around me. It has been rainy most of the day and it seems that at this end of July autumn has already arrived. I canned my tomatoes and cherry and peach jam in the last few days and I feel quite satisfied with the results. I can't say that food preservation is a way to save money because we have places like Aldi's and Sav-a-lot that provides us with dirt cheap food, but there is something eternal about seeing my own crops (or those of the Amish where I bought the cherries and peaches) saved for my family's future use. I can nourish my son and partner and self with food developed from a known source. These preserved foods are an extension of the effort I spent watering, weeding and tending a small jungle of plants.   I told my friend D that I felt she and I were of a generation skipped over our parents. We are grandchildren of depression era grandparents who canned and knitted (or crocheted), mended, saved, and "made-do". Our parents were taught these skills but became adults in an society that provides everything it needs cheap and mass produced, made to be thrown away. For that, the convenience of  not  doing yourself has been a stronger drive and the necessity of skills for "doing for one's own self" have been forgotten and were not passed on to our generation. So we feel "cheated" at not having learned these vital skills. And, with the unstable economy and government and societal values we are learning that we need these skills that saved our depression era grandparents. We feel  compelled  to learn these self-preservation skills-basic homesteading lessons. We seek to be volunteers in simplicity and self-sufficiency. We feel the drive to care and nurture our families and our selves. So we master self-teaching and learn the basics which are not so basic to someone who has never experienced the basics. And, with trial and error, we persevere and we can and we knit and we plant seeds to provide our families with the basics needed to survive this complicated world.

						   The tomatoes are ripening fast and I need to make sauce and try my hand at canning. I hope to avoid botulism, of course, and will follow directions as carefully as possible. The chickens are still eggless; we anxiously await our first farm, fresh eggs. Come on, girls! The sunflowers are at least nine feet tall, but do not have blooms yet. The corn too reaches above the ornamental windmill in the garden which is eight feet. The zucchini and yellow squash are prolific. The cucumbers are disappointing however (we have picked two!)   Our realtor is sending the request to fix the electrical problems in the house and I am losing sleep thinking we are going to lose this house (like the others). I want to offer that we will split the cost of putting in a new circuit panel, but I don't want to jump the game before the seller refuses to fix it himself. Unfortunately, Sr and I wear the scarlet FHA letters due to some past collections (Sr's medical bills-all paid). I feel like the realtors and lender treat us like we should be GRATEFUL that they are helping us and this seller has accepted our offer. The interesting thing is that the seller has the house currently financed FHA!&nbsp; Very discouraging. If all goes well, though, the defects are minor and can be fixed before the FHA inspections begin. Sr and I can help it pass, that is if the seller allows us to help. We really want to live in that house!   Jr is saying so many new words. He seems very bright for a nineteen month old. 'Course, he is my first child and so I have no basis of comparison (and I am biased!! :-). The day is starting out beautiful: sunny and cooler temps. It almost seems like Autumn!   &nbsp;

						   Today the house we are attempting to buy&nbsp;was inspected and it was found to be basically sound except for a problem with double wiring in the circuit box. There are no future spots for new breakers. It was suggested that we ask for an upgrade. I called my realtor and told him this news and (as the inspector predicted) he suggested we rig it simply for a closing. I told him I would prefer that the seller take care of this instead and realtor did not sound too pleased. He said we would have to submit some sort of inspection change of offer (or something). I am so terrible at "wheeling and dealing". I hate conflict! I really want this house, but I made lots of mistakes when I bought my current home (at the age of 25) and I am trying hard to not have history repeat itself. I really want this purchase to be better, smarter, and less stressful. I called an electrician to find out rough costs in order to negotiate somewhat better, but by the time I got home from work it was too late to get any answers. So I will lie awake tonight fretting (a really bad habit of mine). This inspection today cost $400! I really hope we can fix everything!  On the other hand, the view is spectacular out there and the quiet is sublime. Everyone says, "You won't be able to sleep due to lack of noise." Me, I think I'll be able to sleep for the first time in 7 years...

						   Today at Goodwill I found this great little spiral bound cookbook published in 1971 by a group of farm wives in rural Whitley Co. Inside are titles like  Hamburger Goop ,  Best Ever Pie Crust  and&nbsp; 4-H fair Sloppy Joes .&nbsp; One particular recipe called  Sandwich Spread  includes the ingredient "green mangoes". Now fortunately I&nbsp;was the child of older parents who routinely referred to green peppers as mangoes. Had I not known this to be a bit of past midwestern dialect, I'm not sure I wouldn't have thought this ingredient was for an underripe fruit!&nbsp;  Other news: our offer was accepted on the house. Now we just have the financial and closing hurdles to jump over. In another month things are going to be much more smooth...I hope. I am looking forward to that beautiful view, fresh air and quiet, quiet, quiet. Sr jokes that we'll have to kidnap the street sweeper just so I can sleep! Ha, ha...

						   Here in NE Indiana the weather has been quite hot and sticky. I can't complain, though, because the job has been keeping me among the deciduous forests of Indiana. I've been hanging out in lovely places like Salamonie State Forest, Pokagen State Park and Shipshewana. Been quite busy these past few weeks searching for a terrible little beetle that hitchhiked it's way from Asia to the U.S. via ash wood pallets. So far we have two quarantined areas in the state and we are hoping not to find anymore infestations. This beetle is called Emerald Ash Borer and is 100% fatal to ash trees (the most popular urban landscape tree).  &nbsp;  Sr and I found another property a county away. We made an offer yesterday and it has already been accepted. So *fingers crossed* if the appraisal, inspections and financing all travel smoothly we should be moving in a month or so. This place&nbsp;has two more acres than the place we lost and there are two pastures! Surrounding the property on the north and west is a pheasant preserve and a woods is&nbsp;located on&nbsp;the eastern edge. It couldn't be better (except the house is not a cool, old farmhouse, but there always seems to be some sort of tradeoff...). There are even three mature apple trees full of fruit on the property!&nbsp;I am now cautiously allowing some hope in my life... &nbsp; This need for rural landscape is due to the two most expensive hens in the county!&nbsp;Last Spring Sr bought me five tiny chicks of assorted breeds from TSC. Two ended up surviving (1 Plymouth rock and a leghorn). The rock actually&nbsp;was the cause of the other three chicks dismissal, but she apparently took mercy on the leghorn! Sr built me a tiny coop and yard in the backyard (50 ft from any residence per city codes) and there they have happily been clucking and eating bugs&nbsp;for the last few months. Why are they the most expensive hens in the county??? Well, they hooked me on poultry and now I want (I MUST) move out to an area&nbsp;where I can have more chickens. I love them all: the&nbsp;bulky brahmas, the frizzles and silkies,&nbsp;fancy footed banties and standards, the brown and white layers. I covet&nbsp;poultry catalogs. I&nbsp;author lists full of beautiful names: Belgian bearded d'uccle, araucana, silver penciled rock,&nbsp;sultan. I dream of days when I can order the&nbsp;"special assorted bargain" chicks and guess the breeds they morph into as they mature. I want to raise guineas for tick control and ducks just for the pure fun of it. I think I am now forever hooked on poultry.&nbsp;

						   Well, the house deal fell thru due to the owner  &nbsp; 1. losing the house to the bank  2. signing TWO purchase agreements  3. Not involving his wife (whom he is divorcing) despite the fact she is on the mortgage   The whole deal started to turn shady, so we opted out. I have felt the disappointment for days now!   Saturday we are going out to a new house. It is on 3 acres and has a pole barn and two pastures and an apple tree! It's closer to Sr's work, so it may work out. That is if we can get out to look at it!   Sr and I have been working a lot and I have been tired and lonely without him here. I have the responsibility of getting Jr to the babysitters. I feel like I am constantly running around. At night, before my heavy lids crash together, I try to knit (slowly learning) and/or read. I am reading a book I have owned for years, but have just started reading: The Simple Living Guide by Janet Luhrs. I'll write a little review once I am done with it.

						   ...yesterday and then didn't feel like rewriting it. Today has been quiet because Jr is at his grandma's (Sr's mom) and Sr is still working. I am making barbeque beef in the crock pot and fixing odds and ends around the current house. I am hoping I can sell or rent out this place when we move. I took Sr's mom out to the homestead today. I think she sees the same potential in the place as we have, but she's disappointed because we are moving further away from her and her husband (they both love spending time with Jr and he adores them both-they are the only grandparents he really has due to my father's passing when Jr was 4 months old and my mom not really being a "kid person"). I am going to go finish painting the yard barn and then I can scratch another thing off my list. In the garden I counted three ripening tomatoes. We tried a variety called "fourth of July" and it seems to be worthy of its name. Jr loves tomatoes. I can't wait to make and can salsa. I hope if I ever am able to sell/rent this place the new inhabitants love gardening too...

						   ..I have to explain my financial f*&k-ups to the insurance agent in order to get a policy on our new house. Now, I have NEVER paid an insurance policy late, nor have I had a claim, but because I messed up 6.5 years ago financially (long story-will discuss at later date) I am paying a huge price in humiliation and regret (never mind the extra $$$). I feel as if I am tattooed with a huge scarlet letter telling everyone "...about the person who lives in the house" (to quote the insurance agent). I do not want to have to explain my mistakes-I have been steadily running towards clearing up my credit report and changing my spending habits. I have made excellent progress (no late payments, low debt, money stashed away in the bank). I have been living the simple life for many years now, but I feel as though I am never going to shed my past skin, that I am going to be forever trapped in a world of high interest and the sound of disappointment in insurance agents and lenders voices. I feel like a royal mess-up. I want to see some glimmer of hope for the future, but it is hard to erase a 6.5 year old mistake...

						   ...he is fifteen; I have had him in my life since April 9, 1991 (I was 20!). Isaak is a pit bull/dalmation mix and lived his first year in a trailer park, chained to a dog house and "beat" with a plastic wiffle ball bat (at least that was what his former owner told me to use to "control" him). His first name was B.A. ("bad-ass")-I renamed him after the singer Chris Isaak. My dog has followed me to Arizona and college; through many, many boyfriends; and many, many alone nights. He is my son's best buddy and protector. For a senior citizen he still occasionally chases Thai (our Siamese) and Jr around the backyard. He is my first son, my baby, the love of my life and I cannot imagine ever not having him here on earth beside me. However, when my father was dying I asked him to look after Isaak one day even despite my confused spirituality. I knew that my dad understood the intricacies of the dog-human relationship.  Today, Sr, Jr and I went to a petstore to gawk at the animals. I really want a 55 gallon fish tank and hope when we move I can afford one. At the store I saw a small, sleeping bundle of white and black fur. Upon closer examination, the puppy was labeled "bullmation". My heart skipped a beat-he looked amazingly like my Isaak!! I asked a woman working behind the register how much the mix breed was. She let me play with him for a few minutes and proceeded to tell me the puppy was half dalmation and half English bull dog. I asked again for the price and she said all the puppies are warranted for three years and the father (the English bull dog) was from Russia. She avoided the $ question. Someone called her away and I stole a glance at the papers she left behind. The puppy was priced at $899.99! I could not believe it. When she came back I said, "Isn't that a little steep for a mix breed dog? You can't even register it." She quickly became offended and yanked the puppy away from me. Then I walked over to Jr and Sr who were petting a tiny Siamese kitten. She followed me over to the kitten and also took it quickly away from us. Such a shame...!  Truth is it would be extremely hard for me to buy a dog from a petstore-even a "purebreed". See, I worked for years in the animal control industry and I saw countless puppies and kittens destroyed due to crazy breeding experiments (English bulldog and dalmation???) and lack of homes. Our adoption price was around $50 and included first shots, a microchip and a spay/neuter! I would have given that Isaak-puppy a great home (even though I know no dog will ever replace my Isaak, nor would I want one to take his place), but purposely pricing mixbreed dogs that high is a crime. It will not keep irresponsible people from purchasing the puppy. Chances are that the puppy may not sell and will end up unwanted at a shelter anyway. Or, as an impulse buy, a family will get more than they bargained for and get rid of a juvenile dog (I remember vividly how high-strung Isaak was until only a few years ago). Sad. I left the animal control field a jaded person and today this example of greed and animal life brought back many painful memories. It also made me grateful to have saved Isaak from a bad situation and been allowed to have his company all of these years. Happy birthday, my little wolfie-dog!

						   Well, Jr's first time camping was both great and stressful. He loved getting dirty (so does his mama!) and running around the trees. Sr and I worried constantly about him falling into the fire, but he minded us very well whenever he approached "the hot" (as he calls it). At night, we retired to the tent with only a lantern and this is when we decided the trip would become a one night affair. All day Jr ran in and out of the tent, giggling and looking quite proud of himself. Then, when we tried to go to bed he decide the tent was a scary and unenjoyable place. He screamed and hid his face in a corner and finally, after our failed attempts to calm him, Sr slept with him in the truck. Me, I awoke to the sound of something licking itself and opened up the tent to find myself face-to-face with a juvenile raccoon. Near the table were his/her brothers and sisters. I worried about the food I hadn't put away and got up to scare them away. However, as I approached their little coven, I found myself standing among them. They apparently had no fear of humans! I also saw a graceful doe, several rabbits, a bat and lots of eastern black swallowtails. Jr is discovering insects and we spend many minutes following them through the grass and dirt.   Next year we will practice with Jr sleeping out in the tent in the backyard. Sr and I still have another camping trip in October. We travel to brethren, Mi for Salmon fishing in the rivers. I love camping in the fall the best-the weather is cool and scented with campfires, dying leaves and pine needles. Sometimes the rain surprises us in the night making sleeping a joy. And, the wildlife in northern Michigan is varied and abundant (including bears and coyotes so leaving food out like the other night is a definite no-no). Jr will stay with Grandma and Grandpa this time and so we will stay longer. I love camping in MI and look forward to my fall break. On the way home, we stop at an apple orchard and bring home bushels of delicious fruit. I want to try canning apple butter, sauce, and pie filling (of course, this year we are also about to close on a property with two mature apple trees, so this part of the trip will probably be unnecessary, but they also have a farm petting zoo and the country around there is unbelievable, so we will still stop). In a few years Jr will enjoy this trip as much as we do, I hope...at least, I hope he ceases to be afraid of sleeping in the tent!

						   Well, we are down to the appraisal and hoping the house and land is worth what we need it to be worth. The seller agreed to our improvements and it seems we are about to be the owners of a very tiny homestead.  My frustration is building with my current home, however. I bought this "fixer-upper" back when I was 26. I thought I could handle all the needed updates and repairs. Unfortunately, I have been struggling to keep up with it. Everytime we fix something-it seems something gives up. Today I found the drainage pipe under the kitchen sink slowly dripping away. This will be Sr's job tomorrow because I have to work and he has more of the strength needed to tighten the damn thing! I wish I could just walk away from this stupid house (I know this is an unrealistic fantasy!)  In three days we are going camping in central Indiana. The place is called Salamonie Lake and is managed by IN DNR (my employers!!) We are taking Jr (Who is now 19 months old!) for the first time. This ought to be interesting! We all need to get away so badly-the last year has been very rough on us all (first child, death of my father, Sr and my break-up and reconciliation, new jobs for both of us, school, and always lots of bills). We need to just kick back and not worry about house repairs or purchases, lack of money or laughter, television, and all the other day-to-day crap we humans place upon ourselves. I am taking lots of books and my hiking boots and I am going to try to relax and let go (let god)...
