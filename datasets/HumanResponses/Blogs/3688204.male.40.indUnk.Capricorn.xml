      I had to let one of our contractors go today.  It was difficult.  She had no idea it was coming and she certainly did not expect it to come from me.  I'm not her boss.  Never have been.  From her point of view I flashed in like lightning, swooped down like a hawk, cast a shadow in the night like the angel of death and...boom!...like that, her job ended.  Of course, she is not without blame.  Her poor attendence during a highly intense period of work has left a few of her colleagues with a lot of extra work and put some deadlines at risk.  But as a contractor, she was never counseled.  She, I don't believe, knew that her job was in danger.  And I was the bringer of the bad news.  How the heck did I wind up with this assignment?  The "heavy" isn't my favorite role.  At the risk of sounding like  urlLink David Brent , I'm more of a relationship manager than a taskmaster--though some of my employees would vehemently disagree.  Anyway, I really found the whole thing distasteful.  If an employee is going to be fired then the firing itself should not be a surprise.  However, as a contractor, there aren't any reasons necessary for the dismissal.  "Your services are no longer needed," will suffice.  Doesn't make me feel any better.

      Had a nice combination of social events and home-bound activities to keep me busy and out of trouble this past weekend.  Friday, I went with neighbors to  urlLink dinner  and to a  urlLink comedy club .  There we saw  urlLink Robert Schimmel .  There was more crude and shock based humor than anything truly funny.  If anyone can recommend a comedian or comedienne that doesn't do the following, please let me know: 1) jokes on penis size 2) jokes involving defecation and/or diarrhea 3) using the word "fuck" in place of wit and humor in order to get a laugh 4) jokes involving  urlLink Viagra  or any other drug that is meant to treat " urlLink erectile dysfunction "  I think I'm a tad cranky about these topics because all three comedians used this style or type of material.  Last night (6/27), I tuned into the  urlLink Sundance  channel to see  urlLink Margaret Cho 's new show.  Perhaps I tuned in at the wrong time.  Rather than seeing a critical comedic take on racism or the "tyranny of fashion," I saw instead a extended sequence on her need to have an immediate bowel movement.  FUNNY stuff!  Pshaw.  I changed over to  urlLink Gunsmoke  on the  urlLink Westerns Channel .  I caught the ending where there's always a moral or poignant moment of some sort.  The episode was "Kioga".  It is a tale of sought vengeance by a young Pawnee upon a murdering fur trader.  At the end, when the fur trader's story does not check out and  urlLink Matt  has him locked up, Kioga is unhappy that the man is not dead.  Matt assures him that the murderer will hang for his crimes.  Kioga asks if the Pawnee way of handling this is wrong.  Matt replies that no, it is just different.  He explains that with a trial, this man's punishment will serve as an example to other men.  Kioga's way would be merely a personal vengeance.  Kioga leaves somewhat satisfied and promises to return for the hearing in two weeks (trials and hearings are always "two weeks" away from the time of the arrest on Gunsmoke.)  Then I went to bed.

      My daughter left a message on her  urlLink Magna Doodle  and placed it on my office chair at home.  It reads as follows:   (heart) Dear Dad I miss you so much, you and Rafe.  Take good care of him, eat healthy, and be safe.  Do not erase this.  I love you dad.  Love, your daughter (heart) p.s. Say Hello! To Rafe for me.   What a sweetie.  Ralph (pronounced Rafe) is our dog, an  urlLink English Setter .  He's already moping around without the kid to play with him.  Anyway, it's a wonderful feeling to have such a thoughtful kid.  I hope she continues that trend into adolescence and adulthood.  I love and miss you too, Monica.

      The wife and kids left for Portland, Oregon today.  They'll be gone for two weeks.  It is just me and the dog.  I'm already bored.  Isn't it amazing how much time we devote to family?  Shouldn't I be thrilled at this big dose of freedom?  The kids warned me not to do too much cleaning up.  They're afraid I will throw away their important valuables which I consider clutter.  The wife wants me to focus on "yard work" as if that isn't my focus when they're home.  Reading or watching a movie (two of my favorite activities) are only satisfying when shared...maybe it's my age...or habit...the kids and I read a lot together.  We're tearing through the Lemony Snicket  urlLink series  now.  The wife and I are reading  urlLink Stephen R. Donaldson 's Gap series (2nd time for me).  This series is not for every taste.  I'm not sure what I will do.  I can play any  urlLink music  I want as loud as I want.  That'll keep me happy for about 1/2 an hour.  Maybe I'll crank up a little  urlLink Ludwig van  to kill another hour.  Well, I could just focus on my school work.  I'm only three weeks away from completing my  urlLink MBA .  Woo hoo!  I'm starting an online program for my M.S. in information technology from  urlLink Capella  in July.  Maybe I'll just focus on the blog and homework.  Mow the lawn, do a little laundry...watch a movie...I'm getting bored again.

      Well, the colonoscopy went well...I think...the nurse said that I would be in a twilight state for the procedure.  There was not a semi-conscious moment for me.  One minute I'm asking which monitor I should watch and the next I'm waking in recovery to the sound of a machine beeping out my pulse.  On the drive home, I described things I had seen during the procedure to my wife of which I now have no recollection.  I barely remember telling her anything.  Lack of control over thought and speech is downright frightening when it happens (that is, once one regains control and has had a chance to reflect upon it.)  IF I could think right now, I would be attempting to discuss the ages-old philosophical problem of the relationship between the mind and body.  My views lean toward the materialistic with an acknowledgement towards emergent consciousness.  The Wikipedia has a decent introductory  urlLink article  on the issue.  Thinking about these things leads to questions on  urlLink epistemology ,  urlLink morality , and  urlLink free will .  All subjects I love to discuss, especially with those that have it all down pat.  But now, I just need to lie down.  Oh, and no polyps, no tumors, just a simple treatable humble internal condition with a blood vessel.

       urlLink Scatological  humor is not my thing.  Now, I'm not some sort of coprophobic prude...after all, I am a dad--and a former stay at home dad--so I have had plenty of diaper experience.  We're also responsible dog owners, who take plastic bags with us on dog walks.  But that type of humor has always disgusted me.  It certainly has kept me from being an Austin Powers fan...I can't bring myself to watch  urlLink Goldmember .  All of which leads me to say, that I don't plan on making any funny asides about bathroom breaks today.  I am fasting, or to be more accurate, I am prepping my colon.  I'm only 40, not 50, yet I have had some symptoms lately that warrant a  urlLink colonoscopy .  Today is colon prep day.  All liquid diet all day long.  The procedure takes place tomorrow morning.  Rather than take a bad tasting liquid, the physician prescribed  urlLink Visicol  tablets.  My first dose takes place every fifteen minutes from 9 to 10 a.m.  Then again from 6 to 7 p.m.  Needless to say, I'm staying home from work today.  A long time ago, when I was in my early twenties, I had a procedure known as a  urlLink lower GI .  This barium enema procedure was incredibly uncomfortable.  I remember having an upper GI (barium swallow) on the same day.  Must have been getting a complete digestive track picture.  I was in the military...maybe they were practicing...no, I'm not that cynical...I had had a chest x-ray (as part of  urlLink INH  therapy [that is for another post]) that revealed something along the top of my colon.  Combine that with ulcer-like symptoms and doctors start ordering tests.  Anyway, I am glad that tomorrow's test is a relatively painless colonoscopy rather than a lower GI.  I don't watch the Today Show.  However, I have friends that do, so I've heard about  urlLink Couric  and Roker.  Big Al had a colonoscopy at the beginning of April.  This is no narcissistic stunt.  The more you know about the procedure, the less likely you are to be intimidated by it (I have no evidence of this, it just seems logical.)  If you are 50 or over and haven't had one...it might be  urlLink worth  it.  If you have any rectal bleeding or change in bowel habits, see a doctor.  Having this procedure must be easier than being treated for colon cancer.  Well, I'm usually on my way to work and having a  urlLink PowerBar  during the commute.  Not today.  Oh, man...my stomach is already growling.

      Well, it's the 3rd Sunday in June... urlLink Father's Day  in the United States.  My wife has prepped me for my children's planned  urlLink gift  and the kids will be thrilled (and so will I.)  We're business casual at work, so it sure beats receiving a  urlLink necktie .  When my youngest daughter was a toddler and my son was an infant, I was a stay-at-home dad.  A  urlLink rare job  indeed for men.  One's perspective on child-rearing and housekeeping changes after such an experience.  And it requires adapting to a world that is mostly without adults.  Check out the first line from this  urlLink list  from the movie  urlLink  Mr. Mom   to see what I mean.  I'm proud to say that I did it, and not ashamed to say that I'm not sure if I could do it again.  We could use a Caregiver's Day to recognize all those people who take care of another human, young or old, day in and day out.  It is a tough job, that requires a lot of love and patience from those that do it well.  *********** I have six children.  The oldest, Katey, lives abroad...I'm her biological father. About four years ago, I tried to start a relationship with her, but it didn't last.  Maybe we'll have a chance to try again.  No pretenses on a father-daughter relationship.  Just two adults getting to know one another.  I'd be happy trying that.  My second oldest daughter graduated high school and is off to college next year.  My oldest son graduates high school next year.  I am proud of both of them.  We are working on our relationships, trying to figure how to do this long distance.  They live in Alabama.  Their mother and I have not gotten along over the years and my inability to deal with that has kept me distant.  At least for now we're all trying.  I attended my daughter's graduation a couple of weeks ago.  My middle son took up the guitar about six months ago.  He has a gift.  He is a natural, fluid, sensitive player.  I've never seen him so passionate about anything.  Even his Gameboy Advance is collecting dust.  The two youngest, my nine-year old daughter and my seven-year old son, are nice bright lights in my life.  My daughter just walked in to kiss me and tell me "Happy Father's Day" and "It's the first day of  urlLink Summer !"  Well, not until 8:57 this evening for us in the Northern Hemisphere, but I'm not telling her that.  ***********  Mom and Dad named me after Dad.  They used a "II" rather than "Jr." at the end of my name.  Oddly, I was always proud of that.  Made me feel like a royal.  James II.  "James Douglas" is the given name.  Grew up with "Dougie" as the moniker to distinguish me from Dad.  I think I'll go give the old guy a call and tell him "Happy Father's Day and tonight is when Summer starts!" then we'll talk about the  urlLink Reds .

      A long long time ago, when I was in the 7th grade, I read Orwell's  urlLink 1984 .  My young mind had plowed through many books, but never had a single book terrified me quite like this.  The stomach pains and heartache I felt when Winston yells out,  urlLink "Do it to Julia!  stayed with me for weeks.  As a 7th grader, I didn't read the book for its political warnings; it was the story that mattered.  Like many an adolescent boy I was a hapless romantic, thinking that love was the strongest and purest of the emotions.  At the beginning of the book Winston receives a  urlLink note  from the girl with the dark hair.  Maybe that was it...she passed him a simple handwritten message...like school kids.  I rooted so hard for them.  They were in a forbidden relationship, fighting the system with their hearts (and bodies.)  I knew they would escape and be together.  Every book that I had ever read--except those dealing with the  urlLink Alamo --had a happy ending.  There was the shock of their  urlLink capture , but I still held out hope.  There was plenty of book left.  I knew O'Brien had a role to play in this.  The dramatic tension built and I was trapped--like the child I was--in it.  Completely hooked.  After he betrayed Julia, I was still green enough to believe that the moment they saw each other the passion would rise up in each of them and erase the effects of their torture.  They would embrace, kiss, beg forgiveness of each other and escape.  That didn't  urlLink happen .  I cried like a baby the rest of that day.  I felt sick for at least a week.  The reading of 1984 produced a couple of watershed moments in my life.  My libertarian streak started then, though I had no idea what libertarian meant.  And my romanticism became cynical...something I'm still trying to overcome.  "Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you and you sold me..."  No imbibing of Victory Gin here.  No betrayals.  No 2+2=5.  I'm just attempting to blog about things that have affected me over the past 40 years.  Maybe I'll learn something.  *********  Oh, btw, here's one of life's little ironies, I joined the military in 1981.  Served in the US Air Force for over five years.  My first assignment found me living in a dormitory in Hawaii.  My room number?   urlLink 101 .   I  laughed.  My roommate didn't get it.
