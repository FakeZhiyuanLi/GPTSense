        well, here it is, august 21- just two days from my departure. i just wanted to let everyone know that i reached my $8000 goal and then some! it's very exciting. for the last few days i've been packing and unpacking, calling back and forth to other YAVs (those are other volunteers in the program) to talk about the packing situation, and pretty much just freaking out. i'm very excited though. dad asked me the other day if i'm scared or nervous. my answer: beyond this packing situation, i'm just fine. the packing has me freaking out though! but i am really close to having everything packed and ready to go. i finally got myself down to the essentials and barely within the weight requirements. now i just have to rearrange a few things so they fit together better.  monday i will be departing from the akron/canton airport for chicago. we'll spend a week at mccormick seminary in chicago for orientation before taking off to guatemala. from there we well have a short retreat, 5 weeks of language study, and i think another short retreat before separating and going to our own sites. while i'm quite excited, i'm sure that the adjustments are going to be very difficult at times and confusing. i hope to be able to keep in touch with everyone, but i will have to ask for your patience. the first few months will be extremely important in my adjustment. i am planning to make a concious effort not to do a lot of calling home in the first few months. this way i can put all of my effort into being in guatemala and integrating myself into the community. i'm taking a few pictures and my favorite stuffed animal to help me get through being so far from home, but i have always enjoyed traveling and being in new places, learning new things.  anyway, that is my update. please keep myself and the rest of the YAVs in your prayers, and thank you so much for all of your love and support. if you happen to know someone who might be interesting in hearing everything i'm up to and you know they are not receiving my emails, please forward this on. you can also keep up to date (and hopefully view pictures down the road) at my website:    urlLink   http://yavlindsey.blogspot.com       much love; peace, lindsey          "i'm leaving on a jet-plane;  don't know when i'll be back again..."

         i just want to take a minute to kick this site off.  it's now 1:26am on tuesday, but yesterday was the 2-week mark in our countdown to leave for YAV orientation in chicago.  i still have so much packing an preparing to do.... i didn't get  any  reading done today like i meant to, so i'll have to do twice the work tomorrow.  i now have 2 of the 5 books read though, so 3 to go!  i've got most everything i need too... except maybe another   skirt.  i just can't wait!  every day i'm learning something new and thinking about how i can apply it.             well, i'd like to thank you all for your support and prayers.  please keep all of the YAVs in your prayers this year!  thanks so much!          lindsey
