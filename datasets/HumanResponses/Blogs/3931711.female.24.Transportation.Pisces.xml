      It was an ordinary day...i hurriedly rushed home from a very stressful day at the office. No magic, such a plain...ordinary day...Suddenly the phone rang,  maybe, I thought it would be for my mom, perhaps tita would like to talk to her regarding their company outing...when I said hello, an unfamiliar voice answered and he is looking for me...I never thought that at that same time... the prayer that I have been praying for so long would be answered....God led Him to me......

      There's so many things about him&nbsp;that I love-the way he looks at me, the way he makes me feel I am loved and the way he assures me that I am the prettiest girl in the world. Yesterday we were together the whole day, I really felt that he is so concerned and that he is willing to sacrifice everything for me. I asked him not to go to work because we have to go to the police station and file a case against my ex bf who is harassing me. I know he is willing to fight for me and though there are certain things I dont like about him, the good points outnumbered the bad ones. I love him for who he is and what he will be---I know that he is a gift from God. I love him because He is adopting my faith...we never say our goodnyts without praying together.I hope God would bless this relationship..."

       I used to like a guy whose sweet, thoughtful and full of exciting stories to tell, jokes  to crack about and many other adventures in life...I want a man that I can boast to the whole world---but now Ive realized I just need one thing from the person I would someday marry---faith in God . when I have it---all the good qualities of a person will come out naturally in him. Im very thankful that he is Godfearing...that he is'nt like other man, that he is unique.He has this longing to know more about the God I serve...this way, this relationship will stand until the end coz   the author of the universe is the one holding it.

       We had the chance to talk last Friday, after our Webex meeting, I hurriedly dialled his number to know if he already came home-but i was frightened by the voice that answere, it's his ate. I really don't like her..maybe because of how he is treating him, she always want him to put down the phone whenever we had the chance to talk. So I just stayed at the internet cafe for an hour-    then my officemate called me up saying someone wants to talk to me..and only God knows how I felt   I heard his voice. I love him, whoever he is...I love him. When he I saw him-I want to hug him tight and kiss him but instead he kissed me on the cheek, just a sweet pat on the cheek and I know immediately that he is not mad at all. How lucky am i to have known him-to have loved someone like him...We talked and from the tone of his voice-I know that he loves me so much that he is willing to change and I can never forget what he told me that night..    "I will do everything to make you happy...even if it means I have to change all that I am for you..." - I now know God blessed me with someone more that I asked for.

       If I want to change him...It must begin with me. I can'not change a person overnyt. One must give way, and in our case...it should be me. I talked to him yesterday and I asked for a cool off.   Of course it's not really what I want, but I need to say those things for him to realize that this is a serious matter, we really need to talk. I want him to know that I am getting bored with our relationship, that something must be done. I think I really want a tough guy, someone who can make me obey, someone who can tell me things that I should do and follow him as he instructed me. He must have the balls to tame me-and I can't see it in him. I know he always obey me because he loves me so much and he doesnt want to create a conflict between us. Many says Im very lucky to have the kindest boyfriend in the world..but in the back of my mind, am i?...

      &nbsp;  Of course I should'nt compare him with my ex-they are two different people...they have different ways of treating their girlfriends...but I cant help it, I used to be with the sweetest  person in the world...then suddenly- Im with someone I dont know if is really sincere..(well yeah, I should'nt doubt him), perhaps he's just not the "showy type", but Im beginning to get  bored. I just hope I can get away with this feeling...I talked to him last night, I know he is aware that we have a problem but still...he keeps on telling what happened to him in the office, he keeps on telling me how much he loves me...he is just putting an icing to the cake. Those sweet talks just adds up to my anger because he is not pointing to the real problem. I just hope on our   next talk, he will notice that I wanted more. I want him to feel deeper, I want him to search the    inner me. We cant go on like this...

      Perhaps there came a time in a man's life that you get bored in life...I mean those routinary activities you do wether in your work, in your hobbies...or perhaps in the totality of your life.  Everythings seems to be an event somehow had already came your way...maybe that's what I felt at those time...I felt bored, I felt I need an adventure and I thank God..he answered my call.  Everything was plain and simple till he came...he gave color to my world. It seems like he's singing everybody's favourite "Because of you" in a different melody and beat. But it was not that simple...I am the one who paved the way for this relationship. I feel I need to do something so that I can be happy in my life...and I proud to say, it pays to do the first step. Nobody else in the world can make you happy besides yourself....
