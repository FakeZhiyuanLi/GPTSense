      okay.  so i've had this ache in my face for about a month and a filling fell out of a tooth that was awaiting a crown.  dentist anyone?  yeah.  dentist.  i'd been putting it off for weeks not because i didn't want to go, but because, strangely, i didn't want to take time off work to do it.  so finally i made the appointment.  and i went.  well sodomize me with an art marker!  two teeth got yarded out, and my teeth are in SOLID, and a small filling.  the filling that fell out?  well, the tooth split right down the middle.  just like some bloody piece of oral kindling.  and the last of my wisdom teeth; well it was finally his time to go.  the filling was more like some kind of twisted foreplay.  and my dentist, skilled professional that he is, yanked those two bad boys out in one go!  no pieces, no bloody soggy holes, just smooth and neat, thank you.  oh, did i mention that i have a high resistance to drugs?  yep.  so the poor bugger has to use NINE (9) syringes of anaesthetic: roof of mouth (x2), around both teeth (3), rear lingual nerve (1), upper left gumline (1), upper rear right gumline (1) and a final shot right in the top lip (1).  six hours later, i kid you not, my face was still numb.  it's wierd.  i don't like the dentist.  correction, my dentist is a cool-ass guy, but i don't like the practice of yarding enamel out of my head.  i had a perfect smile.  even my dentist said so.  now it has a gap.  !@#$.  and it's going to cost me $4000 to fix it.  shit on a popsicle!  all this oral trauma, emotional and physical left me drained and feeling even more lonely than ususal.  let me tell you this, it sucks driving two hours back from the dentist's and you come home to an empty pad.  there's no one there to comfort you or even poke fun at the fact that you now look like a hockey player (go flames go!).  be grateful for whomever you have with you.  you're lucky.  most of us aren't.  i'm gonna go surf some porn and play video games.  it's a different kind of lucky.  :)

      my grandma has sold her house.  she and grandpa started with the garage, which my dad lived in from birth until he was three, and then moved to the house when they were done.  things took time then.  and they didn't have much money.  i've known that house all my life.  we've had family reunions there and birthdays and holidays.  that house has been a central fixture in many great memories.  and now, well... now it's gone.  grandpa dies a long time ago and grandma... well she's just tired of living without him.  she's in a care facility now, which she likes, and she's tired of back and forthing to the house only to leave it again.  for 50 years she's lived in that house.  watched my dad grow up, leave home, marry, and his kids, us, come back to her.  it's amazing how something like a house can influence so many people.  it makes me sad that people no longer live in places for 50 years.  i thought i would.  i hope i still can.  anyway the point of this was simply to announce that i got my grandma's kitchen table and chairs and the blue couch and chair.  the table arrived today and i've placed it in front of my big window.  i plan to draw on it and i hope that all the great times i've had at that table will suffuse into my home here.  while i understand the purpose of life and the temporariness of it all, i can't help but attach to some things and feel a little sad when they are gone.  i'm glad i got the table and stuff.  i'm glad the things that are in my home are the things we spent the most time as kids playing around, eating around, loving around.  my home is now a place that has a bit of grandma's and a bit of dad's.  it makes me happy and makes me feel a part of something.  my drawings will be even better, i just know it.  :)

      so. i'm starting a blog.  neat.  it's 4am and i've just finished whipping up a drawing for a projector cavity.  to me, it's like using an ICBM to swat flies.  10 years in film and i'm reduced to this: illustrator PDFs of cavity dimensions.  but there's more to this new turn of events and i'll rant about it here later.  right now i'm enjoying black licorice and some Bombay Beats streaming of my WinampPro.  i'm trying to decide if i should go to sleep, read THEN sleep, surf for stupid animations or draw, read THEN sleep.  if i had a girlfriend, some nooky would be in order... but i don't, so i can't.  poop.

      i went to the dentist to see about a filling that fell out.  he'd done a root canal and filled the hole as a temporary solution while the thing healed enough to do a crown.  sound idea.  i thought.  then the filling fell out as i was eating.  and the hole left over got annoying as food kept getting stuck up there.  then it started to hurt.  turns out the entire tooth split and there was no saving it.  right in the side of my smile.  thanks.  so now i have this big-ass hole there.  and the sweet part?  it'll cost me $5000 to fill it properly.  thank you dentist guy.  moral of the story?  find a good dentist.  spoil the shit out of him.  be happy.  i did say GOOD dentist didn't i?
