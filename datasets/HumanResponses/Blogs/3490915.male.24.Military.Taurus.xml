      I went out last night with my friend Doug and a guy named AJ from my boat.  Mostly, we sat at the bar, chatting on subjects ranging from good places to go in D.C. to reasons for leaving the Navy.  My girlfriend is in New York for fleet week, so I was without my usual escort.  After downing a few brews and staring for a while at the bartender's gravity-defying (and massive tip-generating) breasts, I decided to cut the night short and head back to Doug's walking distance condo and crash for the night.  This news was much to the chagrin of Doug and AJ, who insisted that I go out with them to the Time Lounge with Doug's neighbor, Jimmy.  Jimmy is a fat, completely unattractive man in his late thirties who seems to know every beautiful young girl in the Norfolk area.  He works for autotrader.com and probably makes a whole lot of money.  Maybe the attraction is his knowledge of vehicles, but I kind of doubt it.  The Time Lounge is in downtown Norfolk, nearly 30 minutes drive from the beachside bar where we were currently.  I said that I couldn't possibly drive in my current state, and Jimmy's car was so fully packed with tanned buxom beauties that he only had room for Doug.  AJ decided that he would get there by way of his motorcycle, which apparently doesn't become harder to ride at night when you're drunk.  I declined his offers to give me a lift.  After a few minutes of walking, I sauntered into Doug's condo and passed out on the upstairs bed.  I am later awoken by door slams and loud talking.  Soon, Doug and AJ are calling my name loudly, demanding that I get up and eat the doritos they had acquired at some point in the night.  I slowly got up, shaking off my latent drunk headache, and partook of some chips covered in powdered cheese product.   A night like this would have been a wet dream in high school, and the story would doubtless be recounted for weeks on end in the cafeteria.  In college, I would have enjoyed the night quite a bit more as well.  Now it all seems so meaningless and empty.  Going out and getting hammered is a great way to forget your troubles and maybe land a piece of ass.  But if getting laid is not a priority and what's eating you can't be washed away with malted hops and barley, you're left at the end of the night with a thinner wallet, smoky clothes, and a magnified sense of loneliness and despair.  I see why people turn to drugs.  Alcohol is merely a non-prescription strength metaphysical pain reliever.

      Instant messaging.  The new tool of communication for our times.  In an age where just about everyone either owns or uses a computer, the free messaging services provided by Microsoft, AOL, and whoever else allow users to chat with one another in private windows.  All that is required is a connection to the internet and some software downloads.  I would assume that this contrivance has been simultaneously freeing up household phonelines and damaging productivity in businesses.  I started using instant messaging in high school.  First ICQ, then AOL IM.  After a few days of usage, it became apparent to me that most of my peers used their computers at some point after school, and with instant messaging, I could chat with them while I did homework or surfed the internet.  At the Naval Academy, dorm rooms did not have telephones (this has since changed in the last few years), so instant messaging was not only a good way to keep in touch with family and friends in the outside world, but a convenient means to contact a buddy who might be just down the hall.  Hell, if you can't call Joe to find out if he wants to go for a 5 mile run, you might as well ask him over AOL Instant Messenger.  Forget stopping by his room to find out; we're too lazy for that.  More on that later.  One thing that instant messaging services provide is a means for people to communicate with those whom they normally would not.  For example, my buddy list is teeming with people who I haven't seen in years and don't plan on visiting anytime soon.  I don't talk to these people on the phone, and I have no desire to find out what their numbers are.  To put it simply, I don't care enough about these individuals to call them or write them a letter (even an email).  And I certainly don't consider them important enough to visit.  Instant messaging allows me to keep in touch with these people while maintaining distance.  A telephone conversation is a one-on-one dialogue that requires some semblance of attention and focus on the part of the participants.  It's very rude to zone out and miss entire plot points of someone's latest drama because you simply weren't paying any attention.  "Sorry, Julie.  I didn't hear what you were saying.  I'm trying to get this damn ingrown toenail..."  Lets face it.  Some folks we know just aren't worth our full, undivided attention.   Enter the Messanger...  IM allows us to chat with several people simulataneuosly while doing other things on the side.  To catch up with four people who you don't care about out of boredom while searching ebay for a pompasan chair is certainly not out of the ordinary.  What's best is that you can not respond to someone for quite a while, then say that you were distracted and had to leave your computer to take care of something.  Perfectly acceptable when instant messaging.  Better yet, if Sam from middle school is boring the shit out of you (or even worse, asking for contact information such as phone number, email address, etc), you can simply type, "hey I gotta run.  TTYL".  By blocking him from your list or signing off, you create the illusion that you didn't even read his last message.  Beautiful.  Another advantage of IM is that it allows you to write passages that are rank with sarcasm, but have little chance of being detected, since typed messages carry no vocal inflections.  That and the fact that the person you're talking to is an idiot.  In our age of conveniences, anything that warrants one to get off his or her ass had better be worth it.  IM allows us to kill time at work and talk to people with our asses firmly planted in our seats.  Phone conversations take some effort to pull off, but IM takes almost none.  Even personal emails carry the unwritten rule that some effort should be put into their composition.  With IM, none of the above applies.  Find out intimate details about Carol's abusive ex-boyfriend while keeping her at arm's length.  I love it.   So that's my take on instant messaging.  If you're a complete stranger and would like to talk to me about it, my AOL IM name is jeffolee.  Feel free to chat me up.  I'm talking to you, but I'm probably talking to three other more important people, checking my email, and looking at nude pictures of Eva Mendes at the same time.  It's nothing personal.

      My girlfriend is not Chinese.  She's half Filipino, half black (Like Jay-Z, I suppose).  She's the love of my life and my reason to wake up each morning.  My mother, if you hadn't already guessed, is not thrilled.  When Elaine and I began dating, I didn't tell my parents.  After all, I'm supposed to date Chinese girls, right?  For many Chinese parents, dating people who might even LOOK Chinese (Koreans, Thai, Japanese, etc) was just outrageous.  It all stems from tradition and bigotry.  Simply put, they want to maintain pure bloodlines because Chinese are better than everyone else, and mixing just dilutes our greatness, or some nonsense like that.  My mother first discovered that I was dating Elaine when she asked me if I was seeing anyone.  This was after Elaine and I had been together for several weeks.  I said that I was dating someone, and we left it at that.  No mention of color or creed.  The introduction didn't come until later.  My mother flew up to Annapolis to visit me and to watch the Army-Navy game.  After I introduced Elaine to my mother, mom sat in silence for the entire game while I talked to Elaine and wished that I could disappear.  Apparently, my mom found this so hard to swallow that she demanded I take her to the airport immediately after the game so that she could try to catch a stand-by flight back home.    All my life, my parents had taught me about the evils of discrimination and the importance of equality.  I guess everything goes out the window when you bring your black girlfriend home for dinner.      Elaine and I have been dating for nearly three years now, and it's been hard.  She has been to my parents' home twice, and although the meetings have been cordial, they were still rather tense.  My mother is in perpetual denial, and constantly tells herself that we're just "friends", even after three years.  I want nothing more than to marry Elaine and start a family, but my mother has threatened to take her own life if I do.  Worst of all, she's a bi-polar, impulsive woman, so her threat may not be an empty one.  All of this is very hard for Elaine to take, which is completely understandable.  She loves me enough to stay by my side, but she's wearing thin and approaching the breaking point.  She is angry at me (and rightly so) for not having the courage to do what I want to do and to stand up for her.  However, if I kill my mother, I'm reasonably sure that our relationship would suffer as a consequence.  Therefore, I am an impotent, powerless loser.  Someone help me find my balls.  Obviously, this has been quite a point of contention and the source of many heated arguments with both Elaine and my mother.  Mom is wondering how I can do this to her, and Elaine is wondering the same thing.  Eventually, things will come to a head.  I will have to propose to Elaine to keep her from walking, and I'll have to call my mother's bluff.  If she comes around, all will be well.  If she does herself in, she will win.  I'll be guilt-ridden for the rest of my life, and my relationship with Elaine would probably be destroyed.   Please, God.  I need a miracle.

      I have a tattoo on my left shoulder blade.  It's a price tag for $10,000 attached to a string coming out of a cut in the skin.  Ten grand was, incidentally, how much money I received as a bonus for volunteering submarines.  To say that choosing submarines was a mistake is quite an understatement.  Allow me to explain.  Growing up, I had always been outside the "norm" for Asian-American kids, especially Chinese ones.  Yes, I did play the violin, and I did reasonably well in school.  However, I never had any desire to become a doctor or engineer, the career paths that Asian parents consider the yardsticks of success.  The prospect of attending Harvard, Yale, and Princeton also failed to interest me.  What I did consider interesting was a career as a military officer.  Being the teenage male that I was, I was seduced by advertisements for the Marine Corps.  The sharp uniforms, precision in movement, and sense of almost invincibility that the men in those commercials displayed never failed to give me at least a semi.  My interest aroused, I did some research and quickly discovered that there were several options.  The U.S. Naval Academy, Naval ROTC at a civilian university, applying for Officer Programs after graduation from college, or enlisting after graduation from high school.      Well, I'm Asian...I have Asian parents.  Confucious say "Don't use good steel to make nails.  Don't use good men to make soldiers."  That coupled with the fact that Asian parents consider not going to college to be unspeakably shameful, enlisting was not an option.  I had to go to college, but which one?  GA Tech offered NROTC, but it was far too close to home.  My mother would bother me incessantly, so that was out.  I decided that I would have to go to the Naval Academy because it would be completely free.  The government would pay for everything, and my parents would have absolutely no financial leverage.  No threats to stop paying tuition because I wasn't making good grades, was partying too much, or dropped out of pre-med.  I decided that if I had to have a master, I would rather have Uncle Sam than my parents.  I made the decision years ago and never looked back.  I enjoyed my time in Annapolis, and when my senior year rolled around, it was time to choose service assignments.  Everyone who attends the Academy is obligated to serve at least 5 years in the Navy or Marines.  My initial choices were 1. Marine Naval Flight Officer, 2. Marine Ground, 3. Navy Naval Flight Officer, 4. Submarines, 5. Surface Warfare.  Depending on academic and military grades, the selection boards decided who got to do what, with the top performers getting their first choices.  So there I was, all set to go Marines.  Then comes the nuke bonus.  At an information brief, we learned that officers who volunteered to undergo nuclear training for submarines would receive a ten thousand dollar bonus as soon they were accepted to the program.  Following training, they would receive another two thousand dollars, as well as extra monthly pay.    They got me.  Hook, line, sinker.  Needless to say, I volunteered, and was ecstatic when I checked my account and saw that I was substantially wealthier than before.  All my dreams of becoming a Marine Officer came crashing down around me, but I was too busy writhing on a bed of filthy greenbacks to notice.  So am I a mercenary, a whore, or both?  I was obligated to serve one way or another, but I chose the option that offered the most cheddar.  Completely sidestepping my original plan in the pursuit of my own dreams, I ran to the money.  My parents were relieved at the news; serving on a submarine is safer than toting a rifle into enemy territory as an infantryman.  However, I would soon discover that neither nuclear power nor submarining were my cup of tea.  Patriotic soldiers serve proudly out of a sense of duty, and take pride in their work.  Mercenaries serve begrudgingly for money, and will do a slipshod job as long as it's good enough to receive full payment.  I can't put myself in the first category.  A whore degrades and enslaves herself (or himself) temporarily in order to make money.  The plasma TV hanging on my wall didn't get there all by itself.

      Somehow you have stumbled upon this website.  Congratulations.  Chances are that your being here is the result of a search for Asian porn gone awry.  Or maybe you are actually interested in what I have to say.  Either way, welcome to the site...or Blog, as it is.  The title of the page pretty much sums it all up.  I suppose that I'll be updating as much as my schedule allows.  How often that will actually be remains to be seen.  Here's a little bit of background for you. (Cliff's Notes style)  Me My name is Jeffrey Lee.  I was born on April 22, 1980 in Princeton, NJ.  My parents are Clarence and Faye Lee.  My ancestry is 100% Chinese.  I have a sister named Stephanie who is two years my junior.  From the age of five until I left for college, I lived in Lilburn, GA, a suburb of Atlanta.  In July of 1998, I entered the United States Naval Academy as a midshipman.  Four years later, I graduated and was commissioned as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy.  I am currently a submarine officer serving aboard the USS Hampton (SSN-767) based out of Norfolk, VA.   My Girlfriend Her name is Elaine Davis.  We met during my senior year at the Academy, and have been dating ever since.  She is half black, half Filipino, and completely lovely.  Hailing from L.A., she graduated from high school the same time as I, but went to the Naval Academy Preparatory School (NAPS) and entered USNA the following year.  She graduated in 2003 and was commissioned as an Ensign in the U.S Navy.  She currently serves aboard the USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7) as the Electronics Repair Officer.

      Smoking is getting to be a pretty unpopular activity these days.  There are so many campaigns against smoking, and with all the anti-smoking propoganda, rising taxes on tobacco, and increasing number of establishments (and states) placing bans on indoor smoking, smokers are becoming a dying breed.  As a result, smokers are banding together.  When I was at the Academy, I used to wake up early in the morning and go to the gym.  At 5am, there were usually only a handful of people working out.  Day after day, it was always the same people, and we all knew that we had something in common.  We were the ones that were sacrificing a couple of hours of sleep each night to hit the gym in the morning.  Inevitably, we developed mutual feelings of understanding and respect for each other, even if we barely knew on another.  Smokers are doing the same thing.  Since fewer people are smking, the smokers know each other.  They know exactly who the smokers are, who they can bum cigarettes off of when they're running low.  They know who else is with them, fighting the good fight.  ok, I'm done here.

      Here's the situation.  My sub is going to sea in this week.  My girlfriend's ship returns to port while I am gone.  When I come back about two weeks later, her ship leaves again that same day.  Her condo closing was supposed to be weeks ago, but the builders are dragging their feet, and we don't know when it's going to happen.  Fathers' day will roll around while I'm at sea, and I bought a card already.  I have to mail it soon, but I can't seem to get off my ass and actually write a message and send it off.  As of right now, it's still sitting in a plastic bag along with a bottle of Heads and Shoulders beside my bed.  I think it's because I don't know what I want to say in it.  Should I just say "Thanks, I love you", or, "Thanks, I love you, but hey, help me out here with this."?  I don't know.  If I keep this up, it might never get mailed.    I have to pack.  Going to sea for a while will require lots of underwear, my uniforms, blankets, toiletries, and a lot of other things.  I don't feel like packing.  Maybe it's because I don't want to go to sea.  Or maybe I want to go to sea without my things.  Who knows?  I just ate most of a large, three topping pizza, and I'm feeling pretty queasy.  If I didn't feel like throwing up, I'd probably eat the rest.  Pour the garlic butter sauce all over it too.  I'm starting to get a six pack again.  Maybe I subconsciously don't want to get back into shape.  So great.  I hate my life.

      I just installed a new ceiling fan in my condo's extra bedroom.  I wall-mounted my plasma TV and drilled holes in the walls to conceal the wires.  I spent hours running speaker cable under my living room carpet.  My buddy Doug is installing a wetbar complete with sink and stone countertop in his place.  He just finished tiling his bathroom.  Why is everyone constantly repairing their decks, replacing shower heads, repainting, resurfacing, reinstalling, and making The Home Depot and Lowe's some of the most profitable companies in America?  Why do we spend our hard-earned dollars on supplies in order to use our scarce and valuable free time to undertake home improvement projects?  We all sense that something isn't right.  Obviously, our lives aren't perfect.  Our relationships with signicant others may be crumbling, stagnant, or even non-existant.  We might be facing the prospect of losing jobs that we want to keep, or be mired by the possibility of working jobs that we hate for the rest of our lives.  We're too short, too fat.  Hair is graying, or falling out.  Our parents are ashamed of us, our kids hate us.  Whatever.  No matter who we are or what we do, something is not right.  Something is missing.  We're all incomplete, and we don't know what to do about it.  The obvious answers are the hardest to carry out.  Hate your job?  Then quit.  Afraid of losing your job?  Work harder and do whatever you have to do to keep it.  Too fat?  Diet and start running.  Wife wants to leave you?  Get your ass in gear and sweep her off her feet again.  The problem is that we're too scared to try, to lazy to make the effort, or both.  Either that or the answers simply elude us.  One way or another, we find ourselves powerless to improve our situations.  So we channel our energy in other ways.  A very basic human response to feelings of unfulfillment is to engage in some kind of activity.  After all, many great artists and musicians were deeply troubled souls who expressed their depression and frustration with their craft.  Well, the artists aren't the only ones who are troubled, but we can't all be geniuses.  As a nation, we have determined our activity of choice.  Bob Villa should be proud.  Things are gnawing on your mind, so you decide to repaint your kitchen.  The activity numbs your anxiety and soothes your pain, while the satisfaction of seeing the results of your toils edges you to continue working, furthering the cycle while you get closer and closer to forgetting whatever it was that was eating you in the first place.  It's not just home improvement.  It's spiritual amnesia.  When I finished installing the ceiling fan, I took a step back, flipped a light switch, and watched as the blades slowly came to life.  I couldn't help but smile with some degree of satisfaction, seeing the fruits of my labor.  My job certainly can't give me that kind of satisfaction, and I'm sure that many other people are in the same situation.  I imagine that Doug also spent several minutes surveying his newly tiled floor with delight.  He was certainly excited about it, seeing how he invited me over later that evening to take a look.  A feeling of accomplishment AND excitement.  This home improvement deal just keeps getting better and better.  The reasons for initiating home improvement projects are seldom for repair, but for change.  It's certainly easier to change the color of your walls than to change your drinking habits or penchant for overeating.  Swapping out the linoleum in your kitchen for hard wood is much simpler than switching from your current job to another one.  We all want change in our lives, and the home improvement store down the street gives us a chance to have it.

      One of my friend's parents own a little chinese restaurant in Atlanta.  The food is reasonably priced, authentic, and very good.  The establishment itself is nothing out of the ordinary.  Located in a strip mall and decorated just like any other Chinese sit-down place in America, the restaurant is standard fare.  They offer convenient take-out service as well as free delivery for orders over ten dollars, and the restaurant is staffed with friendly English-speaking Chinese folks.  However. despite the high quality food, good location, and convenience that the restaurant provides, it doesn't make much money and in fact struggles to stay open, barely making enough to pay for itself each month.  The problem obviously isn't the food.  Nor is it the service or location.  And it's certainly not from a lack of advertisement; there are ads in the paper, coupons and flyers galore.  The problem is that there are so many chinese restaurants to choose from.  Just open the yellow pages and you'll likely be overcome by the deluge of options laid out before you in black and goldenrod.  The Happy Panda, The lucky Szechuan, the Szechaun Lucky Panda, whatever.  The combinations are endless and so is the selection.  Chances are that when you get the craving for Chinese, you'll stroll out to the restaurant nearest you since they're probably all the same anyway.  In the end, no Chinese restaurant has much of an advantage over any of the others.  Why drive across town to the Jade Dragon, when Hong Kong Harbour is right down the street?  The key to breakout success is to offer something that no one else does, thus drawing more business and making more money.  The traditional Chinese restaurants aren't doing it.  In comes P.F. Chang's Chinese Bistro, the chain of contemporary Chinese restaurants sweeping the nation.  Chang's offers a dining room with the atmosphere of an Outback's Steakhouse, deliciously non-threatening Chinese food, and a decor that would make any yuppie home decorator jealous.  When you walk into a P.F. Chang's, you won't see the same tired framed picture of golden dragons against a garish red background that is so common among other Chinese restaurants.  P.F. Chang's' dining room design is like a fusion between a new age studio apartment and a Chinese art exhibit.  Recessed lights peer out of an assymentrical ceiling bordered with what look like hand painted animals and flowers.  Terra cotta soldiers are placed strategically to catch light from the perfect angle, as are what look like expensive replicas of Ming vases.  Black granite covers the top of the bar.  Colors are subtle, bamboo abounds, and the place just looks splendid, showcasing the mythical harmony that she Chinese supposedly possess.  It's a far cry from the local Chinese diner with a lamely animated picture of a river that has a power cord leading straight from the side of the picture frame to the wall.  Your server's name might be named Jessica.  Jessica will pour everyone at the table some tea, explaining that tea is the traditional drink of the Chinese.  She'll allow you some time to peruse the menu, which is printed on thick paper with a beautiful and exotic font, and even includes an introductory paragraph welcoming the diner to join in a celebration of fun and food.  Jessica will then return, making suggestions for the main course and appetizer, frequently reminding you to not be intimidated and that everything is actually quite good.  She'll then explain the intricacies of eating Chinese food, such as the use of chopsticks instead of forks, and the use of soy sauce instead of table salt.  Of course, forks and salt shakers are readily available to anyone who wishes to use them.  The fact that Jessica will remind you to not be intimidated speaks volumes about Chinese food in general.  Most Americans' knowledge of Chinese food is limited to a few well-known and well-loved dishes.  General Tso's Chicken, Beef Lo-mein, Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef and Brocolli, and Sweet and Sour Chicken to name a couple.  Few dare to venture into the realms of sea cucumbers and Mopu Tofu.  The truth is that most white Americans actually have a fear of the "other" chinese foods.  They know what is safe, and everything else might be just a little too exotic.  "Screw the shumai, I just want an eggroll."  P.F. Chang's may not offer the most wide selection of Chinese foods.  In fact, many of the dishes are actually Thai or from other east Asian countries.  However, the diners at P.F. Chang's are provided with a guide (remember Jessica?) who will hold their hands through the entire process and encourage them to try somethign new.  The mere possiblity of someone ordering something besides the Orange Chicken Combo skyrockets exponentially.  So now we have the new white-friendly Chinese places.  Others are taking P.F. Chang's lead and creating similar restaurants that might as well be a bar and grill, but serve Chinese food.  Exotic, yet not too out there.  Familiar, but different enough to make you feel adventurous.  You might taste roasted water chestnuts in oyster sauce for the first time ever, and there's no chance that the cook is going to walk into the dining room shouting incomprehensibly while brandishing a meat cleaver.   Do I particularly like the new white-friendly places?  Yes and no.  The decor is certainly easy on the eyes, and a welcome break from the tired surroundings of most Chinese places, but the food in many respects just isn't as good.  The variety usually isn't there, and what they do have doesn't always taste authentic.  In fact, it usually doesn't.  It's not bad, just not what I'm after.  I'll continue to patronize the old-fashioned Chinese resaurants, and I believe that although they won't make a whole lot of money, they probably won't close their doors either.  They're not going anywhere, and that's precisely my point.
