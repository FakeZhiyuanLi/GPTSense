      Current music: Jimmy Eat World-"A Praise Chorus"  What a shitty ass day. It sucked. Royally. I was talking to some girl named Jessica, who knew my ex-boyfriend, Jon. For some odd reason not yet known to the human population, I still have affection for the bastard. But anyway, so this Jessica girl says that Jon says he loves her. Well, that just really got my panties into a twist, because Jon says he loves me. I don't always return it, but still. I IMed his "ex-girlfriend" and tell her all about it. A few hours into the ordeal, we come to find out that Jon had not told Jessica that he had a girlfriend, so the two were a fucking couple for God knows how long.  In the end, he had played three girls. Fucking bastard. Men are fucking bastards. There are a few good ones. Key word. Few. So I'm all pissed off. I had to get off AIM, and I decided to take a nice bath. I got it pretty shallow and just layed there..until the ends of my hair were wet. Which reminds me, God, I hate shaving my legs. I feel like there is something I really, really want (besides the new Ashlee Simpson CD, well, Damien Rice would work well, too..), but I can't put my finger on it....I kinda want a boyfriend again, but I kinda don't. And I feel really weird; I kinda want school to start back again, and I kinda don't want it to...once again, I just don't know about anything right now. What else does God want to throw at me? Oh, but I'm complaining. My apologies. Well, I might call my grandmother tomorrow and see if she wants to go take me to see A Cinderella Story....

      Yes, I know my time is wrong. If I cared, I would change it. But I don't care. Plus, I'm lazy. So fuck off. Have a nice day.

      current music: Air-"Cherry Blossom Girl"  I've been seriously suffering from sleep deprivation. I went to bed at around 5:00 in the morning, when my mom was supposed to wake me up at six. So I ended up having an hour of sleep. o_O But then I went to sleep again, after about an hour, and I woke up at 10:00. So about six hours of sleep in all. And this happens everyday. I'm surprised I'm still walking, as well as breathing. Anyway, I got offline at around three. My sister decided to bug me and stayed in my room for about an hour. Not that I could have slept if she was gone, anyway. I read a book for about another two hours. And then I pondered....why the hell doesn't my lava lamp work?! >.  I have come to a conclusion. I have no life. My parents say I spend too much time online. Maybe they're right. ...Maybe. Who knows at this point in my life? But I find that I don't really like being outside. It bores me. I mean, what is there to do? Well, sometimes I'll go shopping. Sometimes. But I usually go to bookstores. Where there is manga. Lots of manga. *becomes starry-eyed just at the thought* And coffee. I'm living off of three things. Iced coffee, H2O, and VH1. And AIM.  Okay, so four.   There must be something wrong with me. I want to see A Cinderella Story. You know, that movie with Hilary Duff? Yeah. Oh, the patheticness (is that even a word?). Well, it looks good....I'm sick of jocks and cheerleaders and preps. Honestly, they think they rule the school. Those poor corrupted souls, how wrong they are. The weirdos shall prevail! ^_^

      Good God, finally, something close to peace. I have been working on this stupid blog idea for hours. Maybe this little thing will be worth it. Only God knows....Anyway, even though I have hardly left this computer, I feel as if I have been on the move all day. I'm exhausted. That's what being pissed does to you; it sucks you dry of energy. I'm addicted to my Katy Rose CD again. Which isn't really a bad thing, because she kicks some serious ass and is such a rare find when it comes to artists these days. She's seventeen, and some of the songs on her album (Because I Can) were written by her when she was just thirteen. Admirable. She says her first album is an autobiography, and this makes sense; I can relate to everything she writes about, as well as find out some of the stuff she has felt. This album is really a journey through her deepest thoughts. God...I feel like I can't be as deep as I really am on this blog...but maybe that's because I'm tired and my life sucks right now. And now I'm complaining. *beats head against keyboard* On top of that, I start back to the hell hole of a school, Priceville, in a few weeks. Dammit, where has summer gone? I'd be more excited about being a fucking freshman if only I wasn't forced to suffer through Priceville. It's such a crap school. I could go on and on...but I am just so tired...so....I think I'll just go. It could be a good thing, or it could be a bad thing if I wake up tomorrow. Depends on my fucking mood. It sucks right now. Ciao, y'all.
