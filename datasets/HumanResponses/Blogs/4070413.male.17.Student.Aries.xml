      Don't make me cry because i have no tears. Reluctant to be engulf be sadness but nothing can be done. Yearning for true love yet came a false alarm. Ending maybe hard and difficult but bugging will never works. Recollecting memories holds its meaning but grieving over past is cruelty.

      Naive is hoping for impossibilities. Selfishness request for more. Stupidity makes yourselves look silly. Stubbornness refuses to accept the reality. Complacency limits yourself from improvement. Foolishness brings shame. Realistic bored your partner. Manliness shows no interested. Feminine shower with care n concern. maturity gains the fame. Childish bears the consequences. Love is special but isn't magnificent and lead you nowhere. Is there something call Everlasting? Neverending? Forever or even Eternity? I doubt. Prove everything to me. Everything will end after you met enough people.

      Forgiveness is the biggest virtue. Only forgiveness can bring down hostility to harmony.Love life pondering through my head. chemistry isn't enough to proceed to the future. Promises keep the person but not his heart. Running away from commitment is selfish. Compromising your partner is basic. Honesty will accumulate trust. Giving everything you can will lead to being taken for granted. Precious words had now became worthless. Love isn't selfish, it will reciprocate.

      Experience can prevent you from making mistakes but still cannot escape from heartbroken state. Abide by the choice made by stubbornness. Abandan everything with courage. Stand guard against everypassby chances. Regardless good or bad and assume everything is here to destroy n hurt you. Driven to madness by love. When will i grow up? How long must i remain as a kid? the rising sun is forcing me to move on. Where did i come from? Where should i proceed to? Where is safe for me? Insecurity is how i feel. Everybody had put on a poker face. What is real; what is fake? I don't know. I can only stay calm and analyse every single person. Not to let my guards down. Judges are unbelievable. DO humans know that people around are putting on a facad? Or have they realise and refuse to believe that they are? Or are they simple n pure? Are their sympathy real or are they there to mislead you n get you hurt again? Complex - a set of prepressed emotions and ideas which affext a person's behaviour; an exaggerated reaction(to something). I had enough of thepeople who hides their true evil self. Show yourself! Stop it! I had seen lots of fabrications. Convinced that that humans learn to protect themselves. Kind hearted is not my personality. Hatred in me cause me to lose myself again. Learned that standing in the crowd will only endangered myself but i chose to hide inside. The philosophies of human nature is profound. Ridiculous contradictions only put yourself into more confuse mindset.

      The dream happiness which everyone pursue after. The best moment is just before we got it. Just because we get hold of it. We have to start afraid of losing it. Be it jealousy or possessive, the root of the cause is always fear. To give too much, the other party will take for granted. To give too little, he will think u don't love him enough. To ask for too much, he will blame u for not respecting him or ask for too much. To ask too little, he will think that u don't concern about him. Too much questioning, he will think that u don't trust him. If the status really causes all this problems, why not we always remain dating? Why not just enjoy each other companion? Whylet those fear manipulate us? Even though we know thats the cause, but we are selfish n choose to proceed with confident. We just see the surface of the problem and avoid it by tolerate n keep pains to ourselves. Do the other party know that we are suffering? Humans do have feeling. When the feelings is beyond our control, when we couldn't hide it anymore. Our tears will start to drop. Some will ask why is this happening to them? some will abuse themselves. Some will drink or smoke. Some will blame others but not themselves. But least will introspect themselves. Theother party may be a flirt or he just couldn't tolerate ur atrocities. We must know how to learn n stop being crazy. The definition of love is too profound. There is no one that can explain every single detail. There is always mystery hiding deep inside. So we cannot assume that we are able to control our love. We are not able to change the fact that we cannot control the other party. We cannot change their mindset, unless they are willing to. If not he will be suffering again. There will always be something to lose. Something really precious

      The song once burns the flame of love between us had now extinguished. In order to commemorate our past memories, i will listen to our song once again. Used to escape from this song n deny that u were once my past. But all of the sudden, its doesn't bothers me anymore. So i assume that i don't love u. To look at u once again, i felt that u r unfamiliar. Taking another closer look, i can't recognise u anymore. Are u ther one i deeply love before? I think the defensive wall within my heart had recover from the past hurting wounds. Probably time really heals all wounds. Just finish writing. I fallen asleep

      The flowers had long blossomed. Am i still living in the past. Do u still remember how we met? Or have u forgotten our promise? The blazing sun came along with us. The journey seems to left me with much of painful & unforgettable memories rather than happiness. Planning the future but dare not think of being with eternally. Eternity is an impossibility. Like the daily routine of the sun, our love had set down. Perhaps there is no more love in us. Why am i still living in torments? I'm sure that i don't love u anymore but why am i so discourage when i hear about u? What a person had been through, had been through. There is nothing such as restart or starting over just because the scar is not visible n the pain is no longer there. But the scar is always there. Same as our minds; once stretched, it will never regain to its original dimension. Probably this is why I can't forget u. I am sure I can get over in no time. Should i be proud or guilty? Proud as in able to forgive n move on while guilty as in my love isn't that deep enough. When the feelings isn't there anymore, can i force it back? Til now, there is no proven ways. So should the next sunrise brings u back to me? I doubt as well as i believe the reason for the parting is inevitable. So i will continue my life while waiting for someone i don't love to come back to me .

      Beautiful attributes, charismatic tongue or saccharine smile? Bad habits defeat the Love at first sight. DO u still have the same impression of me when u first met me? Based on the theory of love, it has broken the rules. Love isn't about looks. It said to be the personalities and characteristics which individual preferences stand the piority. SO why does people doll up themselves? Are they hoping for something more? People tend to improve on the relationships with new friends while neglecting the old ones, some even their cloest kins. Thats why i think human are insensible! the immaturity in them makes them go after the new n better ones rather then improving the current old friends. Have they forgotten when they were at their darkest period, the people who were with them? The golden days that they shared and the most difficult hurdles they had gone through. In fact, they had clean forgotten. Maybe some still remember but unwilling to do anything to revive it. They had never grow up neither they will ever grow up. When will someone learn to treasure the people who love them? When will they give up on the people who don't love them? Everyone says that being love is fortunate than loving someone. But being with someone u don't love is painful. Thats why humans are stubborn. Once stubborn always stubborn. This is a natural cycle. We can never escape from it.

      Living in this world got so many things to be proven.Trying so hard to be accepted by this world. Yet there isn't much more chances to prove than to escape and retaliate against reality. Surviving is just having basic food n water.True knowledge of life is about searching, understanding, thinking and changing -nothing to worry about. Serious as it may be and simple as it may be while complex as it can beyond imagination-Descriptions of life expressions are golden.Thats why i am honoured to write it down. How i wish to express it with music n words. Thats is what i always been wanting.

      Tears of sadness accompany our way through the heartwrecking scene, running in the painless rain feeling heart piercing pain. Holding all the memories back and reluctant to give up. Everlasting &amp; neverending are everybody dreams but it will also end like a dream...

      I am thinking of him but will he miss me? Passion of love really filled my body. I cant resist him but what can i do? So how much u love me? Pls tell me. But can measure love? Neither love can be proven in a short time. Are we destined to love or to part again? So much so much more to say but there isn't chance to say but being too obvious will cause misunderstandings.

      What is life? To be love or not to be? To be use or not to be? To follow what people request or not to? What else can it be? Love is a source of energy to prolong life but how about those without love?

      Everything came as expected. Or should i say i am asking for the consequences even though i know it will turn out this way. Chances are low but i persist. I am not the lucky guy. Neither waiting for someone is.

      Asking for love, face the consequences. Yearning for recovery, yet remain in painful memories. Try to be cheerful but still cannot escape rom past things. Some are sad while others are confuse. Melancholy romance is the most painful thing. So much different types of love. Family, Friends, Relationship, Teacher n student, i been focusing so much on Relationship n neglecting the presence other love. Thus Everthing will be lost when u lose ur only love.

      Seeing things that are unusual is eye opener. As always one thought that they are well-knowledge. The things we see on tv, hear from the news is reflection of what people believed. What we don't see are alot more cruel that it can be beyond imagination. Being aware that you are ignorant is a great step to knowledge. Hoping that someday one able to go around the world to gain more wisdom rather than remaining somewhere that all are provided. Feeling the hardships n pains of others by experience it is beautiful. Being sophisticated is gorgeous. Should one be content n satisfy with what they are now? If they are, they should be abashed..

      I congratulated you for finding your love. Am i real sincere or faking? I suppose to be sad but why should i pretend to be happy? Will my loce for you fade away? Til now it have not. Pretence is how i show my love. Happy to chat with you for a few minutes. Maybe even by seeing u somewhere. This proved the fate is created by someone up there. I must not allow the fate to play with my love ones. Does he love me? So how much he loves me? No he don't love me! He now belongs to someone else. I'm too slow... Never appreciate my love, my unrequitted love. But why i always have the feelings that he loves me. just too sensitive on his behaviour towards me. What am i to him? Maybe i just thinking too much.

      Wasn't aware of being the third party... i was being hooked in a triangular relationship. As the feelings grew deep, all i could do was to prevent it from sinking deeper. You were acting suspiciously, no matter how hard you tired to hide.. how serious u tried to be... i was able to spot you out. Your words were doubtful. Didn't we promised to be true to each other? I guess i too naive, i guess the trust had been broken, i guess i knew what would happened, always believed that there was another party, but why am i still so sad when you told me about him? I thought i already knew?! You told me that he took you for granted but why you still love him? Thats love... same as my love for you.. i chose to love someone that wasn't worthy of it, someone cheated me, someone played with me, a someone who is unfamiliar to me now... i don't love you anymore... Still, the same old tune brings me back to memories lane... I had listened to this music thousand of times. Someday i found this poignant version, also closest to the one we used to listen together.. My mind overwhelmed with you again, everything seems back in time... Yes. We can actually go back in time with the help of wonderful memories. I really feel the presence there? But for sad memories, they are something that we will forget sooner than what we expect. without the feelings with the memories, i doubt we can return to time? But would you go back if you cannot change anything? Just let the tragic repeat once in your mind...

      The feelings came so abruptly. Is not one i can deny it. To think that love must be in possession of the other. Thats why i made my first step. Coincidence brought us together. I'm conscious of the on coming consequences &amp; results. Knowing flowers blossomed will someday die but still chose to pursue my love wholeheartedly. People think that love do not need to be voice out and we can feel it. To a certain extent i agreed, as we can feel the love enveloping us. But still without your acknowledgement, i felt insecure. Just because my understanding of human's complexitivity... Knowing smoking can kills but people still do it... The disappointment is deadly. But i can do nothing. Who can gives me an answer? To question myself not wanting to wait aimlessly. What if there is no answer? Who dares to question the atrocities of life? Who can ever tells me the brink of love is man made or by natural? The answer is to experience by yourself, only this can nurture your behaviour towards life.

      If i were to suddenly disappear from here. Will there be anyone to search for me? Can i trust humans kindness? Just have to wait until i was found. Maybe in the darkness, it is easily for me to recollect myself. the more i want it this way, it will turn out the opposite. There are lots of changes made, but my stubborness remains. Don't really likes to do things which i think it will work the way i think because i hate to see my assumption turns out incorrect. As people always praise my intelligence, i more afraid if i cannot prove them right. Am i really that intelligence or am i just lucky? Before i can be myself again, i have to keep on acting. As it is really tiring, thats why i always want to behave like a kid.

      anyone reading this blog may name them and tell me...  ----The good n bad memories. Everything is whirling in my mind. Without any scientific way, yet can return back to time... Just get yourself torture again n hurt once more.  ----Things may not happen because they owe you. Maybe its just natural cycle.  ----The pain of loving someone had numbed the fortune of being loved.  ----The art of loving is not to take, not sacrfice but to let go.  ----Put yourself in my shoe, how much you love him means how much i love u.  ----The scent, resemblance and music... From time to time maybe someday to the brink of time.. They always exist there.  ----Can dwelling over poignant memories be enjoyable? It tells us about what had happened. To remain unhappy always, you will realise many simple happiness present around us.  ----To try dating with someone before getting into a relationship is said to be mature &amp; understanding of the other. But at the point that both are deeply in love, do you thin they will still date before they get together? Dating is juz to nurture the feelings between each other. If thats the case, what for try to love each other when there is no love yet? COnsiderating the fact that love is a special feeling, please prolong its existance before it fade away.
