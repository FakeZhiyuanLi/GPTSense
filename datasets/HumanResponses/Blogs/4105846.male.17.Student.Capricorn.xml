      Am I honest? Am I true? Am I good enough for you? Am I brave? Am I bright? Am I the one you dream of at night? Am I cruel? Am I quiet? Am I your love like you said? Am I serious? Am I funny? I am.. I am.. I am.. Me.

      I sit here waiting for you with nothing to do and no one to talk to being alone brings out the words that help make up this song  waiting for a message from you telling me were finished at last only the radio keeps me entertained eventhough I dont like the song  Im so bored I think of things but I cant think of anything right now just the excitement of seeing you of seeing you... of seeing you  I can see you walking toward me you and your perfect personality I can smell the scent of your perfume from here ain't love a funny thing? just seeing you is a big deal for me everything you do is wonderful to me  Then I woke up from a daydream I realized that youre not here im back here in this place so boring waiting for you... waiting for you

      by: The Juliana Theory   You're the words that come out easy, And I am speechless at best. Your star it seems to shine above the rest. You're the face before the cameras, The smile i'd like to earn. The closest thing to perfect, In a hollywood to burn. You're the beauty that is deeper, Than eyes can merely see. The closest thing to perfect. But the farthest thing from me.  I'd love to be, The shoulder that you cry on. I'd love to be, The friend you call when things are great.  I'd love to be, The shoulder that you cry on. I'd love to be, The friend you call when things are great.  You're the dream that hasn't ended, And i'm still anxious for rest. Your words they seem to hang above my head. You're the bud before the flower, Unfurls into full bloom. Captivating beauty, But it maybe all too soon. You're the song that writes a story, But leaves alot to read. The closest thing to perfect, But the farthest thing from me.  I'd love to be, The shoulder that you cry on. I'd love to be, The friend you call when things are great.  I'd love to be, The shoulder that you cry on. I'd love to be, The friend you call when things are great.  And like I really deserve a chance to, Sit across the table, And tell you that I think you're wonderful. And I think you're something special. I guess this is my only chance to, Say I wish I knew you, Because I'm sure you're wonderful, If I'd get to know you.

      Too many times when I said were done, but youll cry when you think im gone, so now ill give you a chance to make up. Feeling the teardrops falling in my shirt, that's when the feeling start to hurt, so now ill give you a chance to make up.  This isn't the first time I gave you a chance, because I believe in this thing called romance, so, I will give you another chance to make up. Weve been through a lot in the past, the memories are so vast, so, I will give you another chance to make up.  This will be your last second chance. To have an attitude that is enhanced. This will be your last second chance. I'll say be careful in advance.

      Feeling guilty with what I have done wish I didn't do it coz now youre gone but i tried to stay strong and make sure I wouldnt run i didn't know this day would ever come  Ive tried to change my whole self for you because I know what I feel is true I tried to forget the pain in my heart that's bruised but I always knew that I could never do this to you  I now know what it feels like to have a heart thats broken I say that my heart is numb, but I can still hear your heart calling begging me to come back because its me whom youve fallen but I keep on saying no, and I keep on shaking  I always think about why do you have to be like that all the things that I have said you didn't understand Even if I explain thouroughly, you still wouldn't try to comprehend Even simple things you still don't try to understand.  I want you to remember that even if we couldn't be together, id still be here like what I have promised as your lover. Nothing would change, we would stay this way forever, to hurt you as a friend is what I would never do. Never.

      Awake, through the years it takes to see you  'Til I almost lose my mind 'Cause I'll never be alright And I'm sorry you had to see this  But I'm such a mess And I never could forget   I'm scared I'll miss the way we use to talk And if its all forever lost dont wanna know I'm scared that you're the one that got away And i want you here with me Tonight, will never come    I'm scared I'll miss the way we use to talk And if its all forever lost dont wanna know I'm scared that you're the one that got away And i want you here with me Tonight, will never come

      by: Dashboard Confessional >the song that makes me cry every fuckin time i hear it..must be the mtv unplugged performance though..  I'm always assuming the worst, but you're going on none the less & there's nothing to cusion your heart led fall. Letters from further away keep pulling me close to home. And there's something to cushion my callous sighs. And I know that you hope for longer good-byes embracing for forever and falling in your eyes.   Pouring over photographs. I'm living in your letters. Breathe deeply from this envelope it smells like you & I can't be without that scent. It's filling me with all you mean to me.    Continually failing these trials but you stand by me nonetheless & you won't let me sink though I'm beggin you.  Phone calls from further away & messages on my machine, but I don't ever tell you this distance seems terrible. There is no need to test my heart, with useless space. These roads go on forever And there wi'll always be a place For you in my heart   So I'll hit the pavement it's gotta be better than waiting & pushing you far away cause I'm scared.  So I'll take my chances & head on my way up there. Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten.

      by: The Get up Kids  can you sleep as the sound hits your ears? one at a time an unspoken balance here unabridged for so many years  that I should stare at  receivers  to receive her isn't fair   don't worry I'll catch you don't worry I'll catch you don't ever worry   your arms in mine any time wouldn't trade anything you're still my everything   to my suprise before my eyes you arrive  don't worry I'll catch you don't worry I'll catch you don't ever worry  still breaking old habits,  habits you pulled the wool over me and I can see everything everything remembering Jinx removing  don't worry I'll catch you don't wory I'll catch you don't ever worry   no need for reminding you're still all that matters to me...

      by: dashboard confessional  You called to say you wanted out. Well, I can't say I blame you now. Sometimes you've got to fall before you're found out. Well thanks for waiting this long to show yourself.   Cause now that I can see you, I don't think you're worth a second glance.   So much for all the promises you made, they served you well and now you're gone and they're wasted on me. So much for your endearing sense of charm, it served you well and now it's gone and you're wasted on me.  You called to say you wanted out. Well, I can't say I blame you now.

      by: jaythegame   I can't explain the way I'm feeling, these things in my head are so confusing. Why should I suffer from all these? You always give me a headache, whenever its my time you try to take. Can you please stop coz I'm suffering.  You never listen to everything I say, that's why I didn't insist that you'd stay. Making comments about the madness that we've been through. You tried to ruin my life, and all along you thought it was right. So now I'm staying away from you!  Why can't I stand seeing you like this crying and screaming your apologies while I don't believe in any of these because you and your words are full of infidelities!!

       I noticed you smile at me,   of all the people smiling   it's yours that gave me a slight bump   in the head,   and maybe in the heart.   You gave me a slight bump   in the head and in the heart   when I noticed you smile at me.      We've been friends for a long time,   and that span of the time   we've known each other very well   and I know that it's selfish to say   "could we be more than friends?"      I know it's selfish   but could we give it a try?      So please,   knowing you turned to loving you   and I can't help but to try! To Try!!      To try! I can't help but to try!      To Try! To Try!   It wouldn't hurt to try!      It may be risky,   it may be fruitful,   it may be dreadful,   but can we please try      To risk our friendship,   a new relationship!      I know we can work it out!!!!    >>>I wrote this song while listening to my Dashboard Confessional Collection and I suddenly thought, "I could make a song like that!" Then I took a pen and paper and started writing everything that came to my mind. This song relates to what happened to me in my high school days. It was when my barkada, "Alphappogi" (hello guys!), went to Cubao after school to buy things for our CAT and while walking along Lantana St., my friends realized and found out that I have a crush on Joanne. Wow! Lupet nila makahalata because the two of us ( Joanne and Me) was walking and they were a a few steps ahead of us. So parang nasa hulihan kaming dalawa at naguusap. Biglang nagsalita si Byron na "jay, may sasabihin ako sayo. Sating tatlo lang to nila Regil.." Nagtaka ako kung bakit at naisip ko baka nahuli na nila ako. Sabi ni Byron, "Halata ka Chong!" sabi ko, "Saan?" sabi niya, "basta halata ka!" biglang dumating si reg at sinabi "Chong JOCO ka!" at doon nauso ang 'JOCO'. kaya yun, tapos biglang mejo nagkakailangan kame ni Joanne nun pero nginingitian niya ako nun kaya "I noticed you smile at me.." diba? Parang iniisip ko nun na maski magkabarkada kame pwede naman maging kame diba? If we'll risk our friendship, the caterpillar might become a butterfly or it would die. Gets? May possibility na magkagulo ang friendship namen o kaya maging kame at magbloom. Astig noh? bakit ko ineexplain ito? mushy ung song pero nakakaadik (imagine an artist addicted to his own work) walalang..Tungkol dun sa araw na un ung song..Parang tinatanong ko sa sarili ko na itry namen. Sabi naman ni kumpareng TEB na "magkakapatid tayo dito. ikaw ba papatulan mo kapatid mo?" Pero ok na un. We decided to go for it, tignan mo ngaun it worked ouyt just fine!Astig diba? walalang. Share ko lang..

       Welcome to  Mangyanan ! Bago to ah! Blogspot blogspot. Kung anu ano lang naman ilalagay ko dito e! Natatakot ako kasi tinext ako ni Pauline, na isa kong close friend at nagkakilala kami nung third year high school, kanina at sinabi niya na kasama ako sa 18 serenades sa debut niya. Kakanta ako ng kantang dinededicate ko sa kanya. WOW! Ako kumanta? Sa harap ng madla? This wont be the first time but I remember the last time I sang a song onstage..Fuckin' shitty man! I forgot the lyrics of the fuckin song! it's ok naman maganda naman ung pagtugtog ko e. Pwede kaya ung 'The Closest Thing' ng Juliana Theory? Pwede na un! Hala andami ko na nasabi at dadamihan ko pa. May problem ako dito sa blogspot..Hindi gumagana sa Mozilla ko itong crap na to. Hindi naman ako gumagamit ng Internet Explorer dahil crap tong browser na to. Napipilitan tuloy ako. Parang Zorpia ba tong blogspot? Pangit ung Zorpia e. Crap din! Buti naman naayos na ung PS2 namen kasi hindi ako makapaglaro ng Spiderman 2!!!Nakatulog si Joanne ng maaga. Hindi ko naman siya masisisi dahil may pasok pa siya bukas. Naiintindihan ko un mom tulog ka lang jan at ingat ka ha. hindi ako galit. Ayun, andami kong prublema noh? Makikinig nalang ako ng 'Dashboard Confessional,' which is my favorite band. Sige hanggang dito muna..
