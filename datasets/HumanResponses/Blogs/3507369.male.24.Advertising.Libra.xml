      The desire is to overcome the pain and let this deepest sensation of numbness be transported by a thin cry. The point, lordolord, what's the point if true is that madness will be nothing but a faded stain on a mirror and the world won't be mourning its own vileness? Point is that of the pain, the numbness, the cry... Point is... taken.

      - What if I tell you we can't go on? - Have you, already, or will you? - Don't know... - Well, choose. - Well, it's hard. - Yes it is. - I´ll tell you, then... - Hum... - Look, we can't... I can't. - What? - Don't know... - C'mon, make up your mind! - Yeah. I've already said then. - Well... - Wait! - Ahn? - Well, it's kind of... - What? - Serious, isn't it? - Yes. - So. leave it. - Ok, then.

      Life can be just a game, life can be a just game, life can be just wonderful. A wonderful life led as a game till the game is lived over, is just a game played as life, while life itself runs over.

           Here, every opinion does count. Every little thing concerns every little one, for as most unimportant and expendable as it may seems. The point, in this blog, is to share your unthoughtfull thoughts and your unreasonable reasons.      Yes, it is a bit scary, but nevermind the fear of being stupid... Aren't we all? Well, I know I am.      So, give this to yourself, give yourself the pleasure of saying what you want, anonymously.       LET GO AND... SHARE.

      I praise you, my true rejoice, my pride, my perfectly good mood, my bride, the reason for me to be, my own voice, the tears of this river of joy and its course, my fragrant lullaby, my dreams, my force, my truth and all the lies beneath, the oath I make, the promises to brake, my wide open sea, my abyss, my very choice.

      Mind your life as your own single business and forget to reprehend me for my stupidity! I don't care for your support or your censure, so nevermind my illusion and my religion, 'cause I choose to have one and not the other. Please be a doll and go find yourself a Ken, just leave me with my fears wich can lead me to a place of forgiveness and abandon. Close to you I'm half a human, I can't cook, I can't sing, you even told me not to laugh. Well I'm sorry, I can not cook, I can not sing, I can even try not to smile, but my laughter is my deepest trace of humanity, it's what puts me in touch with my imperfections, my weird sounds, my breath-takes, my tears and your lack of sense of humour. Minding you as you really are, I stop to mind and start asking myself what the fuck was I thinking?

         I believe that we should try to be very aware of our existence. We must be conscious of what it means to exist, what it means to be a live human being and what comes with this condition.    I believe it shouldn’t be so hard to acknowledge that we are all living precarious lives and, because of that, we're inserted in a context of interdependence and colaboration. To be aware of our true existence is to be aware of the other's true existence; it is the first step to accept our own limitations and, in consequence, to accept the other’s.    I believe that really knowing and understanding the fabulous complexity and the multiple consequences of the simple act of existing is our greatest challenge in this life. This is what will grant us the absolute awareness of our own humanity. This is what we'll call, someday, our essence.        Well, that´s what I believe... yet, I realize it can be a large amount of bullshit.

      Tomorrow I'm going to the moon. I'll leave the orbit of this two savage suns who stare at me like I'm some kind of weird event, so then I can face my new life among the holes and the gases that surrender the will of that unimportant satellite. Tomorrow it all will be past in time and the future won't be in my hands, but lost in this universe of uncertainty.  But all of this' gonna take place only tomorrow, for now I'll be stuck here, confronted with my reasons of severe gravitation.

      Time after time in banning lists, guaranteed as data in a register book, dead as a static eye globe that lost its depth and doesn't dive in adventure anymore.  Time after time in screening lists, time after time screaming with fists stood high and slow, a trip into my lost world of insanity, wonder and contemplation contemplating, complain hating, complete hasting in a vain greek catering, over hors d'oeuvres and canapes.  Time after time, like a clock that lost count of its last minutes, but realized that it takes a second for time to be stopped.

      To keep on going and loose track of time. To keep on skydiving and keep your head held high. To keep on misunderstanding and keep up with the good work. To keep on dancing and lay your hands on dirt.  Keep it cool 'cause it can't warm up, keep it free 'cause it can't break down.  Just keep growing up and don't mess to much around.  Don’t keep the nut uncracked, don’t keep the furniture unmoved, don’t keep the question unasked, don’t keep the love ungrooved,  don't keep your life from yourself or keep it, till it’s nothing left on the shelf to keep.

      Mais um  Hoje foi um belo dia de ócio. Nada para se fazer, nada feito. Nem a cabeça com droga nenhuma, nada. Mas, ainda assim, foi um belo dia. Um dia como muitos que já passaram e como outros tantos que hão de passar... e passarão bem calmos, se deus quiser. Um dia que até agora não acabou e que ainda apresenta um monte de nada para se fazer. Um dia que foi útil no mundo todo - exceto talvez em algum remoto canto onde se jejuou perante uma imagem de um rinoceronte branco para se atingir a plena purificação da alma - para mim não passou de mais um dia... que vai passando. Passando. Passando modorrento como a vida toda, perante meus olhos como a vida toda, sem movimento como a vida toda, sem que eu me mova como na vida toda, mas belo, como só o ócio pode ser.    Another one  Today was a nice idle day. Nothing to do, nothing done. Not even my hair in some bad trip of any drug, nothing. Yet, it was a nice day. A day like many that have passed and much others to pass... and, lordolord, they'll pass quietly. A day that´s not over yet and which still has plenty of nothing to do. A normal week day for the whole world - except for maybe some distant place where people fasted before some white rhino sculpture in order to attain purification of their soul - to me was nothing more then another day... that's passing. Passing. Passing lazy as life, before my eyes as life, motionless as life, without me moving as in life, but nice, as leisure can be.

      Gripado como um filho da puta, dedilhando estrofes&nbsp;engasgadas num violão alugado das coisas remotas de minha irmã, batucando livremente letras bagunçadas em uma ordem familiar e funcional, espremendo o que há de sumo aproveitável nessa cabecinha privilegiada que, por seus orifícios, emite odores e barulhos nauseabundos, rabiscando uma cifra monocórdia de bemóis esganados, sustenido por devaneios e por uma pequena dose de medicina, vou piscando, abrindo e fechando os olhos, vou fungando, inalando e expirando ares, vou morrendo, sorrindo e partilhando horrores.

      I am, indeed, remarkable. Beautiful, smart, polite, bright, eloquent, witty, elegant, resourceful. Getting to know me is a perfect thrill. Challenging, defying, an overwhelmingly splendid taste of fulfill. Yes, all of this is true and, yet, not enough. My modesty impels me to say no more, although it's tough.

      Como se minha estupidez não fosse suficiente no meu próprio idioma, eu ainda tento conformá-la ao idioma dos outros. Como se eu não fosse incapaz de fazer sentido na minha própria língua, eu ainda tento comprometer minha inocência não fazendo qualquer sentido na língua dos outros. Como se eu não fosse um tipo estranho com meus próprios maneirismos, eu ainda tento incorporar estranhos modos de outros tantos estrangeirismos. Como se eu já&nbsp;não fosse chato falando em mau português, eu ainda tento chatear, num inglês que nem os outros acham bom. Como se não bastasse essa conversa fiada, eu ainda tento fazer dela&nbsp;algo significativo.

      The father messes with his mind and fortune; drags him down to that sewer of deception he built with zealousness and conviction and about which he won't speak, unless his son sinks in it with a big laugh through the teeth. From father to son, he speaks of indignity and deceitfulness with half-words somewhat sarcastic. But he's not that ashamed. Not embarrassed at all... constraining the young man with guilt, introducing him to sorrow, illing him at ease, leaving a trace of bitterness upon his soul – rugged carpet made of its own roughness. Some father of a son.

      Playing my guitar with  a song I heard a long  time ago and which talked  about giving our hearts to  the ones we choose to love,  so they could do whatever  they wanted with them.  I play it for you, now.  You can do with mine  whatever pleases you; it is  a&nbsp;blank piece of paper and  it's for you to write anything  you like on it, put every word  of enchantment or delight,  lay each letter of disbelief  and help me forget about  myself... cause I already  remember you. I play it  for me, what can I say,  it's just for me.

      I made you a song, but won't sing it for you.  I'm still trying to ask for your forgiveness,  but am not that sure you're ready to give it to  me. You're probably right and quite not ready  to come back either... well, I know I´m not.  I only think that we're too messed up without  each other and do believe I'll be better off with  you here, in my strange little world, yelling  at me. The song I wrote didn't mention any of  this, just remembered the nice times we spent  together and the beautiful feelings we shared  at those meandering hours. And, as a love song,  it didn't tell only the truth; some lies were  added to it, some deeds enhanced, some wrongs  corrected. As a love song, it didn't work that  well. So, I picked myself from the disposal and  faced my fear, standing tall with my chin up,  prepared for my well-deserved unforgettable slap.

I ask you this, cause I don't know me and I don't really understand my purpose. Do I have a purpose? Do you? I know none of this does. What is this shit? I ask you, cause I don't know it and I can't really understand its purpose. Does it have a purpose? Do them all? I don't think so, but who am I, again, to say this? Well, nobody, I guess... just a simple guy with some shit to say. Why?

      I got a ticket to paradise, from here, this quiet litlle place, this stupid placid place, right to the one spot my mind cries to suggest, straight to a stainless and undecayed  piece of peaceful hell.  I got a ticket to Tikrit, but I´ll pass on bumpin' into any of the Husseins, at any place, any shattered violated place, to stay in my own small oasis of alienation, obliviated by a careless distance.  I got a ticket to Pasargada, where I'm friends with the king and with the whole royal family, where I have mistresses in the court and manicures for my negligent fingernails, but am hated by husbands and fathers.  I got a ticket to the movies, but there's nothing there I believe, those infatuated kisses, those nauseated speeches along with fabricated tears, nothing to be realized or even purchased by this bitter self of me.  I got a ticket to hell, from this monotonous sacred life, this prosaic little space, straight to a sort of daring and offensive place, right to my organic and exaggerated shred of arousing paradise.

      Thrill me with your smile, your single smile, opened in bright light, overwhelming to my soul that rests, right by your side, the one place aside my own peace and recognition.  Thrill me 'cause you can, and none of me betrays the trust you lay upon our bed, over and by, inspite my prayers, inspite  myself, unwinding self wich fails thinking of you.  Thrill me and be my bride even if it dies in front of you and reborns through the struggle I face within my mind, minding you as a business undone inside.

      SONETO DE FIDELIDADE (Vinicius de Moraes)  De tudo, ao meu amor serei atento Antes, e com tal zelo, e sempre, e tanto Que mesmo em face do maior encanto Dele se encante mais meu pensamento.  Quero vivê-lo em cada vão momento E em seu louvor hei de espalhar meu canto E rir meu riso e derramar meu pranto Ao seu pesar ou seu contentamento.  E assim, quando mais tarde me procure Quem sabe a morte, angústia de quem vive Quem sabe a solidão, fim de quem ama  Eu possa me dizer do amor (que tive): Que não seja imortal posto que é chama Mas que seja infinito enquanto dure.   Estoril, outubro, 1939.

      The bitter smell of your peace inebriates my will and, as a soldier of nostalgia, constrains our wedding vow. Somewhat like a kaleidoscope, it spreads its colors of uncertainty over my obtuse intellect until I'm inevitably dazzled by its power to emancipate a strung spirit. But, as good as any simple smell, it vanishes in the dark of a castle of disbelieve and fades along with the unreasonable sensations it mindlessly inspires. And the kaleidoscope... well, the kaleidoscope is interrupted in time and space and imagination, unabled to sheer any light into our overwhelmed and corrupted bonds of happiness.
