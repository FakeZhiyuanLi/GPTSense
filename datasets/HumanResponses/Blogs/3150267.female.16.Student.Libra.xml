      Young girl, don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall Young girl, it's all right Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly  When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream  Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems No one ever wants or bothers to explain Of the heartache life can bring and what it means  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Young girl, don't hide You'll never change if you just run away Young girl, just hold tight And soon you're gonna see your brighter day  Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid No one reaches out a hand for you to hold When you're lost outside look inside to your soul  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Yeah... Life is a journey  It can take you anywhere you choose to go As long as you're learning You'll find all you'll ever need to know  You'll make it You'll make it Just don't go forsaking yourself No one can stop you You know that I'm talking to you  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Young girl don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall

      May there always be work for your hands to do;  May your purse always hold a coin or two;  May the sun always shine on your windowpane; May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain;  May the hand of a friend always be near you;  May God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.     ~In Time, it isn't the things you do, but the things you leave undone, which give you a heartache at the setting of the sun.~    ::I truly agree with this... ^_^ May God bless u::

      mm... thought tt i can make it through the rain... but... don't think so bah... was caught in the heavy downpour today... so took 106 wif dori and went to clementi interchange... still pouring like crazy... i hoped that maybe the rain would cease when i reach my house... but no... when i took 196 from the interchange, the rain got heavier... it matched my mood... haha... surprisingly, met wm on the bus... he took it from sch going to somewhere else (didn't really talk to him when i was on the bus)... so the weather was still as horrible as it could be... alighted at the same stop, he "offered" me his umbrella... so delightedly, i got home with his umbrella without getting wet...  Through this, i realised that i can't really make it through the rain all by myself... i still need help from my friends... need their luv n care to pull through difficulties...    Dory n i talked quite a lot today when we walked towards the bus stop... it's quite in-to-thoughts... some how see another persepective of life... n wat devoted means... haha... Dory is a very nice friend who nevertheless will try her best to help n do whatever she can to provide her service... ^_^ Thanks Yiting (z)... keke...    ~It is better to lose your pride to someone you luv, then to lose the one you luv with ur useless pride...~     Praise God!!

      We shouldn't be pessimistic about life!!!  we should be contented with what we have n not sigh over what we don't have... Even when we are down, we should not feel sad... instead, look at the bright side... i m sure that ur life have not reached the bottom (at least u have something which some ppl don't have)... Instead of changing an environment to feel better, i believe that maybe we should change the way we look at it... ^_^ I think i m talking crap here... but ppl... enjoy ur life... we don't have a lot of decades to spend here... haha... Love urself n love everyone around u... ^_^ happiness doesn't pop out on it's own... it's hiding for u to find it n realise the importance of it... when u r physically hurt, u will then realise how gd it is to be well... when u had a fall, u will then realise how easy it was for u to walk last time... Let our hearts be filled with joy n love... let us forget all those unhappy things... n wish for a better day tml.. ^_________^ God bless...       ::I still believe that after every storm eventually a rainbow appears...::

      "The Lord is my strength and my shield. My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices and with my song I will praise him."  I've still got a lot to learn  But, at least I know where I can turn  When I'm in my times of need  Just as long  (As I know all things are possible)  Just as long as I believe   I've loved a lot, hurt a lot  Been burned a lot in my life and times  Spent precious years wrapped up in fear  With no end in sight  Until my saving grace shined on me  Until my saving grace set me free   Giving me peace  Giving me strength when I'd  Almost lost it all  Catching my every fall  I still exist because you keep me safe  I found my saving grace within you   Yes, I've been bruised  Grew up confused  Been destitute  I've seen life from many sides  Been stigmatized  Been black and white  Felt inferior inside  Until my saving grace shined on me  Until my saving grace set me free   Giving me peace  Giving me strength when I'd  Almost lost it all  Catching my every fall  I still exist because you keep me safe  I found my saving grace within you   And the bountiful things that you do  Lord thank you  For delivering me    ~Happy are the people whose God is the Lord...~

      When you get caught in the rain With nowhere to run When u're distraught And in pain without anyone When u keep crying out to be saved But nobody comes And you feel so far away That you just can't find your way home You can get there alone, it's ok  Chorus I can make it through the rain I can stand up once again On my own and i know That I'm srong enough to mend And everytime I feel afriad I hold tigher to my faith And I ive one more day And I make it through the rain  And if you keep falling down Don't you dare give in You will arise safe and sound So keep pressing on steadfastly And you'll find what you need to prevail Once you say  Repeat chorus  And when the wind blows And shadows, grow close Don't be afraid There's nothing you can't face And should they tell you U'll never pull through Don't hesitate Stand tall and say  Repeat chorus  I can make it through the rain And stand up once again And I'll make it through the rain  Oh yes, you can You're gonan make it through the rain  ::Believe in yourself... trust that you can n you will make it through the rain... to everyone... God bless. ^___^::

      bored... n hungry...n tired... in my house for the whole afternoon (almost.. minus the fact that i was trapped outside the house for an hour -_-!!)... don't dare to tell my parents about my carelessness coz i m really scared that they would be boiling mad with me...  dayima is still tempting me with chocolates which he is eating now... not scared that your diet plan fail? keke... jking...  *stomach goaning* hungry... no food in the fridge... no junk food in my living room... no fruit juice in sight... arh! the monitor now looks like an enormous pancake... *drooling* maybe should stop thinking about food...   My parents found out about my relationship with wm, my mum sounds rather calm when she talked to me about this and told me to get my priorities right at this point of time.. (lol... sounds familiar)... haha... i told her not to worry...   Starting to feel that sharing a computer with someone else isn't safe at all. The thought of my parents going through my things makes me feel sad. Even though what they did show that they cared about me... but i really hope that i can still have a little privacy in my life... i feel so insecured... it's like standing nude in front of the sea of audience... haha... maybe i m too sensitive... still, i feel happy that i can have such loving parents who are always there by my side when i thought that i couldn't manage my things well... haha... i m so glad that i have such nice parents... ^__^   enough typing liaoz.... too hungry to type... dayima!!! stop tempting me with food!!!! wm: u shouldn't have invited him to eat cake yesterday...    ~Light without life is a candle in a tomb, life without love is a garden without bloom...~

      Another saturday where i need to go to school and have my hectic life...  There is no better time than right now to be happy... Happiness is a    journey, not a destination... thus I'll work like I don't need money, love like I've never been hurt, and,    dance like no one's watching.  "Adapt and not tolerate... they are totally different 2 things... when you learn to adapt, you live with it with happiness... tolerating only makes the misunderstanding and gap between people bigger... ..." yah... it's true. Between friends, we should learn to adapt to their personalities and behaviours. Even if they are not what you really want them to be, but remember, they are ur friends. Treasure them and adapt to their lives. Instead of changing your friends, wouldn't it be better to change how you look at her?   To u-noe-who: specially dedicate this to you.. u r a great friend n always give me lots of advice when i really need help. ^__^ thanks for you concern too...  Things will get better n i believe that after every storm, there will be a sunny day... ^__^ ~God bless everyone~    ~The secrect to enjoying life is to be thankful for what each day brings...~

      我们都没错，只是不适合... 我要得我现在才懂得... nice lyrics from jolin... nope... i still do not know... I still do not understand... If 2 people really love each other... then what is it that is holding them back? If 2 people are not meant to be together... then why do they still love each other so deeply (or just the 1 of them who is so madly in love)?   What's love? How do u show it that u really care for that person? Why is it that each time you wanted to convey something... it just got misunderstood? Can anyone tell me?    ~Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.~

      Please take a few minutes to read this cos i think it's holds a lot of truth and might change the way we live... take care n God bless!   THE ROOM  17-year-old Brian Moore had only a short time to write  something for a class. The subject as what Heaven was like.  "I wowed 'em," he later told his father, Bruce. "It's a killer. It's the bomb. It's the best thing I ever wrote." It also was the last. Brian's parents had forgotten about the essay when a cousin found it while cleaning out the teenager's locker at Teays Valley High School in  Pickaway County. Brian had been dead only hours, but his parents desperately wanted every piece of his life near them, notes from classmates and teachers, his homework.  Only two months before, he had handwritten the essay about  encountering Jesus in a file room full of cards detailing every moment of the teen's life. But it was only after Brian's death that Beth and Bruce Moore realized that their son had described his view of heaven. It makes such an impact that people want to share it. You feel like you are there." Mr. Moore said. Brian Moore died May 27, 1997, the day after Memorial Day. He was driving home from a friend's house when his car went off Bulen-Pierce Road in Pickaway County and struck a utility pole. He emerged from the wreck unharmed but stepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted. The Moores framed a copy of Brian's essay and hung it among the family portraits in the living room. "I think God used him to make a point. I think we were meant to find it and make something out of it, " Mrs. Moore said of the essay. She and her husband want to share their son's vision of life after death. "I'm happy for Brian. I know he's in heaven. I know I'll see him.   Brian's Essay:  The Room...  In that place between wakefulness and dreams, I found myself in the room. There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with small index card files. They were like the ones in libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical order. But these files, which stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction, had very different headings. As I drew near the wall of files, the first to catch my attention was one that read "Girls I have liked." I opened it and began flipping through the cards. I quickly shut it, shocked to realize that I recognized the names written on each one. And then without being told, I knew exactly where I was.  This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my life. Here were written the actions of my every moment, big and small, in a detail my memory couldn't match. A sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror, stirred within me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content. Some brought joy and sweet memories; others a sense of shame and regret so intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching. A file named "Friends" was next to one marked "Friends I have betrayed." The titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird. "Books I Have Read," "Lies I Have Told," "Comfort I have given," "Jokes I Have Laughed at." Some were almost hilarious in their exactness: "Things I've yelled at my brothers." Others I couldn't laugh at: "Things I Have said in My Anger", "Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents." I never ceased to be surprised by the contents. Often there were many more cards than I expected. Sometimes fewer than I hoped. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived. Could it be possible that I had the time in my years to fill each of these thousands or even millions of cards? But each card confirmed this truth. Each was written in my own handwriting. Each signed with my signature. When I pulled out the file marked "TV Shows I have watched , "I realized the files grew to contain their contents. The cards were packed tightly, and yet after two or three yards, I hadn't found the end of the file. I shut it, shamed, not so much by the quality of shows but more by the vast time I knew that file represented. When I came to a file marked "Lustful Thoughts," I felt a chill run through my body. I pulled the file out only an inch, not willing to test its size, and drew out a card. I shuddered at its detailed content. I felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded. An almost animal rage broke on me. One thought dominated my mind: No one must ever see these cards!  No one must ever see this room! I have to destroy them!" In insane frenzy I yanked the file out. Its size didn't matter now. I had to empty it and burn the cards. But as I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor, I could not dislodge a single card. I became desperate and pulled out a card, only to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it. Defeated and utterly helpless, I returned the file to its slot. Leaning my forehead against the wall, I let out a long, self-pitying sigh. And then I saw it.. The title bore "People I Have Shared the Gospel With." The handle was brighter than those around it, newer, almost unused. I pulled on >its handle and a small box not more than three inches long fell into my hands. I could count the cards it contained on one hand. nd then the tears came. I began to weep. Sobs so deep that they hurt. They started in my stomach and shook through me. I fell on my knees and cried. I cried out of shame, from the overwhelming shame of it all. The rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes.  No one must ever, ever know of this room. I must lock it up and hide the key. But then as I pushed away the tears, I saw Him. No, please not Him. Not here. Oh, anyone but Jesus. I watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards. I couldn't bear to watch His response. And in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face, I saw a sorrow deeper than my own. He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes. Why did He have to read every one? Finally He turned and looked at me from across the room. He looked at me with pity in His eyes. But this was a pity that didn't anger me. I dropped my head, covered my face with my hands and began to cry again. He walked over and put His arm around me. He could have said so many things. But He didn't say a word. He just cried with me. Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files. Starting at one end of the room, He took out a file and, one by one, began to sign His name over mine on each card. "No!" I shouted rushing to Him. All I could find to say was "No, no," as I pulled the card from Him. His name shouldn't be on these cards. But there it was, written in red so rich, so dark, so alive. The name of Jesus covered mine. It was written with His blood. He gently took the card back. He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards. I don't think I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, but the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk back to my side. He placed His hand on my shoulder and said, "It is finished." I stood up, and He led me out of the room. There was no lock on its door. There were still cards to be written.  "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." - Phil. 4:13  "For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."  If you feel the same way, forward it to as many people as you can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also.  My "People I shared the gospel with" file just got bigger, how about yours?    ~Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow; it empties today of its strength.~

      It was the last one. We picked it up n started fighting for it. it was a moment of enthuism n truth. Meisi managed to grab tt last piece n fit into it. it was perfect.   Silence at first as we stared at her, mumbling someting under our breathes. all of our wanting to be the one who got hold of it. after a fraction of a second or so, it soon turned into screams of happiness. (i think those who had not left sch after 6 would be able to hear some high pitch shouts from us (ms, qt, yihan, dori, yc, hj n me). hehe.) We did it! we finally did it!! haha. the 1000 peice jigsaw puzzle is finally completed after 2 days of struggling n trying to strain our eyes to differentiate black n ... black. haha... i was so happy! ^_^ we hugged each other n congratulations filled e room. arh! i thought we would take at least a wk to finish ms junaidah's wedding present. hehe. (shh... don't tell her, it's suppose to be a secret!) i believe tt without our whole class's team work, we would not be able to finish the puzzle in juz 2 days. yesterday, we spent 5 hrs staring at the puzzle n were still thinking how long it would take to complete. today, we worked for 4 hrs (2-6plus) more n our effort is not wasted. the puzzle looks wonderful. as perfect as any picture could be. it's a scene of a little boy kissing a little gal who was on a train. the hard part wasn't the 1000 peices but rather the boy who was wearing a hat which has the same colour as his trousers n the gal has a bonnet the same pattern (spotted) as her dress!! at first we grumbled, but when the picture was out, our success is certainly sweet. ^_^  i like puzzles. it's a very interesting game where u really need a lot of concentration n patience. at the same time, we can also built bonds thru this as we encouraged each other thruout the whole mind-teasing, eye-straining n hand-stretching "exercise". hehe.   but wat's the consequences? qt n mad swore not to touch jizsaw for 3 years or so. i had nightmare abt it as whenever i shut my eyes, i saw the half done jigsaw in front of me while i tried to fit the pieces in. haha... but it's still so fun. ^__^   ~The greatest discovery is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude...~    ::Patience is a bitter plant but it has sweet fruits.. haha... indeed, we should learn to be more patient n we'll be able to have things done more quickly. Just like our puzzle ^_^...::

      Another day passed just like the others, but today was sad. more sad. i don't understand wat's wrong wif myself. y should i feel sad? i shouldn't be. my life is as peaceful and as joyful as it could be, but wat's really tt something which made me feel so empty? these questions had been circling in my head like irritating flies which i don't noe the reason y they r even there. i prayed. i talked. i sang. i tried to indulge myself into every single possible thing which i can think of doing, but nothing seemed to work. it was just there, it was still there... i can't help going into a trance everytime when i m not doing anything. i didn't give a response when my frenz asked me things (sori guys). i couldn't even slp well at night, been bugged by so many things in my head. maybe i do noe wat it was... maybe i don't want to acknowledge it. maybe... maybe...  looking at the mirror, i saw tt gal wif a smirk on her face. it was a smirk of stupidity. mocking at me, telling me to accept some truth which i needed to accept n stop living in a self-denial state. the chanting of "the world is not perfect" hit me wif force. it's not as if this was the first time i heard tt the world is imperfect but rather the first time when i realise tt the truth hurts. it hurts so much tt i was shocked, terrified n i did not noe wat to do...  y r we often feel helpless when we see our frenz in need? y r we always running away from reality? y r we not facing our problems? y is it harder to practice wat is said?  God only help those who help himself...  i noe tt n i should help myself. i will be strong to my faith n try not to be very in tacked to my frenz moods. i will learn from each mistake i make n stand strong to prove tt my life is worth living for... i promise myself this tt i'll try...    but will u?      ~In Life, it doesn't matter who you are, but whether someone appreciates you for what you are, accepts you and loves you unconditionally. A Real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks away.~    ::Obstacles can't stop you. Problems can't stop you. Most of all other people can't stop you. Only you can stop you... let us not be a burden to ourselves n always be persistant...::   p/s: i want to take this chance to encourage n apologize to someone who has a very special place in my heart. i m sori tt i can't do anything to help n sometimes i juz make a mess out of it. really veri sori. plz stay strong n have faith. everything will soon be over n there'll always be sun after a storm. ^_^ even though i have sad moments too, but i try my best to overcome it. so muz u!

      Today was a fulfilling sunday i have ever had. Helped out in church in the afternoon n went ouf wif evan, gary n wm. haha.. really enjoyed myself n think tt all my frenz r so nice. haha... we walked from suntec city to bugis junction, then to bugis street to nibble on some pancakes n finally went to ps to have a drink (wm, thanks for the drink as well as the brownie). haha... u may think tt it's crazy as we did almost nothing except hanging out, but i feel tt today was fun. (oh yah, sad for dayima as the forms for singapore idol were all gone. dun be sad, u can it register online.. hehe)^_^ everyone was happy (even though evan was complaining abt how wm cheated her feeling), which made my mood both as gd as theirs. haha... i hope kq is not angry wif me for lending my hp to wm to sms(irriate)him. I think he's so innocent and yet he was been dragged into the picture for no reasons. haha... Johnathon n his gang r having a great time in cine (i noe, dun need to tell me lah) haha... so i believe tt they also had a great time. *yawn* tired...   My frenz r all so great. haha.. without them, i really will rot without even me myself noeing it. haha. Kudos to evan for accompanying me out. Without her, i would be as bright as usual when i hang out wif dayima n wm. haha... without dayima, i will be very bored as he would not flood me with lame jokes... without wm, my life would not be so exciting. haha... thanks guys. n not forgetting johnathon, keith n jasmine who bugged me contiunously over the phone. lol. jking.   tml is a new day for me, like wat ms said, we should start working hard for our prelims so tt we wouldn't regret too much. haha... thanks to ms for triggling my thoughts. thanks cg for sending me wonderful msgs to cheer up my day. thanks to mad for asking me out to shop n distress. thanks to dori who always makes me laugh. thanks to qt who continuously encourage us. thanks to mavis who is always there for me to bully. thanks to all my frenz out there who always make my day so wonderful n meaningful. haha... really luv u guys... haha.. (sori i crap again. but can't stop thanking u guys as u gave me the strength to be strong. :D)  haha... okok.. enough crap i think. now going to help someone to do his blog liao. lol. take care everyone n nitez. ^_^ hehe...   ~Wind is to fire as distance is to luv; it extinguishes the small n enflames the great...~    ::oh yah, the leaf story, i think i would start writing once i get some fantastic ideas.. hehe..::

       "There is a place I want to go to, but I don't know where. There is someone I want to meet, but i don't know who..."  Hers was a love, nurtured to fullness, in search of a lover. She had to fall in love with love, before she could fall in love with a person.    29th February, will u be there?   This is a story abt a gal who truly believes that her Mr right will appear 1 day, n she's willing to wait for the right one even if it's years of waiting... One day when she was walking on Orchard Rd, she was totally charmed by Jeremy, who was sitting in a cafe, knowing that he's her dream man. Least did she expect tt he would also be the one who was going to hurt her deeply. She made her move in a most creative, imaginative and brilliant way any gal could ever think of. Enthralled by the idea, Jeremy agreed to meet her. It's fate which brought them together n it's also fate which caused the misunderstandings.   I like this novel, it's totally different from the other love stories i had read. This bk is amazing, writing abt the magic of luv n destiny. N it also showed how vulnerable luv is when 2 ppl r from 2 different places meeting at a magical place... haha.. so i really hope u guys can check this bk out. written by catherine lim. :D  Wif lodsa luv, ShIyUaN

      haiz... didn't have the time to fix my blog, i m trying very hard to find a new skin but i still like this skin best. Even when i saw something interesting, i still couldn't use it... i was afraid tt when i let go of my skin, it may never come back... N i will miss it a lot. (put a lot of effort in changing the script n adding stuffs.) I like the background colour, how it matches my blog, how presentable it looks n how romantic the colour is. It's such a nice combination tt i really would wish it would be alright a few days later. The thing which i m more afraid isn't changing a new skin, but rather after changing a new skin. What if the website hosting the pictures r back again? What if i missed the chance of having a nice blog skin again? What if.... There r just too many "what if"s, n i don't really wish to take the chance... maybe it's the one for me? haha.  I m quite proud of myself for fixing wm n ms's new blog. haha... but i really hope tt they do like it n do treasure it. I don't really want me to thank me but i would rather prefer them to remember me when they see the blogskin. ^_^ bhb hor. haha.  It has been quite a long time posting a new entry. Coz really veri busy wif my schedules (going out) n school stuffs (talking crap wif my frenz) haha... we juz got back our mid year results, I didn't do very well. But i noe the reason to my downfall--lazy to study n slacking as usual during the exam period. haha... I passed all my subjects but didn't really score well, not even for my sciences. Almost failed my chinese (a very terrible thing if my mum finds out. she will slaughter me. hehe.) n juz barely make it for my a maths. haha...   Well, i really hope tt all of us don't take the results so seriously. It's just a exam, n for those who didn't do very well, plz don't give up ^_^. It's not over yet, i believe tt if u really work hard n really do study, u will score for ur prelims n ur "o". ^_^ everyone will face failures n unhappiness, if we manage to learn from our downfalls n learn to accept the fact, i think tt we will soon be able to put our best leg forward. *wink*  Had a few wield dreams recently, the first one was leaving st john during a parade to meet py, dayima n wm at tiong bahru plaza. the worst thing was tt i told Yvonne tt i would nv be irresponsible n leave during parade. N yet i stupidly walked out of the sch gate n ran all the way to tiong bahru just to meet them to shop. haha... Next was abt desmond, i dreamt tt he was a korean-chinese mix (it's jus my dream, so plz dun puke. jking). haha... he called his mum to tell her his results n was babbling in korean. i was stunned by his action n suddenly he looked like bae yong jun (tt korean actor, not sure if this is the correct spelling, sori)... *giggling* my dreamz r juz so interesting.   wm juz called to ask dayima n me to go watch movie wif him. or was dayima the one who wanted it? haha... how come wm suddenly so free to go out wif us to watch movie, thought he's always occupied wif his own things. haha.. jking.  haha... think crapped enough for today, later still need to go tuition at orchard. (a veri stupid idea isn't it? travel all the way to orchard juz for lessons + didn't recieve any useful informations when i was there)    ~Those who love deeply never grow old; they may die of old age, but they die young...~    ::In the arithmetic of love, 1+1=everything, n 2-1=nothing... haha.. interesting rite? wat do u guys think?::

      I know it's been sometime But there is something on my mind You see i haven't been the same Since that cold November day We said we needed space But all we found was an empty place And the only things i've learned Is that i need you desperately So here i am, and can you please tell me....  Where do broken hearts go Can they find their way home Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there And if somebody loves you Won't they always love you I look in your eyes And i know that you still care for me  I've been around enough to know That dreams don't turn to gold And that there is no easy way No you just can't run away And what we had was so much more Than we ever had before And no matter how i try I can't get you of my mind So here i am, and can you please tell me  Where do broken hearts go Can they find their way home Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there And if somebody loves you Won't they always love you I look in your eyes And i know that you still care for me  Now that i am here with you I'll never let you go I look into your eyes And now i know Now i know   ::A very nice song sang by whitney houston, haha.. all thanks to my dayima for helping me to dl tt song.

      TOday is the worst day among all the other examination days. Not tt the day is bad (ok the day's bad, hot n humid n stuffy, n no fan... wat else can i expect? *roll eyes* haha...), but the torments i have gone thru... Think abt suffering twice in the same day... Chem n E maths paper... like wat my frenz were saying, "study = CMI, might as well dun study..." So true it is... I mugged for chemistry yesterday nite till 12... n i think i did not do a gd job today... feeling so sori for mrs siew, thinking that she needs to mark so many scripts n see so many wield answers (iodine chloride is one gd answer)... haha... ms lau too, i think she has very high expectations on us (high expectation meaning tt muz pass the paper)... so guys, don't feel sad ok? muz think tt the teachers will have a harder time... so we should be glad tt we r not piled up wif junks... keke...(or u guys already numbed?) haha... we still got a maths n chem n physics paper 1 to go. so muz work hard hard for it ^_^V.  After the exam, i went out with qt, dori, ms n some of dori's frenz to ginza to distress.... actually to fill our stomachs. haha.. reminded me of wat dayima had said yesterday, "ning ke dui bu qi mdm poon, ye bu ke yi dui bu qi du zi..." *giggling* he forsake studying geo for his precious recess... keke... ture enough... on the way there saw wm, didn't say hi to him again... duno y... haha... think he also wun reply if i said hi... somehow i feel invisible sometimes when i m simply in front of him. lol.  *burb* i m so full now... after eating sour n spicy noodles at famosa.. haha... thanks to the gals, i had a wonderful lunch.. ^_^ (not like someone who promised to cook for me but didn't, coz tt person is too busy preparing for a maths tml... promised) nvm nvm... i forgive u... haha...  think my blog is getting more n more crapy n lotsa language mistakes.. haha... but m too lazy to correct them.. keke... maybe writing casually can make me feel more at home? haha... crap... maybe will write something which is more constructive n more innovative bah.. haha.. man, do i luv blogging.. *grinning from ear to ear*  i m thinking of: py n toilet... not tt they r related... but really need the toilet. As for py... really miss talking to her... tried to say bye to her yesterday when i got onto the bus, but she seemed alittle bit surprised... *sigh* still not getting any better... y? (maybe i m the one who should n muz answer this...)   anyway, will stop bloggin rite now n pay my respect to my darling toilet... haha... so everyone plz take care. ^_^   ~A penny will hide the biggest star in the Universe if you hold it close enough to your eye...~    ::Change a point of view n u can soon see another prespective from a different angle... things r not as bad as u think it is *wink* God bless..::

      Tired. Didn't get enough slp nowadays, not very sure y. I think maybe it's becoz of the weather. haha... my mum thinks that it's exam stress, coz i m always sick during the exam period. keke. today was english paper n a maths paper. I think it was easier than past year papers, but found out tt i m quite careless when doing my a maths paper... T_T even for the english paper, i thought that the summary was 130 words. yah... so i actually wrote 120 plus words n only at the last few minutes did i realise that it was suppose to be 160 words!! I actually pity the teachers. I think they are going to have a hard time marking my paper with all the ^arrows^ here n there. haha...  The hall is still as hot n stuff as usual, the extra fans the sch brought in didn't help much. haha. maybe i will bring my own fan the next time... but the gd news is that mr foo promised us to get large industrial fans for our end of year exam... though it isn't air con, but we should be contented lahz.. haha...  Dayima having infatuation nowadays... haha... maybe he found his true luv... keke... he's been thinking of tt person every minute n second... haha... dayima muz take gd gd care horz... haha... n yah.. u r cute every second n every minute... so STOP ASKING US!! haha...   well, everyone take care.. haha... i m thinking of: JY... wanted to say hi n talk to her today, but couldn't find her in the stuffy hall...    ~Our life is just like travelling with minds as the tour guide, without the tour guide, all will stop, the aim will be lost and strength will disappear...~    ::Hope keeps the heart from breaking...::

      A story to share with u:  Tree  ===  The reason I'm called tree is because I'm good at painting trees.  Overtime I start to use a tree on the right hand corner as a trademark for all my watercolors painting. I have dated 5 gals when I was in Pre-U. There's one gal who I love a lot but never dare go after her. She doesn't have a pretty face, doesn't have a good figure, doesn't have outstanding charm. She is just a very ordinary gal.    I like her. I really like her. Like her innocent, like her frankness. Like her cuteness, like her intelligence and her fragility. Reason for not going after her is because I felt somebody so ordinary like her is not a good match for me. I'm also afraid that after we are together all the good feelings will vanish. I'm also afraid other's gossips will hurt her. I felt that if she's my gal, she will be mine ultimately & I don't have to give up everything just for her. The last reason, made her accompany me for 3 years. She watch me chase after gals, and I have make her heart cry for 3 years.   She wants to be a good actress and I'm a very demanding director. When I kissed my 2nd girlfriend, she bumped into us. She was embarrassed but smile & say "Go on!" before running off. The next day, her eyes was swollen like a walnut. I purposely didn't want to think about what causes her to cry but laugh at her the whole day. When everybody go back home, she was alone crying in the classroom. She didn't know that I returned from soccer training to get something. I watch her cry for an hour or so.    My 4th girlfriend didn't like her. There was once when both of them quarreled. I know that based on her character she's not the type that will start off the quarrel. But I still sided with my girlfriend. I shouted at her and her eyes was filled shocked. I didn't care about her feelings and walked off with my girlfriend.   The next day, she still laugh & joke with me like nothing has ever happened. I know that she's very hurt but she didn't know that my heart ache is as bad as hers.   When I broke up with my 5th girlfriend, I asked her out. After going out for a day, I told her that I have something to tell her. She told me that coincidentally, she has something to tell me too. I told her about my break up and she told me about her getting together. I know whose the guy. He has been going after her for quite a while. A very cute guy full of energy, lively and interesting. His pursuit for her has been the talk of the school.   I can't show her my heart ache but could only smile & congratulate her. When I reach home, the heart ache is so strong that I can't stand it. It's like a heavy weighted stone on my chest. I couldn't breath. Wanted to shout but can't. Tears rolled down & I broke down & cry. How many times have I seen her cry for the man that doesn't acknowledge her presence too.   During graduation, I read a sms in my hp. It was send 10 days ago when I broke down and cry. I haven't read it since then.   It says "Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay"    Leaf  ===  During Pre-U days, I like to collect leaves. Why? Because I felt that for a leaf to leave the tree she has been relying on for so long it takes a lot of courage. During the 3 years of Pre-U I was on very close terms with a guy. Not BGR kind but as buddy kind. But when he had his 1st girlfriend, I learnt a feeling I never should have learnt - Jealousy. The sourness in the heart can't be describe by using a lemon. It's like 100 rotten sour lemon. Sourness to the extreme limit. They were only together for 2 mths. When they broke up, I hide my strong sense of happiness. But after a mth, he got together with another gal.    I like him & I know he like me. But why won't he pursue me? Since he love me why he doesn't want to make the first move? Whenever he had a new girlfriend, my heart would hurt. Time after time, my heart was hurt. I begin to suspect that this is a one sided love. If he don't like he, why does he treat me so well. It's beyond what you will normally do for a friend. Liking a person is very heart wrenching. I can know his likes, his habits. But his feelings towards me I can never figure out. You can't expect me a gal to ask him right?    Despite that, I still want to be by his side. Care for him, accompany him, love him. Hoping that one fine day, he will come & love me. It's like waiting for his phone call every night, wanting him to send me sms. I know that no matter how busy he is, he will make time for me. Because of this, I waited for him. The 3 years were the hardest to go through & I really want to give up. Sometimes, I wonder should I continue waiting. The pain and hurt, the dilemma accompany me for 3 years.   Till the end of my 3rd year, a 2nd year junior begins to go after me. Everyday he pursuit me relentlessly. From outright rejection to a point in time when I felt that I'm willing to let him have a small footing in my heart. He's like a warm & gentle wind, trying to blow a leaf away from the tree. In the end, I realized that I didn't want to give this wind a small footing in my heart. I know this wind will bring this badly battered leave far away & better land. Finally I left tree, but the tree only smile & didn't ask me to stay.   Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay.    Wind  ====  Because I like a gal called leaf. Because she's so dependent on tree so I have to be a gust wind. A wind that will blow her away. When I first met her, it was 1 mth after I transfer to the new school. I saw a petite person looking at my seniors & me playing soccer. During ECA time, she will always be sitting there. Be it alone or with her friends looking at him. When he talks with gals there's jealousy in her eyes. When he looked at her, there's a smile in her eyes. Looking at her became my habit. Just like she likes to look at him.    One day, she didn't appear. I felt something amissed. I can't explain the feeling except it's a kind of uneasiness. The senior was also not there as well. I went to their classroom, hid outside and saw my senior scolding her. Tears were in her eyes while he left. The next day, I saw her at her usual place, looking at him. I walked over and smiled to her. Took out a note & gave to her. She was surprised. She looked at me, smiled & accept the note. The next day, she appeared & pass me a note and left.   "Leaf's heart is too heavy and wind couldn't blow her away..."      "It's not that leaf heart is too heavy. It because leaf never want to  leave tree..."   I replied her note with this statement and slowly she started to talk to me & accept my presents & phone calls. I know that the person she loves is not me. But I have this perseverance that one day I will make her like me. Within 4 mths, I have declared my love for her no less than 20 times. Every time, she will divert away from the topic. But I never give up. If I decide I want her to be mine, I will definitely use all means to win her over. I can't remember how many times I have declared my love to her. Although I know she will try to divert but I still bear a small ray of hope. Hoping that she will agree to me my girlfriend. I didn't hear any reply from her over the phone. I asked "what are you doing? How come you didn't want to reply?" She said, "I'm nodding my head". "Ah?" I couldn't believe my ears. "I'm nodding my head" She replied loudly. I hang up the phone, quickly changed and took a taxi and rush to her place & press her door bell. During the moment when she opens the door. I hugged her tightly.   Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay   ::So what's the moral of the story? Is it telling us that we should always do what we wanted to do instead of waiting for the chance to miss u? or is it that if leaf is more brave, she may have the chance to stay with who she loves the most? or is it telling us to let go of things which don't belong to us?::     "Leaf's departure is bc of wind's pursuit n becoz tree didn't ask her to stay..."

      Its the feeling of warmth that bubbles inside The way we play around outside The way you move the hair from my eyes The carefree way we live our lives  It's the tone of your voice, the colour of your skin The way you trust your voice within The way you make me feel at ease When you give me your coat at the slightest breeze  It's all around, in your soul, in the sky Within the birds that fly so high Its in the rivers flowing free But most of all its you and me   ~你可以选择爱我或不爱我，但我只可以选择爱你或更爱你...~

      This was sheer bad luck. I juz couldn't believe what i m going thru. it all started from tuesday which i didn't went to school becoz of some stupid diarrhea... again... it happend becoz i stupidly ate ice cream at 3am in the morning when i was doing the 4 extra compos i m suppose to give ms junaidah. (ok, so e bad luck started on monday. coz i forgot to bring my whole file to sch. ms junaidah had pms :X so she asked those who didn't bring or do the compo to do 4 more... n hand it up to her the next day) okok.. let me continue my pitiful plight... so at ard 5 plus i started to have terrible stomache n i paid my respect to my darling toliet so frequently tt i had no choice but to "camp" there. T_T *sobs* at ard 7 plus the pain had somehow subsided thus i went to see the doctor who gave me some medicine which looked as  harmless  as the ice cream i ate. how wrong i was!!! the "syrup" he gave me was very sweet. i almost lost my sense of taste as it masked all my taste buds... *yuck*   although it was extremely sweet, it was effective. or was it tt i had no input for the output? haha... anyway i felt much better n slpt all my way til ard 4 plus. haha. *contented* then wm called to ask me out to go out wif them to shop for dayima's new sch bag coz some pamala anderson tugged too hard at his bag. hehe. *cheeky smile* gd thing tt i was not "lured" out from my cosy room coz i heard the gang hanged out til 8 plus n after van van reached hm n took a bath, the electricity supply went off. *giggle* being such a nice fren, she called me to check me out, thinking tt calling me to crap was something constructive. many ppl called n smsed me to complain to me abt the blackout too. hehe. (talking to me is always constructive ok... ^_^V) haha. chatted wif van van until 11.30 then she had no choice but to put down the phone to pack her bag. haha. she confirme missed me one. :P (oops... can see ppl gathering tools to throw at me liaoz... =P)   after putting down the phone, i went to do my a maths tys which was due on wed. (yes today...) gd thing tt i had the gd companny of my clay aiken n my fren lw (smsed me thruout the nite also a nocturnal animal...). if not i think i would be bore to death doing a maths the whole nite/morning? haha... thanks a lot lw. hehe. ^_^   as i finally finished my wk at 5 plus, i went on to the computer to put all my compos into a diskette. (my printer didn't work) then little did i realise tt i actually missed out my functional writing. *faint* suddenly, the lightning flashed n everything went black. MY HOUSE WAS PITCH DARK!! with no electricity n i have not iron my sch u yet. *faint again* tsktsk... went to check out e curcuit box n tried to fix teh problem back... haha. glad tt i put mr pandian's teaching into gd use. haha. n the batteries i bought in kuantan also seemed important. my giant torch had prevented me from groping in darkness as where as using hp backlight...  i tot this would be the end of my disaster... how wrong i was.... it was the begining... knocked my head onto the taxi door when i came out from it... T_T *shake head* the first thing i got to noe which scared the s**t out of me when i reached classroom was tt my time table was not the same as my frenz... (or should i say i looked at the old time table instead) *Depressed* so i noe tt i don't have english n chem!!! n I HAVE PHYSICS!!!   Good news: i don't have to hand up my chem ws today. Bad news: i don't have anything which is assosciated to my physics lesson. Good news: i have printed the physics notes for xiu xiu. Bad news: her lesson is straight after mine. i went to almost all the classes to borrow for a textbk n finally xiao huan has one wrapped nicely in a beautiful wrapping paper. i was delighted. happily, i tool the textbk n went back to my class feeling lethargic though.(oh ya. on the way back i sprained my ankle. luckily it was not serious) soon after my geo lesson, it was pandian's lesson. i was ready for the physics class (even though i don't have physics notes coz i passed them to xx). non of us expected this. not even me. i took out "my" physics tbk n started flipping thru it for lesson. n WAT DID I FOUND OUT!!! it was a chem tbk!!! xh hand accidentally mistook physics for chem thus she gave me the wrong bk. *feeling weaker than ever* thus i automatically got up from my seat n stood at the back of the class for 2 whole periods. a poor pathetic gal without a nite of slp was standing there weakly n having some stupid stomach cramps... ls was the only thing on my mind... haha... gd thing tt mr pandian was in a good mood today n thus didn't leave me with any sour remarks. haha. :P  next was chinese lesson. mdm wong's voice sounded like a lullaby... so mesmerised by the tune tt i had to pinch myself to stay awake. *yawn* it was something which i hated. to be feeling sleepy n u noe the fact tt u can't slp. T_T   recess was alrite but was turned off by the fact tt the new store vendor (or the new store which was opend for a few days be4 it was closed due to food posioning cases) used her hands to take pizzas into bags (sometimes spaghetti which had came out from the plate) n collected money at the same time. (now i noe wat caused the food poisoning :P) but it definitely smells gd. haha. i was quite guilty by the fact tt i didn't help xx to buy something for her recess. i was really very tired n her class was way far away from mine. (n was quite sad at tt time coz she asked me for her physics ws instead of thanking me. but after a while i think it's my fault. should have told her tt my printer wasn't working well...*apologetic*) sori xiu... i shouldn't do such things n rejected u when u wanted my to help u buy some food. really sori....   after recess i had 3 period of maths... hey! i managed to pull thru but didn't really understand wat ms lau was teaching. later maybe go look thru again. haha :P after 2 periods, ms lau went for flashcard n thus got the chance to rest again! *yippie* ^_^ our assembly was cancelled thus i had actually 1 hr to slp!! i was so tired tt even my desk looked inviting. haha. soon was in my dreamland. i tot i was in cloud nine when something hit me hard on my head. stupid... -.-"' the guys who played soccer in the class had "accidentally" kicked the ball n it "conveniently" hit my head. *ouch...* nvm nvm... i still managed to fall aslp after tt incident. haha. this really showed how tired i was.   haha.. today was pretty suai. hope the rest of my day would be alrite. :D haha. through this, i really appreciated my boring n hectic life in sch. sometimes even though i grumble on being bored, little did i realise tt my life was gd. at least nothing bad had befall on me. at least i m safe n sound. at least i m luved by all my frenz. ^__^ haha.... i felt happy after going thru this. (though reluctant n we can't change the past... thus i learnt to accept it n appreciate it! ^_^) Thank GOd for giving me this chance to appreciate my life. haha. n thanks to all my gfs in my class who were very caring today when the ball hit my head. they were all so nice. thanks ms, thanks qt, thanks dori, thanks yt, thanks von von, thanks van van, thanks mavis, thanks yihan, thanks cat, thanks cg, thanks daughter mad, thanks velvery, thanks 6677... thanks n thanks... ^_^ thanks to lw who taught me so many things... thanks to daddy david who gave me lots of advice... really duno how to thank liaoz. haha... i really treasure these frenships n hope we can always stay in touch! ^_____^   ~A friend is a gift, whose worth cannot be measured except by heart...~    ::The most cherished thing in life is friendship. The most precious thing between us is understanding... thanks friends. thanks for understanding me n fill my everyday wif laughter....God Bless^_^::   p/s: oh ya.. 1 more thing. low on cash now, parents not back yet. i killed my piggy yesterday...

      waoh... meisi is so wonderful.. she sent us a few very nice emails... n i was really touched by wat they had written.. really want to thank her... so i m sharing these wif u guys n hope u really treasure these things. very meaningful. haha. thanks a lot ms. ^_^   Did you know ???  Did you know that when you envy someone, it's because you really like that person?   Did you know that those who appear to be very strong in heart, are real weaklings and most succeptible?   Did you know that those who spend their time protecting others are the ones that really need some one to protect them?  Did you know that the three most difficult things to say are : I love you,Sorry and help me The people who say these are those that actually need them or really feel them, and they are the ones you really need to treasure, because they have said them.   Did you know that people who occupy themselves by keeping others company or helping others are the ones that actually need your company and help?    Did you know that those who dress in red are more confident in themselves?   Did you know that those who dress in yellow are those that enjoy thier beauty?  Did you know that those who dress in black, are those who want to be unnoticed and need your help and understanding?   Did you know that when you help someone, the help is returned in two folds?  Did you know that those who need more of you are those that did not mention it to you?   Did you know that it's easier to say what you feel in writting than saying it to someone in the face?But did you know that it has more value when you say it in the face?  Did you know that what is most difficult for you to say or do is much more valuable than anything that is valuable that you can buy with money?  Did you know that if y ou ask for something in faith, your wishes are granted?   Did you know that you can make your dreams come true, like falling in love, becoming rich, staying healthy, if you ask for it by faith, and if you really knew, you'd be surprised by what you could do.    But don't believe everything I tell you, until you try it for yourself , if you know someone that is in need of something that I mentioned of,and you know that you can help,you'll see that it will be returned in two folds.  DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON ME???... AT THE MOMENT, TIME AND PLACE THAT YOU NEED ME, CALL ME, I WILL BE THERE WITH YOU !!!!!  "One day, we mad people will change the world...or we are already changing it " THE BALL IS NOW IN YOUR COURT... If the world were to end in 24 hours,all the phone lines, chat rooms and email will be saturated from people sending messages to others, saying: "I regret having made you feel bad", "Pardon me", "I love you", "I hold you in high esteem", take good care of yourself" and sometimes  "I have always loved you, only I never told you".    dear frenz. i apologize tt i couldn't forward this mail to u coz my 2pid hotmail isn't functioning well. but really would like to thank all of u guys... haha. really luv ya. thanks for bringing me joy n sharing my pain. thanks for teaching me lotsa stuffs abt life n thanks for taking a stroll wif me on my journey in life. haha. really thanks a lot... luv u guys. *muack*  got to slp le.. very tired... *look at the clock n gasped* it's 2.30 in e morning n i m still printing mr pandian's ws.

      海的思念绵延不绝 终于和天 在地平线交会 爱如果走得够远 应该也会跟幸福相见 承诺常常很像蝴蝶 美丽的飞 盘旋然后不见 但我相信你给我的誓言 就像一定会来的春天  我始终带着你爱的微笑 一路上寻找我遗失的美好 不小心当泪滑过嘴角 就用你握过的手抹掉 再多的风景也从不停靠 只一心寻找我遗失的美好 有的人说不清哪里好 但就是谁都替代不了 在最开始的那一秒 有些事早已经注定要到老 虽然命运爱开玩笑 真心会和真心遇到

To be happy, it starts with a smile!! ^__^ no matter how miserable u feel, smile anyway. Think abt the positive things in your life n smile abt them. then we can make a conscious effort to listen to the words that come out of our mouth, thru editing them when we r unhappy. hehe. when we hear complaints coming out from our mouths, we should stop talking. i believe tt happy is the most important thing in our human life. stay happy n smile always!! ^_^     ~I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances... Philippians 4:11~    ::True contentment is a thing as active as agriculture. It is the power of getting out of any situation all that there is in it. hehe. interesting sentence huh? take care when i'm gone guys.::

      u guys still remember the leaf story? (refer to my post in may) i think i'm going to continue the story. not sure if u guys like the ending, sori for the bad ending if u guys don't like it.. haha... showing off my broken english again... *shy*   Leaf's departure is of wind's pursuit n bcoz tree didn't ask her to stay...   wind gave her care, concern, love n everything she wanted. Wind loved Leaf. if leaf wanted the moon, Wind would be sure to make a trip into the sky without hesitation. He knew tt deep in his heart, leaf's like his oxygen. Leaf's like his sunshine. If one day, one fine day, Leaf's going to leave him, he'll collapse. He'll lose the power to survive.   to wind, even though he knew tt he wasn't the one whom leaf loved the most, he's contented wif wat he has. at least he managed to have her by his side. at least he could take care of her n promise tt no one's ever going to hurt her. he thought tt she's always going to be by his side. rite?   wrong.  Wind soon began to realise tt wat leaf had done was not out of love. she didn't really love him. she took him as if he's a spare tyre. she took him as a substitution to the tree... (to be continued)

      til now did i realise tt this beautiful song was sang by christina aguilera. her voice's powerful n filled wif hope. haha. kept on humming this song til my frenz got irritated liaoz. :P u guys should really go n hear this song. really veri wonderful n the lyrics is worth reading... ^_^   Young girl, don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall Young girl, it's all right Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly  When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream  Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems No one ever wants or bothers to explain Of the heartache life can bring and what it means  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Young girl, don't hide You'll never change if you just run away Young girl, just hold tight And soon you're gonna see your brighter day  Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid No one reaches out a hand for you to hold When you're lost outside look inside to your soul  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Yeah... Life is a journey  It can take you anywhere you choose to go As long as you're learning You'll find all you'll ever need to know  You'll make it You'll make it Just don't go forsaking yourself No one can stop you You know that I'm talking to you  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within  Young girl don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall

      Oooo hooo... haha... long time didn't blog leh. or i mean write a proper nice blog. haha. n when i read wat i wrote on my blog (recent posts) i feel tt i have been writing too much negative things leh. haha. n i think it's not veri nice to let my frenz read those things. hehe. so decide to write something more thought provoking today.   i think tt the most important thing in our life is to be contented wif wat we have n how we treasures wat we have. instead of trying to grumble of wat's missing in our life, we should be contented wif wat each day will bring for us. juz think, now u r able to sit in front of a computer, going online, reading my blog, shouldn't u be happy abt it? at least u have a computer which can surf net at the same time. think my kind frenz, wat if one day u can't go online? wat if one day u r not able to even afford a computer? will u feel sad then?   u shouldn't!!  at least u have a pair of hands to do wat u like to do, at least u have a pair of legs to bring u to where u want to go. n at least u got lots of frenz ard u, caring for u. tt's wat life's all abt. if u keep thinking abt wat u want n be sad for wat u couldn't have, u will be forever trapped ur own world, thinking of wat u can do wif wat u DOn't have. even though it's true tt in life we should achieve something, at least we shouldn't grumble wif wat we already have. when u only have 10 cent, u should feel contented. coz there r many ppl who can't even have a cent in their pockets. being able to read this blog further more proves tt we r actually being filled wif things. not those neccessary items, but rather other things which we want n can live without it.  haha.. sori guys, think i m crapping again. it's juz my opinion lah. maybe u may say tt it's easier to say than done, but i hope tt we should at least be contentd wif the frenz we have. i believe tt God gives us frenz n family for a reason. it's for us to be contented. greedy should not stand in our way... hehe... so cheeros guys n take care. God bless...   ~There can be miracles when u believe, though hope is frail, it's hard to kill... who knows wat miricales u can achieve... when u believe, some how u will... u will when u believe~

      went out to attend ms junaidah's wedding hoping tt i can somehow not think of anything stupid. staying at home, staring at those inanimated things would juz make me tear.   it truely was a correct decision i made. i really enjoyed the day. first all thanks to my frenz who cheered me up n gave me another day of happiness. ^_^ haha. van van n i met at bukit batok mrt control station at 11.15 then started to wait for our classmates. the gd thing was tt we told everyone to meet at 11.30, which is half an hour earlier than the actually wedding ceremony, in case some peeps r late. as usual, our dear k n k were late. very late in fact. we called them n told them to meet at ms junaidah's wedding as they told us tt they were not out yet at ard 11.45. haha.. n wif little surprise, mad was still on her bed at 12. looking at us sheepishly n gave us a sweet grin which will always melt our heart. haha. (ALERT: ppl goin to kwantan wif her, remember to wake her an hour be4 the assembling time! :P jking)haha... my frenz always make me smile wifout fail. haha. ms junaidah's wedding was interesting as this was the first time tt i had atteneded a malay wedding. she was sitting on a beautifully decorated chair, dressed in a dark blue baju kurong with flowers skillfully sewn onto it. (sori guys, too tired to think of adjectives to describe.. hehe.. so juz bear wif my horrible english). the ceremony was great too, witnessing the bridegroom fishing out a few cheques be4 the bride's maid actually let him to see her face. i still can't forget his smile when he finally got to see her enchanting face. he's smile was filled wif contentment, happiness, assurance n many more expressions which showed a promising marriage. haha.. feel so happy for them. ^_^   after the delicious meal, van van, qh, desmond n i went to orchard 2gether to see wat's street festival all abt. it was pretty interesting as we seldom see ppl dressing in manga characters (mostly from jap comics). haha... it feels as if i was in japan. hehe... we ate long john at cine n took some quite neoprints. haha. qh n desmond always have their own interesting way of posing in front of the camera while evan n i showed our artistic flare on the neoprint by decorating it. hehe... really enjoyed myself today, all thanks to u guys. gosh.. so tired... talking incoherently... better stop writing... God bless everyone...   ~We have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth wihtout creating it...~    ::if u can dream, do not make dream ur master. if u can think, do not make ur thoughts ur aim...(couldn't think of any inspiring quotes nowadays, sori abt it)::

        There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn not to judge things too quickly. So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away. The first son went in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in the fall.    When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe what they had seen. The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and twisted. The second son said no--it was covered with green buds and full of promise. The third son disagreed, he said it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful, it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen. The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfillment.    The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but ONLY one season in the tree's life. He told them that  you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence of who they are--and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life--can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.      If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer, fulfillment of your fall. Don't let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest. Don't judge life by one difficult season. Persevere through the difficult patches and better times are sure to come some time or later.

      Chorus: Have you ever loved somebody so much It makes you cry Have you ever needed something so bad You can't sleep at night Have you ever tried to find the words But they don't come out right Have you ever, have you ever  Have you ever been in love Been in love so bad You'd do anything to make them understand Have you ever had someone steal your heart away You'd give anything to make them feel the same Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart But you don't know what to say And you don't know where to start  Chorus: Have you ever loved somebody so much It makes you cry Have you ever needed something so bad You can't sleep at night Have you ever tried to find the words But they don't come out right Have you ever, have you ever  Have you ever found the one You've dreamed of all your life You don't do anything to look into their eyes Have you finally found the one you've givin your heart to Only to find that one won't give their heart to you Have you ever closed your eyes and Dreamed that they were there And all you can do is wait for that day when they will care  What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby What do I gotta do to get to your heart To make you understand how I need you next to me Gotta get you in my world 'Coz baby I can't sleep

      There r times where i m so enthuisastic on typing blogs n sometimes when i juz wish all the things which had happened to me on tt day could be juz printed on it. hehe. juz plain lazy. n sometimes really need to use quite a lot of brain juice chosing wat to write n wat to eliminate out from my blog.   oh yah.. be4 i forget... ;);););)(*););););) ;);););)(*););););) ;););)(^)(^)(^);););) ;););)(^)(^)(^);););) ;);)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^););) ;);)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^););) ;)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^);) ;)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^);) ;)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^);) (G)(G)(G)(G)(G)(G)(G)(G)(G)  happy bday gary!!! my gd gd nice nice dayima.. haha.. it's his 16th bday! hope he has a wonderful day n have a interesting life ahead ^_^ i remember the first time when i noe him was thru py. due to some financial crisis, i decided to share py's bday present wif him. it was on 15 january 2002. i got his phone no. from jy as she is in npcc too. haha... the gary i first met was not TT lame.. not TT violent... not TT yellow... haha... not saying tt he isn't nice any more, but he has mature n grown up a lot. haha.. it's really nice being his fren. when i needed help, he would always strentch out his "petite" hand to help. He's always there... forever my dayima. haha. he use to say tt he has a glass heart n is always easily broken, but now i can see tt he's stronger now... still remember he "carelessly" tore the first letter i wrote to him... n the first present, a keychain together a tiao zhan shu... :D haha.. so hope u luv the present i bought for u n MUZ not Give it to OTHER ppl ok?!!! haha... anyway, thanks a lot chun qing ke ai, yue guan chao ji mei shao nv. (happy wif tt name? if not later go add somemore)          today had english lesson in the morning n after tt went out wif wm, gary n wc. when i was at orchard be4 meeting them,i saw a lot of nhrians whom i noe n r gary's classmates. haha. such a coincidence. like wat frenz always do, we hang out n walked towards taka to meet rk n his fren. she kinda looks like michelle (yh's gal) hehe. kinda cute. i think yh will agree wif me totally rite. haha. going out wif them always need to ponder lotsa things. first, where to eat. this question is a tough one coz all of us had a hard time deciding. (mostly bc all of us r very easy going.. hehe...) so we somehow corked up a pathway in cineleisure, next to pastamania. needless to say, we went into pastamania. enjoyed our food n off we went in a hurry, as our dear wm needs to rush off to meet his fren. rushing-- due to some unforseen circumstances (coz he kinda forgot the time they r suppose to meet :X).  our gang was thus split into 3. wm n i taking the mrt towards the west-east line, gary, wc n rk walking towards ps to shop n eline (rk's fren) who took the train wif us but alighted at dg to change to nel.  later in the evening when i juz reached hm, my mum gave me a ring n asked me out for dinner. (sounds exciting rite? ya rite....) i simply can't gobble down the food as i was veri veri full after eating a large bowl of pasta. bloated should be a better word. haha... *bleah* my mum is veri nice to me... but sometimes we also get some misunderstandings... thanks mum, u r e best. luv u... *muach*   really enjoyed myself today, all thanks to my family n frenz. hehe... okok, giving my "thank you" speech again. thanks jasmine for making tt trip juz to pass me some notes n stuffs. but also want to tell tt 2pid guy (u noe who u r n everyone in the church does)...

       You're Element is Light. You are friendly, happy, social, bubbly, and can brighten up any one's day. You are very kind and a real people person because you have several friends (or atleast should).

      Tried out this test i found from ms's blog. hehe. thanks ms. ^_^ i think it's veri accurate. haha... at least for me lahz... n ms said tt it's also accurate. so it SHOULD be.. hehe... dun hit me if it's wrong... :D but the pic a not very decent. hehe...     LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS!

      叶子离开了大树才会枯萎 冰块离开了低温才会融化 星星离开了月亮才会寂寞 爱情离开了情人才会失落  失去你以后，花园里已没有幸福的气息 失去你以后，家里的电话也安静了许多 失去你以后，我过的日子变得黯淡无味 失去你以后，我们再也没有机会分享天空的灿烂  但是 我学会叶子坚强的性格 我学会冰块容忍的毅力 我学会星星独立的个性 我学会在失去前珍惜所有的一切  因为我知道 我失去的不是你 而是那颗爱我的心  haha... this is the poem mdm wong wants us to write after listening to ye zi. think tt song quite sad lohz... hear liao very depressed... so i took the chance to post it here for u all to appreciate lahz.. haha... ppl always be strong n hold on tight tight to ur faiths ^_^ haha... sori nowadays my poems all like the same kind... using the same formate. haa.. lazy to apply other things lahz. so juz read lozh... :P my blog mah. haa... take care.
