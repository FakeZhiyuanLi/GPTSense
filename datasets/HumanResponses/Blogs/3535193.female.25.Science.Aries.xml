      Happy Birthdays to all the June babies! (Gloria, Jackie, Sarah)    It made me realized how old I am getting.  We lived a quarter of a century, but I can't honestly tell you what I want to do.  I used to think I was going to get a PharmD and an MPH so I can work for the FDA.  Then I can use my public health background to strategically implement rules to improve healthcare delivery, more specifically in pharmaceuticals.  I figure FDA will eventually start a new arm, but they never did.  Now I am getting all these degrees, but I would have to try to improve the field through private industry.  I want to work for the Department of Health, but what would that do?  Here in Utah, they only have two pharmacists and I don't know what they do....  It is possible that I do a PhD in public health sicne I will be here for another 3 years, but would it be better if I get a MStat so I can do my own analysis better?  With all this, I feel like I am losing touch with pharmacy, then in the end, I may never accomplish what I want bc I already lost my primary focus.. pharmacy.  As you can see, I am a confused little girl.  I guess for nwo, I will try to finish my degree and see who would offer me a job.    In the end, I may end up doing drug information or retail.  Imagine, all these years of education down the drain.  What a waste.

      Interesting comment.. I have been working out a lot lately on DDR, tennis, and rollerblading just because the weather is so much nicer now.  As per sex or no sex.  Well, Clinton is coming out with his book regarding his relationship.  While it seems like the general public is sexing away, what about the rest of us?  Those of us that belives sex is sared.  Well, as I see it, sex is like popcorn.  Once you start having it, it's hard to stop even if it's not that great becasue you are addicted.  Kinda like the korn of the popcorn... you have to spit it out, but you still have it bc you are addicted.  I think that's just a waste to have sex with someone only bc your physical needs.  However, I do understand why some people would do it, if they are able not to get attached and cute enough to always find a replacement when one model is breaking down.  I don't think I fit in with either model so I would jsut suck it up and wait.    Then there is the other theory, what if you only do it with one person, but you will never know if there is anything better out there.  As for that, have you ever heard of people hating sex?  Also, there is probably a better one out there, just like everything else.  If everyone is perfect, then there will be a new level of perfection.  Also if they are perfect, why would they be with you if you are not perfect.  I am by no means perfect so I can accept the fact my partner isn't perfect, sorry dude.  Plus, if you think aobut it, there is always something better out there.  Take for example a TV... I am sure not everyone of you have a flat screen, and if you do have a flat screen, I am sure not all of you have a plasma.... and if you  have a plasma, there is a bigger one out there... and if you already have that then you should have a movie theater in your house and it goes on and on.   Don't get me wrong, I think sex is great, I just don't want the hassle now.  The whole dependence, pregnancy, etc.  I don't want my future baby to be an accident.  How would she feel later on in life?

      Obviously from reading my journal you know I am not the best at keeping up with things.  Well, my life is just a roller coaster.  I got reviews back for this article I co-authored on, but the reviews were conflicting. Then today, I got the proof for the poster I presented at AMCP and it was the exact reprint of the poster.  Now, my department thinks it would be double dipping if I publish at both places.  While I can see their concern, but I feel the paper I submitted was a methodology piece while the article about my poster is what we found in the study.  Anyhow, I am disappointed since I want publications.  Now I have to decide on one or the other.    I decided today to be not as depressed.  I think it's rediculous that I am sleeping so much when I can be much more productive doing something else.  (I have been sleeping on average 10 hours a day!  Sometimes I just lay in bed for no reason since I am wide awake)  There are many theories to why this may be......  we can blame on the atmosphere since Utah has the highest anti-depressant use, we can blame on birth control since there is like a minimal chance of being depressed, we can blame on my boring job since I don't have my data, we can blame on me losing interest too easily.... but I guess after blaming everything, what can I do?  I can't change them now.  So I figure I should just try to find more friends.  The question is where?    My first inclinition is going to a coffee shop.  People are always so quiet there and you can just start talking and see who respond.  I can go to a bookstore and pick up a controversial book.  People tend to like make a comment or two about it.  I can sit on the train all day until I find someone interesting.  Or I could just go to a park and start kicking people around, but that may get me beat up.  Any ideas?

      Well, today has been a very exciting day for me.  I found out last night that my article is actually in print for people to read and my thesis got IRB approval.  Then this morning I found out my abstract is accepted at the AMCP meeting in the fall. Granted I don't know what I want out of my career, at least whatever I am doing, people like it.  :)  The bad part is that I will have to actually do a poster now and that is usually a pain in the butt.   This weekend is my weekend away with my boy.  We have been overwhelmed with work for so long that I think it will do us a lot of good to do this.  I may have to put work in overdrive this weekend, but I guess it will be worth it.

      Well, the general consensus is that I am crazy.  Apparently there would be no one that would want a relationship far apart.  My roomie would never do it so he says.  At least not for that long.  Waahhhh... I guess I want both ways.  If I have Hermonie's time transport thing like in Harry Potter, then I would be all set.  I can do both, but it's only a fictional character.  Oh yeah, that movie is really good.  I highly recommended to anyone that reads this.

      Hi all,  This is a new thing I am trying.  Partly because I never keep in touch with you all, partly because I need advice. It's a fast way to get to everyone.  First, I want to say I had a blast in NJ.  It was great to see people I know, hang out, drink untempered alcoholic drinks, and more.    I don't resent the life I have in UT.  It is good, I have an overall entertaining job/school, a doting boyfriend, a cool roomie, a couple of friends/coworkers, and I am starting an Asian posse.  I get to ski in the winter as much as I want and rollerblade in the summer.  I must say it is the "simple" life I wanted when I first intended to move away from NJ.  Well, as you all pretty much know, I am pretty serious about my bf and I want to be with him and all that jazz. If we stay together I waould have to stay in SLC for another 3 years after I am done with my fellowship.  Three years is no small feat.  I guess for the first time in my life I cannot plan my life without thinking about someone else.   As you all know, I am a big planner.  I plan what I want, when I want it, and how I want it.  I know life is a journey, but for me, a journey is only fun if there is a destination with means of achieving that.  I know what I want in a career, personal life, cars, and all other aspects of life.  I even plan when I want to meet friends.  As if they are pawns in chess.  I don't think I ever have a doubt in what I want.    True, part of me always want to be an artchitect or an interior designer of some sort.  At the same time, I always knew I would be able to do that once I am finished with setting up my career and can do that on the side.    When I was in NJ, I started to doubt my decisions.  I wonder if I made the right choice in coming to UT.  Would my life be better if I had just worked as a drug info specialist at Merck, worked at Rite Aid, or if I had  any other jobs.  Would I be happier if I had bought the townhouse in Edgewater, paying mortage and driving my Camry. I also wonder if it is worth it for me to stay in UT.  I feel guilty for thinking that I am making a sacrifice to stay here for three years.  I don't want to feel resentment later if I am not happy with my job.    I know people say that if I didn't come here, I wouldn't have met my bf.  On the other hand, I missed out in meeting other people in NJ, which potentially could have been the one.  (I don't believe there is only one match for a person, if that is the case, how do you explain most people marry within their geographic area?) I missed out on people's birthdays, graduations, weddings, etc because I was here.  I guess part of me is bitter because I didn't plan to meet someone here that wouldn't move back with me.  I always figure if I met someone here, he will go with me to the east coast.  Who would have thought I would date someone with a tied down job and a career already?     Anyhow, any comments?   What do you think?  Am I crazy?

      To everyone's shock, my parents sold the house in NJ.  It's weird to hear that since all my stuff is still there, the house is still furnished!!  It will be quite a rush for me to get everything settled there in like a weekend.  The good part would be that, I would not have to take care of the bills and etc, but I guess I probably won't be visiting too often now that I don't have a place to stay.  I wished everything was planned a little better so I would still have a car there.    One redeaming thing about the timing is that I may do a business trip there and jsut tacked on this moving thing.  At least it saves me airfare.   Wonder if I can write off the rental car too.  That may be a stretch, but I guess I should be happy with something.   I wonder what I will do with all my stuff.  I wonder how I would mail or get all the stuff I still want here.  Once it's here, what would I do with it?  *sigh*  I need a house so things like this won't happen to me.    Peter is worried about all my stuffed animals.  I think Peter would throw them away, but I want to keep them.  They are like my babies.  If we had our own place I could decorate the apartment/house with them, but we don't.   This past weekend we purchased Trendwest vacations.  It's kinda neat, you buy certain amount of points and then you can go on vacations with them for life.  Granted the vacation was expensive, but considering we can use it for the rest of our lives, I think it's worth it.  It was our first purchase together.  We should actually get a joint credit card, but then again, I would end up paying for most of it I am afraid.  Anyhow, I guess that's all for now.

      It’s the end of another work week.&nbsp; I am looking forward to doing some organization and reading this weekend.&nbsp; I still have all my photos from graduation and before I moved here etc.&nbsp; Yeah, I am a little behind on that wouldn’t you say.&nbsp; I will finish filling in all the gaps on my cruise too.&nbsp; Then slowly, I can update my webpage, but that may be saved for another long weekend.&nbsp; I also want to get some sort of filing system for my papers and etc.&nbsp; All these little things can really clutter up my little space.&nbsp;   My book readings are slowing down.&nbsp; I started the Hillary Clinton book, The Lexus and Olive Tree, and Atlas Shrugged.&nbsp; I am in the midst of all three, but I guess I should really follow through with what I started.&nbsp; I think my goal should be the Clinton book since I started that first out of the three.&nbsp; I guess it’s a little boring so I am not all that into it.&nbsp; The book is a lot about the politics during Bill’s presidency which isn’t all the juicy compared to his scandal and impeachment.&nbsp; I also need to start this book, “Love Languages.”&nbsp; It’s suppose to enlighten people about marriage, commitment, and all that jazz.  I don’t have tennis this week, but I hope Peter would play with me.&nbsp; I want to show him I am getting better, I still don’t play as well as him, but I am getting there.&nbsp; Oh by the way, in case you are wondering 7/24 is Pioneer Day.&nbsp; That was the day when Joseph Smith decided to settle in Utah because this is where the Zion will be.&nbsp; To me, it’s just a freebie day.&nbsp; There will be parades and fireworks and maybe cotton candies too.&nbsp; Yum yum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Jackie came to visit me this past weekend.&nbsp; She arrived at 4:20 AM, that's right it's in the morning.&nbsp; Apparently due to some storm in the East Coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;The good thing is that I live really close to the airport so I can just pick her up when she called.&nbsp; I still made it before she got her luggage and etc.&nbsp;  &nbsp; After a brief&nbsp;"nap" we headed to Lagoon.&nbsp; It's an amusement park with a water park.&nbsp; Since we are&nbsp;not big roller coster person, we just stayed&nbsp;most of our time in the water park.&nbsp; I went on my first water slide with the tubing.&nbsp; It was really fun.&nbsp; Then we met up with my roommate at night to go to a Piano Bar.&nbsp; I have never been to a piano bar, so it was a very interesting experience.&nbsp; They played a lot of country music and of course out of all the people there, it's the old folks that tried to talk to Jackie and I. &nbsp; Friday was the coolest day ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;went on our first hot air balloon ride.&nbsp; It was really neat to see everything in&nbsp;fresh air, not like what you get in the airplane.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't scary at all.&nbsp; The balloon actually moved&nbsp;very slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards we did a little shopping and sight seeing around Park City.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, we had to take a nap since we had to get up at 5:30 for the hot air balloon.&nbsp;&nbsp; After our nap, we went to a club.&nbsp; Unlike the night before, we got whole bunch of young'ins.&nbsp; They claimed to be 21 - 22, but when you are in UT, these kids look like they are 18 especially with the blond hair and baby face. &nbsp; Next day, I had tennis in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we went to visit The Great Salt Lake and antelop Island.&nbsp; What is interesting about the place is that there are ~700 buffalos living on this island, but we didn't see any running in the wild.&nbsp; We saw three in the pen!!&nbsp; They claimed it's because of the weather, but I think it's a conspiracy to get people to pay $8 to drive around a salty island that is not suitable for anything else.&nbsp; We then went to a Neurosurgeon's house party.&nbsp; While it was neat to see them drink and etc, but the women / ladies there are all married and talk about kids and how they don't see their husbands.&nbsp; We got bored pretty quick.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they went to a club after we left.&nbsp; I wouldn't have minded going to a club... at least I don't have to hear about how they put their husband through med school. &nbsp; Sunday was Jackie's last day.&nbsp; We just drove around downtown and visited the LDS temple.&nbsp; It was very interesting to learn about their history and their views.&nbsp; I don't think I will join, but I think it's good that people have their faith.&nbsp; Then, I streaked / highlighted my hair red.&nbsp; I like it, even though everyone is skeptical about it.&nbsp; I think it turned out fine, it's only hair anyways. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I finished my beginner tennis class this past weekend so I am eligible to be in intermediate tennis next week.  I have been playing a lot more lately with my new tennis buddy.  We played twice during the week and some after class.  He is pretty cool.  That reminds me, why do girls suck?  I got stood up by two different girls in my class on two different days.  Then I was supposed to play volleyball with this other girl on Sunday.  Guess what?  She calls an hour before to tell me the she hurt her knee waking up that morning.  I think girls are too shady for me.  They can’t even tell me ahead of time like a day or two before hand if they can’t play.  No more girls for me.    I am also going to start my running thing tomorrow.  I wonder how that will go since I haven’t run in a long long time.  At least I know my roommate won’t stand me up.  On Saturday, I also got the best deal ever.  I bought a bike for $4!! As you can imagine, it will need a lot of work.  Like new brakes and new tires, but otherwise it looked fine.  I figure I can bring it into a bike shop and have someone fix the brakes for me.  I think I can do the tires myself.  It will definitely be an interesting experience.

      I made a list of things I want to do before I get married.  These are the things that I would want to accomplish. 1. Play in a tennis league.  (I will be able to in the fall, but in the meantime I can just take lessons) 2. Run a 10K race (I will start training next week) 3. Get 6 pack (it shoudl come with all my exercise) 4. Backpack through Europe (dunno if I can find a buddy) 5. Get drunk ( I have never bee drunk before) 6. Have a crazy drug experience 7. Read Atlas Shrugged 8. Learn to play the guitar 9. Learn to swim 10. Go to Eusemites, Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, visit all the western states  I also think it woudl be nice to do Peace Corp and stuff, but I am giving that up.  I think it's way too dangerous in this world plus all the other stuff like time.    I guess I will try to start from the beginning of the list.  Since it's a little too much to do all in one day.

      I have officially completed my first year in mmy fellowship.  Hard to believe, a year ago, I was just a wondering child coming to Utah.  I came with two suitcases and two carry-ons full of stuff.  I arrived late at night and my first stop was to Walmart to buy all the essentials such as sheets, toilet paper, bathroom essentials, and other random miscellenous things.  The whole first week that I was here, I just wondered around buying things everyday.  I spent my first night in a really cold apartment with my clothes as pillows and jackets and a blanket as my cover.  Of course, I slept on the floor too.  Slowly I upgraded to having a comforter, a mattress, and then a bed.  It was pretty pathetic since I had my box as my dining table for the longest time, well i still don't have a table, but at least I have two bar stools to eat at the counter.  Now I have so much stuff, it's making me wonder how I will be able to move out of my apartment.  I even have two cars now.  My other car arrived a week ago.  Surprisingly with all the discounts I get for being me, the second car pretty much costs me nothing this year.  It's great.    Well, now I go back to work, so I can get out early today.  Well ok, 5 is pretty early.  hehe.

      I think I am super sensitive these days.  Maybe it's true that the more west you go, you do get soft.  I hope it's just a phase.   I haven't seen Peter for like a week.  It's been crazy in the hospital so he stays late all the time.  One night he stayed til 3 AM.... how is that different being on call since he would have to get up at 4:45 to go on rounds.  It's finalized that I will go to NJ next Saturday, which means I wont' see him for a whole week.  At least I can get some errands done.  Unfortunately, I got a new job which will start this Friday, but I am going to miss 2 days of work bc of this trip :(  I hope they won't mind.  Plus I will miss a day of tennis class.  That sucks since I pay like 11 dollars per class.  I guess I am being cheap about the whole thing but I have to pay off the vacation club thing we bought :(  Moving on, I am reading Atlas Shrugged.  It's very interesting.  I think I am turning out to be like the masses.  I don't think I care about improving things anymore.  I think I am just burnt  out.  Interesting that I get burnt out now not like years ago when I was in Pharmacy school.
