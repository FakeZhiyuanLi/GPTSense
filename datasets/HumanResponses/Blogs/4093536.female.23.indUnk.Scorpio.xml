       urlLink georgewbush.com :: official blog    i guess it is only fitting that my first real entry for this blog should contain a link to another blog:  george bush's blog.  where have i been?  seriously, how did george bush have a blog before i did?  i mean, i know that he's not the one blogging (he fucking doesn't even read.  the newspaper).  but still.  i guess i can take comfort in knowing that i've caught up.  i wonder if kerry has a blog.  let's close this one out with some more links.   urlLink jibjab :: hilarious video   urlLink freaky kerry eye

       this is like my thing. i do this every summer. start a webpage (or something) and then drop it like it's hot drop drop it like it's hot. okay, i've only done it two other times. actually, i also had an e-journal for about five minutes last year. it blew. here's to hoping that this doesn't--and that maybe it will live to see its three month anniversary.

       -i used to have this game on my mobile phone. it's called    urlLink  'guess the dictator or sitcom character'   . the object of the game is to think of a person and try to stump computer as it tries to guess it. i'm still amazed that computer never loses when i play DEE, the moody younger sister from  what's happening.     -   urlLink  john kerry sucks less.    this is how i sometimes feel about our current state of political affairs. i hope all the other elections in our lifetime won't be like this.    -    urlLink  BEAR GUZZLES 36 BEERS, PASSES OUT AT CAMPGROUND.     this is yogi the bear, reincarnated, and bored with picnic baskets.

       i love tampa. i would never say fuck tampa. but if you type 'fuck tampa' into google this is one of the links you get:    urlLink  click here to fuck tampa   . it's a story about a woman who comes back to the tampa which she hates after many years of living elsewhere. it's always kind of annoying for me to hear non-tampanians complain about tampa. get the fuck out then if you hate it so much! in this case, the woman did...but i'm just saying. anyway, it's a mediocre story but it's always funny to read about tampa.    sample quote:     Finally, to keep up the illusion of a conversation, I say, "Tampa's changed a lot."  He says nothing. He seems tentative, almost nervous. I continue, "Well, not really. It's very much the same, just more of it. You know what I mean?"      "Yeah."

       now this is just sad. there is a petition to have britney spears and kevin federline star in their own MTV reality series. kind of like  newlyweds: white trash.  i think television fans can have a lot of influence. just look at what happened to  felicity  when she cut her hair. she was out within the year. but then again,  my so called life  (i know there's a hyphen in there somewhere) didn't make it even after petitions, phone calls, and suicide threats from hardcore fans. so what will happen? will britney and kevin sign on to have their lives taped? will i probably watch this show if it makes it on the air? will it be anything more than britney and kevin eating cheetos and drinking forties? only time will tell.     urlLink   you know you want to sign it

       my sister and i are obsessed with our dog's bowel movements.  wait no, maybe that's just me?        he's staying with us in new york while our parents are gone for a few weeks.  yes, he could've stayed with someone in tampa but this is way better.  it's fun having him up here, but the whole pee and shit thing is so much easier when you can just open the front door and let him roam.  getting him to walk on a leash was just the first ordeal.  he also likes to lick other dogs' pee that's been leaked around the pavement.  gross.  i'd let him lick it if it weren't for the fact that then he comes home and licks on me.  dirty dog.  oh, and you have to pick up the poo and throw it away.  it's a really strange sensation to feel a pile of your pet's warm poo on your hand and know that the only thing between you and it is a thin plastic shopping bag.        so anyway, my pup normally gets all nervous-like when my parents are gone for a long time.  he'll barely eat and hardly poo.  so the first day he was here he didn't drop any turds.  this worried me.  now evertime my sister comes back from walking him i ask her if he pooed.  poo-ed?  poohed?  and when i get back from walking him i like to give her poo updates too.        poo update:  yesterday my sister took the dog for a walk and forgot to bring a plastic bag i.c.o.p. (in case of poo), and he actually went that time.  so she started to walk away from the poo to go find a strewn bag and this voice from up above said, "i saw that!"  some lady was watching my sister and dog from her upstairs apartment.  get a life you pooping tom.

       this is how bad i am PMSing: i just went into my manager's office to get something while she wasn't there and i ate a crumb of chocolate off of her desk. i would have eaten the actual chunk of chocolate because no witnesses were around, but i couldn't really see how she would buy my "the office gnome ate it" story. so i just ate a little crumb. pathetic.

       1. being high doesn't automatically make you funny. i'm not supposed to laugh  just  because you showed up high. do something funny, then you're funny.   2. don't beat around the bush. if you have something you want to share then just fucking say it. i don't speak code. especially loser code.   3. if you don't know me that well, do not assume my loyalty is to you. i will retain everything you have said and then relay that information to my real friend. sucker.   4. practice proper computer etiquette. do not download miscellaneous programs to my personal computer. files are one thing; entire programs are another. also, i will say no if asked for permission because this is my new personal crusade.    5. save the drama for your mama. however, if you really are going to argue with your mother whilst at work...kindly speak in our shared english language so that i can understand what the fuck you are saying. otherwise it's really hard for me to listen in on the conversation you are having in your mother tongue.    6. do not sing out loud. not even if you have a good voice. you are invading my personal auditory space. where the hell did you get the idea that people actually care or want to hear you sing? no one does. go home.   7.  it's perfectly alright to not give a damn about the olympics.

       this weekend in a nutshell:      -friday:  got off of work early.  had drinks with caprice and some people from the place where i interned.  they've been looking for a new intern and can't find one.  they said no one stacks up to me.  my head expanded about a quarter of an inch when i heard this.  picked up alison at the train station afterwards.  went to dinner and a movie.  finally got bookie to walk on a leash.  fun fun.   -saturday:  lazy morning.  went to the museum of sex in the afternoon.  it was cool, but we did the whole thing in an hour.  luckily it was only ten bucks so it wasn't really a rip off.  saw chris kattan and parker posey in the park almost by accident.  they looked so normal.  shopping and manicures afterwards.     -sunday:  had brunch before alison left for connecticut.  ran into the strangest parade ever on the way home.  i still can't figure out what it was for, but they had a police escort and everything.  there were three separate groups of people and each one was playing their own music.  it occurred to me that they should have hired a parade efficiency expert.  went to the upright citizens brigade theater at night and had some thai food afterwards.

        DOMINICAN REPUBLIC : a migrant lost at sea for nearly two weeks without food and water while trying to reach puerto rico said yesterday more than 40 people died during the trip, and at least one woman who refused to give breast milk to passengers was thrown into shark-infested waters.  this article raised a lot of questions for me. here are a few:  1. what's so great about that one guy that he was able to survive? either he's superman, or he had a canteen full of water hidden in the cadillac they were floating on. 2. how did the other forty people die? can't the body go without water for more than two weeks? maybe i'm wrong. 3. who's the lucky puerto rican that found this poor fool floating by himself in the sea? 4. and finally, how retarded are the fools that threw the breast milk lady to the sharks. call me crazy, but if you're willing to let someone die--what is stopping you from holding her down and invading her breast? people are nuts, and dominicans are no different.

       dear sir,  the jig is up. you had critical and commercial success with  the sixth sense  because it actually  was  a good movie. then you shat out two turds called  unbreakable  and  signs.  what happened? i guess you figured you had to capitalize on that plot twist trick again, and so you made  the village.  before you write, direct, and produce another massive disappointment, may i suggest retiring all together?  i only went to see your movie because a friend invited me. in fact, she even said it would be bad and that we could just go and laugh at it. there was a part of me that was hopeful though. i wanted you to redeem yourself after  signs , which was pretty good up until the part where the aliens showed up. it actually would have been scarier if mel gibson was the culprit. his family could have discovered him whilst making another crop circle and then crucified him passions style. now  that  would've been freaky, but you went with aliens instead.  but back to this predictable village of yours...my money was on the creepy things not being creepy at all. i postulated (like that M?) that an expressway was being built not to far from the village and it was just the construction noises that were freakin the people out. eventually the villagers would go explore the noise and discover that it was 2004. an alternative plot would be that the villagers were amish and they didn't know it. i guess my theories weren't too far from the story after all huh M.?  i must say this though...you do command an excellent cast. i really don't know why, but i love joaquin phoenix. i love his eyes, that lip scar, everything about him. why does he keep doing your movies though? he must be bored. you also got adrien brody to sign on, which is impressive. AND he played a retard! brilliant! ooh, and i almost forgot sigourney weaver. why didn't i know she was in this movie until i saw it? i didn't even see a trace of her in the previews. i guess that was your first mistake--not publicizing sigourney. who doesn't love sigourney? geez, her name is enough to entertain me. sigourney sigourney sigourney. oh, and p.s.: ron howard's daughter is annoying. boo red heads.  so m. night shyamalan, i beg of you not to make any more movies. you might reply and point out to me that i really don't need to go see them if i don't want to...but see, your films are like a car crash and i just can't help myself. aren't you rich already? the  sixth sense  probably brought in enough cash for you to add another initial to your name. so just leave us movie going folk alone!  sincerely,  desiree duped

       i got to work this morning and there was a note on the desk from my manager that said she wanted to see me. i thought she was going to reem me russian style for being three minutes late, but no. she wanted to inform me that she had made a few grammatical changes to the reports i was working on yesterday...so now i have to start all over again. i contemplated walking out to fifth avenue and standing in the bus lane until something hit me. maybe even a biker. just anything really. it's kind of a far walk out to the entrance, so i'm still here in my chair.

       note to self: don't take a late lunch ever again because there will be nothing left to eat when you get there. i ended up eating coleslaw, sausage cornbread stuffing, and cranberry sauce for lunch. so much for a balanced, nutritious meal.       this is random, but the spanish have invaded new york. i see spaniards at least once every 2-3 days (especially at the museum). it's probably because we're in august and that's when the whole peninsula goes on vacation. i want to go up to the spaniards and talk to them, but i shant. i used to do that awhile ago when i first moved to new york but realized they didn't give a damn. they'd put their "and what?" face on for me. they are a dry, mean people but i love them still. perhaps one day i'll get up the courage and say to them: "las vacas del pueblo ya se an escapado; riao riao!" big ups to my gente.        urlLink  haz click aqui para visitar a pradoluengo

           is this what's in store for the next four years? hats that eat our first lady for lunch? a president that's so ready to prove he's patriotic that he will pose in pledge-of-allegiance-mode for all photo ops? just look at how he's laughing at her. wait--maybe that's not even teresa under there. we may never know.    here are some possible explanations for her unusual pose:  1. she just heard that the grand canyon luncheonette doesn't serve heinz ketchup. 2. she's looking at the ground and telling it to "shove it". 3. all of a sudden she's shy. 4. albeit not a foreign one, she just found out that laura bush has an accent too (and she's jealous). 5. john kerry just told her that she'll have to use regular toilet paper to wipe her ass because there are no ATMs in the grand canyon, and she won't be able to withdraw any cash. 6. after telling john that she wants a cute anniversary tradition like the edwards's have, he proposes pushing her off the cliff as a new tradition. 7. she carries a little monkey from her homeland of mozambique in the front of the hat and it's tipping her over. 8. for real, this is the actual reason why she is posing like that: she's got vertigo.  vote hats! vote rudeness! vote cash! vote teresa!    urlLink  click here for more vertigo

       don't even read this. at this point it's just posting gluttony.  i had a message on my voicemail from adelphi university. i nearly shat myself. there was a split second there where i truly believed in my heart of hearts that they were calling to tell me that my 'B' final average had been a mistake. i'm not kidding. i think my heart actually paused for a moment. they were actually calling me for something else. BUT! i decided to go online and check my grade and it does say 'B'. it's on the internet now, so that must mean it's official, right?  on a side note, the lady from the king kong movie died. you know the one on the empire state building that kong's all bout it bout it. they're saying she's a cultural icon, but i really think they just mean that about flailing arms and flailing legs inserted into a gorilla's grasp. so anyway, the empire state building will dim its lights tonight in her honour.    urlLink  the kong's girlfriend kick el cubo

       so it's tuesday and i'm back at work. there should be four day weekends at least once a month. i'm saying this with a total straight face too. when i got here this morning i couldn't remember what i was supposed to do. it took me fifteen minutes to figure out where i had left off. next time i have a four day weekend i'm going to make a to-do list before i leave.      i started to post last night when i got home but ended up deleting it. i was so delirious from being tired that i was typing crazy shit like: "so can you to do it from." what does that mean? it would have been funny if i didn't realize i was cracked out about half way through. i would have had to change the name of this blog to: redonkulous midnight posts.      so here's a weekend recap:      1. saturday morning i took my final exam for my last class ever. woot woot. wait, no woot woot. after the test my body went into total meltdown because i did really badly on it. i needed a 78 on the test to get a B in the class, and there's no way i got a 78. the masters program requires no less than a B in required courses in order for them to count towards graduation. so, the 24 hours after that were all about pondering how the hell i had screwed this one up and thinking about how retarded i was for now having to retake this class. anyway, my professor emailed me the next day and told me i got a B in the class. this is impossible. there is no way in effing hell that happened. he changed my grade and i know it. am i morally opposed? no, not so much.    2. alison and stephen were here this weekend. good times, good times. actually, stephen still is here (probably asleep on the couch). yesterday we came to the museum for a few hours; they're closed to the public on mondays. then we got together with freda after she got off of work. we went to this popeye's chicken (don't ask) around rockefeller center, and untapped a hidden drug ring. well, not really--but the cashier guy was totally drugged. he was sweating and his eyes couldn't focus on us. stephen asked him something about these annoying new machines they have for taking orders and he goes: "new york ceety maan. eet's all arteefeecial. all arteefeecial." then he asked the guy making the chicken in the back how much money he had made this week. totally bizarre, and unprofessional even for popeye's chicken. afterwards we went to chelsea piers and then stephen decided he wanted to look for this elusive park that we never found. he ended up walking us halfway up the hudson river park to no avail though. somehow later on we ended up at this place called white horse and got some food and drinks. we were sitting outside and this guy that was on "sex and the city" walked right past us. he played ray, the jazz musician that carried dated. she called him ADD--another dating disaster--but he really did have ADD. dude, he's hot. he's actually even hotter in person. probably cuter than aidan too. oh no, i did not just say that.    3. went to the upright citizen's brigade theater again on sunday. amy poehler and horatio sanz were there. haha. i just laughed in my head thinking about the show because it was so funny.    4. this asian lady with braces stepped on stephen foot whilst riding on the subway. he vocalized his "oww" for the whole car to hear. i was startled...and i do not use that word very often. the boy scared me with his pain. the asian lady's apologies did not help.      i feel like more has happened but that's all i can think of for now. it's 10:22 am and my output has been low thus far. i should get back to work. in the meantime: what up andrea parrino? update!

       elevated terror alerts and a test that i'm supposed to be studying for can only mean one thing: i'm doing something totally useless.      new york city might totally get ka-boomed by someone that never heard you're supposed to check your teenage angst at the door. i'm fucking tired of these assholes that have a problem with our president and his foreign policy and want to blow our shit up. why don't they just take him out instead?! oh my lordy, i bet this blog is going to get flagged by the FBI now because i just wrote that. listen FBI, i just don't want to die while i'm walking up fifth avenue to get to work, okay? that's all. there's really nothing more to it. in the meantime, i refuse to live my life like a scared little shit. i moved to long island the weekend of the blackouts and i moved to manhattan the day after they sent out the alert about the financial targets. i'm not going back to tampa until the end of the year when i'm ready (unless of course there is no apartment left). but just in case something does happen...      as of 8/6/04 there are a few things i never got to do. i always wanted to go to niagra falls, the grand canyon, italy, the greek isles, argentina, maine and prince edward island. i never learned to dance or speak french, and i still had not seen  top gun . if there was one thing i would have changed about my life it would have been to have taken piano lessons when i was younger.       if i could, i would have told my family that they were the most important thing in my life. i would let my mother know that after almost twenty four years i had actually accepted her for who and what she was. that wasn't easy, but i actually accomplished it. i would tell my dad that he is the person i had always modeled myself after. there is no one else i wanted to be like. i would tell my sister i love her and that i was looking forward to our newfound friendship and living together in new york. i would kiss my dog on the nose, and i'd call my abuela on the phone one last time.       if i could, i would have told my friends that there was no substitute for them. i had never met anyone like them and probably never would have. no one made me laugh like them. no one made me feel as good about myself as they did. i'd tell them something that a sometimes wise person told me: you can't pick your family but you can pick your friends. and if you decide to keep those friends around it must mean that you really love them because those should be the easiest ties to break. i'd tell all those from the broken ties that i appreciate what they did for me, whatever that may have been.       if anyone was left wondering about me, i'd want them to know that i was a simply complicated person. or maybe a complicated simple person. i strived for moderation but didn't always succeed. my favorite things to do were watching films, sitting outside and talking, and the excitement of driving somewhere fun. i also loved the feeling i got of seeing downtown tampa at night as i drove back from somewhere else. the things i hated most were lying, genuine pettiness, and elitism. the things i struggled with most were judging, and patience en route to the point.       i'd want people to know they should get over themeselves because no one else gives a damn. i'd tell people that dogmas are evil, and to drink eight glasses of water a day. i'd let them know that there is no such thing as not enough time, or not getting the chance. those are excuses and not reasons. when you want something bad enough you can always find a way. i'd tell people that the greatest disservice you can do to someone else is to be dishonest. i'd want these people to know that the greatest waste of time is not being yourself. i'd want people to know that i was content almost always.

       the girl i sublet from is a free spirit/actress/french tutor i found on craigslist. she's not really sure where she's going in life, or just going period. she's in pennsylvania now, she is trying to move to los angeles, but she might come back to manhattan. what the eff right? so basically she's in limbo and we agreed that she could leave some of her personal shit behind in this apartment while i'm here. let's make a list of what i've found so far:  1. a roach. not the bugs either mmmkay?   2. naked pictures. here's a p.s. to the people that know me: if you leave pictures behind i  will  look at them. i am nosy and i have very little shame about snooping.   3. all-american pick up sticks. it's exactly as it sounds and that's what is says on the box they're in too.   4. some interesting books:  Living Japanese Style ,  YOU Can be a Columnist ,  The Art of Loving ,    The Verbally Abusive Relationship ,  The History of Witchcraft , etc.   5. a pipe. see #1.   6. more half used votive candles than any person will ever need in one lifetime.   7. enough dust to make the CEO of Claritin cream himself.    speaking of dust, i'm having this apartment professionally cleaned tomorrow afternoon. i was a bit hesitant about it at first because i don't feel like i'm  that  lazy a sack of shit that i can't do it myself...but i changed my mind soon therafter. there's just too much crap in this house and it has taken me forever to unpack. i don't think i can deal with it another day. also, stephen and alison are coming tomorrow so i'll let someone else take care of it. i think they're only charging me ten dollars an hour too. it's two latin american women that i found on craigslist. geez, two craigslist references in one post. it really is the best. let me give it a shout out down below:    urlLink  craigslist :: woot woot

        i hate leaving a movie thinking that i could have written it or something just as good. i hate it for two reasons:     1. if i had written it i would be rich.    2. it usually means that it's a simple story.      garden state  was good, but i can't decide if i really really liked it. it was kind of like  lost in translation  in that its foundation was the all too common quarter-life crisis. i really hope that people stop using this theme sometime soon because i'm getting tired of it. you're lost, confused, whatever. it just seems like this topic is the writer's crutch for creating their cash cow. it's so easy to write something about being lost and confused because it's so vague, and therefore you don't have to go into too much detail. if i  was  comparing it to  lost in translation , i'd have to say that  garden state  wins because it had more stuff going on in the plot.  lost in translation  was so about the mood and the feelings. i think this movie actually had some direction.      i guess the movie compensates for its (annoying-to-me) content by the acting. i was really impressed. who knew jd from "scrubs" could be so serious? and natalie portman should get a nomination for a golden globe at least. i think i understand dorky boys' fascination with this girl because she's pretty and smart. plus she's in those star trek or star wars movies right? maybe if i was writing a movie like zach braff i could write a part for someone who i'd never have a chance with in real life too. seriously, stay tuned for my new project called  making out with vince vaughn.     so one and a half thumbs up for  garden state.  that makes for a really gimpy looking hand, huh?   urlLink  zach braff's garden state blog

       so i've been working at the museum for about a month now, and not once have i had to talk/interact with museum visitors. it's kinda nice. the only thing though is that they don't have secret underground tunnels to shuttle the employees between the offices and the cafeteria. that would really be the ideal situation. museum visitors are just as obnoxious and annoying as any other kind of visitor/tourist/zealot. they'll get distracted by a piece and just abort walking. i've almost tasted people's hair because of this.       i shouldn't say that i've never had to interact with a visitor because all of that changed today. so i'm walking to go get lunch and this lady walks up to me and gets in my face. her eyes saw my security pass but her brain interpreted it as "information booth on legs". she wanted to know where the bathroom was. i told her i didn't know. she put her stank face on and walked away. my internal dialogue: "lady, do you not see that i am dressed in professional attire? i'm not wearing orthopedic shoes like all the security guards either, so what gave you the idea that i was going to point you in the direction of relieving yourself?"       it was a total stephen-in-the-miami-gas-station moment, except for that i couldn't say "do i look like i work here?" (because i actually do).

       i think this is my third or fourth dubya post. i really need to stop. i swear i don't go out there looking for this stuff...i kinda just stumble upon it and deem it too good not to share with others (like anyone reads this piece of shit). anyhoo, bushy is in bad need of a makeover. may i recommend the comb over, asleep, close lipped bush?      urlLink  http://homepage.mac.com/krousen/Bush%20site/index.html

       you can tell i'm really into work today as this marks my third post since this morning. i'm over it.  so at the employee cafeteria they have this specialty table that changes every day. sometimes they will have an ethnic cuisine, like greek food for example. the weird thing though is that they don't write "greek" on the menu board. instead they'll write "specialty table: greece". it makes me think of eating the country for lunch. strange huh? little people screaming as i pick them up and eat them. i need to stop.  so anyway, i'm in the cafeteria today and this lady walks in and goes "spain!". i thought she was weird; she was talking to herself. turns out the specialty table had spanish food today.

       i'm sorry, did i say heart? i meant hate. muahahaha. i love conspiracy theories; jfk and the magic bullet, how we never actually got to the moon, the 2000 s-election, and weapons of mass distraction. don't worry, i'm not going to start spewing some shit about how aliens, jesus, and elvis walk among us. i'm just suspicious of our government, and this creates an environment that is conducive to conspiracy theories.      so check it out...this site takes out all the work of creating the precious babies that fuel my days.    urlLink  http://www.buttafly.com/bush/index.php

       i wish i could say i was finally moved in, but no. i still have some major unpacking to do.  my apartment is totally crappy chic. i signed on the dotted line because it's in a good location and it has roof access with a great view. however, it's like the wonka factory minus the chocolate. seriously though, it's wacky. the whole second half of the apartment is slanted. i could get a rolling marble to prove it. even some of the doorways are titled too. then there's the bathroom sink that's fit for a gnome. not even david the gnome though--a female gnome with a smaller build instead. it is smaller than airplane bathroom sinks. i have to wash my face in the kitchen sink. i shore do love it because it's purdy in its own way. i just can't wait to be all moved in. i guess i'm the only one that can fix that though.  it only took me thirty minutes to get to work today. the museum has extended my contract without giving me an end date. i don't mind staying here because it's not like i have another job lined up. still, i'd like to know when this is all going to be over. my manager keeps giving me different projects to work on that aren't the ones that i originally came here to do. whatever. the money is good. plus, i have two days off coming up. one of them will be on monday when the museum is only open to friends and family, so i'm going to come with stephen while he's visiting.  speaking of the museum, i'm actually here so i should get back to work.
