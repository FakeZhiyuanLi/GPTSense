      well i havent updated this thing since friday. we'll the weekend was good. saturday i just stayed home and went outside. when my mom got home, we went to dinner at 'Captians' on Main Street. then to 'stop & shop' in bridgeport and fairfield, then to 'shaws', trying to find salad for the picnic on the fourth. then we went to 'kohls' to return something. we didnt get home until past ten. when we got home i helped my mom make some cake for a picnic on the fourth. then went to bed. the fourth was fun. we went to my moms friends house in Hunington. they have a nice big ass house, with a pool and big yard. i was in the pool most of the time. the water was really nice. it was 79 degrees. thats warm for me. so that was good. then we went to my uncles house at about eight. a lot of people were there. we went because he does fireworks every year, so we wanted to see them. they were really gooood. loud, but very good. you should see all the people that line their chairs up on the street to watch them. its crazy. everybody that has a picnic that day, tells all the people to stay and watch the fireworks. my two uncles and some of their friends do the fireworks. then monday i went to 'kohls' in trumbull with my mom, jay, and grandma. we were their for almost four hours. but, what else was i going to do at home? so i went. i listened to my mix CD on the way there and in the store. so while we were their me and jay walked around to all the stores there. so that pasted time. then we went back to my grandmas and just hung out their for a little while. i almost lost this whole thing. thank God theres an undo button, because if their wasnt then i would have been screwed. but anyways. then we went to 'stop & shop' and got some pizza at 'pizza time', came home and ate it and went outside. my friends did some little fireworks. so i stayed there to see those. they were actually good. today im going over a friends house. he has a nice pool. so that should be fun. so im gonna go. maybe i'll be back later tonight to update some more. maybe. peace.
