      A  urlLink news article posted today on MSN  states that our Vice President, the aptly named "Dick" launched into a heated discussion with Sen. Patrick Leahy about money, politics, and religion.  The confrontation apparently began with Sen. Leahy had the nerve to say "hello" to Dick and ended when the Veep, apparently unable to come up with a real argument, shouted either "f--- off" or "f--- you" to him on the Senate floor, in apparent violation of Senate rules barring the use of profanity on the floor.  Senator Leahy, you see, has been one of several members of Congress who have seen Halliburton's receipt of lucrative contracts in post-Hussein Iraq as suspicious, given Dick's former leadership of that company, and has called for public hearings to see whether the Veep orchestrated the contract's awarding. Halliburton has come under fire recently for allegedly overbilling the government and the military.  The exchange offers a telling glimpse into the psyche of the current administration, which appears to go to extraordinary lengths of not having itself questioned or confronted.  A parallel can be drawn between Dick's defensiveness at the suggestion that he helped his Halliburton cronies bilk the government--which may be a case of "methinks the lady doth protest too much"--and current regulations barring protestors and dissenters from being within the sight or sound of the president when he makes a public appearance.  This is an administration who not only does not want the public to know what really is happening behind the curtain, it doesn't want to peek behind the curtain to see what people really think.  Hopefull, this disdain for public exposure and criticism will come back to haunt them at the polls.

      On Wednesday, the United States Supreme Court--surprise surprise--dodged deciding a major case involving the Bush Administration, which might have had the effect of actually telling the executive, "Hey, you were wrong," in favor of sending the case back down where it will be cloaked in obscurity until after Election Day 2004.  I'm talking, of course, about the infamous Dick Cheney case and whether he should be required to turn over records of the secret meetings in 2001 between him and several energy-company heads that resulted in the administration's enegrgy policy that I shall call "No Corporation Left Behind."  For those unfamiliar with the case, shortly after Bush took office, he appointed Vice-President Dick Cheney to head an energy task-force to come up with the administration's energy policies.  Cheney is the former head of an energy company, Halliburton, which recently has come under fire for allegedly overcharging the goverment in its contracts in Iraq.    That aside, Cheney allegedly undertook a number of private meetings with other engergy and industrial company heads--including the illustrious Kenneth Lay of Enron--and, in 2001, produced the administration's energy plan.  Shock upon shock!  It was very, very friendly to big-business.  Enter The Sierra Club and others, who sued to obtain the records of these secret meetings.  Citing the Federal Advisory Committee Act, a 1972 law requiring that governmental commissions conduct their business in public unless all members are government officials, the Sierra Club argued that it had a right to the records.  A lower court agreed and ordered the documents' release, but the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the district court's order goes too far, and it sent the case back down for the parties to to hash out.  In doing so, the Court did not rule on the big question--namely whether Cheney legally can refuse to release those documents for public inspection.  Now, I'm no Supreme Court justice, mind you, but it seems pretty clear to me.  The law requires these meetings be made public, unless all attendees are government officials.  Many attendees of  Cheney's Energy Policy Giveaway Extravaganza were corporate heads, and last time I checked, corporate heads are not (yet) government officials.  The administration's argument?  Well, despite the plain language of the Act, it shouldn't apply to them because, otherwise, people won't be candid when the meet with the government and offer suggestions, lest their suggestions be held up for public scrutiny.  Call me crazy, but I think that is the whole purpose of the law in the first place--so that if Ken Lay is dictating energy policy to the Bush Administration, the people would know about it and be able to protest or, at the very least, cast an intelligent vote come election time.  So what's the problem?  Why didn't the Court address the merits of the case?  Seems to me the Court screwed this one up.  Even if it determined that some issues were unresolved in the lower courts, it could nonetheless have ruled on the big question before it and then sent the case down for the lower courts to handle in light of its decision.  It's done so before.  Many times.  But this time it did not.  It chose not to act against the administration.  An unsettling pattern is beginning to emerge that raises some serious questions about the current justices of the Court.  They seem to go out of their way to favor the Bush administration, don't they?  Beginning with the infamous Bush v. Gore case, which by the way, history will judge harshly, the Court has taken pains essentially to permit this administration to do as it will, consequences be damned.  Many view the current administration with skepticism, beginning with the Florida debacle of 2000.  And let's not quibble--whether you support Bush or not, the Bush v. Gore decision is logically flawed and, worse, itself violative of the Twelfth Amendment, which says that the method of choosing electors for the president of the United States is exclusively up to each state to decide for itself.  Yet, as a consequence, Bush received the disputed electoral votes in Florida.  Now, faced with another case involving the administration, the Court has sidestepped passing any judgment on it, choosing instead to pass the buck back to an overworked federal judge.  The Court had before it a chance to redeem itself in the eyes of many as a fair arbiter of legal issues, a symbol of respect for the law that is, like Lady Justice, blind (and now, thanks to Rev. Ashcroft, demurely draped) to political parties.  Once again, they blew it.

      It's more than an homage to a  urlLink classic R.E.M. album.   Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be turning a critical eye to political, religious, and other developments in the news, examining their contents for bias and on their merits.  You may agree with my opinions and analysis--you may disagree, and that's okay, unlike many commentators today, I welcome reasoned dissent--heck you might even change my mind.

      Democrats and Republicans alike have, according to recent reports, resorted to the basest of tactics to promote their candidates.&nbsp; The trend, left unchecked, could spell the demise of any pretense of positive campaigning.   In well-publicized reports, Democrats came under fire when MoveOn.pac released a television spot juxtaposing President Bush with Adolf Hitler.&nbsp; Not to be outdone, a local Republican organization released bumper-stickers proclaiming that John Kerry was Osama Bin Laden's man.   Whether Democrat, Republican, or independent; whether liberal, conservative, or centrist, all Americans should be disturbed by these tactics.&nbsp; Hitler and Bin Laden both have come to embody evil in our culture, and comparing the candidates in this election to men whose policies and dictates stand for intolerance, murder, and dominion is the height of irresponsibility.&nbsp; President Bush may be many things, but he is no Hitler.&nbsp; John Kerry may be beholden to many, but he is not to Bin Laden.   The problem with these tactics--beyond the obvious fact that they are singularly distateful--is that more Americans who do not already have an axe to grind with one party or the other do not appear to be outraged.&nbsp; Indeed, many to whom I have mentioned these events simply say, oh, well, that's just more politicking.&nbsp; They point out that both sides are equally guilty, and emphasize that it is just another reason why they avoid politics at all costs.   And it is politicking.&nbsp; One of the worst kinds, I'd say.&nbsp; It's the ultimate in demonizing one's opponent.&nbsp; Both campaigns were calculated to spark a visceral reaction, and juxtaposing the leader of the free world with the man who terrorized Europe for more than a decade and presided over the slaughter of 6 million Jews certainly can do that, but I fear it would backfire.   Indeed, much as I hate to admit it, the Republican party could have scored points with many Americans, like me, who find those tactics so reprehensible that they backfire.&nbsp; Do we want a person in office who would sanction the equation of our leader with Adolf Hitler?&nbsp; By responding in kind, however, the Republicans squandered an opportunity to make good on Bush's pledge to bring dignity back to campaigning.&nbsp; What we're left with is more politics as usual, and what may result is more voter apathy, leaving the results of the upcoming elections and the course of this nation for the next few years in the hands of only the radical few.

      HR. 3313 passed the U.S. House of Represenatives yesterday.&nbsp; H.R. 3313 is its official name.&nbsp; Popularly, it is known as the "Marriage Protection Act of 2004."  I'll not belabor the issue of gay-marriage or same-sex unions.&nbsp; Many others have done so on both sides.&nbsp; I wonder at the wisdom of the act, however.  The MPA purports to remove all questions regarding the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Acy of 1996 and the MPA itself from the jurisdiction of the federal courts.&nbsp; This means that no person can challenge the constitutionality of the DoMA in federal court,  nor can any person challenge the constitutionality of the MPA itself.   Right now the MPA is, as the old Schoolhouse Rock song goes, still just a bill.&nbsp; It must pass the Senate in order to be presented to the President, who has indicated he will sign it into law.  But take a moment to imagine the consequences of that action.&nbsp; If the MPA passes and if it surivies its inevitable constitutional challenge, one of the basic pillars of our democracy will have been destroyed.&nbsp; We learned in elementary school about checks and balances.&nbsp; We learned that the judicial branch has the power to invalidate legislative and executive acts that are unconstitutional.&nbsp; The MPA would destroy that.  So what, some may ask.&nbsp; I'm not in favor of gay marriage anyway, so I really don't care.&nbsp; To those, I would ask, Suppose it was something more personal to you?&nbsp; Suppose the government were to pass a law saying persons over the age of 65 cannot vote and include a clause saying you cannot challenge that law in court?&nbsp; Does that seem fair?  See, I believe that the problem with the MPA goes well beyond the issue of same-sex unions.&nbsp; In their zeal to legislate what some Congressional members believe is some kind of imminent threat to their way of life, they risk opening the door for future lawmakers to take actions against them that they might not like.&nbsp; If that happens, by then, they may well wish they had left well enough alone.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Ooops they did it again!&nbsp; This time to legendary singer Linda Ronstadt.&nbsp; During a performance at Las Vegas's Aladdin Hotel and Casino, Ronstadt dedicated a song to filmmaker Michael Moore and the film  Fahrenheit 9/11 .&nbsp; A near riot ensued.  &nbsp;  According to a  urlLink report on CNN.com , guests who disagreed with Ronstadt's viewpoint "spilled drinks, tore down posters and demanded their money back."&nbsp; Nearly a fourth of the estimated 4,500 patrons walked out.&nbsp; Following her performance, the hotel admits, Ronstadt was escourted out of the casino and told she would not be welcomed back.  &nbsp;  Okay, what the hell is going on in this&nbsp;country?&nbsp; According to a spokesperson for the casino, "Ms. Ronstadt was hired to entertain the guests of the Aladdin, not to espouse political views."&nbsp; Once again, we are faced with an example of corporate censorship--formless business entities taking action against individuals for expressing their views.  &nbsp;  Should this obtain in this country?&nbsp; Yes, the casino is a business entity, not a government agency, and of course, businesses have the right to hire and fire.&nbsp; But business cannot hire and fire for discriminatory reasons, such as on the basis of race, religion, gender, or being differently abled.&nbsp; Federal and State laws prohibit these actions already, the idea being that society as a whole benefits from the inclusion of all people.  &nbsp;  Is not, then, an action taken because of a person's expressing a viewpoint that a corporate entitly disagrees with equally wrong in principle?&nbsp; Should there not be federal or state laws prohibiting the hiring or firing of an individual for engaging in constitutionally protected activities, such as expressing one's opinion?&nbsp; Would that not promote some of the same ideals that the antidiscrimination laws address?&nbsp; That society as a whole will benefit by allowing others the freedom to express their views?  &nbsp;  And one has to wonder at the casino's actions against the thousand or so people who behaved boorishly.&nbsp; Were they foricbly ejected too?&nbsp; Lord knows, I hear things I disagree with all the time, yet never have resorted to riotous behavior.&nbsp; And before anyone says, well, they paid to hear Linda Ronstadt's songs, not her views, I beg to differ.&nbsp; As with SlimFast and Whoopi Goldberg, the casino ought to have to take Ms. Ronstadt as they find her.&nbsp; Her liberal political views are not unknown to the world, and her expressions of them are a regular feature of her concerts.&nbsp; This is elementary knowledge.&nbsp; Worse still are those who reacted by tearing down posters and spilling drinks.&nbsp; Who did they think they were going to see perform?&nbsp; Some vapid teen blonde without an ability to think?&nbsp; Or a veteral singer/songwriter whose antiwar stance is well known?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The casino should not condone the fans' boorish behavior by punishing the one who, frankly, was doing no more than what everyone in this country ought to be entitled to do--speak his or her mind.&nbsp; A stronger statement would have been made if it said, "Hey, like it or not, Ms. Ronstadt is a human, and an American, and entitled to speak her mind.&nbsp; If you don't like it, leave, or disagree, but don't act like an animal."  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      In a follow-up to yesterday's piece about Kerry's Hollywood fundraiser, CNN reports that  urlLink SlimFast has dumped Whoopi Goldberg as its spokesperson  following reports that, during the event, she made off-color plays on Bush's name--I'll leave to the reader to imagine the fun one can have with that one.   The troubling aspect of SlimFast's decision to fire Goldberg is that it apparently did so under pressure from GOP supporters and conservatives who threatened a boycott in retaliation. What has occurred, thus, appears to be a case of a corporate entity taking punitive action against a person because it disagrees with her viewpoint.   The danger in this is obvious and reaches far beyond this case. What is to prevent a corporate entity from taking punitive action against, say, a news organization who reports a legitimate story that is unflattering to whomever or whatever the corporation supports? Similar actions taken by government entities would violate the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, yet Goldberg has no remedy available to her.   And let's make one thing perfectly clear. This is not a case of a corporate entity being blindsided by an unforeseeable action taken by its spokesperson. Goldberg is, first and foremost, a comedian whose routines regularly have skewered politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike. Her alignment with the Democratic party is not unknown to anyone who has paid any attention whatsoever to her career, as is her tendency to "go blue" on occasion with her comedy.   So what's the problem? SlimFast took Goldberg as they found her, but now they want to act pious and upright because she made an admittedly off-color joke about Bush? Their actions appear to be yet another example of corporate America's intertwining with the president and his party--not surprising since the White House has consistently pushed for policies favoring business at the expense of the workers and the environment.   But there was a boycott threat, and SlimFast couldn't risk the potential loss of revenue otherwise, some might say. Whatever, I say. Boycotts by conservatives and religious groups have not historically been a major factor in a company's bottom line--witness the well publicized boycott of all things Disney by fundamentalist religious organizations in retaliation for Gay Days. SlimFast should have had the courage to stand behind their spokesperson--a person whose reputation was known when they hired her--and reminded the protestors that, in this country, we can be ourselves.

      An  urlLink article posted this afternoon at CNN.com  recounts how Bush's campaign has blasted a recent fund-raiser for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. The event featured speeches and performances by Whoopi Goldberg, John Mellencamp, Chevy Chase, Paul Newman, and others.   What Bush & Co. find most appalling are Kerry's words of thank you at the end of the event, in which he stated that the entertainers "conveyed the heart and soul of America." In a campaign stop in Marquette, Michigan, Bush stated that he "thought the heart and soul of America is found in places right here." His campaign attack dogs fired off a letter to the Kerry campaign demanding that footage of the event be released.   In one of the best comebacks I've seen in this contentious race, Mary Beth Cahill, Kerry's campaign manager, responded with her own letter: She'd gladly release the footage as soon as Bush released a number of documents "relating to Bush's performance in office" including military records from his service in the Texas Air National Guard; correspondence between the Defense Department and Halliburton about no-bid contracts for Iraqi reconstruction; records of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force; correspondence between the Bush administration and the pharmaceutical industry about the Medicare drug bill; and documents about prison abuse in Iraq.   In closing, Cahill stated, "Considering that the president has failed to even come close to keeping his promise to change the tone in Washington, we find your outrage over, and paparazzi-like obsession with, a fund-raising event to be misplaced."   And you know what? Good for her.   It strikes me as utter hypocrisy for a man to stand before a of working-class citizens and tell them that they are the heart and soul of America, when well-known footage exists of him before his high-dollar contributors glibly referring to them as the Have's and the Have-More's. "Some call you the elite. I call you my base."   And make no mistake about it, the "heart and soul of America" who applauded Bush's words in Marquette, Michigan never will be allowed a seat at his table. Bush has no more use for them than the  urlLink young inmate he met during the primary race in 2000 during a photo op at a juvenile detention center in Texas,  a young man whose story he used to make the case for "compassionate conservatism." If his  urlLink record  is any indication, only those with the cash to become a Pioneer, Ranger, or, now, Super Ranger will ever be heard. The average citizen will not.
