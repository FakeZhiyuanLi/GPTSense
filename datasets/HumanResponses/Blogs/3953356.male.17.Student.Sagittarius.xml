      Well people. Things have come to a pretty pass, a pretty pass indeed.  At the moment I can hear the air being squeezed in and out of a bouncey castle, of which I will be bouncing upon later this eve. There is a BBQ outside my house so we are going!!! Gonna be a few broken hips! All in the name of fun. I would like to celebrate the return of Mattius with a round of applause! And the death of Heliana and Lauren, also with an applause. (That was cold). This Wednesday is outing time. Anyperson who wishes to accompany me and Rocio to the cinema to watch the incredibly awesome Thunderbirds please let one know as soon as possible. Thats all I have have to say... Oh apart from "HELEN, LAUREN. I TAKE YOU BOTH DOWN!!!!"

      Hello again my likkle followers. Well last night was filled with festivities. After finishing work at 11 at night I walked out onto the terrace of the Hilton to find Jess Nye looking very bored! I checked supy-visor and he said I could buy a drink. However, I did not pay for said drinks as the bar manager knew I worked there (hard not to notice from the bright yellow shirt and the name badge with the Hilton sign on it!) So we got free drinks! Also, the man who was looking after the wedding saw me and Jess talking and asked me if I was chatting her up! You can imagine the reaction he got! Anyway, that was all. Pedro is waiting for me to give him a sensual massage! Bye bye!

      That title was totally random.  Last night saw the departure of Miss Garas, Miss Sanders and Mr Davey... boo hoo.&nbsp; The school will not be the same without them. It's a shame the less talented teachers don't go... like M.A. Constantine. But she's holding on for the sympathy vote! And Luke Bradbury too. God he was annoying.  Anyway, Lauren SHUT YA BIG MOUTH!!! I didn't even Luke was his name! Obviously someone did a little research into the matter. Oh well. We did come up with some funny stuff. Betty Crum-Swack, Metty Swinge, Betty Swoobs, Cletty Sweavage! Oh the list is endless.  I had the weirdest dream too! I was staying in America with some one who lived on 10th street! thats all I can remember!  Feel free to post your dreams on here and I will try to a) analyse them or b) rip the piss out of you!   I'm spent!

      What a fix! That's all I'm saying. Bignor so deserved to win. you have to agree with me snoopy Nose! We had the boy you fancied running for us. You know the one... dreamy eyes... nice tight bum... and so on and so forth. (Those weren't my opinions btw... they are ones Lauren had... In my head!) But yes anyway Bignor should've one because I managed to deafen almost everyone surrounding me and Mr Blachford! He was gonna deck me!!! LOL!  I now feel sad because college is over for a while and I'll be stuck in Fontwell (FONTWELL FOR CAPITAL) and no one, apart from spontaeneuos Matt and Lesley, will visit me. Bastards.  Oh yeah, we went to see aplay last night called 'betrayal' with Samantha Janus and it... sucked big hairy donkey balls. Their voices were annoying, there wasn't any action and the jokes just were not funny!  But Samantha was F.I.N.E!   Any way   TTFN.

      WE WENT DRIVING!!!!! Darling Lesley and Mattius visited and we went for a drivey poohs. T'was fun. Did ask that skanky bitch Snoopy Nose if she wanted to come. "I'm watching a film" was her reply. But it was fun. Both Mattius and Lesley hit the 50mph mark!!!! And I reversed into a ditch! But in all fairness I had to in order to turn around. I also got a courier badge and two white chocolate cookies out of it. Also smacked in the chest, arm and face by a rather springy green sphere! I think that is all for now. Any comments feel free to post.  Check ya later. And stay safe. String Out!

      My last post seemed to have crossed a few wires. Not that I care but I suppose I ought to put things right. With in the last post I happened to mention something about a person. Well I should say now, I was only writting what sean had said to me. Nowhere in that post was a biased comment from me. I was merely pointing out there was another side to the story which I&nbsp;felt needed to be heard. That's that cleared up. Anywho, I shall be expecting a visit from Mattius and Lesley-Anneous tonight. Fun as always. And my car needs petrol and I'm broke at the mo!!!! Damn expensive things.  Go and play in the fields of Barley my young learners. Life is too short to stare at a computer screen. Go. Go. GO! FUCK OFF!!!!

      Bonjour puppinos. Upon my visit to the cinema on Friday night I met a boy named Sean who one of our greatest friends had told us she had had a close encounter with. Well, me being me, I continued to question said Sean about the exploits. And it seems our not so great friend had told a few porkies. This Sean boy told me they had only kissed. No titties were shown and no bulge was felt.  However this may be his efforts to hide the humiliation of having had an intimate session avec "she's not that great" girl. I have put acroos both arguements and are letting you decide your story. On a lighter note, Simon Sladen walked past me today in Currys. Seeing as he works there that doesn't seem like a coincidence!  Also, my badge collection will be building as I will be recieving a 'Camerai' badge! I will be 'Camerai the Guest Relations Manager'! Thank You Hilton! Anyway. I shall allow you to continue with your lemming lives. Chow Chikidies!

      Apparently someone with a snoopy nose has written upon her blog spot some very interesting things about a German and some whos name no one can get right. Well I would like to say in retaleation... Shut up you evil whore! LOL.  Well have not the last few weeks been interesting?  Invasion from the Germans, film festivals all over the place, teachers becoming gangsters and Lauren Greatorex declaring her love for said German (Lukas) and said boy that no one can remember his name (Rob)... (whoops... Tom).  Last night I went with old friends to see the very funny 'Shrek 2'.&nbsp; Doesn't Jennifer Saunder's have an amazing voice! I never knew.  And I would just like to say now... letters are ok through my letter box, hence the name, but books torn in two, two Happy Meal Sonic games and a Tape entitled 'Crush' are a bit extreme. Bloody tards!  Anyway it seems my inspirational writing for one day has come to an end. So from me and myself.  Goodbye!

      It has come to my attention, I fear, that dear Mattoose is going insane with the lack of communication on our behalves. So I am here posting this blog on his behalf. Over le weekend I had two weddings to work at! The first one I was there for 13 hours till 4 in the morning!!! And it went ok. The cake tasted nice!!! And I found a sobre Irish man!!!!! RARITY!! Although he got drunk about 5 minutes later!!! Second day I had to stand in the ceromony!!! The only wedding I've been to and I didn't know anyone there! And I swear the groom was gay because he was the biggest ABBA fan!!!! How could you marry that? Anyway that cake wasn't as nice. A fruit one. I met a few Polish people, one called Mya and she was manly! One called Bart, he was funny! And one called something but he looked like Marco from BB!!!!! It was so funny darling! Anyway I must reply to a message I got from the scuzzyness that is Lauren! TTFN
