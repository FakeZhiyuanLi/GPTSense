      It's getting harder to concentrate on the work at hand, but that's not surprising.  Got my itinerary mailed off today to the folks, copied all my travel documents and put my shoes in for repair. Nice work I say.  The English guys finished up their IG cleanse today, they were a lot of fun, kept playing pranks on Daniel, putting stuff up for sale on the intranet. Rather amusing and they will be missed around the office. Had to wear my Birk's to work this morning cause I left my shoes at the office, too painful to walk home in.  But I'll break them in properly once I get back, nice shoes if they didn't hurt so much in the heal. I have a Hotmail account now as well, figured I had better be contactable by some method, seeing as you can't roam if you are on prepay, that sucks.  I had better be off, I'm supposed to be at the trinity bar by now for trivia, I'm running late.  Only one day to go at work.

      Tuesday was pretty much the usual, did I mention that Ada was back at work from her holiday, Michael is leaving to go to another job internally and Nick is heading over to our team on the 10th.  Methinks it will be a rather busy period. I also sorted out rent payment while I'm away which was a good move, otherwise it could have been a little embarrassing. Cell group was good, a new girl, Melody from Canada.  She lives down the road, but toward Redfern! not the nicest place to start living in Sydney. Read some more of that book today, still enjoying it, helps me as its written in a daily study type way which helps keep me a little more consistent. Wednesday tomorrow.

      Back to the Journals, the weekend has passed and a new week has started. Back at work, which was more of the usual, it will be interesting to see if I can get all my tasks completed by the time I head out. I started reading that Maxwell book I bought on Sunday today, week 1, the law of the lid.  Some interesting points of difference between David and Saul's leadership styles and effectiveness. ie "Paul mistook his position as king for real leadership...when God no longer favored him, he thought the title of king entitled him to continue leading" David was never afraid to admit his shortcomings  and ask forgiveness, and took opportunities to grow in his leadership.  The book is looking pretty good.

      Sunday was rest day, Church was good in the morning, and I signed up to pay touch with the Hillsong touch football team. The night services was really good, the message made me think, I got a copy so I could listen to it later, and give it to dad, so he can hear some of the teaching that we get over here.  I also bought a book called 'The 21 Most Powerful minutes in a Leaders Day' by John Maxwell, which looked like an interesting read/study while I'm away. They also had one of those hammer strength testers that you have to try to bang the weight upto the bell.  Not really very difficult but you need a little technique (wood chopping styles).  I managed it around 4/5 times in a row, apparently some dude managed to hit it 43 times in a row.  Now that is a good effort. The rest of Sunday I watched football on SBS and did washing, ironing etc.

      Saturday was a nice day. Played a little touch down at Bronte beach, and Andrew dropped me in Green Square. There are a few discount/outlet stores down there which I decided to frequent.  Bought a pair of shorts and a pair of pants for $55, not to bad. Then I picked up a Puma visor at the Puma outlet store on Botany road, $20.  Then Leanne and Chris picked me up from their and we wandered out to the outlet stores at homebush. We we cruising out there and in Leanne's car listening to some NZ music, very relaxing (if you weren't the one driving in the traffic). I then proceeded to get a pair of shoes for $149 and a woollen jersey for $69. A bit of retail therapy for my Saturday afternoon. We popped over to Daves place and said hello, he's up from Melb at the moment and had the little one (Grayson) making us skip and all sorts.  Got home in time to watch the Warriors scrape through 17:16 to a semi final against the Panthers. The Swannies lost their semi against Brisbane unfortunately.

      Friday, better day today. Of couse its Friday you say, didnt really get alot of work done today, but it was ok, got my coffee from City Grind in the morning and tried to get stuck in.  But other work cropped up that sort of got in the way with me finishing stuff off.    Had a look at my leave, looks like ill be a we bit in debit to the bank after my trip. No going home for Christmas after all, but Emma should be coming over for a while, so that will be good. Got all our tickets today for flights etc, very exciting. Got no tickets to the Warriors game on the weekend wich is a bit slack, hope they smash the Panthers, same goes for the Swanies.  Anyway, weekend looks like being a bit of a shop and a plan the trip weekend.  I need to see what I have got to take away, and whether I need to get anything extra to take away. Hopefully I'll get in a bit of touch rugger down at coggee on Saturday.  Well, I'm off.

      Whoops I missed a day in there. Oh well Wednesday was pretty uneventful.  Went out to trivia last night as per usual, we came in seventh which means we win a 6 pack of beer (between the 8 or so of us), and then Leanne (Chris's new flame) dropped us home and then stayed the night (with Chris).   Not really so kean on that, but it is Chris's life.  Leanne is a nice girl, very smart works with DNA, proteins, sugars and stuff, way beyond my 6th form chemistry class. Despite being smart etc, she's definatly not my type of girl. But apparently she's Chris's type, or perhaps they both just need each other at the moment. Chris, doesn't really confide a great deal in me, in this case I think perhaps he thinks my boundaries of Christianity would frown on his actions, and maybe they would. But saying that, in general he doesnt really discuss or convey how he's feeling, puts on a good front, but then I know that I do the same. What is it about communicating fears and problems with freinds and peers, it just doesn't seem to happen.  Maybe its just guys, and our macho, 'boys dont cry' persona, which we like to impose on ourselves, who knows. Today  at work was utterly mad. First up there was a fire alarm so we didn't even get into the building till around half nine, had a morning coffee and a chat outside. Then I started back at my standard job today, and received my work load right through to when I leave. Not happy.  I lost stuff, tried to get things done, things didn't work, etc etc etc.  Not the most pleasant of days, but I did pass my personal securities course which just leaves me the one course left to do before I leave. Michael (my boss) was a little odd, seems to be a little funny when dealing with some of the other guys at work.  I bit short with them, I don't know, but I can learn some things not to do when I manage others.  My work flow is a little high as of today and I have the grand sum of 5 days to move through it all.  I doubt I'll make it but I'll give it a go.  Not really worth getting stressed about. I have cleared my desk down for a clean start in the morning, so I'll hopefully be able to post at a more reasonable time tomorrow.

      Low key day today, ran a little late for work, had trouble with getting up after watching too much of Andrew Denton's show on TV. I really do like his interview style, and having Germaine Greer & Billy Bragg on the show was a bit different to the usual talk-shows on ASCII TV. Some interesting comments re: men, from Germaine Greer, apparently all men hate women in some way or another? or at least that's what I heard her say, not 100% how that works out.  Passed that training module at work today after getting a little bit of shared input on the questions, 88% will do me fine. Also finally paid the rent (due last Friday!) which is probably a good step, still need to find out how we can continue to pay the rent while were away overseas though.  We'll Chris should be back this evening so we'll see if he's made any decisions regarding jobs, hopefully he's de-stressed a little anyway.  We have a new person starting over here on Jane's side tomorrow, which means tomorrow's my last day before going back to the old job, hopefully just to clear my desk before I go away (unlikely I know, but dreams are free).

      Monday, work day.  Still working over on Jane's side of the fence. I'll be over there till Wednesday, which will give me a week and couple of days to tidy things up before I go on holiday, nice. Paying for my trip today, well paying off the credit card which paid for the trip initially.  That means taking cash out of my savings A/C, but hopefully after payday I can boost up my savings to around the $3k mark, it'll make me a bit more comfortable about the trip.   Apparently there are no flights to Israel from Jordan on the day we fly in, hopefully we can get a flight across the next morning.  Trying to get in overland is, apparently, not a particularly pleasant exercise, so we'll try to avoid that if possible.  Also I hope the places to stay in Israel all work out too.  Staying with people is definitely the best way to get a real experience from the trip. I probably should check with Chris to see if he has an update on those contacts (He's still out at his auntie & Uncles place in the burbs).  And finally for the day, looks like I have to redo some of my credit training before I leave as well. I've tried to go through it twice (I get three chances) and I have just failed so last time lucky. I'll leave it to tomorrow, and get some more input.

      Sunday was fairly quiet too (story of my weekend), Church in the Morning down at the City congregation.  Caught up with Ben and Andrew, I must have them round for dinner some time, nice guys.  Got home and watched SBS's football show, Chelsea is still in the news after apparently trying to buy Sir Alex Ferguson from Man U (this was  urlLink denied  of course), and they beat spurs 4:2 over the weekend. Church again on Sunday night, the Hillsong USA tour team played at church tonight, very powerful stuff.

      Saturday, was supposed to go play touch down at Bronte Beach, but it was raining a fair bit on Friday night, so I assumed it would be raining on Saturday morning.  I assumed wrong. It was a very nice morning, and I slept in and missed touch.   I did head down to Glebe Pt markets later on in the morning. I really do like those markets, a few odd people around but such a cool vibe. I bought an old Ronson lighter at the markets for $8, I have no need for a lighter, not being a smoker, but its quite cool. It has a different action, I guess I'll use it to light the stove as the gas auto-lighter doesn't work. We have been using books of matches 'borrowed' from various pubs around the place to light the thing. Had a rasberry bagel and a coffee at a local cafe after the markets. I dont know that the bagel was really much of a bagel as such, really more like a danish I guess, It was tasty though.  The other major event on Saturday, the mighty Warriors triumph over the rather pitiful Bulldogs.  Francis Meli running in a record 5 tries in a final's match. Next stop the Panthers I think.

      Friday night was a relatively quiet one, had a beer at work with the usual folks, and cruised round to Nick’s place for a bit of a feed. Picked up Gangs of New York at the video store on the way. GNY wasn’t too bad; it was fairly violent and lacked a wee bit of cohesion. Not really what I was expecting, not that I really knew what I was expecting, but anyway, doesn’t make it anywhere near a favourites list.  Probably missed a bit in the lack of big screen impact.  My flatmate Chris is spending a few days out at his Aunty & Uncles place.  I think he’s feeling a little stressed at the moment, about finding a job etc. He’s got a couple of decisions to make regarding a job offer and this has made him a little anxious so he wants a little family support. Decisions, decisions, decisions.

      So the Aussies won the boxing day test, oh well I guess they deserved it, the Indians crumbled in both innings, after reasonable starts.  But the series is one all, so bring on Sydney and Steve Waugh's last test I say.  Not much planned for New Years Eve, probably have a fairly low key night, and enjoy the day off on Thursday.  What a pain having to come into work on Friday.  Had an interesting read today in an article in the AFR about Roman Abramovich of Chelski fame.  I'm pretty happy with the way the team are traveling, and I'm interested to see what will happen when the transfer market opens up.  Hopefully they can firm up the mid or/and back field a little, to stiffen up the defense and help them through some of the injuries.  The article focused on the whole Russia, Billionaire, Governor, Oligarchy situation.  Really quite interesting, I spent a few minutes on google hunting down a few articles on him.  Maybe I'll mention something tomorrow.  Reading a book at the moment, Scarecrow by Matthew Reilly, personally I think its a fairly lame read.  The action is way over the top, like something out of one of those plot-less Hollywood action movies.  The plot in this is pretty tacky, I'm a little over the idea that a small group of people can control all the major events occurring on the globe.  After working in a large company and seeing the difficulty they have getting things done, the organisational nightmare that running the globe (secretly) would be, makes it seem a little unrealistic in the least. I can understand someone influencing global (and local) politics, but controlling it right down to the details, and all the interactions that occur, I doubt.  But then again, after reading the article about Abramovich and his partner Berezovsky and the level of control wielded by the Oligarchy over Yeltsin, then getting Putin elected. Maybe the book is just a little over the top, not necessarily crazy.  Russian politics appear to be a little dodgy, but I don't think that should surprise me.  Super 12 starts up again in five or six weeks, time to head down to the Wallaby bar to watch the mighty Blues take on all comers. How nice is it that the rugby season starts so early.  Pretty hard on the players but great for the fans.  And finally, after the effort against Portsmouth, Chelsea fans say bring on Liverpool.

      Hello, I've been rather absent for a while (maybe three-ish months), initially it was because I was traveling, then I just got lazy.  But now, freshly motivated after Christmas I'm back blogging and trying to get back into the habit.  The trip was fantastic, had a great time traveling around, particularly the Middle East (Jordan & Israel) section. The wedding in Ireland was also great, approximately three days of drinking, apparently the only thing to match an Irish Wedding is a Wake! Had a few little adventures during the trip, Chris's bags didn't ever get off the plane after the first leg to Amman, and then my bag was stolen off the bus from Tel Aviv to Beersheeva the day of Yom Kippur. And then there was the expected security, suprisingly it was more difficult going through the security getting out of the country than getting in.   Since then I've also been back to New Zealand to see Reub's & Kylie get married off.  This, while being completely different to the Irish wedding, was really good.  Great to see those two get hitched, even though I was pleasantly surprised that Reub's made it without any trouble.  Christmas is the time of year, very warm here in Sydney. The Christmas party at work was amusing, Nick had a fair amount to drink and amused us as did Daniel who was somewhat more restrained but fun none the less.  I spent Christmas out in the suburbs with my flatmates family, a whole pile of them were over from NZ for the occasion.  That was nice, had a good celebration, I ate and swam my way through the day.  Not quite as good as being with the family, but defiantly a good alternative.  Chris seemed happy enough with the present, and I got away with chocolates for the rest of the folks.  A bit lazy I know but what's a guy to do? I really should send some stuff back to the family in NZ but I get the feeling I probably wont get round it.  Today, back to work thank goodness its fairly slow.  Apparently Sony Music & BMG are going to merge, interesting.  With the slowdown in the industry the major savings will be the merger of back office functions in the combined entity. Hopefully this will improve the likely hood of an I-Tunes Music Store opening up in Australia, but I guess we'll have to wait & see on that one. I wonder what the impact will be at the local Sony office here?  And India is chugging along slowly in the cricket after what was a great start initially, here's hoping they can put up enough of a lead to make life difficult for Australia.

      Can't spend too much time on this as I have to head off to Cell group.  Still no distance made on the AC Parma shirt, was a little busy today.  Went down and met all the CPM folks.  Tomorrow's the big day.  A new system got rolled out today, doesn't seem like the most useful of tools, but we'll give it some time.  I'm still fairly skeptical regarding the impact on the music companies suing music downloaders, or as I found out yesterday, apparently they have only sued people who have provided music for download, not those who have actually downloaded files. An interesting aspect which the press doesn't seem to focus on.  The Kurds seem to be in a little bit of a tough position regarding getting their own autonomous state.  I can't see the US or the Iraq administration agreeing with any sort of deal that leaves Kirkuk, or much else in Iraq in the hands of the Kurds.  Spent most of the day mucking round with a settlement issue. Customers can be a little pushy and odd at times.  Sometimes their requests just don't make sense & are un-necessarily complicated. Oh well they do pay my bills.  Yay payday tomorrow, but most of it will go on bills.  Apparently flights to NZ have decreased in cost, I'll have to have a look this week. Maybe I'll book a flight home for the family reunion.  Well see.

      Editing my blog... Once again I have been slow to keep my blog updated.  My resolution in this area doesn't seem to be going so well, but I have excuses.  Excuses, Excuses...  Touch started up again on Wednesday last week, and we won again and I scored a try, which was good. Apparently we are coming 2nd on the table (second due to the points difference), and we have another 4 weeks of round robin games to go.  So we are pretty well set up for the next rounds, we just have to concentrate hard for the future games to stay on top.  Chelsea haven't done so well recently, drawing with Birmingham on the weekend.  At least Man U lost to Wolves, so Arsenal are back at the top of the table.  Disappointing from the Blues considering the fact that they appear to have played well in their FA Cup match against Watford mid-week. But I guess Watford aren't what you call serious competition.  I have a new little amusement idea.  I want to get a 2003/04 jersey from the Serie A team AC Parma. They are owned (for the moment) by Parmalat who have pretty much gone bankrupt and are now trying to sell the team.  Accounting scandals galore. I have an odd sense of humour but I think it would be funny to have a shirt with a big Parmalat across the chest. Looks like I'll have to fork out around $80 odd bucks for it but it would be worth it.  Thursday was a bit of football action with the guys on levels 8 & 9 out in the domain. A good crack. I scored a couple of goals and had a good run around.  I have got myself some new shoes for touch, some Puma's with a fairly well defined tread, however they are probably around a half a size too small.  They do fit, they were the last ones in the store and they were what I was after.  They were fine for touch on the Wednesday, but after Thursdays soccer match my feet were killing me.  Not too sure why, maybe kicking the ball around etc did a bit of damage.  I've bruised my big toe under the toenail which is a little painful, and I think I pulled a muscle on my thigh. I'll have to stretch well this Wednesday to make sure I don't hurt my leg anymore.  Saturday we didn't make it to touch, I had sore feet still and Nick was heading out to the beach, so Chris & I tagged along. We headed out to Maroubra, which is one of my favourite beaches in Sydney.  I really do rate it. We mucked around there before heading back to the city and doing a little cheap shopping at the outlet stores in Alexandria. I picked up a Mossimo shirt for $30.  I think I will probably get away with wearing it on Fridays at work, otherwise its a nice casual shirt. Chris picked up a whole lot of stuff for around the same price he had paid for one shirt he had lost while overseas.  Guy did an unusual thing for me last week, based on my review and career plan he went down and had a talk with the managers in CPM and got me a spot there once a week for the next month.  So starting Wednesday I'm down in CPM for the day. I'm heading down tomorrow to go through the introductions.  I'm very stoked with that, and somewhat surprised as I haven't ever seen Guy organise something like that.  He just went off and did it.  He has surprised us up here, perhaps he's not as bad as we often think.  It's very good for me I think, if it goes well we might be able to make it last a little longer, setting me up for any jobs which may come up there.  Church was good on Sunday, I went along in the evening too which was good.  Got myself signed up for Discovery 1, which is a basic Christianity class, but I've never done one and there is power in the process.  I am trusting God to help me get maximum value from the time.  The only downer is that it's on Thursday nights, which means that I'll have to postpone Football on Thursdays for a few weeks once that starts off on Feb.  Still considering heading home in Feb for the Chamberlin 150 year reunion, would really like too, I might have close to a day's leave accumulated by then which would be nice.  I could get in 3 days (Fri, Sat & Sun), a trip down to the Island and I could catch up with Emma who is back from her trip to the Philippines and hear how that went too.   Closer to now is this weekends trip to Melbourne.  I got my e-ticket all sorted through work and I have a ticket to the tennis on Monday night with Daniel & Nerida. I'll have to check with Dan that I can still crash at his brothers place.  The next day I'll head off to this web course for work and then fly home. That reminds me I had better book in a website meeting for Thursday to update and make it look like we've done something.  I'm going to print out my bible in a year readings to date and start going through them.  I think I should try and look up a study guide as well because I need to get more insight from the word.  Anyway I've written a small book today, over and out.

      How difficult is it to get a new calculator?  Trying to get an HP12c Financial Calculator for a reasonable price is like pulling teeth.  I had a look in a store today and they had it for AUD220!! Extortion. Even in Australian online stores it was priced at around AUD190.  On Amazon US buyers can get them for around USD67, which is around AUD83. Plus shipping I would expect to pay around AUD100.  But Amazon wont ship electronics out of the US. Why I don't know, but they wont.  Last time I bought one in NZ it set me back around NZD160, a far more reasonable price than in Australia.  Why the massive price? It's an old piece of technology that has surely paid back its initial investment, why so steep, and why the disparity of price between the US & Australia? I'll have to figure something out, to get one from the US for a reasonable price (particularly with the way the exchange rate is at the moment), maybe I'll resort to eBay.  Also that new cannon digital camera looks nice (Ixus i, or SD10 or such like), no veiwfinder but so small and 4MP for under AUD500, very nice.  No real action today, just settlements kicking off again.  Didn't see the bus girl this morning, must have left at the wrong time. Work is still a bit of a struggle, sunburn still hurts, but I think the solarcane is good for it.  Ada was back at work today, Guy seemed to be a little funny over the fact that she had the day off yesterday (because she flew in in the morning). Seems a little pedantic if you ask me. She bought back a couple of DVD's, I ended up with a copy of 'The Recruit', so I'll have to watch it on Chris's computer monitor & then I might swap with Nick & Dan to see some of the others.

      Well well, I'm cream crackered (knackered) at the moment.  I spent yesterday up at Avoca beach on the Central Coast, lay on the beach, played some golf and had dinner at Daniels folks place.  As per usual my golf was rather terrible, I was going ok on the short holes, averaging 1 over par, but the longer holes blew out a touch.  I think if I want to take it seriously I will need to get a couple (understatement) of lessons. I got rather sunburned from lying out on the beach over the hot part of the day and am feeling it today.  I went out at lunchtime to the chemist and picked up some solarcane, hopefully I can stop it peeling and maintain a tan for the summer, we'll see I guess, for the moment its just a little painful. Got back from the coast at around 11:30 ish, and we were all a little tired today, so I (the whole lot of us) didn't get a lot of work done.  Saw that cute girl from the bus again this morning outside Wynyard station, still cute. She must have caught the bus two back after mine.  Still don't know what to say anyway.  Friday's news; I am an uncle all over again. Caleb George Chamberlin - 9 ½ Pounds. Apparently the birth was very quick (3 hours) for quite a large sized baby, and Bec & baby seem to be doing well. All good.  Mum would like me to come back over for the Chamberlin Family Reunion in Feb.  I would like to go but I've got to find the cash.  I've got no leave available, but I could go for the weekend. I'll have to see if my insurance pay-out comes through.  In relation to the insurance issue, my assessor came round on Friday night, which is why I couldn't blog after work as per usual, to check out my claim.  I had to sign a statutory declaration relating to the loss, and they took a form allowing them access to any flight records that the airlines might have.  I think they wanted to see if I checked in any major luggage after I had lost my bags, which I didn't because I didn't have any. Should be just a formality.  I am interested to see how much they decide to pay me out though.  After spending a couple of days on the beach (I went down to Bronte on Saturday afternoon (didn't get sunburned)), I had a look at a fair range of the women on display (as you do). And came to the conclusion that a lot of women have a very similar body shape, implying you can, and should weigh further toward the personality. What is different is often how she holds herself, rather than looks per se.  But then Avoca had a lot of older women out on the beach, and there were significantly greater differences between the features and body shape of older women than the differences between younger girls.  Possibly explaining some of the reasoning behind the younger woman, older man scenario.  Even from my age, younger women are more consistently attractive than women my own age, or older (consistently being an important word in this conjecture). Something to think about anyway.

      Kiora,  Forgot to bring in a few extra clothes to play football in, must remember for next week, maybe I should put it in my diary.  Spent the day slaving over a securities packet with Jane, still have a whole pile more to complete on it, what fun. I did get a whole pile of financial extractions out today, which got a pain in the backside out of the way.  Saw a really nice girl on the bus this morning, dark hair, brown eyes, nice figure.  I'll have to see if she's out tomorrow.  No nice I just didn't know where to go from the glances stage.  I'm crap with chicks. But I was glad that Guy had us wearing ties and stuff today for the new boss, turns out I didn't get introduced anyway, but it had another use.  Paul at work won an ipod today as well lucky little so & so, but good prize.  Out.

      Wednesday but no touch today, that starts up again next week (14th), but I will head out and play a little football with some of the guys from work tomorrow afternoon.  Need to get out for a bit of a run around, particularly before touch kicks off again.   Slow day, spent most of my day on one set of financial's, have to work back through around 5 years worth, and now I only have one more year to go, yay. Looking forward to finishing off these ones, they have taken me a fair while.  At macworld, or whatever its called, Apple released their mini ipod today, it holds 1000 songs and is a fair bit smaller than mine.  That said, I've never complained about the physical size of my ipod, and my 4-5,000 songs should keep me going for a while. I only have around 980 on it at the moment.  I need to get a computer with firewire, and get ahold of some more music.  Also those G5 xserves are beautiful looking machines, I wouldn't mind one of those to complement a nice powerbook, but that's all dreaming for the moment.  Booked a flight to Melbourne today, turns out Daniel and Nick are going to be down there for the tennis, so I'm booked in to go down a day earlier and catch an evening of the Australian Open.  Fantastic, I've never been to watch tennis before so I'm looking forward to it.  Got a couple of emails from Emma in the Philippines the other day after a call from the folks.  Nice to see she's well and the ministry on the trip sounds great.  So long as she keeps out of the trouble spots, I'll be happy. Apparently all she heard regarding the mud/landslides on Mindanao was news coverage so they can't be too close to them.  The SMH story ( urlLink Body found in garbage bag in Surry Hills ) was about a body found on Reservoir St, just round the corner from our old place, and where Mike & Simone still live.  Pretty nasty and a touch to close to home.

      No real major's today.  Should be heading down to Melbourne later on in the month for some training.  Not really sure if I should be going because I would really like to have a new job fairly soon, and I'm not sure I should be going and getting specialised training, then leaving. I might have to have a chat with the boss about that.  No news on the Job front, either they don't really like my application at all because they have other more experienced people applying, or they are a little slack. I guess time will tell.  Lots of speculation regarding Apple's announcements at Macworld this year, will we see a mini ipod? tablet imac? I cant afford my new laptop at the moment, so it really has very little impact on me.  But I like to keep track of it. What I would like to see is an iTunes Music Store for Australia, there have been various rumours but no action, Telstra was supposed to be in talks.  You would think it would have good synergies, boosting traffic on their broadband networks and encouraging people to get off their slow dialups onto broadband.  Had another look into jobs in Dubai, the more I look at it the more interesting an idea it becomes. I was talking with Daniel the other day and he was semi interested so I think I'll get together some details. The pay seems fairly healthy and the experience would be fantastic, providing the right job turned up.  I think the average contract length is around two years, which would suit me perfectly.  That would take me through to about 27, maybe to the UK after that for a couple more years till 29, then regroup and try to figure out why I'm not married yet!!  We'll that's on the cards, but I need to get the next job up here first, so I guess I keep plugging away until God opens up the opportunity he has for me.  Faith is pretty important for me at the moment.  As for the cricket, there is 15 overs remaining. Australia needs 152 runs to win, India needs 6 wickets... Looks like it will be a draw methinks.

      As mentioned last week, I thought I might add in a couple of New Years Resolutions/Goals to the mix to get a fix on positions and also to have something to reflect on at the end of the year, so;   New Years Resolutions,  details as follows (in no particular order):  1) Leave Australia - Probably to the UK, but main targets are as follows: UK, USA, Dubai, Hong Kong/China/Asia  2) Prior to leaving Australia - New job, in same firm but next level up to gain experience before leaving and, save some cash  3) Start investing in Sharemarket - US & Euro markets primarily (USD currently low against AUD) Tech stocks I like: Amazon, Ebay and Google when they list.  4) Purchase laptop - preferably 15" Powerbook, or more likely (cashwise) a 12" ibook, with wireless networking, max HD & plenty RAM etc  5) Purchase Digital Camera - love the cannon ixus stuff, and use the camera as much as possible before leaving Aus (get solid memories)  6) Get more involved in Church (also find new church in country that end up in) - possible as usher, moving chairs around etc, anything really  7) Follow news and current events better, keeping up to date & current (important for conversational skills)  8) Develop conversational skills and behavior in groups  9) Learn to dance - classical & latin classes  10) Give more - target is around $2.5k on top of normal tithes (around 5%)  11) Purchase Chelsea football jersey, and finally  12) Blog more consistently and better - try to add insights rather than boring stuff   I'll try and keep this updated as the year goes by to see how I go.

      New Post, had myself a bit of an up & down weekend, did very little Friday evening. I think I watched a TV movie or something, not very exciting.  Spent the most of Saturday at the Glebe markets, bought a hat ($10) and a new wallet ($18). The wallet is quite thin with a money clip, no bulky slot to stash cash, but I seldom have much of that to worry about anyway. The hat is plain white, I want to get some transfer's and put on a little logo based around the 2010 (twenty ten)postal code for Surry Hills in Sydney. I have been thinking about this for a while, now I have the hat I've got to do something.  The rest of Saturday was spent in front of the TV watching Steve Waugh's final test. India seem to be doing well, one more day to go, so we'll see what happens.  I'm a kiwi so naturally I would like India to win, but at the same time Steve Waugh is an absolute legend so I'd like to see him go out on a positive note too.  Saturday night I went out to the movies, saw Cold Mountain (Nicole Kidman, Jude Law et al).  I saw it by myself at Broadway.  I think that's the second time I've ever seen a film on my own/by myself (going to a theatre that is), I think I saw one of the Lord of the Rings episodes by myself because everyone else had seen it already. I don't really like going by myself at all, feel a bit like a loser.  The movie wasn't too bad, left me depressed though.  Felt pretty drained & empty with no motivation, if that's what the movie did to me I wonder what the books effect would be. Also when walking back home I felt oddly afraid, and as a general rule, Sydney does not scare me at all.  The only time I've felt genuinely uncomfortable was when I walked down part of Everly St in Redfern on a Sunday morning. I had no idea about Everly St (apparently its one of/the most dangerous street's in Sydney) but I felt very unsettled and turned around and walked back out. This time wasn't that bad, but I felt alone and exposed, and I didn't like that either. Possibly it made me question my faith a little. Clouding over what I believed was true, it blurred my perception of what I thought and what might be true in reality. All in all, it opened up a few possibilities which may have altered my approach to my life, maybe/maybe not time will tell, bring on April.  I think the questions it asked, left me questioning my faith, and to be fair, it wasn't the movie per-see, more a feature of the movie.  Anthony Migchella is not that impacting a director.  Overall the movie was ok, a little tacky maybe. Personally though, I thought Renee Zelwiger did a fantastic job, for me she was the most outstanding actor/actress in the film.  Anyway, I was going to put up some New Years Resolutions, but Ill do them on a new post

      Ahh, the Friday in between times.  Managed to be fairly busy today, despite the expectation of a slow cruisie day.   New Year's Eve was fun, when out to a friend of Craig & Vals place and pretty much just hung out.  Craigs best man, Tim & his wife (Shara) were there too, so it was nice to catch up (nb both of Tims sisters were very good looking girls) and overall I had a good evening.  Chris spent the day/night with his folks, but he turned up were we were rather drunk at around 2am ish. He proceeded to drink a little more and throw up on the terrace.  Not very pleasant. Chris & I cleaned up some of it and Val wipe up the rest. That was a bit of pain, but we left after that effort (at around 5am).  The next day was a write-off, I slept through till about 4:30pm, and did a little cleaning up around the place.  Found an interesting site today called  urlLink News Is Free  which seems to be useful, just has new stories that you can select from different sources round the world. I might set it up from my Outlook so I don't have to have a web window open all the time. It will be nice to have a whole lot of stories all together, much easier to skim read. I can also blog from it as well apparently, but I'll see how that works out.  The weekend planning is looking fairly quiet, Chris is out with his folks, or what's left anyway.  His mum decided to leave early because she had a bit of a spat with the family.  Hope its not to serious, apparently she does this from time to time, threatens to leave etc. Not nice, but Chris assures me it happens every now and then, however I think it contributed to the amount of alcohol he had to drink on NYE.  Anyway, I'm thinking I should develop a couple of resolutions for the coming year, like leaving Australia, getting a new job, moving house and maybe some personal development ones too, while the new year is fresh.  I'll have a think over the weekend and update my blog on Monday.

      New guy at work today (actually from yesterday) replacing Paul's position.  Senait was supposed to be taking that position but the powers that be decided otherwise.  He has got a masters in finance from Massey & his undergrad is Hons in finance from Waikato U.  Well and truly over-qualified for this type of position (in my opinion).  Spent the whole day teaching stuff, and having him follow me around and ask questions.  Pretty good questions though, so it's not so bad.  Ben's not going to be at the game tomorrow night, so we'll probably end up with just the one sub.  Big game though so concentrate, concenrate and give all out.  Cooked a mean meal last night, Mint and Feta Rice & Salmon in Lime Ginger Sauce, from  urlLink mealsforyou.com , very tasty, very easy, then watched Billy Connelly on Tour, that guy is very very amusing.  Such interesting bits and pieces.  I've got to go work out what to have for dinner tonight.  Looks like some baked Chicken Grecian Salad, & maybe a bit of apple crumble too.  I'm feeling a little peckish

      Monday Blog time.  Well what happened on the weekend, Friday night was pretty low key, spent the evening at work having a couple of free drinks then had a coffee with Senait & Tiffany, met up with Chris and picked up Senaits friend from central station, then went home.    Before I forget, on Friday morning I sat next to that nice looking girl on the bus again, I still couldn't get up the guts to say anything.  What a lame duck.  Saturday, I played some touch in the morning, stinking hot, hot, hot.  But the run was worth it.  After that hit the markets for an hour or so, Chris was after some shorts, but he ended up getting some from Broadway.    Lawn bowls was the order of the afternoon on Saturday, Bronte Bowling Club was the venue and Craig, Val, Kitty, Amanda & Fiance (cant remember his name), Jeff, Chris, Eric, Dave & G/F (once again, the name escapes me), and a few others were the players.  In particular was this stunning girl Krystal who was a friend of Amanda's. Apparently she had been a model in her late teens/early twenties (probably mid/late twenties now).  Very good looking girl, she was also pretty smart too.  Turns out she is a market researcher for CCA (Coke etc), so definitely got some smarts.  It was a bit sad to see all the fawning, but it wasn't too bad I don't think.  Hopefully I wasn't too bad anyway, I only spoke to her for a few minutes, but I'm not really to concerned anyways.  Later on Kitty had had a few and was telling me that I should try my hand at modeling.  I'm still interested in giving it a go, but I'm still waiting for an opportunity. It's been in my mind since that other Irish girl mentioned it back during the world cup.  Funnily enough there was another model there that night too, go figure. Saturday night ended up at the Royal Randwick and Thairiffic at Randwick Junction.   On Sunday we had this guy Casey Treat speaking at church.  Very good message, I ordered a copy of the message and the Saturday night message as well for good measure.  I also checked him out again in the evening, still good.  Also bought the new Hillsong united album & DVD.  How good is that DVD, very cool shots and very well put together highly recommend.  Major let down of the weekend, Blues going down to the Brumbies and the Crusaders downed by the Warratahs.  Craig had a field day, and I got a call from Nick & Robbo at around 1:30am on Sunday morning, then again at around 9:30 Sunday morning regarding the performance of the Aussie teams.  Nasty piece of work.  My tipping ended up at 13 pts, I must have picked the South African games a bit better than the kiwi ones to get those. I think I may plan to be a little lower key next weekend.

      Gave a little blood this morning, little being particularly accurate.  I think they made a bit of a mistake and the needle wasn't in the vein correctly, or at least wasn't put in correctly and some air got in the line and the blood wouldn't flow properly. I think I ended up only managing to give around 80 mls which is no use at all.  I couldn't even get enough blood out for the tests, of which I have a lot.  Apparently I don't have a common virus (usually picked up from animals/pets etc) which can be particularly harmful to baby's.  So despite having grown up with heaps of animals and pets I have good blood. Nice to know, pity they cant get it out.  Apparently I can go back to try again in a couple of weeks.  I went through the  urlLink waitangi test  yesterday, I scored 5 from a possible 12. Not a good score, but pretty average from the looks of the  urlLink graphs .  Interesting to find out how little the Maori have actually been given, but I would like to see some stats on what has happened to the money, and how much is left for future generations (whether in cash, investments, assets (including cultural & historical assets), I tend to think there is a general concern that the money may get misappropriated or badly invested through the tribes, perhaps less than transparent, management systems.  An interesting quote from Paul Saffo regarding Steve Jobs;  urlLink "Steve Jobs is virtually alone (as someone) who has deep credibility in Silicon Valley and deep admiration in Hollywood"  This goes someway toward explaining how ITMS got the support of the music industry.  It would be nice if they could pull it off over here in Australia, but that has yet to occur.

      Weblogs, what's news. Missed out on a  urlLink riot  on Sunday, mildly disappointed to be honest I've never seen a real riot. 'Mildly disappointed' because I'm not really sure that I want to get too close to the whole thing, because of the violence, rock & brick throwing deal.  Apparently 40 or so policemen were injured.  One of the girls from cell group lives down by 'the block', it will be interesting to see what she has to say tomorrow.  All in all though, it would be nice to move away from this particular area of town, methinks.  Other than missing the riot at the end of the street and it being another valentines day the weekend was good. Checked out the NZ Breakers playing basketball against the Sydney Kings.  We lost but they played ok.  Once again I have found that live sport is far more interesting than TV replays, the basketball was quite watchable live (although I had seen it once before at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney).  Sunday arvo after church (Vision Sunday) I went down to the NSW Art Gallery with Craig Val & Chris, which was very nice way to spend the afternoon.  Better than watching Chelsea get beat by Arsenal I bet.  At least it was only the FA Cup (Although it is very sad still, I don't like to see them lose) not the Premiership.  We lost at touch last Wednesday too, that makes twice in a row so I'm not sure if we've made it into the semis this week or not. I guess Ben will let us know soon enough. Its late enough now, I'm off home.

      I am exhausted. Flew back in from NZ this morning. The plane was running around three hours late. Apparently it had left Santiago four hours late, and got into Auckland three hours late.  The plane ended up leaving at around 9:30am rather than 6:00am as scheduled. The train from the Airport then proceeded to be delayed on my way to work as well, but by that stage I was beyond caring too much. I got mum to call work to let them know that I was going to be late. I ended up getting in at around 12:00 midday. I did the usual, stuff to declare line trick.  Legit as I had been out at a farm, but I cant believe they don't xray your bags if you declare stuff, very odd.  The 150 year Chamberlin family reunion was good. Michael McLeod turned up to the dinner on Friday, I haven't seen him for around six years since he went up to Canada to live. Apparently he's been back in NZ for around four months, he's staying down in Coromandel with Brian and the family. I hadn't seen Brian for a fair while either, so it was really good to catch up with all the folks. Church was also good, Elevator are no more by the looks of things but the rest of the church is going well, Brent Cameron spoke at the evening service, and he was really good.  Powerful stuff.  I really want to go home now, so I'm off.

      Why am I concerned about getting more responsibility? Is it just because we get no recognition or reward in relation to it? Or is  just change that I don't like.  Our new task flows came out today and we are responsible for a whole series of things now.  Great can't wait (note sarcasm). Off to play touch.

      What camera to buy Grove, what camera to buy myself? Questions questions . I'm looking pretty closely at the Ixus i, it's small, 4MP, and cool, but I think I might prefer a camera with a viewfinder, despite the fact that these small cameras generally have only 70% accuracy through the viewfinders. For Grove & Becs I assume a bigger camera with a viewfinder will be more useful & less likely to be lost or broken. Was thinking maybe an Ixus II 3.2MP camera. Nice & small but solid and good feature set, it gets some pretty good reviews.  Work hasn't been too great today, I got through a wee bit of work, which is good but still a fair bit of securities work to go, and more stamping issues this afternoon which is not much fun at all.  Also Phil is a little busy tomorrow so I can't go downstairs till next week, slack. On the upside my ticket confirmations came through, cell group is starting up again tonight and I will be able to go to the Discovery 1 course at Church on Thursday night.  Sharon appears to be reasonably serious about moving settlements out of the Gaza Strip, interesting to see how much conflict that sparks up. Blair has made it through the Hutton review, Bush has started a review, and Frank Cicutto has succumbed to the pressure at the NAB. Some interesting news for the week to keep track of in the future.  Just having a look at a nice little Nikon camera as well, too much choice. I'm off to cell group now.

      Well I seem to be having a little trouble with the consistency of my blogging, perhaps I need my own computer at home? I walked past the apple store in Glebe on Saturday and was sorely tempted to purchase an ibook or powerbook. But I held back from the temptation.   Last week was pretty cool, had a nice weekend, spent Saturday morning (24/01) up at powerhouse retreat on the central coast. I only caught the morning session, but it was really, really impacting. Went out to see The Last Samurai on Sunday night, not a bad movie made me want to go home.  Flew to Melbourne on Monday (Australia Day) and hooked up with Daniel & Nerida. Did a little shopping, but I didn't find anything that I really liked except for some pants that were the wrong size.  Monday evening was the tennis (Australian Open), we saw Roger Federer beat Leyton Hewitt. It was a really good game to watch with lots of long rallies and stuff.  It was heaps better to watch than I thought.  Oddly enough I have been watching the games on TV since and enjoying them a whole lot more since watching it live. The final was on Sunday, and Federer won (and is now World No. 1) over Marit Safin.  I would have liked to see Safin win. I rate him, but Federer is really good.  The Tuesday was the Create It training course which was ok, pretty straight forward, I caught up with Mark Ingram for a coffee while I was down there which was good. He's very excited about what I going on in his work, but a little tired too. Spent Wednesday in CPM again, enjoyed it immensely I really would like to get my way into a job there. I met Chris's new excitement on Thursday after soccer, another Kirsty.  Looks a little similar to the old Kirsty, not really but just in a couple of details (Nose in particular) he's got a bit of kick for her, but we'll see what happens.  Apparently her current on again, off again boyfriend has a ferrari & 3 houses, I think Chris thinks this may be quite steep competition.  Particularly as he came home with on the P.A.'s from his work on Friday night. A bit of a mistake methinks, not good form. I'm off home to NZ on Friday, finally booked in my flights today, couldn't get a decent priced deal for leaving on Thursday evening so I leave on Friday and come back on the Monday morning for work.  I'm flying Lan Chile, which is not the best airline but for AUD377 it wasn't a difficult decision.  Oh well seeing as I'm pretty much up to date, and Chelsea have beaten Blackburn 3-2, and got themselves Scott Parker, it might be time to go.

      26/27 Feb 2004 - A late night conversation with God:  God has always given me things pretty clearly while under the cover/anointing of my Family. I went through High School with no real plans for the future, just an idea that I might like to snowboard a fair bit.  Then he gave me a prophesy when I was around 16/17 years old (Steve Blackmore, from Napier/Hastings (I think) was who he spoke through). That message essentially contained a series of words that said that in the future I would travel a lot. It was this prophesy that I based my decision to apply for AUT's (AIT then) BBus in Travel & Tourism. This course was a very popular course (as I found out later) and my mid term/end of year internal results were not good enough to land me a place in the course. My end of year Bursary results were adequate for the degree, but I didn't take them in.  So I started on the Dip Bus doing an accounting paper & an economics paper of all the subjects, and I enjoyed it, shocking. From their I switched to the degree course as previously planned, however instead of travel & tourism I ended up majoring in Accounting & International Business.  Uni was good, and God blessed me, I ended up with a couple of trips to Europe, work experience, APEC & NIBS competitions etc and a couple of scholarships.  At the end of the course I had to do some work experience, I was saying 'I'm happy to go anywhere except Australia, it doesn't count'.  But the open door God provided was to Australia, oddly enough.  So for the first time I left to live away from home for the first time (long term). Spiritually it has not been my strongest time.  Moving out from under the natural protection of you family and home church was difficult.  God provided a good work environment in Newcastle with Colin being very good and helpful, he treated me as a friend, rather than just an employee, he had me round to dinner a couple of times while I was there. Then he offered me a job. In hindsight I think that perhaps it was God providing the opportunity through Colin. I would have learnt a lot from him, and I could have paid him back for some of the input he had put into me.  Instead I thought I knew what God wanted, and I thought he couldn't really want me in Australia, and certainly not Newcastle (despite the fact that he had obviously placed me there). I walked away because I thought I knew where I wanted to be, and that wasn't in banking. Did I think I knew something God didn't? God had deliberately and specifically placed me in Newcastle, and I walked away.  My thinking was that Newcastle wasn't a recognisable city in the worlds economy and wouldn't be much use to me, on top of this I was of the opinion that I should be getting out of Australia as fast as possible. Not listening much was/am I. He kept me in Uni for 6 years, now I wanted to be out of Australia in 6 months.

      Hideho bloggers,  Russell Browns Hard News was good yesterday, rather classic story re: Carlos Spencer.  Wish he would kick like that for the All Blacks.  Today's been a little of a practical joke day. I got caught out a couple of times by Daniel, amusing fellow that he is. Right while I was helping him with a spreadsheet too. Freddo Frogs were good tho.  Found myself wide awake the other night and had a few insights and home truths spoken to me by God.  Changes your point of view somewhat.  I'll write down the gist of what he told me tomorrow as I have it written down in a book at home.  Was out for dinner on Saturday night at the Casino (Pyrmont Seafood & Steakhouse?) with Craig, Val, Tim (Perth) and his sisters & co, Jeff and a few others.  Nice night out, lost $60 on black (Roulette) between us as we had some cash left over once the discount had been calculated.  Oh well, that's the way it is when gambling. Craig had some news for me, apparently the nice girl from Bowling the other weekend (Krystal) had been asking who I was (to Amanda).  I've been keeping it quiet from Chris as Craig would like to see his reaction when he's told.  Personally don't think Chris will react too much.  Personally it's very flattering. She is a very beautiful woman and I would like to meet up with her to find out if she's as nice as she seems.  But we'll see, I'll have to find out from Val how interested she was, and a Phone number too if there's anything positive to report. Rather exiting, maybe. If nothing comes out of it, it was nice to be commented on.  Sunday night was the Hillsong recording, an excellent night at the Sydney Entertainment Centre.  It wasn't quite full, but there were a lot of people there.  Chris came along, which was nice.  Not much really going on with him and God, but it's in Gods hands not mine.  His timing is right. The mixed team also won the finals of the touch comp on the Sunday morning.  Great result. The team played very well, we could have used some of those guys in our team last Wednesday.  We lost our semi.  We were down one player for the whole game, and the other team had around four subs. We managed to hold it together till halftime (Score was around 3-1 in their favour at half time), we managed to get the score up to 3-2, however in the end we ran out of steam and went down about 8 or 9 - 2. Which is a little depressing, but we played well to hold them out as long as we did. Plus I had a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to next season.  Anyway, I have cell group and I haven't been for a couple of weeks, so later.

      Boss still not back today, I wait to see when she eventually gets back.  So more training today, woo hoo.  Saturday night was spent out at Bondi, having a rather large meal in celebration of Robbo's 26th. The feed was really quite significant, and the drinking that went along with it was generous, not excessive, but generous. A good time was had by all, unfortunately we ended up the the Palace in Coogee, which has never been a place I would choose to frequent. The sticky nature of the carpet underfoot is always a good sign of a rather nasty spot. One of the girls at the party was rather cute too, kate. What is it with me at the moment. Every weekend I'm off checking out girls in a far more serious manner than previously.  Got home at around 4am, in time to grab a few hours kip before heading off to Church. We are into week two of the six hot weekends building up to hillsong conference, and the guy who was speaking was really good.  And at the end I got invited to a cell group by this girl lisa.  Such timing, as my old cell group has just decided to go girl only. Which fundamentally means, I can't go. And this one is frontline also which I think will be a better age-group than the powerhouse cell I was in before.  Panthers game on the weekend was good, beating the bulldogs at the finish. I don't like the bulldogs, but I don't mind penrith, so go you good thing (I can't believe I just said that!).   “It's not easy, being green” -- Kermit the Frog

      Apparently the state of origin game was boring and lacked atmosphere I don't see how that is. The crowd must have been dead, because on TV I thought it was a decent hard game, not a lot of points but very high levels of commitment, even willie mason didn't play too badly. Not that it make up for being a loser. Watched the game up at the Clock, with Craig, Chris, Dave & Nicola. Nicola's off back to Ireland for the next three weeks I think, so we get to look after Dave and keep him out of trouble.  Still got very little work that I can actually do, sort of killing time till lunch which will be the usual, rice or noodles with two choices from the hunter connection, boring but decent for 5 bucks. Particularly as I'm looking to save more cash over the next little while, good luck to me. Still trying to work out how to use the Bloomberg computer I sit next to, seems rather complicated but has soo much information available through it. Pretty cool service, enough to make a fortune and NY mayor for some...  Just joined the risk management association, paid for by work of course. Might see if I can get myself into the presentation tonight: "David Murray - CEO Commonwealth Bank Group will speak on their views on risk management and related critical issues facing financial services organisations". Sounds interesting but I left it a little late to apply methinks, time will tell.  My musing today is over banking as a whole, The idea that firms borrow due to the relative cost of borrowing in the debt markets is lower than the public/equity domain. The how do banks make money, when supposedly firms make more money by using debt, but banks also have equity contributors. These contributors want returns above the interest rate, however banks lend at the interest rate? and other firms should be making more than the interest rate in returns because otherwise people wouldn't invest in them? A little simplistic I know, but an interesting question nonetheless, I think.   "Simulations are like miniskirts, they show a lot and hide the essentials" -- Hubert Kirrman

      Fifty grand fine for Gasnier, finally a club that's taking this stuff seriously, pity the bulldogs can't just tape up willie masons mouth.  Today was really pretty quiet, did next to nothing but a bit of training. But found it a little hard to concentrate consistently, I'm sure I read the same page over & over & over... you get the picture. And as for pictures, none yet but I'm working on it. A bit disappointed with the fact I haven't been offered a trial of gmail, c'mon I know I haven't posted that much but still.  Though about purchasing some shares today, read some stuff about News Corp, which was interesting, and seeing as the US economy & USD appears to be on the way back up, they might be worth picking up. I've got all inspired but I'm still an overly conservative investor with around 80% of all my savings in interest bearing deposits. Not that 80% of my savings is a large amount, its just I should mix it up a little.  State of Origin 1 tonight, off to the clock to enjoy. Have no real interest in who wins as long as its a good game. NSW deserve to loose after all their stupidity. Cheers all and as per yesterdays quote ideas, this is perhaps apt considering the current conflict:  "The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence.

      Today's noteworthy updates, not a great deal but here goes...  Got a call last night after heading to the gym, apparently my current cell group is merging into another one, but its going to be a girls only cell, which perhaps unsurprisingly means I need to find a new cell. I'm supposed to be getting a call regarding a new cell but well see how it goes. I may take the opportunity to shift from powerhouse to frontline.  Debate on hard news was regarding the proposed (or not any more?) changes to the age of consent legalities.  All in all it sounded fairly sensible, but from the looks of the current existing legislation, what we have is pretty inconsistent and confusing. I think education in this area is pretty important both for teens and for their parents. But it doesn't look like many of the proposed changes will be heading through.  On on side I can see the reasons for uproar, regarding what may be seen as a slackening of the law, but at what point do you decide what is realistic and if you are going to create laws, are you going to enforce it and educate people regarding it?  Found a great site with reference material including quotes, so I thought I'd list a few of my favourites that I found today:  "History will absolve me." -- Fidel Castro  "If the nose of Cleopatra had been shorter, the whole face of the earth would have been changed." -- Blaise Pascal  "Everyone who enjoys thinks that the principal thing to the tree is the fruit, but in point of fact the principal thing to it is the seed. Herein lies the difference between them that create and them that enjoy." -- Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche  Might add one to my post from now on if I can find the time to keep up to date.  Last point of note; I think the gym may actually be working. I'm finding it easier to lift weights, and overall I'm happy enough with the result. Also feel pretty good for the increased fitness as well.

      Thought I might make a few quick comments about the weekend. Firstly, what happened in the rugby! The Crusaders were simply asleep for the first 20 minutes of the game. But I guess the comeback in the later stages of the game was a little more positive, particularly Andrew Mehrtens effort. He pretty much got on the field and stabilized the defensive line. Because of that he's made the possibles in the All Black trials which is good news for him and his personal battle to get back up. The rumours surrounding why he went into the slump in the first place arent too nice at all.  The FA Cup was fairly consistent with expectations, Man U pretty much controlled the whole deal. Would have been nice to see Millwall score a goal, I thought they deserved it after battling there way through the final. They worked pretty hard, and walked away without a great deal other than having turned up.  So other than the two losses it was a good night out with Dave & Nicola, Chris and a few of Nicola's friends. One of her friends was this mix/indian girl. She was really quite nice looking, very sort of structured/high cheekbones etc. Not sure how to describe her but sort of a proud look, not in a bad/arrogant way. But doesn't matter anyway, I just like to look.  I think I need to work a bit harder at the cash management side of things. The last couple of weeks I've ended up not having any cash left in the Sun/Mon/Tues before payday. Payweek is only a fortnight but I still can't plan it out properly, very poor effort. I think its because I'm trying to reduce my credit card bill, but I shouldn't have let it get out in the first place. And it makes saving a whole lot more difficult when you don't have spare cash to put into the savings account.  I need to look at getting some photos onto my blog, I got a shot of a really nice sunrise over central station which with a little cropping should look nice.

      The real problem here is where do I start? I haven't blogged for how long, I guess the dates down the side give me a fair indication of that.  The other question is why? Which I'm not sure If I can answer really, I guess I was lazy, busy or both, I think I sort of got stuck wanting to finish off the conversation with God session, but couldn't/didn't get it finished.  Anyhoo a lot of water has passed under the proverbial bridge since then, I have a new job, as does virtually everyone that I was working with in Property.   I'm now in credit and the job is far more interesting than the old one, and my new boss is really good. There was a few moments during the process where I was thinking I wish they would just tell me, but eventually they offered me the position.  Jo was my insider on this one, kept me in the loop and aware of most of what was going on. Apparently I was the only one they interviewed from the initial applicants and it was either me, or advertise externally and external recruitment is a bit more expensive I think. Plus I don't doubt that I can do the job fairly well, which helps. I've been here three weeks now, and I don't really have a lot to do, my boss is very busy and it is sometimes a juggle teaching me new things while also trying to get work out the door. So at the moment I'm waiting to go into a meeting with my senior manager, and then hopefully I'll get some new work from my direct boss later on in the morning. One of the more amusing things is that since I accepted the job up here, Ada tendered her resignation (her last day was on Friday), Daniel has accepted an internal job offer and finally Nick has also accepted an offer in a role similar to mine. That leave the new guy who started at the end of March as the senior member of the team. And the manager is going on holiday, oh well, I think I got out at the right time. My only issue with my new job is the salary, they offered me AUD44750, which is about 2k more that my previous job. I was expecting a little more so that was disappointing.  The most frustrating thing is that I didn't want to go into the job already unhappy, but when you get offered that it's hard not to get a little annoyed. But that hasn't been an issue really. The main frustration is that they (organisations) don't want to pay you what your worth in front, you have to turn around and prove them right for hiring you before they'll recognise you, despite the fact that that they know that you are good for the position. I guess it just means I need to get stuck in and push for an upgrade at my next review in 6 months. I guess we'll see how successful that is in time.  Since I last wrote I think I've been through a series of ups and downs, and I've managed to get out of the city on a couple of occasions as well. Over Anzac weekend Chris & I hired a car for the weekend and drove down the south coast, made it as far south as Batemans Bay after a bit of a tiki-tour around a few beaches on the way down. Spent the night in a hostel/caravan park in Batemans Bay and had an interesting evening with an English fellow (decent bloke) and a whole stack of 17/18 year old girls from Canberra. They were drinking a little, or a couple of them were, one of them seemed to latch onto Chris a little. She was a little funny, her old man worked for customs so she had apparently been living in the US and a couple of other places.  She was very proud of the size of her breasts and her bra, and proceeded to lift up her shirt to show us her bra. Not really very exciting when you feel like your about thirty in comparison. Anyway Chris was advised that her cabin was the second light down and that the door was open... I don't think he took up the invitation though, which is good. The next morning was the dawn service, in such a small town there were only a few people about, and the music was supplied by an ancient PA and a tapedeck. Then we went back and watched the ceremony occurring up in Sydney with the whole parade deal and about 20,000 people, quite the contrast. WE drove back up the coast, stopping back in at lake conjola (Lake, I think not!!) and staying the night at Berry to avoid being invited to a beach party at Batemans Bay, with more young girls.  The Monday was a nice little cruise up through Port Kembla, Wollingong then home James so that Chris could get to work for a few hours on Sunday arvo.  We'll that's enough, it's past five now so I'll have to continue my update tomorrow.

      How nice is it to be here at home, everything is pretty nice. The funeral was pretty good, for a funeral. Everyone was happy enough, and it was a good opportunity to catch up with all the relatives in one place.  The dinner afterwards was pretty good, a little Thai place in Te Rakau drive. Dad got up and had a little speak at the funeral. He spoke really well, it was amusing and delivered well. I think that even dad was surprised with how well it went. He was surprised at how much he enjoyed it. Apparently God had spoken to him about public speaking and that he was going to do a fair bit more of it.  There is a little dinner at the Dougs tonight which will be good. Nice to catch up with all the folks at church etc in one place.  I had to go renew my license today as well, I was supposed to head in afterwards to see liesje, but I was too slow so I couldn't catch her. I'll go in tomorrow, and I'll have to catch up with JM as well.  Once again no quote, they are at work.

      Have I ever mentioned how much I dislike airports. I don't really have a detailed answer as to why, but I really dont find them fun. Just waiting & waiting & waiting. I booked in for my flight, I arrived around an hour to early as I thought my flight was at 7:10am, it wasn't its at 8:10. So I lined up and started talking to this guy at the check-in and he first tells me that he cant do anything in the way of compassionate anything relating to the fact that I was going for the funeral of my grandmother. Thanks for that, I guess I'll have to write a letter.  Then he tells me that I'm too early, boarding doesn't start for another 10 minutes. 10 Minutes.... I was asked to leave and come back. What is with the complete lack of service in the country.  When I came back the lady that served me was far nicer.  I just tried to kill time by registering for gmail, however the computer I'm on is (a) very slow, and (b) very locked down. It doesn't run a supported browser so I got halfway through and it just stopped, I'll have to r\try again later when I get home.  No quote this time as I'm in the airport waiting for the plane.

      Well, I'm of to NZ tomorrow morning, a bit of work tidied up today nice effort, even if I say so myself.  The leadership training meeting was very good and I heard the quote below at the meeting, and I really quite like it.  I might write a little from NZ, and I'll definitely be taking advantage of the gmail account on offer.

      I almost bought some News Corp shares this afternoon, but I left it to late. The price rallied in the last half hour before close of trading. I'm a little annoyed with myself, my guess is that the slack might get picked up by the US market in the morning, that's what I think anyway. I should have got some at my target price of $12.50. Ohh well we will see what tomorrow holds. Maybe I'll get a few tommorrow... my first share purchase.  Brief stop in a the trinity bar last night, but no trivia. Just to say hi to Craig & Val, back from Ireland. I'm out to a leadership night at Hills tonight with the folks from cell.  I have decided to take my Snowboard to NZ with me, if I decide to go down to the mountain I look at getting some new boots then I think. Plus I need to get a new cell phone, I'm wondering if Paul will have an old one lying around that I can beg, borrow or steal. I think he had an old T28 around.

      Actual news today. I got a call from my mother last night, letting me know that my Grandmother had passed away at about 7:30pm (NZ time). I had understood that she was sick and when I spoke with Dad on Sunday night/Monday morning he said that she was pretty much unconscious, and not eating. I guess its for the best though, rather than carrying on and perhaps dying in pain, it wasn't a bad way to go. I have had to change my flight out of Australia to Saturday, and take another day of leave (I get 2 days bereavement leave) to bridge the gap through to my flight back to Sydney.  So I get an entire week in Auckland instead of 4 days.   I guess its sad to see her go, but at the same time its not really that sad. I think she wanted to go, seeing as Bapaa died back in the late 70's. I guess I should look at saying something at the Funeral on Monday.  The prayer night at cell was good, it was over at Lisa's place in Neutral Bay. Had a bit to eat at the Oaks and had a pretty good session.  Today my boss went shopping at Country Road as they were having a sale, and I decided to wander up. Big mistake, $119 later I got a nice pair of trousers and a brown belt to wear with my gray pairs of pants and jeans. Pretty happy with the price really, but I think I need shirts more than I need trousers. Maybe next time, or when I'm in NZ.

      Another pretty good day in the office. I'm actually feeling like I'm, (a) useful, and (b) getting through some of my work, both are nice feelings.  Less done today than yesterday but much of that is a function of how much time I can get with my boss.  Spoke with my mum this morning, apparently Granny is not well at the moment, she is now unconscious and not eating at all, so there is a real question as to how long she will last. Interesting to see if I have a funeral to go to when I'm in NZ as well. She is getting pretty old I guess, but its pretty sad. I think dad has been spending a bit of time out there with her, but she hasn't been with it for a while. I don't think that she has recognised dad for the last couple of weeks, so maybe its for the best. Her heart is still strong, and apparently poppa lasted around ten days with nothing but a strong heart.  No real news on the block, except for the useful little sandwich / toastie / jaffle maker we got from Bilo the other day, fruit pies and cheese & spaghetti sandwiches. mmmm. Also no gym today because I'm off to cell... see ya.   "Guns are only deadly if used for their intended purpose" -- The Onion

      Not a bad weekend in all, Friday night was good, had to leave on time, thus no blog. I went rock climbing with my new cell group from church, Or with some people from church anyway. Boxing was cancelled in the morning due to rain. I went in and trained anyway but it was a pretty lackluster effort on my part. Much less demanding if I've no one else to train with. On top of this I didn't get to touch on Saturday after going out after climbing and not getting in till 1:30-2am. And I didn't get to pilates this morning either, but I will head down after work today with Dan & Nick.  Saturday involved a sleep-in, a trip to glebe markets and then the Rugby. I caught the All Blacks game at the Novotel bar out at homebush, nice to see the boys show England a thing or two. Big Joe, running in for three tries, and my personal favourite, England not scoring a try in the whole series. The Australia game was a bit slow in patches. I was there with some work colleagues and I was the only one in Wallabies colours (I wore a Wallabies scarf that I had got at another corporate game a couple of years ago, it has had very little use). One of the other guys had a beanie but it was blue or something, with a little wallaby on it. So the others got a bit of a laugh out of me in my scarf.  Sunday was Church, I haven't been in town for the last couple of weekends so I had missed out on a couple of the six hot weekends speakers. But Sunday was number five, Alan Myer from Melbourne I think. He spoke really well, primarily on how both parents and people in power over us are never perfect and due to this we must manage the way we interact with them to limit the impact of their flaws on us. The first illustration was how Ham was cursed by Noah for not covering his nudity. Noah's flaw and Hams mis-management of that caused him to be cursed. So there is a paradox of leaders who were good/great men, but their weaknesses had significant impact on their sons/followers. Main verse was Ex 20:12 You shall honour your father & mother... that it may be well with you. Honour gives weight both to the positive aspects and to the negative aspects. By acknowledging the good things we allow them to be released in our own lives. By recognising the bad things you become able to understand/have healing, allowing you to grow and go past the inefficiencies of leaders/parents.  In closing, today has been good, I've got through a fair load of work so off to the gym for a bit of a release.

      Very stoked, I have been offered a gmail account from blogger, very cool. Now I just have to find a computer which I can access and open up the account on as work blocks the gmail site to stop me wasting all my time there I guess. How inconvenient.  No real time to comment much today as I have been busy trying to get a few photos off my Ipod for the weekend. Accomplished about 5 or 6 photos off, but now I've got to head to the gym for the pilates session. Adios.   "I used to think that the brain was the most wonderful organ in my body.

      What was it I was going to write about... something along the lines of what I've been learning over the last six months.  Over the last little while I've begun to come to the conclusion that I'm not bad looking, almost good-looking perhaps. It started after I came back from overseas, maybe even a bit before that. But people have been making comments occasionally about me and I guess I had never really considered myself to be very good looking before. In a bar during the world cup there was a kiwi girl & an Irish model who seemed to think that I could do some modeling, later on in the year/early this year Kitty seemed to think I should and Val sort of did too, I think. Then Eames said something but I can't really be sure of his comments. But on the weekend I got told that I had looked like some sort of Polo model or Calvin Klein or something. And three separate people have decided that I look like Ruud Van Nistelroy, the Dutch football player. I think that may be primarily due to the longish hair. But in all honesty all this has been boosting my confidence, along with the idea that Kristina may have liked me as well (which I'm not 100% on really). But my confidence has increased significantly. I still have little or no idea of what to say to girls but at least I feel more comfortable in how I look.  Despite the fact that several of my mates have been trying to pass me off as gay, which is unusual. I'm not too sure of the motivation on this one but they find it amusing enough.  I'm still not sure on how I rank on a scale of 1-10, and that would be nice to know, I guess.  I got asked why I didn't have a girlfriend on the weekend, I replied with the usual, I didn't really think I should be committing to something here in Aus.  Not sure if that's really true now. I think I'm looking a little more seriously than before, and at least I'm learning little by little how the whole conversation thing works in the male/female deal. I'm pretty crap at it though, I get a little nervous I guess, still lacking a fair bit of confidence in that area. The other thing is I guess I've been waiting for the right girl to come along, not looking too hard, but expecting God to help me out in that department. I still reckon God will work it out, but I don't want to not be ready when he does. I've got faith.   "Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires" -- Song of Songs 2:7

      Wagga Wagga - Crow Crow, or the place of many crows. Had a really great time down there, drove down Friday night/evening. Had a pretty amusing trip down as we had these walky-talkies, one in robes car and the other in Nicks. We were playing around, being clowns as per usual, but we were on channel 5. Next thing you know this voice comes over, "you kids get off this frequency, its a backup emergency frequency" whoopsie daisy. Once we sorted out which frequency was ok to be on we started giving robbo a little grief about the lady in his car (Robbo was with Cathy, a friend of the family from Wagga (a wee bit older than robbo but we didn't care)). Unfortunately she happened to be a physiologist, and once she got a hold of the walkie-taklie she burned us good. Then when we took to long to reply she hit us with "are you guys workshopping your reply" which of course we were, with very little success. Made the trip down pass pretty quickly.  The first night was pretty quiet, just a couple of quiet beers once we arrived. The Saturday was spent at the farm (after experiencing Youngs butchers of course) cutting down a big old tree, moving a few cattle a  riding around on motorbikes. I went on one ride up the back and six or seven kangaroos took off across the paddock, heading for the national park at the back of the property. One however had a little trouble with the fence and I ended up following it along beside the fenceline for a couple of hundred metres. They move pretty quickly, once they get hopping along, those things. Saturday night, after watching the mighty All Blacks smash England, was spent in Wagga, dinner then the pub. Chris and Nick had a couple of the girls convinced I was gay. She told me afterward that she hadn't thought I was but then decided that I had nice shoes! Apparently shoes is some kind of indicator, I don't really see the logic, but anyway.  Sunday, back to the farm this time collecting rocks. Got a whole pile of the things, the headed back for a big old Sunday lunch and the rugby test between Scotland and Australia. We then headed up to one of robes, Dad's mates place (the guy we got most of the wood and all of the rocks for) for a few drinks with him and a few of his other friends. His company makes neon signs for Aristocrat pokie machines, and I thinks its doing pretty well. His pool room was nice and the full on bar was pretty impressive, complete with neon sign above.  The Ipod radio transmitter worked pretty well, and I took around 70 odd photos and movies. I'm pretty happy with some of them too.   Monday was pretty much spent hanging around till around midday till we decided to pack up and head home. Rather uneventful trip back but nice to crash out once I got home, quite a tiring trip.  I'll have to develop on a couple more issues as I'm supposed to be at the gym at 6pm, and its currently 12 past.

      Off to Wagga tonight, had to bring all my stuff in to work which was a pain, but at least I didn't have any golf clubs, that's one bonus I guess.  Tried out my new toys last night (well I tried out the FM transmitter anyway), works ok, a lot better at close range or if a person is holding it, must sort of use the person to increase the signal or something. The only thing is the way the signal works, it leaves a whole pile of signal tracks on my Ipod. I think I need to delete most of them and just use one or two, that way I can still use random and not get a whole pile of beeps in my ear. That said thy shouldn't turn up too often amongst the other 2700 odd tracks that are loaded on it at the moment.  I also made it to boxing this morning, put in a fair effort and left pretty tired. Nick had a bit of a sore shoulder and pulled out after a few minutes so I finished the class partnered up with Rupert, who punches quite heavily but slow. Class left me pretty knackered though, I had to have pineapple and raisin toast for breakfast along with my coffee. Also did the Pilates class last night, I think I'm slowly getting a little bit more flexible. Not much, but improvement is improvement, credit where credit is due, etc.  Very deep...

      Newsfever,   Couldn't blog yesterday because we only had a half day, and the night before I was in a fair old rush. I was heading out to Hills with my new cell leader at church, Lisa. However I was supposed to contact her / reply to a text message organising where to meet and I left my phone at home. Very clever of me, I know. I got there with out any real problems and it was a really good night out. But once again the night before payday I ran out of cash, payola, moolaa, however you want to say it. Once again my budgeting wasn't up to scratch.  This fortnight will be tough too, I went out this afternoon and bought a few toys for my Ipod, a griffin FM broadcaster and a little bag with a few bits and pieces inside. I think I may have been a little ripped off with the bag, but I've got the car charger I was after anyway, for around $40/$50 more than if I had got it by itself. Maybe I just shouldn't worry about it, I'll write up how useful it is on the trip to Wagga this weekend. The bag will be useful to keep it all together I guess. But the cash is gone, and it looks like they have declined my request for a gold card, which sucks. I might give them a call when I receive the letter and explain what I want it for, not the for limit but for the travel insurance that comes with it. But my budget for the fortnight is already out.  Yesterday afternoon was spent in Balmoral at Awaba restaurant, rather than at work which was very nice. It was a sort of work celebration for a whole pile of things and was a pretty good crack overall. Pleasant way to spend the afternoon, at the beach.  Still no closer to getting pictures up, I think I need to get them served on another host, and I think I might be able to use some of Dave's space until I get around to getting my own.  Until tomorrow then...   "The girl who stoops to conquer usually wears a low-cut dress"

      Well I can plug my Ipod into my computer at work, very convenient and useful that will be. Yes.  Brilliant weekend, spent it down at Mossvale with Nick & Dan. Tennis (I improved significantly over the weekend), golf, food, glorious food, picture frames and a few choice photos.  Its so nice getting out of Sydney, and the Southern Highlands is close but you really feel like you've got out. My Golfing hasn't improved much since last time I played at Mossvale, but I had a couple of decent shots. My putting need a bit of work though (understatement).  We went for a run/walk round Cecil Hoskins nature reserve and I got some cool photos. I'll try to get some posted up on the site now that I can connect my Ipod to the world.   In addition to the rest I also read a book, Catch Me If You Can, not a bad read, and the guy is a genius. With a rather large set of balls I might add. Some of the stuff he got away with...  I'm due at the gym at the moment so I gotta rush.   “No man is justified in doing evil on the grounds of expediency.” -- Theodore Roosevelt

      I can't believe we won. Triva indeed. After about a year & a half of going along, pretty consistently to trivia, we finally won. Craig & Val weren't there, but Dave, Mike, Simone, Chris & I were, to savor the moment. $50 between 5 of us isn't much to get excited by, but after coming 2nd, 3rd (a couple of times) and a few prize winning 7th places, winning was a good feeling.  We (NZ) lost the soccer, to Vanuatu of all places. So that makes for difficult times, its not like we were likely to beat Australia any time soon to get to the playoffs for the world cup, but still... Vanuatu...  Work is slowly picking up as I learn what to do about the place. Still looking forward to getting my boss back though. Had any interesting conversation with Nick today, commenting on a married couple who had split up and how they had looked and continue looking for others to blame other than themselves. I wonder what it is that we refuse to believe that it is us/I that has a problem. I often think I have the reverse problem, that I assume that the fault lies with me, but I'm yet to be seriously tested in a situation like a serious relationship. Does seem sad though, and I think it makes it difficult to get through/over if you can not take any ownership of the issues or problem. Robbo also mentioned that Kate might be going on the Wagga trip, chances are it wont happen, not sure what I'd do if it did either. Deal with that issue if it arises I guess.  Got the lotto ticket today, numbers: 05, 08, 10, 17, 19, 24, 27, 29, 31, 37 & 43 for the record.   "As long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have its fascinations.

      New comments, All Black trials were ok, pity about Mauger getting injured, but not so unhappy to see Reuben Thorne out of the team. Merhts is in the squad, very happy about that.  I was told the other day that I was getting bigger, nice to hear. I thought I might be a little bigger after all the time spent at the gym, nice to have someone notice though.  Had a little bit more work come in over the last couple of days which is nice, but still no boss. Odd sort of problem which you don't usually have people complain about. But the increased workload is well received!  Can't remember what it was I was going to say right now... ahh that's right... Chris was talking to Robbo & Nick about getting a 4br place somewhere. Chris has had a look on the net for some. Generally you can get quite a nice place if we were willing to pay the same but just across 4. But I think I'd rather find a place for a more reasonable amount. Use the numbers to reduce cost rather than to increase living standard. Chris looks for living standard but I think I can count on Nick to help stabilize his expectations. I would prefer to have the cash in the hand, than sending it to the landlord.  Thinking I should probably get back in touch with Kristina, given her enough space/time, if I'm going to be  a friend, I should at least try to be good at it. I can still learn a great deal more I think out of the whole saga, or non-saga as the case is. Learning is good.  Another amusing aside, I'm in a system 11 for this weekends 23M lotto draw with the folks here at work.  After never really thinking about getting a lotto ticket. Eleven of us here (pretty much the whole team) are in, I decided that I couldn't really face coming in to work if they had won over the weekend and I had decided not to join in.  Plus its a little bit of a team thing too, so despite not really being interested, I've forked over my $20.   "I'm not a god, I was misquoted" -- Lister, Red Dwarf

      I've got to say that Archery is pretty decent fun. We ended up missing C & V as Chris misplaced his phone, &amp; mine is a little bung after dropping it in the toilet. So we ended up in a cab out to Olympic park, but it was good fun, I have no idea how the Olympic competitors manage to shoot them 75 metres! I had great trouble with my accuracy over about 10 metres!   The AB's scraped in against the springboks, sort of feel like we cheated them really. After all those times of feeling cheated myself when Australia had does the same thing to us, now I feel like we've done the same. Although the boys did dominate the field and the tries they got were fairly opportunistic. But they took them and almost won. Aussies might be in for some fun this weekend.   Stayed up till 2am last night to watch Armstrong with his sixth tour. I reckon that if he decides to ride again next year I might go watch some of the race. It would be really cool to see the race, and extra cool if I could see Armstrong racing 'his' race.   Found a really nice place in North Sydney on the web today, only thing is they want $450 per week which is a bit steep. I wonder if we could wind them down to $400?   I guess we'll see. Off to the gym now, no Nick or Dan they are in Bali. Punks, I'm quite jealous.    "Prosperity makes friends, adversity tries them" -- Publilius Syrus

      Still busy, but now starting to get a little tired after staying up till 2am watching the tour de france. How good is lance Armstrong, he just powered up the alp d'huez or however you say it. Very impressive, he completely took apart Basso on that hill.   Thinking of skipping the gym tonight, lazy fellow that I am... But I've been pretty tired today and I'd like to go boxing in the morning, so I'll pop in and put my name down on the way home.   I finally got some photo's loaded up on the web, so I'll look at getting a photo to add to the profile on the right. I'm also playing with the idea of purchasing an iBook, probably a 12"er because I like the form factor. If I do It'll happen soon after we move into a new place (still looking) because we will then be getting broadband internet access, so I might as well be able to use it I guess. The other choice would be a 15" powerbook...&nbsp; mmm so nice. But a bit&nbsp;too expensive for the amount of time I'd spend on it.     My question was whether they had ever discussed governing with a bunch of pinko fruitloops like Rod Donald or not? -- Winston Peters

      Gosh, very busy at the moment. Went to Melb on Friday which was a good move. The team down there is pretty cool. There is a lot of ribbing and joking going back and forward between the guys. All good fun. I also bought a Shirt &amp; Tie from the Voi shop down there, they had a sale and I'm a sucker. But $60 for a Zegna Cashmere tie is pretty good.   Played touch on the weekend, good craic. The AB's won the rugger, so the Bledisloe stays in NZ for another year. My two cents is that it should be a three game series. Hopefully it will go back that way in sometime soon, although the Aussies will probably want to change it back as soon as they can win it back from us.   Apple are out with a new Ipod, I think the soon to be released 60 gig will be pretty killer, but I'll survive with the 20g I have now. Chris might get round to getting one tho, now that the price has been reduced.   Just changed my desktop to a photo of Jasmine, after finally looking at some of the photos from my trip to NZ. Some nice photos of the beach there, despite the bad weather. Today I'm finishing with a quote from Nelson Mandela. I watched some of the Andrew Denton interview with Bill Clinton and he made a couple of comments regarding Nelson Mandela which were pretty cool. Sounds like a nice guy to know.&nbsp; &nbsp;    "I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended" -- Nelson Mandela

      Well off to Melbourne tomorrow, not too excited about that, but the fact that they are sending me is nice. At least I get the experience of going through the process of the handover etc.  Not too bad a night last night for the going away bash. Dinner was nice, it was at the Belgian beer cafe in the city. The have a pretty good range of Belgian beers and some decent food too. A nice night overall.  Oh, well off the gym now, not sure if I'll get the dinner tonight, but pilates should fun.   Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls there will it lie -- Ecclesiastes 11:3

      Good day bad day? Hard to tell really, started out ok got some useful information back regarding some of the work I'm doing. But then in the afternoon it got worse and worse. I'm not really too sure what I'm supposed to be doing and it really does get a bit frustrating. What I'm after is an overview look on what our strategy is and where we want to head. Hopefully I should be able to get a run down when I'm in Melbourne, but we'll see I guess.  Had lunch with Kristina today, it was nice, a bit better than last time, so far no emails telling me I had the wrong intentions so far so that’s ok. It was only lunch so we didn't have to fumble around for things to talk about for too long also, which made it a bit easier I guess. Very friendly chat overall.  Was at the gym last night, and I'll be down there again tonight. A good workout yesterday but I can feel it today, that'll teach me for not exercising for the last couple of weeks. Should be ok tonight, I'm looking forward to going, a big change to my attitude prior to going to the gym. Last night Nick, Dan & I ate at the Leagues Club. Not to bad a feed and we walked out $6 the worse for wear after a good size meal. Should try that for lunch one of these days.  I have a meeting with a sector head fellow tomorrow evening, then a going away for one of the guy's I work with so busy day tomorrow.

      How useful is Bloomberg, and how difficult are customers. Bit of a mission day in the office, but not too bad. Spent the arvo at some Bloomberg training. Finally getting the hang of how it works and there is so much information available through the system. Good on you Michael! Still a pretty complicated system though.  Hillsong conference has been good. I'm thinking of bringing my little sister over for next years conference. I think that she would enjoy it heaps and get a whole lot out of it. If I can organise it I'll try and register her today or tomorrow as its heaps cheaper.  NSW won the State of Origin in an almost too perfect a performance. I only caught the end of the game as I was stuck on a train coming back from Homebush... apparently a signal failure between Ashfield and the City. Oh well I could have stayed out and watched the game out there. But I have been offered a ticket to the Bledesloe, which will be far better for sure. I'm looking forward to that game. Hopefully it will be as good as last year (50 points)!   “I'd like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole field to private industry.” -- Joseph Heller

      I'm off to Hillsong conference tonight, I know it starts at 7:30pm which should give me a bit of time to get home, get changed etc. However, I have memories from last year, when I was generally arriving on time, but in a rush after doing the same thing. I don't know what time it started but I reckon it was probably the same sort of time. So do I go straight from work or go home, get changed (put a load of washing on) and then cruise out?  I might try it.  Late to work this morning, I forgot to set my alarm, then woke up at around 4am and remembered, so turned it on. Then proceeded to sleep until I heard Chris leave at 10 minutes to 8am! Turns out I hadn't changed the time for the alarm from around 3:47am, so the time had already passed. Whoops, but my boss was away sick again so no real worry.  Well one of my complaints about my church in NZ was that no one really made me aware of whether I was good looking or not. But while I was there it got commented on a few times and I guess I'm beginning to change my mind. Maybe I'm scared of what that means? What does it mean? I don't really know, still working on that.  Took quite a few photo's while I was there, and Paul got a couple of very cool photo's of Jasmine. I might have to put together a collage on my desktop I think. I might get some printed for the walls at home too, that would be nice. I walked down to wigmores on the Thursday after catching up with Dave, Jo & Steve for lunch. Rained a bit as you would expect, but I got some nice photo's and would still really like to build a place out there, overlooking the beach. But that may be a little way off.  I must say I'm a little jealous of James & Julie. They looked very happy together, the way James was looking at her was very touching. I'm really glad that they are so happy, and look forward to the same for myself. But all in Gods timing, as he knows best.

      We'll I'm not going to write a great deal today. I'm back at work, in Sydney after a very pleasant week in Auckland. I didn't get to catch up with JM which was a bit disappointing, I just didn't try hard enough.  Overall it was really good, though. James' wedding was good, and I caught up with a couple of mates, Shane & Andrew, whom I haven't seen for a fair few years. I caught up with most everyone still in NZ, except for Celia, whoops. Apparently it was her birthday so I'll have to send through an email.  Ended up going shopping at dress mart. Got a nice pair of brown shoes and a shirt. Spent a bit much but, I decided to spoil myself.  I'll write more later, I'm pretty tired after getting up at about 1:30am Australian time.

      Might be time for a new entry on the blogg front. I've been a little tardy on this fron for a couple of days.  Had a nice weekend, just don't mention the game. The AB's lost, I was at the game and it was a touch depressing to be fair. Carlos had a shocker and apparently he's been dropped for the SA trip. And I've got too say that after scoring one try in three matches with arguably the best backline in the rugby world, you've got to wonder about this flat attack. I guess if they can make it work it will be fine, but so far they haven't been able to. Is there something specific in the execution that they are not pulling off, what can be done...  Sunday was spent out at the Bulldogs game on behalf of Nike. A good free afternoon was had by all, and the doggies thrashed the cowboys. I've got to say that I was a little concerned by the blatant se*ual attire of the cheerleaders. I didn't realise that much cleavage was possible to be fair. And with the reputation the Bulldogs have you've got to wonder who came up with the outfit. The haircuts out there were something special. I got a quick snap on the way out which is pretty consistent with the quality levels out there.     Sunday I went to the early service at church and saw this fantastic girl again, who I had seen a few weeks ago. She is really quite stunning, quite possibly the best looking girl I think I may ever have seen. Now I think I'll have to find out how to meet this woman!!  Today I went to the gym at lunch, missed lunch so I'm feeling a little light at the moment. Also I've spent all my cash for the week and have had to transfer another AUD80 out of my ING account to cover me for the rest of the week. Not sure how successful the cheapness will be but I'll try.   Our response to being bored and rich is not to discard our possessions and live more simply, but to buy more stuff to reduce the space in which we might contemplate our shame -- Stuart Jeffries - The Guardian

      And so to continue the story, at least for a little anyway.  We had a bit of a laugh watching the rugger because there were all these adds for Tooheys and Bundy Rum which had the common theme of Australian males (often Wallabies supporters) requiring either females or teddy bear's to help them out and to stand up for them. Needless to say these comments didn't really go down too well with the aussie males around us, but no bear came to rescue them.  Sunday, Kirsty from NZ & her brother who were over in Sydeny for a couple of weeks, came along to church, it was nice to have visitors. And her bro is possibly going to be over here studying. That would be good as he's a really nice dude. We ended up being very late to church though, and then I missed the evening service cause I was too slow. Not too excited about that. But cell was on on Tuesday, pretty low key. Ended up playing pool at the Clock in Surry Hills.  Much else news worthy, nope not really. I didn't get to the gym last night like I wanted to, but I did get some photos up on Flickr ( urlLink http://www.flickr.com/photos/roladex/ ), so I have some more images on the web. Wowsers. Check them out, ya'll.  I'm off to the gym, take two. Work is over for the day.   “Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions” – Coco Chanel

      What anice day to be blogging again, hey.  Havn't done much in the way of updating for a while, I've pretty much been flat out at work, but the team presentation is done, the work at home Bank hoiliday is complete and another weekend has passed.  Chris & I went to look at places at Kirribilli on Saturday. We really are pretty hopeless at looking for a new place. We got up at about 10am, got the paper &amp; headed over there. Turns out there was only the one place open for inspection in the paper, and we had missed that. So we headed into the agency there and they advised us that they had one open at 12:15. We went to the wrong place, then we missed the agent, and had to call her back. The place was a hole as well, and they wanted $420 for it! I for one was shocked. It really was nothing at all. Then we met up with Dave & Nicola for a brief chat. Then had some of the worst fish &amp; Chips ever in the park under the bridge. Wont be eating there again, methinks. But I still really like Kirribilli I must say.  Sat evening was spent up at the pub watching the Wallabies beat the Springboks. But more on this tommorrow, I'm off to the gym.   “The proverb warns that, ‘you should not bite the hand that feeds you.’ But maybe you should, if it prevents you from feeding yourself.” –- Thomas Szasz
