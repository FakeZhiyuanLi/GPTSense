      hi all, this was a really a very bad  budget , FAr FAr AWay from a dream budget,   A day after the Budget announcement which saw 8% excise duty on personal computers being knocked off, branded computer makers, said that viability of assembling computers is under question. Besides domestic vendors such as Wipro and HCL, MNC companies like Acer, HP and IBM assemble computers in the country.   MNC computer vendors are of the view that importing a fully assembled PC now makes more sense than assembling them here.   The reason being that while an imported PC just gets saddled with a 10% customs duty, a host of components that go into making a computer still attract custom duty plus CVD (counter veiling duty) which shoots up the assembling cost.   For instance, memory card, a key component of a computer now attracts 10% custom duty and 16% CVD. Similar is the case with heat sink, which has a 20% custom duty and 16% CVD, and monitors which attract 10% custom and 16% CVD. As customer preference is for multimedia PC’s, most computers are sold with speakers on which a 10% customs and 16% CVD duty is imposed.  Early this year the previous Government in its mini budget announcement dropped 16% excise duty on microprocessors and storage devices like hard disk drivers, floppy disk and CD Rom drives, all key components of a computer.   According to Mr S Rajendran, general manager, marketing at Acer India, price reduction at this stage is not likely. Computer prices in fact are likely to go up considering the 2% education cess that will be imposed on some of the imported components.   “While government’s intention on zero excise for PC is good, anomolies arising out of CVD needs to be looked into.” he said.   PC’s in India are 42% more expensive than in China and 32% more than the global average price. Despite India being the prime destination for software services industry and having a large population of technology workers, PC penetration in the country is a dismal nine per thousand. IBM India’s vice president, personal computing division, Mr Alok Ohrie said that they are assessing the impact.   excercise on assessing the kind of impact the budget announcement will have on pricing is currently on.  Few branded computer vendors are of the view that as a fully imported PC would cost less and some local makers promising lower price, customer preference will be more for branded products.     Computer assemblers that ET spoke too, however, had a mixed view. Citing better after sales service and attractive bundled offering like comptuer table and web camera, some assemblers said that they will continue to score over branded vendors.   Others like Mr Sunil Kumar of Lampo Computers said that if price difference between a branded and un-branded PC shrinks further, customers preference will swing towards branded computers. This trend will hurt assemblers, he said.   According to MAIT, desktop PC market in fiscal 2003-04, grossed 30 lakh units registering a growth of 32% over the previous fiscal. PC sales are expected to cross 38 lakh units in fiscal 2004-05. Assembled PCs-the lesser known regional brands and unbranded systems, accounted for 53% of PC sales in 2003-04.
