      yeah, so my mom got a letter today...which had no return address...that had all these codes for having dogs out in the yard,&nbsp; and how if they bark or get into a neighbor's yard...even if by accident, the dog can be taken away and put to sleep...so now i have to sit here with 2 crying dogs because they have to go out so bad while my mom goes to the store to get chains for them...people in this town really suck monkey balls. come one people. get a friggin life. but my question is what about the stupid ass next door who rides his lawn mower up and down the sidewalk at 2 am?? waht codes are there about taht? god damn. i hate this town. i'll be so glad when i can leave.
