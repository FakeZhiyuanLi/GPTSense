      There are quite a few things that I am truly passionate about in this world. One of them is my family, the other one is my girlfriend. You could also make case for the Boston Red Sox and Van Halen...although not necessarily in that order. I love flying, it is a passion that I hope to develop into a career. I love hard rock music with blistering guitar solos...regardless if the music is considered "dated." I like drinking margarita's on the beach, but sometimes I can't make it to the beach and I just have to settle for drinking margarita's (one out of two isn't bad). I love to watch movie's, comedy's and action films are amongst my favorites. I love trying new foods, my girlfriend plays a huge roll in that. For example; one time we went out to lunch and she suggested a Lebanese (sp?) restaurant. I'm thinking "I didn't even know there was such a thing?!." I have to admit, I really enjoyed it...we had like three or four different types of hummice. Here's a little advice for some people who are eating pizza six times a week, "try new foods."

      After my second 14 hour day I think I've come to this conclusion...going to work   early   in the morning, and coming home   late   at night  ,   does not leave much room for quality of life. Especially when what you're doing at work is...well, work! I heard a great quote not too long ago from Randy Haugen (Diamond level Amway/Quixtar IBO). He said, "we sell our lives at wholesale, and we buy our lives at retail." That is so true isn't it, at least for most of us. It made me think of what we do for a job, and how much time that job takes out of our lives when we would rather be doing something else. And I am not trying to say that I am allergic to working, because I have always had a good work ethic. But I started thinking how we are always a couple payments behind, or we can never save enough to catch up. It is just causing me to think about the money we make, and how we make it. More on that later...  I was getting ready for work this morning, when Jeff (whom I am living with now) had shouted from the other room, "Hey listen to this one, Death and destruction are never satisfied, much like the eyes of man (Proverbs 27:20)....so true." We are never satisfied. There is always something else, something new, something different. I have a friend of mine who dates a different girl every month (maybe two or three every month). It is almost as if when the novelty, or "new-ness" wears off, he is on to the next girl. Maybe I used to be that way to some degree, so I am not trying to point fingers, but I think that I've learned a thing or two (and continuing to learn). That passage makes me think of sexual immorality more than anything else.

      I was just looking at the date from my last blog, its over a month ago! It has been longer than I thought. It reminds me of a great quote I heard the other day, "Bad news is, time flies...Good news is, you're the pilot." Maybe I like that quote because it makes me think about flying, then again, it also makes me think about maximizing the use of my time.  I've been reading a great book lately that I'm finally finishing this week, its called "The Magic of Thinking Big," by Dr. David Schwartz. Its a book that pretty much separates the "doers," and the "don't doers." I have really enjoyed it. Its pretty dated, as far as the numbers go (it was written in 1959), but the principles and concepts are timeless. One thing I've started to do a lot more lately is read books. I am trying to construct a plan that will make my reading time more effective, and efficient. There are so many books I'd love to read, I just feel like I have no time to read them all. I was with one of my good friends the other day in a bookstore in Harvard Square, and I told him that I feel like I am so far behind in reading, that I have a stack of books that just continue to pile up. He said that if you're not  behind  in reading, then you're probably not reading  enough . It is so true, I can't afford to go into bookstore anymore, because I know that I'll come out of there with just more books to read. I'd love to take a vacation to someplace where I could just read through a pile of books, that would be my idea of a vacation.  This past week, the Red Sox traded Nomar Garciaparra (for those of you living in a cave, he is perhaps the best shortstop in professional baseball). I don't disagree with the trade, especially since Nomar's contract was up at the end of this year, and the likeliness of him re-signing with Boston were slim to none. So I think the Sox front office were right in dealing him on the last day of the trade deadline and getting two good players to strengthen the defense. I think it dawned on me (and all of Red Sox nation for that matter) that Nomar's days were numbered in Boston when the Alex Rodriguez trade discussions were going on last December just prior to free agency. I'm going to miss seeing him in a Red Sox uniform, but all we can do now is look back and say that it was seven plus great (and interesting) seasons. His heart just wasn't in Boston in the end, and it was time to move on.
