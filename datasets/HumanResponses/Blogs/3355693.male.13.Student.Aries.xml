      My Mood Is         Today a miracle happened, I stayed after school! Man, believe me that’s a miracle. I never stay after school, not even for boring after school tutoring. I skip that *shit* every Tuesday and Thursday. I didn’t stay for tutoring, I stayed for the Talent Show. Well I have to say SOME people there did have talent. But let’s not even talk about the one’s who didn’t have any talent (Help them Lord.) Well, let’s go back to the beggining. I lied to my teacher and told to him that I needed to use the bathroom, it was on the last 4 minutes of school, where I really went was to meet Soraya at the main office because we were going to the talent show together! HOLD UP!!! We went as friends. Chill people, anyway, I got there just before the bell rang me and Soraya Ran to the auditorium to be the first one’s there. Me, Soraya, and Igor! We waited for the show to start. Well, when it did it only took what? like 3 minutes. The show was going ok for the first 30 seconds of it. Man, not wanting to be racist but these Monkeys (monkeys= black people from MMS) sat behind us. Man, they would always *fucking* yell when anybody got up on stage specially when some type of gorilla (gorilla = a big male black person ) got up there. They would YELL something like, "You so fine!" or, "I love you!!" Dude, we didn’t hear *shit* when they were yelling (they yelled throughout the whole show). Then this girl got up on the stage and she was singing solo(accapela) and it was all quiet and then I yelled, "Go ChaQuiChiBarucha!!" That had nothing to do with the girl's name and everybody looked back at me and started laughing. The show lasted for like 2 hours and 30 minutes. Good lord. Because the monkeys started to stink the place up like it was a zoo (zoo = a place full of black people from marietta) up in there.  When we got outside it started to rain so I called my aunt to come pick us up. Man, she took forever to get there and it was raining so me, Soraya, and Amanda started playing in the rain. Igor didn’t feel like playing, so he just watched us and laughed. Amada was jumping in the mud, it was funny, anyway it rained a whole *fucking* lot. Today was fun. Only 3 more days until the *shit* is over .

      My Mood Is        Today  was  cool, Soraya and I went to  the  mall. She had  money, well  my  parents  were  working  so  I  went, but  without  any  money. We played  punch-buggy, this really  old  game  from  6th  grade. Rules  are: when  you see a buggy you can  punch  the  person and say no punch back so she doesn't punch you. The fun part was when we passed by a car dealer, they  only had buggies. It was funny, we stayed punching the fuck out of each other inside the car, lol. Well, when we got to the mall we went to Hot  Topic. We stayed in there for about one hour and Soraya bought a jacket,a  wristband, and a shirt. The jacket was really cool, I‘m  going to buy  one  for  me  next  Saturday, Soraya’s mom was horrified with the patch Soraya  bought to put on the jacket. It was a blink 182 skull. So, only four more  days until the shit is over. Oh, I can’t wait until the 27th, I’m  going  to the beach for five days. I'm going to chill out a bit, I will tell you  more about it when I get back.

      My Mood Is        I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on your hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me She said Goodbye too many times before  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore...
