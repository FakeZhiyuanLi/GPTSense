      Morning. Managed to not have any university commitments today, so I'm writing this in my local library. The computers here are about ten times as good as the ones at university so it's a good play. Trouble is, it ghas just filled up with the local losers who've got nothing better to do than hang around in a library. I mean how desperate do you have to be at 11 on a Friday morning.  Anyway, had to laugh yesterday. Attendance at lectues and seminars has been slowly declining. Mainly because the actual courses are as dull as s**t. Out of the immediate group of us that normally hang abouit together, there ended up being only two all day yesterday. The best comment was at the end of one of the lectures, who doesn't realise just how little everyone wants to be there. ' It seem that people aren't reading their lecture notes or doing their seminar sheets '. You think? Maybe it's because we've also got Monday and Tuesday off next week (due to some weird local holiday). Can't complain, though.   Yesterday I said I was going to enjoy the sunshine after having worked through the glorious day that was Wednesday. Well, as soon as I finished lectures I thought I'd sit in the sunshine for lunch. Trouble is, as soon as I went to do it,the sun had gone and stayed gone for the rest of the day. Typical.  Feeling pretty good about myself as I've managed to avoid writing this essay for my education course (it's not as difficult as all that). I suppose I should use this week- end to actually get it done, but it's not going to be the greatest one ever but I just want to get it done right now. Last night, I was supposed to go out with a friend for a friend of hers birthday. Kinda wierd but I was up for it, after all, alcohol's always good. Unfortunately, she was supposed to text me about when we were going to meet up but it never happened. I suppose they decided they only wanted people who actually knew the guy who's birthday it was. I don't care, I stayed at home with a few of my mates and flatmate and ended up watching  urlLink Red Dwarf  dvds. A little alcohol  may  have been consumed.  Here's looking for a good week end  Jack

      Thursday sees the first day of the first test in England (so its guaranteed to rain). Thinking about this got me trying to understand the game in America. Mashed about this makes baseball.  I first got into baseball during the 2002 World Series. I think I couldn't sleep one night and just ended up watching it all. Trouble is, after two years you'd have thought I could start to understand what's going on, but I still don't get it. It's ok to have on in the background but I can't see anyone wanting to sit through three hours of it every day. And yet they do, so there must be  something  in it. It seems that all innings up to the ninth are just preparation for the final inning to kind of set the score. You get one pitcher who lasts 8/9 of the game and then go through half a dozen in the dying moments. It just seems as though something is happening and I'm missing it.  I've started to be able to work out which pitch is which once the ball has gone through to the catcher, and I guess that after years and years of watching, I'll start to be able to work out which pitch would come next. It just seems like a game of paper, scissors, stone with balls. The pitcher has a selection of pitches to throw and places to put it so he just picks one, the batter goes for it and if he's lucky he gets a hit. Where's the skill in that?  The other thing I don't get is the pitcher's simple inability to do his job. I've seen this quite a few times, normally in the eighth or ninth inning. If the bases are loaded, the last thing you want to do is walk the next batter because that'll give them a run for free, and yet what happens? Exactly. Especially since usually they've intentionally walked to load the bases.  I don't think I'll ever understand but I'll keep watching anyway  Jack

      What a glorious week it's been so far! You can really tell that summer has arrived at last and yesterday had to be the best if all. Predicatable really, since I was at work all day, but it's really nice to sit outside at about eight in the evening with a cup of coffee in hand sunning yourself. Aah. Trouble is, though, I got woken up at six this morning eith the sun streaming through my window as bright as midday. Wouldn't have minded but my day today doesn't even start until eleven.  Funny incident at work yesterday. The Senior Sales, who's eighteen, engaged, but not bad looking was walking through the shopping centre when some strange person crept up behind her and pinched her arse! Being the sort of person she is, she turned straight round and gave him a wallop round the head. As soon as this had happened, she realised that the person she had just belted was none other then her fiance (and she's got a wicked right arm). How much wuld I have given simply to be there.  Was watching the ice hockey on TV last night. As there was no game they showed  The Season , the documentary series about my team following them through the course of the season that's just finished (well it has for us- we were knocked out embarrasingly last week). Even though it's been more than a week since we were knocked out, I still can't get over it. I know that every year you think that this is your year but this year.... ah, well, only six months to wait for the next one (I hope).  Enjoy the sunshine  Jack

      Hi, and welcome to what I hope is going to become a regularly irregular journal/ forum for me to witter about basically whatever crosses what passes for my mind. Feel free to comment or email anyhting you feel relevant and maybe I'll even get back to you. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jack, I am 26 and single, living in Edinburgh. I am in the second of a four year Maths with Education course at  urlLink Heriot- Watt University  (although the education parts actually are run by  urlLink Stirling - don't ask but it'll become clear what we all think about  that ).  I live in a third floor tenement flat with two other students, one on my course and the other on another. When I'm not at uni, I work in a discount book store two days a week, so I've got a little beer money. I am an ice hockey fanatic, supporting both my local team (the  urlLink Edinburgh Capitals ) and an American team (the  urlLink >Colorado Avalanche ). Anything else that I haven't thought of that is relevant, I'll explain as we go along.  By the way, it is not my intention to offend anybody, adn if I do so I'm sorry. My opinions may not be accurate adn the evidence I use can be anything from years of detailed study to something I read at a bus stop once. Feel free to correct me as neceaary.  Thanks  Jack

      Just the first of a few quick rants about various things I have noticed.  Yesterday, I got my polling card for the forthcoming European elections. On the same day, the University held their annual elections for various offices. Two elections, seemingly at opposite ends on the scale of importance, but what do they have in common? Well, it seems that they are considered equally important by the people in the running for the posts and the amount of canvassing they are doing.  Consider this, in the Local Election, last year, it was clear to me the sort of people who were standig. You'd hear their points in the media and often meet canvassers as you went about your daily business. By the time the election day came about, I had a good idea who I was going yo vote for (an independent if you must know). Now, I have no idea who's even standing, for which party and on which issues. In my opinion, if you don't vote for anybody, then you have no right to complain when the next incumbent of the position doesn't do what you want. The trouble is I might as well not for all the good its going to do. I mean why bother. If anyone had even bothered to come out and say what they were up to, the may gave got an extra vote for nothing, but no. The same is true for the University elections. Occasionally, you'll see a poster up telling you to vote for someone or other in some position because ' I'll make everything better '. But you never see these people once they have taken up their position (or even find out who won).  Another point on the importance attatached to the Eurpoean elections by the returning officer. In the General or Local elections the ward that we belong to is once of about twenty in the Edinburgh area. For the local election, guess what the ward we belong to is....  Scotland . I kid you not.  Vote for me. I'll not do anything either.  Jack

      Whew, what a day. More test type things that I don;t really have much of a clue abaout. Its a good job I can improvise (part of being a teacher I guess) still, only one more to go and its pay day Friday so guess who's going out. I had to laugh at the weather reports this week. Every day they've said that it's going to rain and as soo as I look outside the sun is beating down and it;s absolutely baking. Today, they've said that the weather will pick up and what o I see as I look outside... it's  raining .   Talking of the weather I was watching the first test yesterday. Well there's a promising situation gone right up the spout. Looking good coming back fromt the winter tours and asked to bowl, England managed the most half- arsed, pathetic attempt at anyhting I've ever seen. Unbelievable. Still, we'ver got four more days to make it up and if that fails we can always rely on the weather.  On sports of a more positive note, a Calgary Flames shirt and Canadian flag has just gone up in the window opposite. Fair enough, if you're going to put in the best post- season's performance since 19-- then I suppose you'd want to make the most of it. The finals start on the 25th, and I don't see me getting any sleep  that  week.  I've gotta go noe to make the most of the sleep I've got.  Jack

      For those of you who've never seen the  urlLink Eurovision Song Contest , you really don't know what you've been missing. Basically, what it's supposed to be is a competition where every country votes for a song to represent them in the inter country competition broadcast simultaneously throughout the union. After all the countries have performed live, everybody gets a chance to vote by phone for their favourite song except their own. Once this has been done, each country gives points to the others depending on the votes. From 12, 10, 8 to 1. The country with the best song and the most votes wins a trophy and gets to host the next competition.  This is all very well in theory, but the reality is very different. Basically what it boils down to is that every stereotyping of every country you have heard of is right. For example, this year, the Italians decided not to compete. This was because Italy considers itself the home of fine music (after all they invented opera) and as such they are quite put out that they have never won the competition and they're not going to play any more. the British can't understand why they never win any more even though they clearly have the best song every time. Also, they like to remind everyone that they used to win it all the time in the good old days, and that's all that counts. The fact that the winner gets a fine trophy is completly ignored in the face of what is going to become basically a full evenings worth of a free plug for the country (and the do make it count at every possible moment during the competition. The prestige of being the winning band is effectively nil.  The absolutely most hilarious part is the voting system. Alledgedly, it is all done by the phone votes in the country, but a few suspicious coincidences have been noticed. For example, the countries that are all around one another in the Balkans, the former Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey all seem to have a system where they vote for one another. The Scandanavian countries also have a little system as do the formar USSR. Seriously odd. It seems also that people look at the style of song that won the previous year and just copy it. These never win. After a while you can pick where the votes are going before they are announced. Added to this we have Terry Wogan being incredibly sarcastic and desparate local television personalities who have never had sucha large audience in their lives. Ridiculous.  It's in Ukraine next year, and daft as it is I wouldn't miss it for anything  Jack

      Ah how good is that. A little couple of days of holiday in the sunshine goes down a treat. What a shame, than, that I've got so much work to be doing that I've barely had time to go out. I've got two essays due in on Friday and a test on Thursday and another on Friday. Aargh! Still, now that's all done I can kick back and relax. Oh, no I can't, because I haven't got any money until payday which is Friday. Still, there's a  urlLink Mr Scruff  gig on Friday night, whihc I'm trying to go to but since I don't get any money until then, I'll have to hope there's still tickets left on the door. F**k  Still, been watching the hockey recently. Getting down to the important part of the season and all the games are fantastic. It's just a shame that we only get coverage twice a week. Still, there's always internet highlights, after all I don't actually need to do any work between now and the end of June.  Have you noticed that when people try to annoy you just out of spite, it always comes straight back to them with interest. My boss' assistant tried to irritate me by giving me a stupid shift next week, which basicaly means I have to leave at the same time as normal but I won't get paid for it. However, she didn't realise that this left her in a hole ahving to run the shop on her own for a while and she had to come crawling back to me to ask me to help her out. Heh heh heh.  Here's hoping the weather lasts until I have time off  Jack

      So, this muslim cleric living in Britain is going to be extradited. What a relief that must be for the British government. Isn't it such a relief that the Americans have mysteriously discovered that they want to talk to him about some crime that he apparently commited some time ago. Its almost as though a favour was asked of George Bush. Surely not.  Unfortunately, there's one or two minor problems. Basically, the British couldn't have him arrested as he hasn't actually done anything against the law in this country. Except for saying nasty things about people but, in spite of teh efforts of Daivid Blunkett, that's still not illegal. So we need the Americans to take him off our hands. Fine. Trouble is, though, that if he is to face the death penalty when he faces the crimes for which he is being extradited, British law says that he cannot go. Problems, since he faces one charge of kidnapping. Ho hum.  It looks like they'll have to do a quick rethink, but I'm sure its no problem for men of this calibre, since they managed to put together such a convincing argument for invading any country they feel like.  I wait with baited breath  Jack

      Oh, how I love the Inland Revenue. Not something often said, but there you are. About mid- April, I got a phone call from the Inland Revenue tellin gme that they had been trying to send me a cheque for overpaying on my tax as I'm a student, but they had the wrong address. I corrected them and heard no more until I got home yesterday. Holding my last money in my hand (no joke) and three weeks till payday looked bad, until I opened a cheque for £150. Magic. Heh heh heh.  Still, it looks like we're going to get more bank holidays. Fine. It seems that we have about half as many as everyone else in the European Union and we deserve some more. Fine. I don't care but I'm quite happy to gat paid for a day that I'm not going to work anyway, as lonf as they don't just give you two days off in a row as there's not really anything to look forward to. Trouble is, the company I work for at the moment is a bit tight. They allocate just enough wage budget for us to get by and no more, so when there's a bank holiday, they can't cope with paying everyone extra. The other great thing they tried to do is to tell us that we weren't getting England only bank holidays as we were based in Scotland. Fine I hear you say. Ah, but stick with me, my story gets better. We can't have Scotland only holidays either, as we are run by a company in England. Bastards. Needless to say, this wasn't acceptable and was changed but it is a bit annoying that they should even consider it.  If they don't want to treat us right we won't stay. Simple  Jack

      So, we hear that the 'allies' are keen to leave the running of Iraq to the locals. I bet they are, after all, its just been a total shambles from the moment they claimed to have one. I thought the war finished a year ago, but they still seem to be fighting. Almost makes you wander why they want to stay. Oh yeah, incidentally they haven't yet found Bin Laden either. Still, minor details.  Whenever I turn on the news these days I ama more amazed by the total shambles that's going on out there. It started as a mess with a pathetic excuse for them to go in there and now it is even worse. I mean, they haven't found Bin Laden and they only produce Hussein when the tide of public opinion is turning away from them so dramatically as to be a concern in an election year (whihc has nothing to do with it of course).  Talking about elections, it seems that there is a large threat to the civilised world from terrorists. Apparently there is a large threat to remove the incumbent president and fight against the saviour of humainty's good works. Nice touch that. If you are working to unseat George Bush (in an election year remember) then you can be classified as a terrorist or non- legal combatant (or something) and bunged away to rot. Isn't this known as a dictatorship, I must check my dictionary.  If this is all it takes call me a terrorist  Jack

      If I thought that last time's rantings were just the uninformed blitherings of an opinionated mind, yesterday at work put me totally off that idea. What with the weather getting better, Edinburgh has now become 'Tourist-tastic' and is full of people who appear to forget the simplest things like how to walk in a straight line as soon as they leave their own country. This irritates the hell out of the locals and so there is a lot more pushing and shoving accompanied by random swearing etc. etc.  Surely went you go abroad you expect to have to use the language of the country that you are going to? I mean how far do you think you would get going abroad with no idea what people were saying to you or what any of the signs mean? But here they are, seemingly confused, but only because they haven't a clue as to what's going on. Then they get upset when you don't understand what they are going on about and annoyed whan you try to talk to them  People eh?  Jack

      Why is it that people always think that the world revolves around them, to the extent of ignoring and sometimes endangering others? I mean, there have been many times like the story Iwas told by a friend of mine. A car was reversing into a parking space, with another car coming up behind it. As the first car was reversing, a person walked out in front of it to cross the road. Whereupon, the following car scraped its way down the side of the parking car in order to get past rather than waiting and nearly hit the pedestrian. Not only that, but the driver swore at the pedestrian and raced off. This always happens with people in cars. Why is it so important to be 15 feet further along the road that you have to dive in front of a car that is trying to join the traffic. Does it get you home any quicker? Apparently, BBCs Top Gear discovered that if ou let people in front of you at every opportunity, often it takes exactly the same amount of time to get anywhere. How about that eh?  Working in a shop you see this a lot. Especially in my shop which is very narrow and doesn't allow much room for people to get past. People always think they are the most important person in the shop and they can just push past and nobody will notice. I had to throw two people out on Sunday, because one insisted on pushing through (knocking over a display but they ignored that) and the other started to shout at him that she was here first and he should ask to be excused and gave the impression that she  may  move for him. Eventually I had to send them both different ways around the centre.  I have seen a lot more of life than the 19 year olds that I share a flat with and I decided sometime before coming to Univeristy that I didn't care about what happened and I only wanted to worry about things that concerned  me . Assuch I feel so much better and I don't get stressed about anything (apart from the after effects of giving up smoking) The others let all sorts of things bother them and I simply don't care. It makes me laugh.  I don't know if less stress makes you live longer but what you do get is better  Jack

      This internet is really starting to annoy me now. I don't know what it is, but I've been trying to get onto this website for my course in various different ways for two days now and every time the damn thing just stop loading. Every damn time. AAARGH!  Anyway, yesterday was abit of non event really. We are now starting to get our results back from the middle of term tests, but I'm really not interested as they seem to be exactly the same as they always are. Reasonably good but not spectacular but his won't make any difference to the final result. Could you believe it? We slog our guts out to learn for three tests, plan a lesson and get an essay in in the  same week . What does it turn out that our education tutor says  'Oh, dear. If you want to you can touch up your essays next week and hand them in in a weeks time' . Of course after working that hard under such pressure, naturally nobody wanted to do so. She seemed a little put out that we didn't take her up on it.  In depth analysis on BBC breakfast TV this morning. What does your hair say about you? I didn't see the article, but I would say absoulutely nothing. I've had a lot of different haircuts in my time and I don't think that it changes the sort of person you are (excewpt that if you are bald you get more colds). It's nice to see our licence fee is being spent wisely.  Don't you love terrestrial programming  Jack

      I can see this coming a bit of a running theme, so I'll put part I so i can reheat it later on if something happens as ridiculous as what happened the other day.  Whilst on holiday in Oil Country, this president, this most powerful man in the world, this self- style protector of the masses, this man who, with a mere word, can have people disposed of if he wished, managed to fall off a bicycle and narrowly miss a tree. Talk about art imitating life. I was reminded of  urlLink The West Wing  Season 1 Episode 1 and the President crashing into a tree. Back then I thought it unlikely that this would be possible what with all the security and secret service and stuff, but I didn't reckon with the ingenuity of human stupidity. I man, this guy manages to embarras or humiliate himself at every opportunity and doesn't seem to notice. He may not be a decent world leader but he gets my vote for comedy relief every time.  And this is the guy who's supposed to be protecting everybody from all the bad people out there. From what I've seen, this term is defined as everyone I say so, since the Israelis aren;t being the nicest fo people, and yet he refuses to do anything about it (the fact that there are some very useful business deals happening between them has nothing to do with it- I'm assured)  Just thank whoever you believ in that American politicians can only serve for a short time  Jack

      And oh, man what a gorgeous weekend it was as well, the sun was shining and the birds were singing and where was I? Working. What a surprise. Still, it's a few more pennies in the old beer kitty. Would rather have been in the sunshine making the most of doing as little as possible though. Still, the best part was that I could laugh at my flatmate's sunburn all evening.  It's amazing how prejudiced people can be. I noticed this at work when every time a bunch of kids come in the shop, if they're wearing caps and/or track suits with dyed blonde hair, he always puts us on security watch. it would do him no end of good just to talk to people as normal human beings for a change and maybe he'd realise they're the same as everyone else. This was compunded by Top Gear. They had Jordan on (who's from Essex and sounds like it) I was quite prepared to watch and listen as she thrashed her way around in a cheap car as i didn't know she was into cars and it was quite interesting and entertaining. My flatmate, however, couldn't get over the fact that she had an annoying accent and wouldn't listen to anything she said. Such is life  If you've got anything to say I will listen no matter who you are  Jack

      And what a week it has been. Since the lectures are coming to a close, I haven't had to have been in uni since Tuesday. In fact, the only reason I'm here now is that I've been asked to talk to some inspectors about the maths department so I can tell them what I think. After that, the only thing to do is hope that the notes I got through the term are good enough (as you don't expect me to have read any of them yet) and revise like mad.  So, it appears from some government research that one in twenty kids have ADHD, or attention deficit disorder. Now, call me cynical if you like, but in recent years the number of kids diagnosed with this has gone up quite remakably. Now, some may argue that this is because more is understood about the condition by experts and they can treat it better, but it seems to me that at least part of it is that the condition is more understood by  parents  and so they can use it as an excuse not to be able to control their kids. Anyhow, it doesn't really bode well for having 1-2 kids like that in every class you teach. Aargh.  Went out to see the new  urlLink Harry Potter film  yeaterday. Cue groans here. But, evenb though the three main kids are considered slightly annoying (but looking at it dispassionately you can see they are good young actors) the thing that I certainly didn't appreciate is that the rest of the cast are made up of the finest British actors there are, and so each and every one puts in a fantastic performance, making it an exceptional film. I'll probably even go to see the next one.  Also yesterday I bought a few DVDs. I got the  urlLink  Open Range  and Bad Taste. The first is a good story that I saw earlier this year at the cinema. Kevin Costner was born to do westerns and since I'm a bit of a western freak, I loved it. The other is the funniest and grossest film I've ever seen. Words can't describe it. Really. If you haven't seen it yuo haven't lived.  Jack

      And so the time draws near yet again. Yes, it's nearly the end of anotherterm and another year. Only one week of revision and three exams and then months of glorious freedom (if you don;t count the teaching placemant I've got to do before next term.  It's a bit weird to think that, once this term ends, I'll be half way through my degree course. I mean, I might have learnt something, but it doesn't feel I'm half way to being a qualified mathematician. I knpw a few more things that I did before I started but there must be something more out there that they're hiding from us. Everything so far seems to be preparation for something else.  Still, on Friday I'll be talking to the inspectors about what I think about the department. I don't know if they expect any startling insights but if they ask me a quaestion then I guess I'll have to answer it in the best way I know.   This may be all very well, but with two more years left, everything from now on counts towards the final mark, so it's time to stop shirking (something I've managed very well so far thank you  very much) and actually get down and do some work.  The ironic thing is, though that I decided to do teaching first and then picked a subject I was good at when I chose to do this course, but now, what with the badly organised education part of the course, I'm totally sick of the teaching part and really enjoying the maths. In fact, if the teaching placement does not go well this summer, I am very tempted to go out and change course to the primary teaching one. Whether this means the I've got to redo some bits or go somewhere else (maybe Moray House) I don't know but right now I don't care.  Isn't it fun finding out  Jack

      Well today my dad's 400 and somethingth birthday and good luck to him. I almost thought that I had forgotten to get him anything what with him living about 500 miles away, this would be quite awkward. Never fear, though, I managed to get it to him when I saw him in April, its just that I've forgotten what it was that I actually got for him. I'm sure with a little gentle questions I'll find out sooner or later.  Yesterday was just gorgeous. Now that lectures are coming to a close, it gives me more opportunity to just sit around in the sunshine doing nothing and that's exactly what I spent yesterday luchtime doing. Out the back of university there's an artificial river bed in the middle of a field of poppies with some really big rocks scattered around. This is where I like to just sit and do nothing. The rock heats up like crazy in the sushine so it's like getting grilled and you can tan without even turning over. Nice. So now I've get red- brown arms which will have to keep me warm as all of a sudden its raining again. No surprises there then.  The  urlLink RSPB  has decided to find out why there are less birds around than there used to be, and to do this they have developed a very simple but completely bizarre experiment. What you do is this. You drive around the countryside for a bit and when you get home you just count the number of bugs splatted on your registration plate. Simple. Trouble is, if you're going around killing bugs by driving into them doesn;t this mean that there will be even less for the birds to eat?  One of the great mysteries of the modern world  Jack

      It has got to be the best time of the year. The sun is out and the days are long and so are the nights because, for two weeks only, there will be no sleep because the Stanley Cup finbals are here.  Yes, I know that the Americans are inconsiderate to be putting these things on in the middle of the night so that they start at around 1 in the morning, so you have to find something to do before then and they finish at about 5 am so there really is no point in going to bed before getting up for another working day, but I wouldn't swap it for anyhting. My team may have been knocked out of the competittion up to three weeks ago but that doesn't matter. I've got a new team to support for the next little bit and I will follow them passionately until the end of the season.   The say that it is the hardest trophy on all sports to win. Whilst this may be the usual American way of just not counting anything they don;t understand or take part in, it may be quite true. Whereas there are six mnths of battling during the regular season, all this counts for is positioning for the last two months and to select your opponents. Weird things always happen, this year the champions of the Western division ended the 82 game regular season in sixth, but none of this matters as they are considered the best from the west.  Suddenly, people you've never heard from before are hogging the headlines all over America, and, on the other side, one second of madness at a crucial time can undo a brilliant season of work and could (and has) lead to you being run out of town in disgrace.   Whilst I would have liked to have seen my team triumphant, it is nice to see that two teams who are considered to have less history and glory than many others are fighting it out for the big proze. Go them.  Now to find something to do until the next season comes around.  Jack

      A pretty good weekend all round really. It rained on Saturday, but I don't care cos I was working. Hah! It's a funny thing to see all these tourist types wandering round Edinburgh in their T shirts and shorts in the pouring rain. How little they knew about the weather here before they came.  Sunday saw me goping to see the new Trot film. You know, for something that has been plugged as much as it has and with all those famous people in it it hasn't half got a load of boring drivel in it that makes it form a good film into one which suddenly stops in the middle fo the action to go on about something I don't really want to know about still. It's good to see they didn't just arbitrarily make things up like they tend to do in modern films and stuck to the original stroy (yeah right)  I also managed to see about 10 seconds of the  urlLink formula 1  on Sunday. In fact all I saw was Schumacher getting out of his car having won and hugging his team- mate. Then I turned it off. It's a bit much when you can correctly predicat that the Ferraris will come first and second then Jensen Button with both McLarens engines' blowing up. I mean it won't do that much for the popularity of an already dying sport. In fact I won;t hold my breath for the next round or even get out of bed for it.  It would be nice to be surprised more often  Jack

      It's been noticable recently, what with the football and the European and local elections, that more and more people are spouting out more and more random statistics that jhave absolutely no bearing on anything that could happen, except that, because of their very existence, people use them to distact themselves and not perform.  For example, it has been said that ing games after Michael Owen (England striker) has a bad game, which he did against France- who, incidentally, before last week's game we had never lost to in a competitive international etc. etc. Anyway, oh yeah, after that, he has a 65% increase in his game. First off, how can you measure playing 65% better? The other point is doesn't it depend on the opposition as to how much better he performs. Surely his production against Switzerland would be better than aginst the formar World champions, who, incidentally, in their last competition failed to score a goal so...  What's my point? Well, my point is what's their point? I mean there must be somebody out there who comes out with all these statistics, burning the midnight oil and all of that just to come up with a fact that is either completely irrelevant and does not affect anything or is something that everybody knows and you could get the same answers just by asking some guy off the street.  Another point of it is the television ratings. Apparently, somebody asks lots of households in Britain what they will be watching on TV that week and on the basis of this, programmes are cancelled or given extra series. Now, who are these people? Nobody I know has ever been asked by these people what they are watching and it appears that what they do watch is most mindless drivel. Even if I was asked what I would be watching that week, I wouldn't know because I only decide what I want to watch when it's time top turn the channel over. How does it work?  Besides, have you even met 0.4 of a child?  Jack

      And we're off. Yes, the exam season is well under way with the first of my three having been got out of the way yesterday. Not a bad little showing if I do say so myself, I had that unusual feeling of looking at the question, not really knowing what I was supposed to do, but as I worked through it, the whole thing slowly unfolded in my head. I think i probably did better than I thought I would as I managed to quote the mathematical proofs verbatim, with all the fiddly tedchnical guff that normal people manage to forget. So here's hoping.  All this, of course will become academic (har har) by this afternoon as we have some kind of weird Physics typew module exam today. Yeah, in a maths course, but trust me, that's the most normal part of this course. Fortunately, all of the people I have spoken to have as little a clue as to what's going on as I do so that's a bit of a relief. Anyhow, we've got a bit of a leaving do for a couple of thye guys at work this evening so even if it doesn't go so well there will always be an excuse for more alcohol. I'll probably try to do something like I did yesterday when, idly flicking through the notes pretending to revise, I noticed a bit I didn't know and lo and behold it comes up. magic  Further to yesterday's moanings, now England have managed to beat somebody (anybody) all is right with the world. The sun will shine and we'll probably win the tournament (if you ask the experts). Yes, we managed to beat Switzerland (as expected) and suddenly the experts' opinions of the team have swung right round again.  Isn't it annoying always being right.  Jack

      Some of you may not be fully aware, but there's is a football type competition on at the moment and England are involved. In fact, if you listen to the various TV and news tpyes around, they are the only team playing.  What amazes me is that they seem to think that we are the best team out there when, and I wish it wasn;t the case, we clearly aren't. The first match of the competition was against France. They are the former World and European champions, and rightly so, as they have about half a dozen of the best players in the world in their side. Leading up to the game the tone was one of cautious optimism that, on the right day, way may be able to get something out of the game. Until game day. Then, certain pundits felt that the  'awesome arrogance'  of the French side would let us plucky Engalnders to sneak in and take the game from them. After all, they were confident in their ability (well so would you let's face it). But surely they would be more carful about such an important game, and considering that in the last World Cup, they went out in three games without scoring a goal.  So, the match starts and both teams play well, and amazingly England lead 1-0 going into half time. Well, as you can expect this leads to a bit of premature celebraing and the predictions of the final score get a bit stupid, as if they realise that they are losing against a country that is obviously more important than they are so the should feel grateful that we'll let tham getaway without being flogged as well. Still, in the dying seconds, literally, it's about injury time, up pop the French score 2 goals, stuck 2 fingers up at us and go home. Shock. But what is to com is better.  Every news report and every game in the other groups (there are 4 groups with each group playing in order) discusses and disects the goings on that led to the goals. They carry press conferences with anybody who may have any connection to the team (even if it is just one of the trainers) and 'experts' discuss what they should have done differently. Of course, over the nmext few matches similar situations are enacted with different teams. Every time, the commentators notice this and remind you, if you've managed to forget, of what happened on the time that actually mattered.  Now, England have to play Switzerland and, yes, they do have to win to have a chance to go through. But wait a minute, they are not the greatest team there has ever been and I don;t think it has occurred to the team that they could lose. Since they won't. But now all the pundits are going on about how it's time to face up and all the team are worried now there is nowhere to hide. Rubbish.  The team know how good they are. It's only the media's opinions that change  Jack

      That's right, I'm back. Yes, I've been away, revising like the busy bee I really am. Technically, there's actually no reason for me to do so as I only need 9 out of 12 module passes every year, and have got 9 already with other term's exams, but ther is such a thing as pride you know. Incidentally- what's wrong with being prideful anyway. Sureyl if you take pride in yourself and your work then there is no reason for anyone to come dsown on you saying that it's a bad thing. Ho hum.  Also this week, my revision was slightly distracted by having to have my wisdom teeth pulled. In fact they've needed doing for about 6 years, but I never actually got around to it until I went back to university and so I get all my health stuff free so why not? There's a bit of a catch here though. When I first applied for assistance, I wasn;t working, and so I got all the help I could need, so I made this appointment. However, by the time I have come to have the operation actually done, they have re-assessed me at the working rate and i am now liable for a bit (still it's better than nothing) and it's too late to back out now. I'll spare the gory details, suffice to say that I only got onbce side done (the other is due next Monday) and the upper took about 10 minutes to encourage out, but the lower took a full three quarters of an hour, with both dentist and assistant heaving away and using pulling things and extra incisions. Ow. Still I spoke like the POntious Pilate guy in  urlLink Monty Python  which was very amusing to all I'm sure.  Still, you'll be glad to know I've recovered in time for them to rip the other side.
