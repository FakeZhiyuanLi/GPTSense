       urlLink Feds warn against Microsoft's browser   but the software giant's stock appeared not to feel a significant negative impact from a government group's warning against using the Internet Explorer Web browser.     The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, known as CERT, issued a "vulnerability note" saying that computer users should not use the Internet Explorer browser because of security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to launch attacks on personal computers and corporate networks.   Hmmm, that Bill Gates is one sly fella.  GW should make him VP, cause @ this point microsoft can access just about anyones data @ any time.

From the article:  'On Tuesday, Cheney, serving in his role as president of the Senate, appeared in the chamber for a photo session. A chance meeting with Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, became an argument about Cheney's ties to Halliburton Co., an international energy services corporation, and President Bush's judicial nominees. The exchange ended when Cheney offered some crass advice.   'Fuck yourself,' said the man who is a heartbeat from the presidency.'   ...Even if the Senate were in session, the vice president, though constitutionally the president of the Senate, is an executive branch official and therefore free to use whatever language he likes.'

I know, I know � you may have heard the same thing before from those that think it�s cool to hate Microsoft; but I�m not one of those guys. I�m actually an MCSE and I happen to like quite a few of Microsoft�s products. Rather than lump me into the Microsoft-basher category, consider for a moment why you use the browser you use, and humor me by entertaining the notion � if even for a second � that switching to another might be worth your while. My argument is simple: the benefits of using IE are too few - and the faults too great � to put off the adoption of an alternative any longer"

       urlLink Moxie Congress Online Newsletter Summer 2004 Edition : "     The Legend of Lieut. Moxie.... ....It has been said that after the Civil War a Lieut. Moxie, went down to the vast unexplored jungles of South America and 'discovered' while exploring near the Strait of Magellan a 'starchy plant' know to local natives to have great powers....the rest was history. Sadly.... Modern History has never documented anyone named Lt. Moxie that had ever fought for either Army in the War Between the States. Furthermore, no scientific reference has ever been published on any South American 'starchy plant much like our asparagus' that has medicinal properties that gave a 'durable, vigorous feeling' to the 19th Century local natives. Oh well. So much for the Legend. There were several versions anyway. The stories made great copy, and demand for a tonic extracted from the mysterious plant increased nationally."

       urlLink HP Compaq Business Desktop DC7100 Review : "HP Compaq Business Desktop DC7100 Review June 22, 2004 By Eric Grevstad  We Wouldn't Mind Our Boss Buying Us One Business desktops are generally more cautious, conservative designs than their consumer-PC counterparts. They appeal to IT managers' concerns such as network manageability and software images guaranteed to stay stable for a year or more, instead of snarling deployment plans with short-lived video drivers or quick-changing configurations.  But IT managers are as tempted by new technology as retail shoppers, especially when new tech brings real improvements such as faster graphics or Serial ATA storage. So as of next week, the spot in HP's office desktop line described as 'lifecycle-optimized' yet able to 'meet the performance needs of demanding users' -- now filled by the D530 series based on Intel's 865G chipset -- will belong to the HP Compaq Business Desktop DC7100.

      I live on a 70 acre farm in New Hampshire.  Although I do not grow any crops for sale on an annual basis, it is considered a farm becuse it has barns (2), and saleable crops such as hardwood and hay.  I lease out about 20 acres of pasture to a friend who has 19 head of beef cattle (mainly herfords) for  summer grazing.  The article describes how by using a little out of the box thinking, we can work more productively using current in the box technology.  TIFTON, Georgia (AP) -- Farms of the not-too-distant future could be managed through wireless computer networks that allow farmers to sit in their pickups with a laptop and drive tractors, monitor soil moisture and even feed the hogs remotely.  http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/biztech/06/18/wireless.farming.ap/index.html

      Toshiba to Unveil TV-Capable Laptop.  Okay.  So I get one of these to replace my TV, DVD Player, CD player and receiver.  I can then also get rid of my telephone by using Vonage VOIP and their soft phone on my laptop. I then get a data/celphone card for the laptop so I can connect to the net anywhere and voila !!!   Think about it.   When I moved into my dorm room in college I had a HUGE stereo system and about 500 vinyl records.  No computer (1975), nor  digital anything.  My first computer class was programming using punchcards.  I failed.

      NEC announced yesterday that they are introducing "a new software for microcontrollers that detects counterfeit battery products in mobile phones and digital still camera batteries":  "The growing number of worldwide incidences involving inferior counterfeit batteries is a considerable source of concern for manufacturers and customers alike. NEC Electronics' authentication software offers a highly effective yet affordable solution to help detect such unauthorized products and prevent the damage caused by them." said Kazuo Nakamura, General Manager, Device SI Division, NEC Electronics.  Preventing damage is one thing, but stiffling competition is another. Who's to say that NEC won't use this authentication as an excuse to sue "unauthorized" after-market competitors under the DMCA for making compatible replacement batteries? After all, in order to be compatible, wouldn't these products would have to mimick the authentication codes of the original batteries? Such practices are exactly what got Static Control and Skylink sued in the printer cartridge and garage door cases mentioned above.

       urlLink    Pic of me vactioning in Jamaica this July, Dunns River Falls in background.  Jamaica is a real interesting country, struggleing to address it's social problems with a ineffective Govt.  Murders are a daily occurance mainly due to the drug trade.  In talking to the locals many feel that Jamaican society traditionaly revolved around the Mother as being the Leader of the family and traditional values were in stilled in the children.  With young women gettting hooked on drugs, and embracing a lifestyle that deemphasizes family, the role of the strong mother is dissapearing, leading to the breakdown of their culture.  Very Sad to see such poverty and violence in such a beautiful and abundant land.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink One man and his dog and his laptop | The Register this illustrates is the power of integration, or the lack of it with mainstream vendors. If I could get things set up with old technology, why exactly have the big IT companies been unable to bring such capabilities to market? While Microsoft and Intel still struggle to deliver the perfect tablet PC with integrated voice recognition, an old PC with an old operating system and an old version of a software package were perfectly capable For the past five years, there have existed opportunities to mobilize the masses, and they didn’t require multi-billion, high-bandwidth infrastructures. Not everyone is going to want to use voice recognition, but let’s face it – the idea of people walking about chattering into space is no longer as unnerving as it was. And what if – just imagine – voice recognition turns out to be the missing piece in the entire mobility puzzle? Not that we should all be lugging laptops around, but many of us are doing this anyway.

         The memory cards in most cameras are virtually indestructible, found Digital Camera Shopper magazine.      Five memory card formats survived being boiled, trampled, washed and dunked in coffee or cola.  Sounds to me the way to go with storing digital media is to use large capacity flash memory.   I now have all my music on a hard drive, 100 gbs.  Do I get a tape back up? Back up to another hard drive?  If it wsa on flash memory would it last forever?   with a 4 gb gflash mem drive going for around $1500 bucks, its not affordable now.   BUt what about a couple years fom now.   A 20 gb flash drive as a backup?
