      3 weeks.  I've washed dishes twice voluntarily and once it was just sandwiches and paper plates.  This is freemasonry at the phoenix lodge here in SF.  I've been drawn to secret societies, the occult, conspiracy theory and extradimensional travel since I was a pot sticker loving street fighter 2 playing chunky punk living on Menalto Ave. in EPA or seven for those counting in man years.  So after finally making it through the Illuminatus book almost 2 years ago I've been on a grail quest.  The research I had done suggested freemasonry was the foundation for so many other orders I admired..the O.T.O, the Golden Dawn...but freemasonry appeared in the roots for everything from the American revolution, the French revolution, our constitution, declaration of independence, everyone from Crowley to Oscar Wilde to Mark Twain to George Washington to Jack Johnson to Ben Franklin had been one and I wanted to know what secrets they kept too.  I had dabbled in darkness with Lavey's COS and been freaked out by the spermo-gnostic aspects of the OTO(not disgusted, just would rather supply my own than risk it) so freemasonry's appeal lay chiefly in its perceived nobility.  A higher calling above politics and religion with the mission to unite all men in brotherhood regardless of appearance or ancestry, where I could practice the rasta prophet Marley's words "... until the color of a man's skin, is of no more importance than the color of his eyes ..." and where the concept of InI would be understood as the golden rule. No titles, degrees and shiny badges for me, thank you.  Nothing is true, everything is permitted.  Because the grail I seek contains no truth nor do I recognize any ultimate truths.  The quest is the journey, chaos the magic, the meaning is writ, life just the script I write myself in.  Invisible identities contained without I and within you.  Shattering boundaries that connect us.  The schizophrenia is a symptom of our society not the patients it manifests in...I survive 9 to 5 become the dog walker smoke talker absorb the information drug and do it again where is my transcendence and iluminification.  Conversations that teeter on the forbidden fence of politics and religion...so many Christians.  They don't comment on my pentagram ring and I don't say anything about the big one on the temple wall...

      coincidences...I've definitely been trying to better attend them.&nbsp; First, a few weeks ago Cosso is talking story in the morning at work about&nbsp;how hot it was the night before and tossing and turning trying to get cool&nbsp;and KNEEING his girl in the back and her waking him up yelling, "what the hell did you do that for!?!"&nbsp; It  was  hot that night and I remembered tossing and turning a little myself and damn everyone knows how hard it is to keep cool&nbsp;on those rare hot&nbsp;summer nights in SF without no fans or AC.&nbsp; OK...I get home and I'm smoking on the porch with April and talking story...Not really the most interesting day I've ever had so I start telling Cosso's story.&nbsp; April's eyes go big and she almost drops her cigarette...turns out I had KNEED her in the back last night too.&nbsp; I just sleep a little deeper than Cosso and she couldn't have woke&nbsp; me up unless she kneed me back... so, gracefully, she went back to sleep.&nbsp; Weird, yes.&nbsp; Significant? ?...no idea.   Now back to present day...two weeks later...I'm getting excited about the masonic picnic April and I are going to tomorrow.&nbsp; Reading up on the history according to Manly P. Hall and really digging his p.o.v. esoterically speaking that is..connecting the dots between ancient mystery schools of Egypt, Greece and Rome and the craft.&nbsp; A few at the lodge don't like Mr. Hall and a few recommend him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I definitely plan on reading  The Lost Keys of Freemasonry  before I undertake any degree ritual.&nbsp; He supposedly wrote that before he was 21 and without ever belonging to any lodge and in it details blue lodge masonry and the allegory and symbolism behind the first three degree rituals.&nbsp; Whoa...way off track.&nbsp; So, I'm perusing Hall's organization website:( urlLink http://www.prs.org/mphbio.htm )  and I see this book by him:   ADVENTURES IN UNDERSTANDING   which trips some sort of alarm in my head and I run over to my bookshelf to see my very own copy of  JOURNEY IN TRUTH  by Manly P. Hall.&nbsp; At first I have no idea how that book got on my shelf when I was so desperate to read something by him just a few seconds before.&nbsp; Physical manifestation of thelemic will?&nbsp; Naw...I got it as a bithday present from Nicole when I was working as a YMCA camp counselor in Wilmington, NC one summer.&nbsp;&nbsp; She msut have known I would need it some day.&nbsp; Coincidences...now I'm starting to pay more attention.

      Just as the devil has many faces, I've seen many places And I’ve got no more patience for our total complacence All I hate is these racists who still believe in races Just labels to divide and displace us Make us reactionary like acids and bases An if you don't like my looks, then avert your faces  Cause I got this light skin but a darker flow An I don't need religion cause there's truth in my soul My life's education worth more than ice and gold I've learnt that salvation can't be bought or sold Sometimes my love feels frozen and cold Then all I really need is to pack a bowl  My mind is young, but my spirit's old I've forgotten everything that I've ever been told Now all I know is how to rock a show With some wicked prose, It's the path I chose Because when I speak is when I feel relief Which strengthens my belief that we're all just love thieves Stealing that feeling from whoever we can Trying to find our place in this master plan My eyes are still new but they've seen plenty My pride has bent me and my hate has spent me I'm sorry you leant me your heart But you had mine right from the start I was so scared of being bored Til I got bored of being scared I sold the devil my soul and Now I use my father's instead When I lost him, I lost my twin Castor and Pollux So I didn’t know where to begin I thought I'd wander in sin Break before I bend Die before I spend My life regretting What I’ve tried so hard to forget

      Off the top of my head and from the bottom of my heart Guess who’s back from the dead with some wisdom to impart Because time asks those questions with no easy answers And if it isn't your heart, then it'll probably be cancer InI see us eating our dreams just to fill our bellies That’s why I don't buy the faith that religion's selling So they call me a devil and call me a heathen I just call them blind and then I call it even And if you really believe a church will save your soul… That salvation’s something to be bought and sold Then stuff your dollars in their collection trays And at the gates of heaven… tell their god you paid I pray Jesus will save earth from his own believers and their institutions of immoral thievery I know the son of man was never a god And nobody but me will ever be my lord So forgive this heresy and forgive these sins But when you try to convert me, you ain’t never gonna win Cause my body’ll break before my mind’ll bend And know that holy bible was written by men And that there's a few chapters that ya’ll haven't read So listen up and listen up real good And let me make one thing well understood God can’t be found in churches of wood and stone But in every molecule of every bone The only god I know lives inside our souls An he doesn't want us to bow He wants us to grow To see the light in all mankind And the beauty in the chaos Of this whole design…

      August 9, 2001  Dear Librarians,          I am composing this letter in an effort to apologize for my actions in the Wilmington Public Library on July 20th.  While I can replace neither the time nor energy you were forced to expend due to my behavior that day, I do hope you will accept my apology for the trauma I caused you by asking you to reprint those job listings that had the phone numbers cut off.   	A public service job requires one to be patient and accommodating to patrons, but now I realize that I, too, am charged with the responsibility of being understanding when you believe circumstances are out of your control.  In addition I would like to apologize for questioning your competency and becoming agitated when your responses were not to my satisfaction.  While patience has never been one of my strongest suites, this hellish  experience at the hands of your comrades at the Wilmington PD will remind me to make a more concerted effort to do so in the future.  	Again, I extend my sincerest apologies for violating your policies, as well as the interruption in your demanding work responsibilities at the library.   I appreciate your consideration and hope you will find it somewhere in your hearts to forgive me when you feel ready.  Humbled by the grace of god(...and those billyclubs),  Jonathon Michael Jacob

       written may 2003   After I graduated from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill with a degree in Journalism & Mass Communications in May of 2001, I worked as a dishwasher in an Indonesian restaurant for 2 months while I searched for a job in television news.  In late July of 2001, I was offered a job as morning producer for KGNS Pro 8 News in Laredo, Texas.  The station faxed an employment contract to me and gave me 24 hours to decide whether or not to accept the position.  I was never offered, nor had the opportunity to visit Laredo and KGNS before I signed the employment contract.  I paid my own moving expenses and relocation costs necessary to accept the job and began working for Pro 8 News.   The contract stated I would make $7.93 and hour with the opportunity to earn overtime.  I assumed that overtime would be at least my regular hourly wage.  However, when I received my first paycheck it was lower than expected.  KGNS had unilaterally altered the terms of the contract to my material detriment.  Instead of paying me $7.93 an hour with overtime they had changed my employee status to exempt at a salary of $16,000 a year.  When I approached the general manager about the changes to my contract without my consent, Mary Nell Sanchez said the station was under investigation by the Texas Wage and Labor Board and was being compelled to change the station’s overtime policy.  The new overtime policy would pay employees half their regular hourly wage for each hour of overtime worked.  I voiced my displeasure about the changes and was told I could leave if I did not like them.  However, after paying for my relocation out of my own pocket, I lacked the money to move again so I continued performance of my duties under the contract in good faith although they were in breach of the contract.  If I had been paid under the terms of the contract I had signed, working an average of 50 hours a week, I would have made over $20,000 dollars a year.  $4000 more than I was actually being paid.  I spoke with the General Manager two more times regarding the changes made to my compensation under the contract and never received a satisfactory reply.  After four months as producer of the morning and noon news, I was promoted to the 6 & 10pm evening newscasts.  Along with this promotion came a $2,000 a year raise, but I never signed a new contract or received a new title.  After producing the 6 & 10pm newscasts for a month, our entire Spanish news team resigned en masse and walked off the job on the same day.  Subsequently, I became responsible for producing the 5 pm newscast along with my other duties.  I performed this additional duty without complaint nor additional compensation until a new producer could be found.  During this period I began to look for new employment that would pay me at least as much as I had expected to make under the terms of contract I had signed with KGNS.  I eventually interviewed with KMOL in San Antonio and was hired as an associate producer making $29,000 a year.  I put in two weeks notice of my resignation at KGNS and prepared to leave for the new job.  One week before I was to leave, I received a call from Anne Nau, Executive Producer at KMOL.  Anne Nau told me the General Manger of KGNS; Mary Nell Sanchez had threatened to sue KMOL if they went through with my hiring.  I insisted I was not under contract to KGNS because they had breached my contract upon my arrival in Laredo and she asked me to fax her a copy of the contract.  As I was faxing her the contract, I was called into the General Manger’s office along with KGNS Executive Producer, Richard Rocha.  In Mary Nell Sanchez’s office she told me she and spoken to KMOL and planned on suing both KMOL and myself if I tried to work there.   I again voiced my opinion that KGNS had breached their contract with me first and that I was free to pursue other employment since they were not paying me according to the terms of my contract.  She called me a “traitor” and said I had “betrayed the station” before suspending me without pay for a week and demoting me back to the morning show.  She also said she would make use of her extensive contacts to ensure that I could not work for any other station in Texas or the rest of the nation.  KMOL retracted their job offer in the face of litigation by KGNS and I went through with my resignation, leaving KGNS on May 31, 2002.  I subsequently moved to Orlando spent the summer building houses for a construction company before I got a job selling cars with Saturn of Orlando.  I have been selling an average of thirty cars a month for the last year but the experience has made me realize how much I miss having a passion for my work.

      How can I begin to explain all the pain  that became anger that became bittersweet rage Can’t afford to spend anymore days Imprisoned by this system that I didn’t choose or create Could we contemplate chaos from my temporary autonomous zone?

      I definitely believe in magic and fairy tales...to some extent every fantastic story, fairy tale and nursery rhyme we've ever heard is true is some sense...whoever wrote them had to get the idea from somewhere, part of our collective unconscious, the veiled connections and shared ancient memories we all contain...I think magic is just the manifestation of ideas and will into physical reality...anybody with a shopping list is familar with a low grade of magic...you desire honey and bread, so your body is the vehicle to transform that desire into reality...On a larger scale, our long term plans and dreams (college, marriage, children) are better examples of magic...will manifesting into reality through effort and ritual...I've been trying to think of how to put the connection I see between rastafarianism, rosicrucianism, freemasonry and the original gnostic christians into words...so here goes...I think modern Freemasonry arose as a resistance to the Inquisition...the intolerance of the Catholic church for heretics, other forms of Christianity, science and any dissent was as dark a period as any in history...modern freemasonry based upon tolerance and universal brotherhood arose during the inquisition as a opposing and balancing force...the secret of freemasonry is the same as the ancient secret of gnostic christianity, the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, and later the Ordo Templi Orientis under Aleister Crowley...this secret has lately become sanitized and popualrized in Dan Brown's "The Davinci Code"...The theory runs that Jesus was flesh and blood, a man, who was not chaste as the church would have us believe, but in fact married to Mary Magdalene and the father of children with her (a bloodline known as the Merovignians)...the holy grail was not a chalice at all but the holy bloodline of christ which survives to this day under the protection of another secret society called the Priory of Scion...that was as far as "The Davinci Code" took it...lately I stumbled across something that takes the story further...some say Jesus and Mary practiced sex magic rituals which were the source of the power behind the many miraculous workings...they say it was Mary who actually initiated Jesus into a sex magic order descended from ancient egyptian rituals...Jesus would base his own myth upon the myth of Osiris, the dead and risen god, that he actually had himself  crucified to experience near physical death and actually live out the myth of Osiris, resurrected through Mary in his children...so the secret is sex and ritualized sex magic...the uniting of opposites..the word rosicrucian means roughly, rosy cross...rose=vagina and cross=penis... when combined in sexual union communion with the divine can be achieved...actual gnosis...or direct experience of god.  So the great secret of all these orders is...that the holy grail, the sacrament of Jesus Christ himself was the comingled sexual secretions of man and woman mixed together and consumed...Freemasonry performs charitable works in the name of "The Widow's Son"...the widow is Mary and the son is both the resurrected spirit of Christ and the actual bloodline of Jesus and Mary (the Merogvignians)...Freemasonry's most guarded secret is that they are the descendants of the original gnostic christians followers of Christ before a church was ever created to pervert, distort and glaze over the teachings of Christ they didn't like...Jesus himself cautions against this in the Gospels of Christ that were discovered in the dead sea scolls..." search not for me in buildings of wood and stone ."   I would venture to guess 95% of Freemasons either are unaware of or don't believe this connection and just enjoy the fraternal aspects of the organization or the good works they do....Many of the concepts and ideas expressed in rastafarian lyrics reflect the same ideals of tolerance and universal brotherhood that make up the foundation of freemasonry and gnostic christianity...I and I (never me and you, no distinction between individual beings, instead conceptualizing that we are all just different expressions of one supreme force/energy/being...different vessels of the divine love)...Rastafarians always refer to Jesus as the "son of man" for obvious reasons...they warn against a Babylon system of oppressive and misguided authority...which would be the organized religion which tells the poor to suffer in this world while waiting to reap the rewards in the next...as bob marley sang,    "...Preacher man don't tell me heaven is under the earth I know you don't know what life is really worth Is not all that glitters in gold and Half the story has never been told So now you see the light, aay Stand up for your right.  Come on  Most people think great God will come from the sky Take away ev'rything, and make ev'rybody feel high But if you know what life is worth You would look for yours on earth."   To build on the connection between the lyrics above and Freemasonry...consider this from Robert Anton Wilson's "The Widow's Son"...Wilson is either quoting from a defense of freemasonry by a priest named Henri Benoit around 1797 or he wrote a beautiful summary of the purpose of speculative masonry ..."Every Christian, of every sect, prays in church on Sunday, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, ON EARTH as it is in heaven."  Not one in a thousand stops to think what these words mean; not one in ten thousand dares to imagine that they could mean exactly what they say...Speculative Masonry is the coherent will of all those committed to the Great Work of achieving the meaning of the Lord's Prayer, so that the mind of the Great Architect of the Universe will be manifest, not only in the marvelous harmony of the stars at night but in the daily lives of men and women everywhere- on earth as it is in heaven."    Another connection between masonry and rastafariansim is the cornerstone concept... In the gospel according to Mary Magdalene,..." Peter asks Jesus "Who sent thee?"...Jesus answers, "The cornerstone that the builders rejected is the place from which I came ."  this is significant in the master mark degree of masonry...  " The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner "   -Psalms 118:22    "It was customary for Operative Masons to select for themselves a Mark, to be placed upon every piece of work wrought by them. Each Mark was distinctive. These Marks may be seen today on the stones in old cathedrals of Europe. A report made to the Grand Mark Lodge of England states "There is probably no Degree in Freemasonry that can lay claim to greater antiquity than this one."  -http://www3.telus.net/jcw/ram/invitation.htm   bob marley sang, " The stone that the builder refuse Will always be the head cornerstone-a; The stone that the builder refuse Will always be the head cornerstone.  You're a builder, baby; Here I am, a stone. Don't you pick and refuse me, 'Cause the things people refuse Are the things they should choose. Do you 'ear me? Hear what I say!"   the cornerstone concept can even be found on the back of a U.S. one dollar bill...   "On the reverse, is the All Seeing Eye within a triangle surrounded by a golden glory.  Besides the obvious Masonic signifance of this design, it has a cabalistic value of seventy plus three plus two hundred equaling two hundred and seventy-three (273) which is the value of the phrase EHBEN MOSU HABONIM (the stone which the builders refused) familar to all Royal Arch Masons."  -http://home.att.net/~presidents/trivia2.htm  Well enough trivia and conspiracy theory for one afternoon...there is a connection between everything if you're obsessive enough to really look for it...just like you can use the bible to justify klling in the name of...I hope I haven't offended you in any way, I don't even believe half of what I say...
