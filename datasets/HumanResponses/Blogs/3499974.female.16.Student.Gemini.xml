      My blog! Mine! I've done this before, but I tried making it serious, and you know what? Serious just didn't work. So I QUIT! I GIVE UP! My failed attempts of sanity brought me to believe I was even more disturbing then I once pressumed. So I'm just going to have fun with this. Why? Because I can, beeches.   Just how FUN am I? I'm so FUN I waste my time taking online quizzes.     You have an angry soul! Angry Souls arent always angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold grudges. You probably often get in fights with your friends and family, and its difficult for you to understand. When someone makes a mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to those memories. Your very stubborn and your rage is known to everyone. Though you never actually mean it, you can say mean things in a fight and go over board. Many people are sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you have many redeeming qualities and those are that you are quite intelligent and smart. You would make a good businesswoman or lawyer because you know how to prove your point. You cherish the ones around you, and appreciate life, even though you can complain or throw a tantrum now and then. The good things is, you keep your emotions very outspoken, and are normally a very happy person because all your rage is let on the outside. Anger is simply a state, but you, yourself as a person, are great.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

      People are beautiful. I want to draw so badly, but I have no patience for art classes. Draw this landscape. Draw abstract shapes. Draw this! Draw that! Let me draw people! A picture of a person can embrace so many emotions. Millions more than some still life of a flower vase ever could. People are beautiful. Well, not all people. Thats the appeal though. I draw angels a lot. Though I rarely ever draw a good hearted angel. Their always fallen and injured. Thier beautiful. Something so holy and pure thats been drug down and is hurt, is suffering like everyone else. It's the emotions of people that really get me. I can hear a song singing something sad and it could go in one ear and out the other but sometimes something happens that makes me identify an object with a song. Last night I was looking through some elfwood galleries and listening to Heaven's Not Enough from the Wolf's Rain OST when I saw a picture of this person and they were so sad. I just started crying. I went into my room and I finally as able to draw. I have to be emotional to be able to draw, I've concluded. Usually if I draw just to draw nothing turns out right, but when I'm angry or sad or happy I acautlly churn out stuff I like.  I'm too emotional of a person. It's becuase I personally envolve myself in everything. Just about any movie I like a bit or book or anyhting I make up my own character and I'm there too. I become a hundred times more attached to characters that way and when they hurt I beomce deathly sad. I've layed in my room at night dreaming up little acts, events, with my characters and the others and I get so  wrapped up in it I cry. o_O It's weird. I think it's just an excuse to cry. I'm pretty stupid like that. My parents make fun of me when I cry. When they make me cry they just tell me to stop it and stop trying to make them feel bad. They say me crying is my way of trying to get back at them. Like some sort of blackmail. Then they just keep making fun of me because that only makes me cry harder. I've been teased at home far more than I ever had at school, and it's far worse becuase it's coming from people I love. I could be insulted a million times by a stranger, but just once from someone I care about can scar me for life. I'll never forget it. It's not a grudge. I'm not mad, just saddened by it.  People tend to think I'm just so happy-go-lucky like I don't have any problems. Like I've never done anything wrong. Then when they found out some of the fucked up things I used to do and how I'm so pathetic and thier opinion of me probably changes. I mean really. How many people who know me, How many people who I consider friends know that I casually think about suicide almost daily. Right now not so much. Things are pretty Ok right now. But normally I think about it all the time. It's horrible really. I used to be so scared of just thinking it, but now it's just something I've accepted. I've thought about killing people too. Just randomly. Who goes through with that stuff though? I'm too sensitive for any of that shit anyway. But those nights when I'm just so sad and angry I can feel myself fighting the urges to just tear someone apart. I just want to jump out of my skin. I want to be someone else.
