       I admit, I was really mad when I heard that Capcom decided that the Resident Evil main series would be exclusive to the Gamecube. I mocked the Gamecube for a long time after that until I broke down and got one because of RE addiction. I haven't regretted it since. The REmake of the original Resident Evil and also Resident Evil Zero look amazing and both play really well.    However, I still don't understand why Capcom switched. Resident Evil became famous on the Playstation, where its core fanbase is. Then they put it on a platform that seemed to be targeted mainly to younger kids. The only reason I saw was the big graphics upgrade. The graphics look so advanced that, and I'm sick to say, I don't think the PS2 could handle it. But Gamecube or not, I'll buy whatever I have to in order to have my Resident Evil. However, if I find out that I had to get a 200 dollar system only for all the games to be ported to PS2, I'll be really,  really  pissed.

       I'm not as avid a gamer as some other people out there, but I've been playing since I can remember. And as a "lifelong" gamer, there's been some games that are a lot better than some of the most popular titles out there. I'm sure a lot of it depends of taste, but there's some really underrated gems.            Earthbound  (RPG) for Super Nintendo    I first played this game when I rented it about seven years ago. After I took it back, I searched every Funcoland in the area for a copy, only to find one a K-Mart. (Go Figure). &nbsp;It's one of the greatest games I've ever seen. Unlike most RPGs, it's set in the present, with a normal kid as the main character. And it just has a great story and there's nothing wrong with it, unless you count the graphics, but it  is  Super Nintendo. If you still have a SNES, I highly suggest you check it out.  (Funny note: After I bought it from K-Mart, I was happy as could be, then I dropped it in the street and it was runover by a 18 wheeler. Ouch! I nearly peed myself but I took it home at it was fine. Scary!)           Illbleed  (Borderline Survival Horror) for Dreamcast    Whoever still has their Dreamcast, put Soul Calibur down for a minute and get Illbleed. Everything is original about this game. The story follows a group of teenagers chosen to test a horror theme park built by a billionaire&nbsp;B-Movie director. If you survive the first level, though, you're home free. The first level scared me more than any Resident Evil or Silent Hill, both of which I'm very dedicated to. The gameplay has you searching for traps that can harm and eventually kill you, all the while running from some really ugly monsters. If I still had me Dreamcast, I'd still be playing this game, I guarantee it, but alas, it was sold. I highly reccomend this game, I love it. I've been lobbying to have it ported to a next-gen console, but I highly doubt it will happen. If this had gotten more promotion, it probably would've been a better success.          Shadow Hearts  (RPG) for PS2    I played a game called  Koudelka  for PSOne a few years before this came out, and when I played  Shadow Hearts , I was surprised to see that it was an indirect sequel of  Koudelka , which is also an underrated game. The best way I can describe the feel of this game is... Gothic horror I guess. The first part&nbsp;of the game is set in China, which doesn't exactly scream gothic, but if you play it you'll see what I mean. This game really shines in combat, with great spells and a unique morphing ability for the main character. Each character is very distinct and has a set of very diverse abilities. And the Judgment Ring put a new spin on combat. I traded this game in like an idiot but found it again for 20 bucks. With the sequel,  Shadow Hearts: Covenant , coming out in September, I suggest you check out the original.         Suikoden Series  (RPG) for PS and PS2    This game is more well-known than the others I named, but it still doesn't get all the respect it deserves. All three of them have an amazing storyline and each game has more than&nbsp;100 characters and a castle to build up. These games live in the shadow of the  Final Fantasy series , which is also great, but not nearly as good as this series. The story is linear, technically, but there's so many sidequests trying to recruit more people and mini-games that it doesn't even feel like it. Along with the size of playable characters and castle build up system, the series is also famous for the battles. There's the normal turn-based RPG battles, but there's also one-on--one duels and full-scale army wars. Another great system of the game is the way magic is set up. You have to see it to fully understand. And for those of you that hate going into every town and buying the newest weapons, forget it. Instead, you take your weapon to a blacksmith and upgrade it. The bad part about this series is that all the games are very rare. I bought  Suikoden 2  for 26 dollars a few years ago, and was surprised to see on E-bay that some were going for 200 bucks! I also had the strategy guide, which was worth a pretty penny, but my friend's idiot dog ruined it. If you don't check out any other game I mentioned, try one of these!  Suikoden 3  isn't as rare as the others, but it's also not as good as the others. (It's still great, though.) The fourth game is due out by winter, so I'm on pins and needles. If you really want it, you could try a PSOne Emulator, or find a bootleg of it. If you want to know more about the series, go here:  urlLink http://www.suikosource.com/ &nbsp;It's really the greatest series I've ever played, and considering my love for  Resident Evil  that's saying a lot.     If you know of another underrated game that I didn't mention, feel free to post it. And if you played one of these games and think I'm an idiot for liking it, tell me.
