      My baby is home and that makes me a happy duck. He got home sunday, but that day was a mixed blessing...I had to work for three and a half hours, which wasn't that bad. Then, I went home and got changed and "asked" if I could go it was really a retorhical question because I was going to go to his house either way I just figured I would be nice about it considering I wasn't going to be home this entire week.&nbsp; So, I'm on my way to his house...about halfway there...and I hear this *thwump thwump thwump* from my tire and I started to lose control so I pulled over to the side of the road with a blown out tire and called Mathew. He came and rescued me because he is my Knight in Shining Armor. blah blah blah, I never made it to Mathew's house...I was still happy that he was home though and so that made everything better.  Yesterday we went and got a new tire for my car and then went to the company picnic and pretended to care.&nbsp; Then we went to his house and hung out for awhile, went and rented Bourne Identity, because we were gonna go see Bourne Supremacy....Which was all really entertaining, I enjoyed it greatly even though I didn't get home until 12:00....and slept until 11 in the morning.&nbsp;   Now, I am again with Mathew, in his room....but I so totally win because I have his laptop and I made a fort...yea baby. Mum just called me and was whining about not seeing me because I'm spending all my time with Mat. I told her welcome to my world because I didn't see her hardly at all this past couple weeks because we were both working. Then I asked her if she would go to the fair with me and she said that she didn't know, so I said deal with it because I'm not going to be home this week, she said get home tonight and talk to her or I have to spend all day tomorrow home...which doesn't make any sense because it wouldn't solve the problem but only make it worse....whatever. I still win, I have a fort. Groovy Baby.  The fair starts tomorrow, and I think I want to go...then I want to go to the new pool at Eagle Crest, that should be fun...but yea, more later. I'm going to become busy soon.  Fucking Kangaroos *scribbles them out*  Ciao~

      It is again, unnaturally hot in Sunny Central Oregon....Which sucks because I don't feel like going anywhere or doing anything...though I may make cookies later just because I have an odd craving for chocolate cookie dough which I believe was brought on by talking to my dear Whitters who was making a cake for fair.  I entered a contest the other day....at 2424milk.com, where you enter the UPC of milk products and are entered to win a Volkswagon bug convertable...they are giving one away once a day for 24 days. I thought it would be cool to have one, and you don't have to do anything but drink milk and pretend to care to be entered, so I'm game. I do so hope I win a car, I would be quite happy.  In other news, after this weekend I don't have to go back to work for about 11 days or so, which will be quite nice because I will be clinging to Mathew with all that I have absolutly begging him not to leave to no avail, but I will still but on a good show. That, and I get to go to the fair, a pathetic event in which the prices are far too high, the rides to lame, and far too many gross people call fun....It shall be a blast, because I get to be with friends, and that will be fun.  My sister-in-law leaves for Japan on Monday to be with my idiot brother....Halfway across the world is a good place for him, I don't like him at all, and the chance of him coming home, even on a semi-regular basis is now null and void, my life is almost completely perfect, now if only I could get rid of his demonic father, life as I know it would be grand...  As for now, I shall commence making cooking and thinking about my darling Mathew, oh how I long for his return. I love you Mathew, my darling. I will always love you, with all my heart.  Fucking Kangaroos.... *scribbles them out*  Ciao~

      I just ate a bagel. I want a glass of milk.   Oh, I wish I had my darling Mathew home...that is what I truly want right now, cus if I had my darling Mathew home now...I would be in love with him....even more? Whatever. I'm okay, I just really, really, really, really don't want to go to work today, and at the same time I do because it keeps me away from television and my mind away from constantly focusing on the fact that Mathew isn't home yet. Meh. This sucks.  I'm going to get a glass of milk, I can't think.  Mmm, that was really good.   Anyway. I was thinking earlier today because I made my appointment to get my senior pictures taken. And the thingy they sent me says that you can bring your pets in for no extra charge...So I got to thinking: "Hey, I have a pet chicken!" I want my chicken in my senior pictures, because that would be hot, and she is a cool chicken.  Okay, my complete weirdness is coming to a close...Yea.   I LOVE YOU MATHEW GARRETT!!!!!  Fucking Kangaroos. *scribbles them out*  Ciao~

      It's not hot...Yet. And that is a good thing. I guess scattered showers kind of make it so it isn't hot, that and it is only 11 o'clock. That doesn't mean much though, because usually it is already about 80 some odd degrees...which it isn't. &nbsp; I haven't seen my dear Mathew for a week...It's horrible, I don't like this game. And he will be gone for another 5 days. Woo-hoo! [/sarcasm] I miss Mathew horribly. I'll be alright though. What I really need to do is go out and do something because all I am doing is either working or hanging out in my room doing nothing but watching TV. That isn't very healthy. I need to get out and do something. (I think if I keep telling myself this then I will actually go and do something, but I don't know how effective that is going to be.)&nbsp; I don't know what to do with&nbsp;myself, I'm being pathetic.&nbsp; I think I'll go read my book and think about how pathetic I am. Works for me. &nbsp; Fucking Kangaroos. *scribbles them out* &nbsp; Ciao~

      So, it's 1:00....85 degrees and 100% humidity. Serioulsy, I'm hot, and I don't like it. It's raining, which is great, you would think it would make it cooler, but no. It only makes it hotter because of the humidity. I might as well to go Jersey, because that is what it feels like here. Meh. I could go get in the pool, but that requires going and putting on my swimsuit and going out to the pool, alone...and the water is colder than I want to be exposed to. This world is evil. &nbsp; I took 10 days off from work to go with Mathew to Portland in like two weeks or something, that should be great. I also work everyday this week except Monday and Tuesday, which will be nice, because I will get some hours before I leave for 10 days, that way my paycheck won't take that much of a beating. Phew. &nbsp; I really shouldn't take all that time off work though. My car needs a new muffler, no let me rephrase that. It NEEDS a muffler. Mine fell off a while back and I need to put a new one on it, something about safety or something....whatever. But that requires having 200 some odd dollars. By the way, I DID have that kind of money, but I bought a.....puppy.....yes, that's it a puppy. So, now I don't have that kind of money. Damn puppies. *shakes fist* I could take the thing back, but that just doesn't fit into what I want to do this month, and some things are taking a higher priority these days....You know how it is. Well, maybe you don't but that doesn't matter. So, deal with it.  &nbsp; I'm going to miss my Mathew, I know that.... But I think I can handle it. I know I can handle it, I love him, more than anything in the world, and I can wait. Not leaving your thoughts is the same as having someone there right? No, but oh well. The wind just picked up, and mum said it was cooler outside, I'm going to go investigate. &nbsp; Fucking Kangaroos...*scribbles them out* &nbsp; Ciao~

      It's so hot.... I think it is unnatural to be this hot at this hour, and what makes it worse is it is stagnant heat....there is no damn wind!  If I was smart I would strip off all my clothes and run around the house naked, but I still don't think it would help much, because I am still sweating from every oraphis...  The parents are still gone, and the thing is, they didn't plan to be gone this long, normally I so wouldn't mind the continued quiet...but they didn't leave me with enough food, and if I tried to cook. Hmm, lets not go there. I am still hungry though and I might brave Hamburger helper for the sake of I want to finish my Bronchitis medicine which must be taken with food and I have discovered that it doesn't really work with cereal.   Mathew needs to be saying more than one sylable words to me...  I think I am going to go make myself some dinner now because I'm hungry and crap.  Ciao~

      Since it is morning and nothing today has happened except me watering the lawn, cleaning the house because I haven't for the past three days, doing laundry, and working on my summer school class....I shall tell you about yesterday afternoon and evening, which was slightly more exciting...  *deep breath*  Okie Dokie. I shall tell you, I did go and get milk, which made my day a little better. It took me awhile to actually tell myself I did want to get dressed, go to town and get milk, but I eventually did it. I got home and had to get ready for work...I hate work. It requires pretending you care for far too long. But yea, I fould out my friend's parents are having a garage sale...and so I'm going to go and buy all my things back, that I left at her house, because they are selling all her things...since she was emancipated last week. Great fun. After I got off work, I went home, changed out of my work clothes and got dressed to go to a movie with my Mathew. King Arthur, great movie, I enjoyed it greatly. Then I came home and read my book until I fell asleep....Then the strangest thing happened this morning...I was waking up every hour and 10 minutes...It was quite bizarre.   I have decided not to go to school today, I seriously don't feel like taking a shower and getting ready to go, so I'm not going to, besides its hot out there and it's cool in my house, so I think I will stay here, finish my class and wait until the family returns home.    I might write later, depending on how I feel.  Ciao~

      So, we are going to start this thing out by posting a rant...Why? Because there is NO MILK!!! *glares*     Let me begin...  My parents left me. They went on a 4 day vacation to the coast and left me here alone, and I told them to leave me AT LEAST 3/4 of a gallon of milk...I should have known...They didn't. I got a grand total of a little less than half. Arg. I'm mad, and I have to go to the store and buy milk and bread and that makes me angry...GRRR!!!  Meh.
