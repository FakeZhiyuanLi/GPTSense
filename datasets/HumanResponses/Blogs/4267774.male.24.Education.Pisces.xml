      I spent the extended weekend moving Katie back to lovely Olean, NY. She will reside among a plethora of white trash Americans, including hapless single mothers, and toothless wonders who cruise the pot-holed streets in their 1980's Camaros (sorry Deirdre). In years past, Katie and I ventured into the mountains via Escort Wagon to indulge in various pleasures. A particular pleasure that comes to mind--counting "dead" or otherwise nonfunctioning motor vehicles. Simply put, we count the number of decommissioned vehicles adorning front lawns of residences city-wide. Anyways, the weekend was interesting. Katie and I also spent the evening at the Holiday Inn hotel in Hamburg, NY. Nothing struck me as particularly interesting in Hamburg, NY. I ate breakfast on the beach of Lake Erie Sunday morning. I partied on the Fish's porch with Ginny, Corey, Maggie, etc. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to spend precious time with my beautiful girlfriend Katie.

      I forgot to mention waking up in a pool of cat piss. I hate cat piss. Years ago, a buddy of mine informed me that his cat-loving uncle owned 53 cats, and lived with them in a local farmhouse. After Kevin finished speaking, I informed him that he was a motherfucking liar, and that only a madman would house that many cats. His retaliation was, "I'll show you man". Whatever, I had nothing better to do than visit this fucking madman and his cats.  At the end of uncle Matt's driveway stood a three-foot tall pole with a wooden carving of a cat's head. Jesus Christ. I wasn't slightly prepared for what I was about to witness. As I stepped into Matt's aging farmhouse, I was greeted by a horrid stench, that reminded me of the homeless man I once smoked a joint with in Utica, NY. Holy shit. I puked, and swallowed the puke, so not to offend Matt, the owner of this godforsaken farmhouse. Kevin and I waded through piles of cat shit, as we made our way though the house. Each room contained at least ten cats; sleeping, licking their asses, balls, and/or clits. Overflowing litter pans adorned many of the house's corners. I puked, and again swallowed it.  Goddamn. Anyways, Janis, my kitten conveniently pissed in my bed, which reminded me of my visit to Matt's cat-invested haven of a fucking house. Needless to say, I disowned Kevin as a friend for ever bringing me to that shithole.

       Last Thursday, my wonderful girlfriend Katie brought me a beautifully, semi-Asian, kitten.  I immediately fell in love with her (the kitten's) wide, blue eyes (which apparently is typical of Siamese cats).  I've contemplated getting a kitten for quite some time; my only reservation being catâ€™s innate selfishness.  I'm a fucking ferret owner.  Ferrets aren't selfish, nor independent.  I am father to those bastards, and they love me, and depend on me.  Anyways, as I was saying, I haven't had a great experience with cats, especially one name Eliot (sp?).  Eliot is a purebred Asian, an Apple-Faced Siamese to be exact.  For reasons unknown, Eliot and I are constantly butting heads; I believe our personalities are so drastically different, that it is impossible for us to get along.  Basically, Eliot is an asshole, and I'm not.  Eliot is Katie's cat.  Katie is my girlfriend.  Eliot and I don't get along.   FUCK.  Well shit...have a great day everyone!
