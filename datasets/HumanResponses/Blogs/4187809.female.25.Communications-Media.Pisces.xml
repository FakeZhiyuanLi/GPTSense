      Ok, this whole blogging thing is an interesting oxymoron for me. I'm referring to the idea of publishing your private thoughts to be read by the general public, people i don't even know. And then this thought occurred to me... what about allowing your family to read it? I'm not sure about most people, but for me, I think I don't spend enough time with my family, in fact, i think they don't really know me very well at all.  Is it my fault for not making time for them? yes, I think so in some ways.  But the thought of my family reading my  JOURNAL ...whoa... that's scary. But it shouldn't be that way, right? I mean, my family is supposed to be the people closest to me.  I have another blogger friend, she lets her mom reads her blogs. And it's all about her relationship with her mom. Or rather, lack of it. Makes her mom pretty upset sometimes.      So should there be a self-censorship to who should be allowed to view your blog?        Do the contents of your blog change if you knew certain people read it? People whom you are afraid of being open to?      Well, right now, i'm not sure if i can be so open and honest to EVERYONE. But the strange thing is that, since I'm publishing this, I  AM  being open in some ways. I think i confuse myself sometimes.  And so I can publish my inner thoughts to the world out there, but somehow find it hard to let the closest people to me read the very same words.

      After yesterday night's saga, well, needless to say, I dragged my sorry butt off my office chair and went to join the others for tennis. Hmm.. not bad, my third game, and already i can rally the ball over the net. It felt good to hit something.  But later that night, a friend of mine asked me what was going on in my life.. i seemed grumpy lately. I don't know.. could it be work? A sense of uncertainty about the future, direction in life... etc? Whatever it is, I'm glad she noticed and took the time to chat. I felt much better after that. Did I ever say how grateful I am for friends around me?  Well, I am.  And I thank God for bringing them to me. And for my boyfriend too, who sometimes can be as blur as i am, but who has such a big, caring heart.  Hmm... thinking back abt yesterday makes me wonder abt the balance between being an independent woman and a woman who just wants to be cherished and pampered. (dependant on others in short!!)  Well, part of me didn't want to receive any help from others yesterday... it was more of like my pride talking i think.     "I am woman! Hear me   ROARRRRRR!!!!  "              Meow.         That was how I felt... a facade? A strong woman on the outside, but a soft, vulnerable one inside? I am neither one or the other.. but I'm both. So when is the right time to portray the different sides of me?

      Sigh, it's 9pm, I'm still at work, and I feel sorry for myself. My boyfriend and all my friends are out playing tennis right now, having a good time and all I'm doing is eating yesterday's leftover bread for dinner and staring at my computer screen.  Ok, I have to be an empowered woman. Stop putting up a pity party for yourself! You can choose to leave the office now. Yeah, I can.. and go home and get my clothes and join them for tennis... but in reality, i just want to go home, sulk, and be pampered.  But no one's coming around to pamper me.  Darn it.  Looks like I have a choice of how I want to react to this situation. Why do i even allow myself to be overtaken by emotions? It's normal, isn't it?  Alright. I will leave. Soon. After I finish this part of my work... ok ok.. that will take another hour at least. No... I think I'll leave.

      Had a really interesting day yesterday.. talked to different people, shared with them about life, God.. etc.. one of them being my maid, just by giving her a lift to the market, gave me the opportunity to share with her about prayer. She shared with me about Thaipusam, and how she prays, but it doesn't really mean anything to her personally.  Also talked to another friend about loneliness... she's tried a lot of things.. and a lot of people have talked to her and said things like... your family's there... u have friends... believe in God and you won't feel lonely. But the fact of the matter is that she still feels lonely. I don't know if she's deliberately pushing people away from her. Does she even want to be helped? She doesn't want to be around 'church-y' people, and that's fine.. i respect her decision. Have I tried to provide 'book' answers for her that doesn't work when all i need is to just be there for her?  And later that night, I went to my cell group (small bible study groups) and found out that my cg leader and his whole family is moving to Bangkok! And the wife is pregnant! :) Wow... I kinda feel sad and happy for them.. sad that they're leaving, and happy that it's the beginning of a new stage of their life.  it makes me think.. so many lives out there.. so many people going thru different stages of their lives. Life    really is  a big canvas, and whatever decisions you make and how you react to situations paint the picture of how the final image will look like.   How  do  I live my life so that I live it to the fullest? What are my priorities? Do i even care about the people around me who are hurting and are calling out.... or am I oblivious to it all... just wanting to have fun and not wanting to have my time interrupted?

      Was doing my devotional today, and I read something that really struck me.. It was a passage talking about Satan, and how he is a deceiver, a liar...  "When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies." John 8:44  The spiritual realm is real... if we believe that there is a God, then there must be a devil. There's a spiritual war out there that we're fighting in, there's no such thing as being a pacifist in this war - you're either  for  God, or  against  God.  So how does the devil go about the task of attacking God's people? Reading from Selwyn Hughes' book, "Everyday with Jesus" (a backdated issue)... he says...   "Satan's major weapon is always that of temptation. This is how he achieved success in bringing about the downfall of Adam and Eve - and it is his chief weapon still. Satan used a strategy which proved so successful, and it is still one he uses to this very day.  Satan did not attempt to get Adam and Eve to become atheists because he knew that was an impossibility. So he focused instead on getting them to  doubt God's goodness . The devil began by saying, "Did God really say, "You must not eat from any tree in the garden?" (Gen 3:1). That question was formed in such a way that it introduced the first human pair to something they had not come up against before - an attack on the  character of God . Eve then explained the situation, and this gave the devil further opportunity to sow doubt on God's goodness. "you will not surely die," he said (Gen 3:4). The implication behind these words was the suggestion that if God really loved them He would not have limited them in that way."   Wow, that passage really sunk deep into my Spirit. There  have  been times when i doubted the goodness of God, and asked Him (more like yelled, actually...) "where are you, God! Do you even care?" How can I even trust you when I can't see you, or I can't hear you? But in His 'silence'.. a lot of times, there comes a peace.. (especially after yelling and crying to God).. that I can't quite explain, and it is during those times that my spirit within me says... "He does care... "  I think learning to trust Him and walk His path even though the road seems dark is one of the hardest things to do as a Christian. But there is that thing within me that hangs on still.. and says... "He does care.. don't give up..."

I'd like to find a space where i can post pictures and write personal thoughts as well...

      I was reading this book called   "Women - God's Secret Weapon"   by  Ed Silvoso  a while back, and found it to be a really fascinating book! This book has really opened my eyes to see that women are really special creations in God's sight, and that Satan really fears us women! Hah! Eat dust, satan!  Here are some excerpts from the book. (with my little musings, of course!)  Ok, let's go back to Genesis when God created man and woman.   At the end of each creation day, except the second and sixth days, God looked at what He had brought into being and declared, "It is good" (Gen 1:4, 18, 25). On the second day, He issued no opinion. However, the sixth day undoubtedly gave Him the most joy. After minting Eve, He pronounced it "a  very  good day" (Gen 1:31).      God did not indiscriminately rubber stamp each day with the words "It is good." Silence on the second day and the added adjective on the sixth imply that He did a thorough evaluation before giving an opinion. Undoubtedly, the sixth day is the one that gave God the greatest joy.   We tend to assume that Gen 1:31 ("and God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good.") refers to everything that He had made during the six days of creation. Ed Silvoso in his book said that though in a general sense this is true, but a careful examination of Gen 1:31 places that remark at the end of the sixth day and in the context of the creation of Eve. This was the only day that God changed His rating of the day's work after creating something.  Therefore, women are really special in God's eyes!  In Genesis 2:7, God created Adam by shaping him or forming him out of dust, but in Eve's case, God employed a different technique and used more sophisticated raw material! Instead of shaping her out of dust, the Lord "fashioned" (Gen 2:22) her out of flesh and bone taken from Adam. This made Eve twice refined.    Wow... now that definitely beats all the gender jokes out there! Women  are  more refined than men! ahhah... this really made me feel that... as a woman, God delights in me, and places such a high value on me. Therefore, if God sees me as worthy, who then has the right to say otherwise?  And now, on to Satan...  In Genesis, when God passed judgement on Satan...  God lowered him to the bottom of the animal totem pole. God lowers him further by cutting off his feet. "On your belly you shall go" (Gen 3:14), He declares, downgrading Satan's mobility to crawling. Finally, God ruins his diet too, proclaiming, "Dust shall you eat all the days of your life." (vs. 14)      Next, God threatens the devil with the woman by decreeing that her anger will forever be focused on him (Gen 3:15).  The seed of the woman will defeat Satan, who will have his head bruised while inflicting minor damage to the heel doing the bruising . (vs. 15)      Obviously, God is speaking about the advent of the Messiah, but the fact that female anger aimed at the devil occupies such an integral part of God's threat must mean that women have a significant role.    Wow! We are such a threat to satan... this is our position in Christ.. we have the power to stamp Satan on his head...Satan knows that, and that's why a lot of times, he wants to give women the wrong impression... that he's the one in control, but in reality, he has lost all control right from the start! So we do not need to fear him, because he is in the one who needs to watch out!  Therefore, as God's chosen woman, stand tall, knowing that God has designed you for a purpose, and that Satan has no right over your life whatsoever.

      I came to work this morning and found out one of my pc's hard drives is missing. Well, it can be detected, but it's just not working properly. And my project is in it! It's my video editing system, and everything I have been working on the past 4 days are in it, and there's no backup whatsoever. Not only that, I am also rushing for a deadline this evening, and this has really set me back a few hours!   Arrrgghhh....   So I'm waiting for this technical guy to come in and hopefully do wonders to it. I really need to work on this project desperately. Sigh... ok, ok, on to more cheerful things. It's my sister's birthday today, and my parents are here in KL, and my brother is flying in from Singapore today as well. It's a whole family reunion. :)  That's why i need to finish this project soon! ahhaha... ok... stop it!  Want to see what I'm involved in at work? Visit  urlLink  www.3r.com.my   ! That's the program that I edit and occasionally direct (a few episodes). It's a young women's program about social issues and issues pertaining to women specifically, eg. dealing with rape, unfair legislation towards women, relationship issues...etc...  It's pretty cool. Especially since a lot of viewers respond to our program by sending in emails and letters saying how the program has impacted their lives.  Ok, enough rambling for now. Maybe I should write something more interesting next...

      I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday, and we had a really interesting conversation. He was telling me about this prayer that he's been praying lately...  to ask God to give all the young adults everything they ever wanted... monetary success, relationships, the lifestyle that they want... everything... but in ONE aspect... where God is supposed to be; one   BIG FAT ZERO  .   So I asked him, what were other people's responses to his prayer?  He said, someone told him... "hey, what kind of prayer is that!?"  Hmm.. what kind indeed... it really gave me something to think about, because in reality, i know a lot of young adults (especially in the church... myself included!) are seeking for something more in life.. it's like we're never contented... always looking for something more.. more fun, more money, etc..  And yet, there is an undeniable cry from within our hearts for something more meaningful. Something that looks like a God-shaped hole.  I woke up this morning thinking about this, and telling God, " I don't ever want to have an empty bank account with you!"  (spiritually, i mean, duh! :)  It has been my heart's cry to ask God to fill it... fill it with His presence. And yet, a lot of times, it just seems to elude me. Is this a route that God wants me to take? To just   trust  . Not to rely on my feelings. I have this disatisfaction within me, and part of me thinks it's somekind of holy disatisfaction... to always want to have more of God. That's good, isn't it?  But I can't say that I've  never  experienced God's presence in my life. Many times, He has reassured me by just a gentle nudge in my spirit, about an issue in my life... or something that I should be doing. Or just spoken to me thru His Word.  Could it be then, that    my listening channel has somehow been corrupted?        By something in my life that is blocking my sensitivity to Him... Or is it just the fact that I've stopped listening?  All I know is that I never want to stop seeking Him. And i don't want a big fat zero where God is.
