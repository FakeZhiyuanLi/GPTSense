      One of the things that has been coming to mind a LOT lately is the question- “who on EARTH am I?” Everything I do and everything I say and everything I think seems to bring that to mind. well I was looking through some Christian song lyrics last night and God really used them to speak to me. THIS is who I am. . .   Casting Crowns “Who I Am”  Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth Would care to know my name Would care to feel my hurt Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star Would choose to light the way For my ever wandering heart  Not because of who I am But because of what You've done Not because of what I've done But because of who You're  Chorus: I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the ocean A vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I'm calling Lord, You catch me when I'm falling And You've told me who I am I am Yours, I am Yours  Who Am I, that the eyes that see my sin Would look on me with love and watch me rise again Who Am I, that the voice that calmed the sea Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me  I am Yours Whom shall I fear Whom shall I fear 'Cause I am Yours I am Yours   I am His! Oh that sounds so much easier than searching through all the crap this world has to offer to try and find joy! He is the only one who can offer true joy! God sent His Son to die on that cross so that I could be saved! What a WONDERFUL thought!   For so long I was deceived Enslaved by these chains Blinded to Your forgiveness If only I knew Your love Giving Your life to save me from this pain Broken and bleeding I turned You away Now I have seen the scars inflicted by my hands The Innocence spilled to save me Reaching to the hand that brought You this pain And now I am on my knees Crying the way You wept for me Crying, crying tears of shame  -As I lay dying   well I want to write something right now but I think the lyrics to these songs describe exactly what I want to write a lot better than I could ever explain it. . .   forgive me Jesus this time i cry i rip my heart out to give to You alone it never did me any good hold me close, wash my mind destroy the me that lives inside  -underoath   that is my prayer. My plea. My cry. I want to be God’s     .   You're afraid of what it takes to give it all away Doing enough just to get by, just to get by Thinking that you live the right life Are you doing just enough to get by To try and fool 'em into thinking That you live the right life  -pillar   that was me. I was scared to give him EVERYTHING. I was scared to give certain things over to Him. Especially relationships. That was something I had control over it seemed. But “seemed” is the big word there. I didn’t have control over it at all. I was scared to let people that meant a lot to me know that I actually cared. I hid everything. . . I hid the real me from a lot of people.   So what's the point of even trying to hide Cause everything you do is seen by omnipotent eyes  -pillar   I changed my ways I'm never goin' back again  -pillar   I have “gone back” so to speak SO many times. Gone back to living for myself. I don’t want to ever go back again. I am His and that is what I want to be forever!   A daily walk with Him is exactly what it takes –pillar   One of the things my parents always stressed was spending time with the Lord every day. As I was growing up that’s what I did because that was what I HAD to do. It helped me grow closer and closer to Him. I didn’t really realize it at the time but now that I am older, and don’t spend time with Him every day because it seems like I “don’t have time”, I realize how much that affected my walk with the Lord. Christianity is not just a Sunday thing and occasionally a Sunday night thing. Christianity is a DAILY walk with Him. Now THAT is what I want!  Your sister in Christ, Alycia

      why don't my parents trust me? what have i EVER done to not deserve to be trusted. NOTHING. maybe if i had done something BAD at one point in time i can see how they might not trust me too much but i havent done anything bad. nothing at all. and they dont trust me in the LEAST bit. i was asked the other day what the worst thing i had ever done was and i couldnt even ANSWER it. there is so much crap i could do if i wanted to. i could give them SO many reasons not to trust me if i wanted to. but you know what. . . i dont want to. the problem is that if my parents think thats what i am like then what is stopping me from being like that? you know what else it proves? it proves how much nobody knows me. i hide the real me so much that my parents dont even see it. i came on the computer tonight hoping to go on msn and have a deep talk. well i came on the computer but didnt make it onto msn because my dad changed the password to the net nanny so that i couldnt go on. i figured i would suck it up and just surf the net for some christian sites. i went to surf the net only to find that my dad must have also blocked the possibility to view sites. i couldnt even open up ONE single freaking CHRISTIAN website. not one. they were all blocked. now if my parents, or anyone for that matter, tells me that my parents DO trust me i am    na flip. it is plainly OBVIOUS that they dont when they wont even let me go on the internet when all i want to look at is CHRISTIAN things. augh
