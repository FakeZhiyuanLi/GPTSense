      I just joined here today, or something, so I'm new. I switched over from livejournal.com, because I've been informed that this site is cram-jam packed (mmm...cram jam...) with non-lackey goodness whilst the other site is not. So here I am. LOVE ME! Well, don't, because by doing so you will have started a nuclear war...If you don't know, don't ask.   I hate people. I really do. This probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense to you, or you think it does, but it really doesn't because you're interpreting it the wrong way. But. I do hate people. Someone'll talk to me. Sure, I'll talk back. But I still hate them. I'm saying this while you're keeping in mind that friends, when they become friends, don't 'count' as people anymore. They're friends. I'm finished ranting now.  In TAG, for "Treat Friday", Mr.(Insert lackey pre-intern which I hate's name here) brought everyone waffles. Waffles. WAFFLES! JESUSCHRISTMEANDASHLEYNEARLYHADACONEPTION. *twitch* ...Uh, and I'm not going to tell you why that's disturbing. and last week we had cake. JESUSCHRISTIFITWASMANGLECAKEMEANDASHLEY'SHEADSWOULD'VEEXPLODED. Okk. I'm done now.  So. My mother is useless. Utterly useless. We went to Long and McQuade after school to pick up my drumkit, right? (It gets better...) and we got it, and on the way home we stopped at this Godly store (I...don't think it has a name, but I have a story about it...it's creepy) and I bought a prickly spike bracelet (!!!). Anyway. So we get home and I say to her, "So...when are we setting up the drumkit?" "We? No, no. You can set the damn thing up whenever you want to." "Oh, well thanks, MOM!" "...Get me a beer."  Ok so story time. I'm in this store (My mother abandoned me temporarily) and there's this old man in there ranting on about how punks are the devil and don't trust people with chains, etc... (I think he must've been senile. He was in a punk store.) and buddy just keeps eyeing me down and watching my every move. So the person that works there is showing me a bunch of bracelets and I'm like "but wouldn't the leather crack over time?" then buddy comes up to me and he's like "See, what you do is, when you go to bed at night, (buddy grabs one of my bracelets and starts rubbing it) you rub some vaseline or something like that" I got all disturbed, grabbed my hand and I was like "OK THANKS THEN. YEAH MY HAND."  I. Can't. Wait. Til. May 25. *twitch* Why? I'll tell you......IT'S THE DAY OF THE DISTILLERS CONCERT!!!! IT'S GOING TO KICK FUCKING ASS. MY CAR IS NOT WHERE I PARKED IT, MY CAR IS NOT WHERE I PARKED IT!!!! *SINGS* Erm...It would probably be better if you didn't ask. Erm. I don't suppose it matters whether or not you ask, seeing as I'm not going to tell you either way. Anywhoo's. I'm bored and tired and...bye.

       ...I'm leaving this place! There've been changes in my life with no regrets and I'll be alright! And If I see you again I hope that you will have changed, too. Cuz there's more to me than you can see...more to me than you could ever see...  -Crowned King's "Farewell" This is such a hypnotic song...you don't even want to being to TRY to know...   Soo. Today I had my regular gay morning classes...late for 1st (as always)...2nd, we had some abuse presentation...3rd, I got my assigned seat (:|) she's like, "Ok Jodi you're supposed to be sitting over there *points*" "Yeah ok...I wasn't here last day so..." "Just go sit over there. Ok class, this is your new seating plan" "...You don't say." haha anyways then in 4th I sat there with Braun laughing over NOTHING it was so gay...then my cell phone kept beeping in my pocket...it doesn't like my pocket apparently because I couldn't figure anything to justify the beeping and it ONLY beeped when it was in my pocket...it was so annoying...and then in 5th I sat there writing out lyrics to random Crowned King songs. Yeah that was my day. Oh yeah and we got kicked out of the cubby because of MARK'S long-term writing!...Bastard. Yeah and then tonight...I believe I am going to get my new bus pass (hoorah) with my mom and then going driving...I should be "happier than a clam in clamtown" as my good pal Lindsay would say...Hmmmm....Yeah and then tomorrow I have drums....Then wed I am supposed to do something with Braun...Yep. Thursday and Friday iunno yet. I'm not for the whole planning 5 weeks ahead soo yeah whatever happens happens I guess....    But yeees I have run out of topics to turn into wonderful bloggedy topics full of CAAANDY, so...I leave you.   -Joebie

      Punk music, or what is portrayed as "punk music", these days, is depressing, and somewhat frightening. Most of these new bands that claim to be punk are "harddashcore" mainstream pop singers that are in it for the money, and don't even care about their fans. Also, they got their career handed to them on a silver platter by a little thing called MTV. These bands include: Sum 41, Simple Plan, Billy Talent, Good Charlotte, Avril Lavigne, Yellowcard, and many, many more. The only show I confide in for real punk music (The Punk Show) disappointed me last night as well. Co-hosts for last night were BILLY TALENT!!! WHY GEORGE, WHY???! Some of the music played by other bands on the show was alright, but the fact that he co-hosted them on the PUNK SHOW! The one dude's hair looks like fucking MC Hammer's for fuck sakes! Fucking posers! NYAGH! Hatred! On another note, I believe the only good punk band playing in the Warped Tour this year is Crowned King. And they're Ska-ish punk, but amazing live. If you want to listen to some REAL punk bands, and not some little posers, listen to: Misfits, Rancid, The Distillers, Ramones, Casualties, The Vandals, and Crowned King. These are just a few off the top of my head, mind you, but still REAL PUNK. That is all  So about a week ago my computer crashed, and has been in the shop until today. So now, I have to re-download all of my 200+ songs, which is a painful challenge because KaZaA Lite HATES me. Lots. Almost as much as I hate it. I hate a lot of things. I hate a lot of people too...hmm. Yes. Hate is good, and full of hatred, sanity, and chewy delicious elements like that. And CRAM JAM! Don't ask...  But yeah. Now that I'm semi-calm and don't want to take an axe to the computer (for now), I'm going to go and try to get my songlist back. Later.   -Joebie

      LAST NIGHT KICKED MAJOR FUCKING ASS!!! Oh. My. God. You don't even want to  begin  to know, but this being my blog, I am going to tell you, seeing as it is a topic chock full of bloggedy goodness. (This is going to be one hell of a blog! Like...57 pounds of blog in a 3 pound bag. That's a lot of blog. Not ooglay though...) Alright, where to begin?! Let's start at the beginning (Idealy, anyhow...) So, we got out at 2:15 yesterday because it was the last Tuesday of the month and I roped Lindsay into coming to my house to hang out and get ready for the concert. We were still in a state of shock. We couldn't believe it was finally the big night. 55 days, and it's finally here! Anywho, so I changed my clothes because I was wearing sweatpants (I knew that I was going to be sweating tons and bathing in 12 other people's sweat, so the last thing I wanted to be wearing was SWEATPANTS.) and we got ready. Then we decided we were hungry. So we grabbed some doritos, sat down in my room and put in a Distillers cd to generally get us pumped (moreso, anyway) until my mom wanted to drive us there. We left at about 5:20, and got there close to 6:00. A few punks in there, not too many. We sat down on one of these circle bench thingers. We had brought little Kool-Aid pouches, and Lindsay takes hers out and just chugs it down. Then we decided to go wait in line for the concert. Me, being the very COOL person that I am, take out my Kool-Aid pouch while we were standing in line, just standing there and drinking it. Good times getting stares! And this, my friends, is JUST where the good times begin. So we finally get in, and Lindsay and I bolt down the stairs and into the place where the concert was. We started out in the 2nd row from the gate, which is a pretty damn good view of the stage. I may as well have been in the front row because I saw between buddy with the braids, and Igor's girlfriend's heads (I will explain all in due course) and I think Lindsay generally had a good view (besides when igor was shaking his ass at her AHAHA...I'm not even going to explain that one to you...). Anywho. Igor is, most simple put (and this is a long story so  try   to understand because this blog is going to be long enough without the story of Igor) is Igor For Hair. Meaning he's bald. And his girlfriend is simply the chick he was with. (They were both fat and ooglay) and buddy with the braids is this hardcore guy that stood beside me talking to me, and he had obeasty bracelets and chains and...braids. And my mom made a friend (Hey Lindsay!) She just sat at a table...while we moshed away. And...my mom is a bad bad man. She talked to (well kinda) one of the band members of the Distillers. Well, he more or less asked her where the band members go whilst she was outside smoking. Anywho, so the concert starts. We knew that Distillers wasn't going to play first because they were with Crowned King and we knew this. So the band starts to play, and it was all SO FUCKING LOUD. There were like at least 12 amps. Ah hell, hearing's overrated anyway. Now this band sucked. Not so much the instruments (debatable) as so much the vocalist. (That savage guitarist that broke the string was kickass though hey Lindsay??!) The vocalist...you couldn't even hear him. Apparently this  wasn't  Crowned King. I didn't know this until Crowned King came onto the stage. I looked at Lindsay after the 2nd band came on (I thought there were only 2 bands: Crowned King and Distillers) and I was like "What the hell who are these people?" "Oh this is Crowned King." "No It can't be! Who was the band before?" Then buddy with the braids turns around and he's like "No, this is Crowned King. They're Ska, but they're good. Don't worry about it." I just took his word for it. So apparently buddy with the braids was all into Crowned King. In between taking 80,000,000 pictures he was either moshing or screaming the lyrics, making me smell his hair (I was standing behind him). Yeah...and then buddy from Crowned King (after he was finished throwing the microphone stand around and jumping and flailing about like he was on fire) jumps into the crowd, and is like 5 inches away from kicking me in the head. It was awesome. And he has his belly button pierced! lmao! This was all shortly before crowd surfers started to, well, surf the crowd. Half the time they were falling and/or kicking me in the head. I would either punch them as they got pulled off the crowd by security or I'd stab them with my spikey bracelet. (And some chick lost her phone and they were just kicking it around...I felt kinda bad for her. I was so paranoid after that about losing my phone) So Crowned King is playing like their last song, and the chick in front of me decides she wants to leave. SCORE! I get front row centre. Right in the middle of the fucking pit. So, this was right before Distillers came onto the stage. As soon as they did, all Hell. Broke. Loose. I was almost insantly practically plastered against the gate in front of me, which didn't hurt that much at the time, but does now. People were constantly jumping on me or elbowing me or kicking me. I'd either stab them with my bracelet or bite them if possible. And even worse  everyone  was trying to squeeze into front row, and there's a simple rule, or a guide, if you will. DON'T TRY TO SQUEEZE YOURSELF INTO A 25 PERSON SPACE WHEN THERE'S ALREADY 30 PEOPLE THERE. It was  so  annoying. And about 4 songs into Distiller's show, Lindsay gets thrashed out of her spot by me and almost gets pushed into the circle pit. Yeah that concert was good time ALL AROUND. Best night of my life. 5.5 hours of NO rap, NO country, NO poser punk...just good ol' punk rock! And then after the concert I bought a zip-up sweater with a "D" on the front and "The Distillers" written on the back with a picture of a naked lady who is bleeding on it (this is their album cover, for "Coral Fang") then I went to the bathroom and pissed for a very very long time. I had to piss before we left for the Distillers, so my bladder was about to explode. I end this segment of my blog with one bit of advice: Don't go to concerts if you're clausterphobic. (I'm not clausterphobic, just a piece of advice). Because you've got people leaning on your shoulders and putting their elbows on your shoulders (apparently I'm the "perfect height") that you don't even know. And I was SO FUCKING SWEATY AFTER. IT WAS SO GROSS. But yeah, I guess my "last piece of advice" thing didn't work out according to plan. So, yeah, don't go to concerts if you're clausterphobic.  So school today...nothing happened really...the usual...cubbyness, I fell asleep in 2nd and 5th...yeah I don't know...pretty slack! And I don't have to go to school all day tomorrow because I have to go for an MRI for my headaches.  But yeah I've run out of bloggedy goodness and topics of that nature, so...later.   -Joebie

      Allo. So, last night I was supposed to have a sleepover with Braun, but apparently when she was getting her ears pierced she pissed her mom off somehow, and she could only hang out for the night. So I'm talking to her on MSN, and then 5 minutes after she told me she couldn't have a sleepover she said she couldn't do anything at all because she was arguing with her mom and she swore, or something to that effect. So, I called Kailie and My dad and I went to pick her up and we watched a movie, then decided we wanted to go to 7-11. So we're almost out the door and Autumn phones me and says she's off grounding for the night and asked if I wanted to sleep over. So we picked her up and went walking around a little bit, then I got Kailie to get her dad to pick her up from Autumn's house, and then I just slept at Autumn's, and left at about 2:30 this afternoon. Yep, that's my day.  And then after supper my dad took me driving. I  hate  driving with my dad, because he's  always  bitching/yelling at me about something, like if I make one mistake he'll tear my head off about it. And when he does that, I get really nervous and end up screwing up worse and then he yells at me more...lol...I'm getting used to it but still! It's fucking annoying! And then I tell him to stop yelling at me, and he's like "I'm not" and he's semi-civilized for like 2 minutes or until I make another mistake...he should fuck off...today was my second practice day, and I was in that fucking truck which I hate! Oh well...today we were in the Superstore parking lot, because Superstore closes at 6:00pm on Sundays, so I basically had the entire parking lot to myself. There were just a couple other cars driving around aimlessly (like me), and I'm guessing they were students practicing because I don't think if someone had their licence they would sit there driving around the Superstore parking lot...that and they were driving at half the speed of smell...but I can't complain because I was driving that slow too. But hey you're supposed to drive slow in parking lots! And anyways so we're done practicing for the day, and he's driving home and he stops the truck about 160ft before the train tracks heading towards Centennial School on Dalgliesh (I had figured he had run out of gas; he made a comment earlier on how he was almost out of gas) and he looks at me and says, "Ok, drive home from here." To say the least I was nervous. But I actually was ok! I had to drive 40, which seemed fast at first but I started to get used to it then had to slow down cuz we had to turn off of Dalgliesh (I'm...still not used to it). You may think 40 is really slow, but try being used to 15-20 for 2 days then having to switch to 40-45 just like that! But yeah I did alright...I'm way better in the streets than in a parking lot for some reason...Probably because the street is a way wider space, and that seems to work for me. Meh.  Anywho I've run out of topics to turn into bloggedy goodness so, later!   -Joebie

       "I step right off the edge, let the blood rush to my head. I'm going down to where the lucky ones have bled. I lift the veil up to reveal fascination, and if you crave it then you know that you are injured. And I'm holding on...And I'm holding on..." 'The Distillers - Love is Paranoid' 4 days...4 fucking days! There was an article in the Previews section in the newspaper yesterday..."The Distillers Provide A High-Energy Show"...This concert is gonna kick so much ass! Hehe! We've got it!   ...so I'm currently on the phone with Lindsay. And we're just talking about whatever, and she's like "I'm gonna go get a needle and thread." "What the hell?!" "...I need to fix my backpack. No, actually I'm going to make a skirt and a pair of pants. And wear them. At the same time." "Hoh. Big skants." (skirt pants) "...Or pirts." (pants skirt) Then we were discussing how Mark (somehow when we're talking about somewhat girly things, he's  always  added into the conversation in one way or another. It's  really  creepy, in the sense that it's starting a nuclear shwan war...don't ask) would practically  worship  these skants or pirts and possibly sacrifice himself to Lord Bun-Wah for them then Lindsay's like "Yeah...one size fits all. Because they're made of SPAAANDEX!" "and CAAAANDY!" Yeah...that's a really,  really  long story, so...don't ask.  Anywho, today was relatively boring because I was too lazy to phone a million people asking them to do something. But. I did go driving today. 3 times. The first time I did...oh my it was so bad. We were like at the parking lot at Superstore (the part that's kinda to the side and no one generally parks in it) and I was just driving around aimlessly then I didn't realize it (well I did, but I didn't...it's confusing), but I was about to enter into the part of the parking lot that was busy, and my dad's like, "What are you doing? You're not ready to drive in traffic" or something to that effect. So I was kinda pissed off, because I had to back up, then he's like bitching at me, "You're not watching if anything's behind you!" and general shit like that, so by now I'm  really  pissed off and I go to park it, but I'm not thinking straight and I put it in park before the truck was completely stopped. Anyway, it made this rank ass tapping noise (it was so brutal) and my dad's like "What the fuck are you doing?! You hear that noise?! That's you tearing the shit out of my transmission!!!" He was  so  mad at me. Oh well though. What did he honestly expect? I did nothing but slack off in the driving class and I started out driving his obeasty fucking truck, and I couldn't even see what was behind me because he has one of those truckbox thingers and it was all fogged up cuz it was raining. And then the other 2 times I was with my mom and her car, which was  so  much easier. But she is  so  annoying. I can't even begin to describe how annoying she is to drive with. I wanted to  kill  her with a pair of tweezers and feed her rotting remains to Snowball. The entire time she was like "Don't forget your signals! SLOW DOWN! You didn't signal. Watch the fucking curb! Watch out for the glass and garbage on the ground!" Ahh it was so annoying. Ohh well.  But yeah I've evidently run out of things to say, so I'm gonna bail...   -Joebie

      Allo. Me again. So, today in Health we got this handout and we had to date it (it gets better...unbelievable, I know...) and I wrote May 20. Then I stopped for a minute and just stared blankly at my paper. I wasn't amazed that it was the 20th of May, I was just so creeped out about how fast this month has gone by. This whole year, matter of fact. Last year was painfully long because life sucked last year and doesn't now, but that's a whole other story. Anyway, so I'm staring at this date, and out of nowhere it just clicked. 5 days. 5 fucking days! 5 days til the Distillers concert! I can't believe it. This is the same Distillers concert which I've been counting down to since it was 55 days away. It doesn't even feel like I've been waiting 50 days, but I definitely have. I just find that incredibly creepy, how time flies by so fast. Now, I'm not  trying  to make a referance to cliches or anything, because they're the devil, but that one "Time flies by when you're having fun." It sounds cheesy, but it's kinda true. I'm not going around to my friends, skipping merrily and saying "Gee, guys! The time is flying by so fast! Where's the year gone! We're having so much fun we just don't realize it!" But. It's kinda true. Minus the preppy factor. Matter of fact, don't even try to figure that one out. The bottom line is, cliches are cheesy, and time is jumping around at random intervals.  Soo, today is officially boring. I'm so tired. I've been tired all goddamn day. And I know why. I got up in time to catch the 8:10 bus this morning rather than take the 8:23 and be 10-15 minutes late. Normally, I can't be bothered to wake up in time to catch the 8:10. Whenever I try, I get ready, look at the clock and it's already 8:15. But. I got up in time to catch the 8:10 today, and I don't know why. I walked into English this morning and Mr. VanD gives me this creepy ass smile, shows the thumbs up and goes "Woohoo! You're on time today!" "...Or so it would seem."   Anywho, school (as always) was slack as hell. In 1st period we read a myth (wheeee...), in 2nd we got the remainder of our abuse presentation, in 3rd we watched a movie about Rome, in 4th we watched Stomp and I fell asleep in my chair, in 5th...I actually don't know what we did. I kinda fell asleep then Ms. Halbert woke me up and hauled me down to the office and I sat there. Doing nothing. If she does that again on Tuesday, I'm just going to go into the gym and visit whoever's up in the bleachers. And Halbert phoned my dad, and I phoned him from my cell after school and he tried to bitch at me, but I just told him that A) I don't get that fucking shit, B) It's retarded, C) I don't need that class next year, and D) I never do shit all in that class and I'm still passing (he was bitching about me failing or something). Like fuck. I wish he was out of town so I could skip that class altogether. But noo. He doesn't go back to Estevan til July 1st. Fuck. HATRID GRR! Anywho...  Today I had my eye test in Driver's. Surprisingly, I passed. We like had to read these numbers that were 18,000 miles away (I had  no  idea what they were, I guessed half of them). Then, he'd switch eyes and we had to read them again, then my mom and I went down to some office dealy that gives you your licence, where they took my picture and I got my learner's. Yeah pretty excited about that. I most likely will get to go driving tomorrow. Providing that the weather will be nice tomorrow, although I do love the rain. That's what prevented me from driving today. Stupid bastards. Stupid stupid!  ...It would appear that I have run out of topics to rant and/or ramble about. I  may  get some further ideas as to what to blog about later in the night, upon which I will rush to the computer just so you can read my senseless rambles. Actually, it's more like I'll go on the computer and blog if and when I feel like getting off my ass to do so. Although I doubt I will get more ideas. We'll see what happens.   -Joebie

      Gaah. Today is  such  a lazy day (well for me anyway). I did absolutely  nothing  in school today. Nothing. In 1st I pretended to read while Mr. VanD was in the room (which wasn't all that often...) in 2nd I zoned out during some abuse presentation, in 3rd I fell asleep, in 4th I pretended to dance, and in 5th I didn't do shit all except be really disturbed at the pink teddy bear that was under the sink in the science lab for some reason. The only class today that I did actual "work" (if you can call it that) in was Driver's. We got this assignment thinger, which was ridiculously easy. Which reminds me. I had my written tests in Driver's yesterday. One was a signs test, and the other was a basic driving test and shit like that. They were both multiple choice. I think you had to get 80% or higher to qualify as "passing". I got 88% on my driver's test and 100% on my sign test, and I get my learner's tomorrow (provided that I pass the eye test...) I don't understand how people fail the driver's test (5 people in my class did though...) A) It's multiple choice, and B)  Most  of it is common sense, although evidently common sense isn't so common in most people.  And while I'm ranting, I decided that more people need to blog. I don't know how many people read my blog, but I'm guessing quite a few. And most of them don't have blogs, and need them. I sit here every second or third day and write 1,000 (I may be exaggerating a little bit) words of rambling ranting goodness, and occasionally I read a couple people's blogs, but not often, because people are lazy bums and don't have them. I don't know why, but I love reading people's rants and rambles. Don't ask, I wonder about that one enough myself. So if you're one of those lazy bums who sit there and get to read the glouriousness of a thousand people's blogs without contributing to the bloggageness with your own blog, GET ONE! It takes like 3 clicks...lazy bums.   -Joebie

      ...Fuck. I just finished typing out my science lab, for the second time. You heard me. SECOND TIME. I'll explain. So I'm almost finished typing out my lab, home stretch, right? Then, Microsoft Word decides to gibble up, and I lose all my information. I almost died. That took  forfuckingever  to type! And now I just finished typing it out, all I have to do tonight is blog and practice drums. Then tomorrow I have to have drivers and study for my drivers test afterwards AFTER all my chores. Then Tuesday I have drums. After Drivers. If I'm lucky I'll get some socializing in Wednesday or later...I've been pretty busy.  So Friday, being it my birthday, I had a few people sleep over, and we went bowling, watched fire, and ordered pizza. And such. Yeah it sounds boring, but it wasn't. It was pretty entertaining. Then Saturday...What the fuck did I do Saturday??! Oh right...In the morning I went with Lindsay and my mom to Telus in the Cornwall to fix my cellphone, then I went out for supper with my family to East Side Mario's. This was the belated "Birthday supper" type thing, so my parents told the people that work there that it was my birthday, and well, long story short, they sang me a song about birthdays to the tune of the Flintstones theme song, and I spun a wheel. I won a mug. It said I won a coke. I have  no  idea how that worked out. Then when I got home, I decided that for the remainder of the day/night I was going to study for drivers. I would do nothing with friends. And I accomplished that. For about 20 minutes. Autumn phoned me and we went to a movie. Then I slept at her house. I'm easily persuaded (at least when it comes to getting out of homework). And then today I went back to Telus because my web browser thinger wasnt working right and, well, that was pretty boring. Then I typed out my science. And now I'm blogging....So today was pretty fucking boring eh?  But yeah, I gotta go...It's 8:31 and I still gotta practice for drums because I havent AT ALL....and I gotta study for drivers (or  try  to, anyway)...Later.   -Joebie

      So, hello. I'm sitting here,  trying  to get a ringtone, but as it turns out cellphones hate me. Last night I was sitting at the computer, going to random sites and trying to get "Smoke on the Water" By Deep Purple and...well, to no avail. Soo I went to bed before I took an axe to the computer. Then today, I went to the Telus Mobility website (my phone's brand...shocking, I know) and I poked my dad with a stick (metaphorically, of course) until he gave me his pin and client number so I could register to this site so I could get a ringtone. And, so I succeeded and registered a name to this site. And eventually I found the ringtone I wanted ("Smoke on the Water") and bought it. So, a couple minutes later I get a message on my phone. "You have a ringtone, 'Smoke on the Water'. Would you like to open it in Web Browser?" Or something to that effect. So I press OK and this white screen comes up with little blue arrows that look like >>>>>>>>> at the bottom of the screen. So I'm waiting for like, 10 minutes, then I quit because I'm impatient. Then I started again, at about 10:36, and it's still going, and its exactly 11:00 at this moment. I'm beginning to doubt that I even have Internet on my phone. I'll get my dad to attack the people at Telus tomorrow and find out. He was supposed to phone today but...he can't remember anything. Meh.  And today, (I'm still grounded for the whole door incident) I cleaned my ENTIRE house (by the demands/requests of my mother). Seriously. I did everything except the laundry. The only reason why I did it, essentially, was so I can have a bunch of people sleep over tomorrow, ON MY BIRTHDAY!!! (!!!) I can't wait. I'm real excited, and I don't know why. I don't even know what we'll do. XD. We'll probably go bowling. Ahah...Or something to that effect...Enter the 6 year old Friday night... :| Oh well. Its not like my parents'll be around.  And as far as school goes, nothing special happened. Had my gay morning classes then I had a smoke at lunch with Lindsay and people and then we sat in the cubby and I played with my phone and we ate lunch and do what we do every single day at lunch in the same cubby every day while we visit Him and discuss entirely random crap that I tell you about every single day I blog and I don't know why. Oh, but we have a new addition. A new addition to the cubby. Sort of. We don't know how much longer he will live, but he actually  does  exist. His name is Entertainor. Entertainor the Dancing Spider. He lives in the light above the cubby and skitters across, dancing for us at random intervals. I discovered Entertainor, and Lindsay named him. I was laying on Sandy's leg (She's  reaaally  comfortable) and I was staring at the light, and I saw this black dot in the middle of it. So I go, "Hey, look, a fly is stuck in the light. Haha." And it was creepy. Right when I said that the fly that wasn't really a fly at all got up and started skittering and dancing for us, saying, "Look! I'm not a fly! I'm better than a fly! Look! I'm dancing for you with my 8 gloriously magnificent legs!" and Lindsay's like, "Oh dude, that's a spider." "That's wildly entertaining. He's  dancing  for us!" "He can be Entertainor!" "Entertainor the Dancing Spider!" Thus concludes the story about Entertainor. Yeees, b'y. But. I must be going. It's late-ish and I need sleep. (By the way, my phone is still not loaded the webpage and its like, 11:15. Gaah!)   -Joebie

      Looordy. Lately I'm not really finding too much time to blog. I'm only blogging now because I feel obligated to. I'm kinda pissed off right now because my brother is fucking around with my drumset and he fucking SUCKS at drumming. The funny part is, he's actually  taking  lessons. Yeah, it gets better. Like everything he does, if it takes work and effort, he doesn't do it. So I guarantee he will quit in 2 weeks tops. XD Yeah, I had a big conversation about that in the car on the ride home from my drum lesson, but I can't remember it. That's another thing. I find that it's really hard to remember simple things, such as what I had for lunch. That, or I black out. Lots. Like last Thursday, in social, I blacked out. I looked at the clock and it was 11:00. I look 5 minutes later, it was 11:17. It was kinda creepy. So, then I zone out and Mr. Adams is like, "JODI! you wanna join the class and maybe open your books now?" (Apparently I had blacked out on my binder) I look at him, and open my binder. "Yeah, this is what we call a rhetorical question." And he stretched out 'rhetorical question' as if he was talking to a 5 year old. I just look at him, then I go, "Well, if it was a rhetorical question, then why did you ask me it?" "Go sit outside! Get out of my classroom!" But yeah anyways my brother's being stupid so I'm going to go practice drums so he doesn't drive me nuts with his lack of talent.   -Joebie

      Today was kinda boring, but I have an interesting story as well.  Kind of.  So, I woke up at about 10:45am, give or take, and I made my mother a Mother's Day breakfast type thing. Then I watched my dad try to put these chairs together that he bought my mom for Mother's Day, but it turns out that one of them, a piece for it was like snapped in half. So, after he was done shitting his pants with anger, he and I went down to Canadian Tire to exchange the chair, which took  forever  because the people at Canadian Tire have the mind capacity of a stick. Honestly. My dog is smarter than them. Anyways, and then after that we decided to go look at cell phones. So we did that for about an hour, then we went home. I decided against the Samsung one, because I phoned Braun with one of the ones they had there, and they're too small and too hard to talk with. So, no. Then we went out for supper at Montana's. Yeeep.  Okay, now for the interesting story. Actually, I just realized I have another story after this one. Hrm. Okay, so we're out at Montana's. We wait for about 20 minutes, get a table, order our food and eat it. (It gets better) So we figure the bill's going to be at least $65, right? (Probably more) So the idiot that was our waitress, gives us the bill. Look at the grand total....$32. So my dad looks at the bill and he's like "This  definatly  isn't our bill. But, it's their mistake, so I'll pay this one. It's a hell of a deal anyway." (The bill actually belonged to the table  beside  us, this Chinese couple, but I have a story about them in the next paragraph). So my mother, Tyler, and I go to the car to wait for my dad. So, my dad evidently paid the Chinese couple's bill as our own. So he walks non-chalant out of the restaurant then fucking books it to the car. "GO GO DRIVE!" he says. Apparently the people at Montana's were starting to catch on. Especially the Chinese couple. I just think that's hilarious. We paid, like, at least half of what the meal itself was worth.  Okay, so this Chinese couple. Now, I know that Chinese people have a reputation of eating an insane amount of food in one sitting, but MY. FUCKING. GOD. This story is about the girl in particular. She's the tiniest person in the world. She had this double chicken dinner thing. There was. So much chicken in this thing. I couldn't believe it. I thought she wasn't going to finish half of this dinner. No, no. She eats the whole fucking plate. THEN, for dessert, she has this 6 or 7 inch tall cake. Oreos, peanut butter, mocha...mmm, calories, is all I can say. This thing was HUGE. She ate almost the whole thing. WHERE THE HELL IT ALL WENT I HAVE NO IDEA. But, yeah, I don't know what else to rant about, so, I bid you adieu.   -Joebie

       It's going down, tonight in this town. Cuz they stare and growl...they all stare and growl. I take a scar every time I cry, cuz it ain't my style...no, it ain't my style. I went down to the gravel, head to the barrell. Take this life and end this struggle.  -Distillers' "City of Angels"   I usually start my blogs with a song when I start blogging and that particular song is playing, or when I don't have too many topics to blog about. It's a little bit of both. Mainly the one about the lacking of the topics. It's very hard to blog under pressure. By that, I mean, when someone is  forcing  you to blog. *ahem ahem LINDSAY...* Anywho, so, in the words of Ashley, (except the name is changed) "If you feel like complaining about this blog, please, blame Lindsay. It's all her fault." So, today, I did nothing. Absolutely nothing. N-O-T-H-I-N-G. Nothing. I'm still grounded. And I'm  trying  to be a suck-up to my mom, but it's  extremely  hard, when she's being the world's biggest bitch. So, I think, ultimately, as far as having people sleep over on my birthday and going to the Distillers go, I'm digging myself a bigger hole. So I'm going to  try  to be a big suck-up (yes, Lindsay, SUCKDASHUP) in order to achieve Distillery goodness and having people sleep over on my birthday...goodness. Yeees, b'y. But...I'm gonna bail.    -Joebie

       Murder murder, a ripe blood stain. Pulled the fucking trigger cuz I'm sick of it all. Murder murder, a ripe fucking hate. Pulled the fucking trigger cuz I'm sick of it. I went to school today with an Uzi. There's this kid, he teased me so I shot him in the face. All the world's light won't ease my pain. It won't cease, I'm diseased. Won't you hang me please?   -Distiller's "Sick of it All" hehe...18 days...=D    Ok, so school today...rocked. I didn't go in the morning because I needed to know how I would walk without snapping my foot in 8 places, then in 4th I sat there and bitched with Ms. Clark in between talking to Braun, Ashley, Chazlyn and Candace, then...I skipped 5th went into the gym and talked to Braun and the creatures that go along with her. Then I had drivers. And we never do anything but write notes and watch movies. So I just sat there talking to whoever was around. I'm surprised Mr. B didn't kick me out for skipping.  And then after supper my dad and I went to look for a cell phone. I found the tinyest one ever. It's so LITTLE! It's like a Samsung thinger...Iunno...Cost $200 but hey it's not my money! Now, I'm not saying I'm spending all my dad's monAy....the clerk at Rogers Communications is!!!! (My birthday's in 7 days...May 14)  Anywho I'ma bail...I've not nothing else to say...   -Joebie

      Ok, so I'm limited with the time, so I'm gonna make this blog relatively short, or  try  to, anyhow. So, at lunch today, in the cubby (as always) after we got back from 2-4-1, Brian and Kyle dropped by. Kyle is so fucking moody. Today he said that he supposedly hates Brian, but that'll probably change by tomorrow. But anyway, so Lindsay was telling us about how this comedian was going up to people and saying "Cake or death?!" and the 4th guy he asks is like "Cake please" "We're all out of cake. We only had 3 pieces, I didn't think it would be so popular." "Ok, so my choices are 'or death'?" "Basically." "Ok. I'll take the chicken." anyways, so we're telling random people as they walked by "You there! Cake or death?" Most people ignored us, but if they did we would yell "SLUT!". It was funny as hell.  So, I have comfirmed that Jesus is  definitly  attacking me. Me waking up to the "Jesus' Brother Bob" song after falling asleep in class, hearing the "King of Carrot Flowers 2/3" song while looking at a picture of Jesus while the light is ONLY shining on his face, and him attacking me for going out while I'm grounded. I'll explain now. So, I'm grounded for 2 weeks, right? So Autumn phones me at about 7:30. "Wanna come over?" She says. "I'm grounded, but it's worth a shot" Surprisingly enough, my dad lets me. (I was shocked) So the plans for the evening were simple. Play a little basketball, then walk to McDonald's because Autumn's mom wanted us to get food. So we played basketball for about 24 minutes (Yes, 24) then I was like "I wanna play soccer" so we did. For about 2 seconds. I try to deek her out and I twist my right foot. This hurt like fucking HELL. I was laying on the pavement, for like 5 minutes. The pain was, unimaginable. THEN I had to walk to McDonald's. Oh well. At least I get a "get out of dance free" ticket. Providing that Ms. Clark isn't a bastard.  Anywho, I find it hard to concentrate what with my drunken mom yelling at me for going out tonight, so...later.   -Joebie

      So, lately, my moods and emotions have been nothing but a roller coaster. I don't think I can find a more perfect way to describe it. Not just about my parents, everything. Guys, friends, ex-friends, school. One moment things are going good the next it's like it can't get worse. Yesterday was by far one of the worst days I have had in the longest time,  months . And, about that, well, long story short, I got in a kickass fight with my mom, went into her room and kicked a hole in her door. Semi-unintentionally. I don't remember if I wanted to kick a hole in it. I'm guessing not, though, because of my dad. And then afterwards, after I had realized what I had done and after it had sunk in, I was fucking tripping out. I knew I was in shit. This reminded me of one day back in June, when I knew I was in shit, and I couldn't talk my way out of it. Lindsay knows, and God knows that half my school knows as well. Shit gets around fast...Anyways after I realized what I had done, I escaped my mother by camping over at Autumn's place. One of the roughest nights of my life.  [By the way, my punishments so far include: not being able to go to Distillers (although I think I can talk my way around that one), paying for the door (even though my dad gave me allowance today...), 2 weeks grounding, and getting nothing but a cell phone for my birthday (I have no doubt that that isn't going to happen!) So basically, the only thing that's 100% offical at this present time is the grounding.]    And then today I come home after Driver training and my mom's like "You know, you should've thought before you acted out on your rage and kicked a hole in my door. Then you wouldn't be in so much trouble" I can't remember what I said to that, but it's kinda hard not to when your ready to kill someone. I mean, it took enough will power not to rip the fucker off its hinges and hurl it at her head!   Driver training makes me mad. The instructor is  such  a lackey. Okay, he's taking attendance at the END of class (for some reason...) and he calls my name, I look at him and I'm like "...I'm here" and he's like "Come here for a second." So I go up there, and I'm standing there for at least 5 minutes while he's talking to some other person, and I was like "...So, did you call me up here for a reason?" and he's like "Oh yeah...my daughter knows you." I just give him this weird look and I'm like "Ok...well who's your daughter?" "Megan" "Megan...?" "From McClurg." I was like "O...k..." and I walked away. Now, either I have  no  idea who this Megan creature is, or I do, but it's too far back for me to remember her. I think I have a faint idea, but to confirm it would involve me conversing with specified people, and I don't have the energy right now, and I don't really care. Also, the fact that she remembered me (whoever she is) is slightly creepy. Because, if there's one thing i  do  remember about a Megan, is that I was never really good friends with them.  At lunch today we were all sitting in the cubby, and Brian and Kyle come along. I talked to both of them a little bit, then I started playing with my lighter. So Brian took his lighter out. Then somehow (don't ask me how) me and Ashley decided that Kyle's a penguin. And me and Brian (joking) decided to set him on fire (It's a long story, but basically we set penguins on fire because every day that goes by a penguin doesn't burn, a rubber ducky does...that, and they're the devil.) So Brian and my are lighting the frills of his jeans on fire. Harmless, little fires. Well, he didn't take too kindly to that. Anyways, he spazzes on Brian and he turns his back to him. So Brian holds the lighter to his jacket for maybe, 2 seconds. Kyle pulled fucking drama queen and spazzed on ME because he thought I did it. Anywho, so he storms off and me and Brian decide to have a lighter fight. Lighter fights are ridiculously fun, and apparently fun to watch. It was hilarious. Long story short...I win! And on that note, I bid you adieu.   -Joebie

      Now, from yesterday, I've done some more thinking. I'm a little less homicidal and/or pessimistic, and well...ah crap I've lost my train of thought *hears 'choo choo' sound as she looks to the left and sees a train chugging away.* I don't know...So my dad came home for a visit last night (he works out of town in Coronach) so I camped over at Autumn's to escape his ass-holy-ness. Anyway...so he picks me up from her house today and right off the bat starts bitching about my bracelet. "You can't be wearing that. You could take someone's eyes out. The spikes are too long." so I just said to him "I spent like $7 on this, I'm not throwing it in the garbage." He shut up. I think he's starting to realize that he aggravates me to no end, because whenever he comes home I'm never there. And for good reason. I hate him and I don't want to see him, or see as little of him as I can. Luckily, though, he's going back to Coronach tomorrow. I just can't get over how fucking moody he is. Take today for example. I called him to see what's new over there (my house). At first he's all peachy keen, and then I was like, "Well, could Autumn come over for a little bit?" then he's like "Well..." then I said "Well, if you don't want her to, it's alright..." then he fucking trips and says "I DIDN'T SAY THAT. STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH. I HATE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT." He pisses me off. Anyways, I'm a little "happier" now, I guess...but I'm still not going to try and make everything better. I'm still just gonna sit back and watch what happens, hoping for the best. Whatever happens, I'll deal with it somehow. Later.

      ...Fuck. I've been thinking lately, and I'm so sick of the way things have been going. Friends drifting away, guys, ex-friends being fucking retarded, my dad being an asshole that favours my little brother, people looking down on me like they're better than me because I'm different from them. I'm fucking sick of it. And I'm also sick of trying to resolve everything and make it ok. So I'm just going to give up, quit trying to fix it all. I'm going to give up, sit back and watch my life and relationships get ripped to fucking pieces right in front of me because no one ever gave a shit. I've tried before, but people either don't listen, don't care, or don't give me the time of fucking day to talk to them, so FUCK IT. There's no way things are ever going to change now. It's not like these situations are new to me. This has been going on for years. This is why I stopped being a prep. This is why I'm the way I am now, a fucked up chick who does stupid shit and skips school. This will be the death of me. I am thankful for the select few who don't judge me or look down on me constantly, because without them, I wouldn't be here right now. Around them it's like I'm a whole different person. But when they're gone, it all fucking goes to hell and I become the person I regularly am. So, thanks.

      woo. i didn't blog  at all  yesterday. its like...a new breakthrough for me. not really, lol. but yeah. so last night i didn't do anything for reasons disclosed (:@) and today...well..let's just say i'm still in my pajama's! so lazy day today. anywho...so i'm sitting here, drinkin diet coke, eatin some chips, and listening to alice cooper! he's my new obsession. i burnt the 1975 cd "welcome to my nightmare" the other day and it's awesome! yea..soo pumped for october!! we've got zeetz linz...we got zeetz. lol, don't ask. right so i think it was yesterday i was bored so i took a trip to good ol' forwardgarden.com and ventured into the music section out of curiosity. and...i saw a couple forwards about avril lavigne; people were debating that she is punk. jesuschristexcusemewhilemyheadexplodes. avril lavigne??! punk?!? don't make me l-a-f-f laff. my tweezers have more punk in them than her. "yeah, i'm punk all right. i wear ties and sing a song about a 'sk8er boi'." ugggh. and apparently, she said stuff like, "i'm as punk as they come", "i'm punk for the new generation. you don't see britney running around wearing ties and singing punk." ties have been around since before you were born, girlie. aaand, punks don't label themselves. she needs to go die. right now. in a corner. along with her 9 year old fans. also, a quick fact: she was, at a point, a country singer. until her label or whatever the fuck told her to be more "punk", because that's what is "in" right now." yes, little avril. follow the trend. anyways i am going to stop myself before i get into a full-fledged rant about avril la-fucking-vigne. but yeah so, these past 2 days, i was bored so i took a html tutorial. which basically just explained the basic codes of html. if you're interested in taking the tutorial, you can click  urlLink  here  . you can also find it in the links section. anyways. we're having a campfire tonight. woohoo. i actually am taking a break to tell you people about my boooring life. hm. yeah. he brought like fuckin bugspray out and saw a mosquito crawling around on like the arm of a chair and he sprayed it n it was staggerin around n he was like "jodi!! watch him dance!!" i was like "hoh!!!" i guess linz would only  truly  understand that. and ashley. silly hobo jesus. but yea it's dark now so i suppose i should get back out there...hahhaa..byebye...might blog later...but prolly not..we'll see. :)  -joebie

      greetings. so today, i woked up bright n early (try,  6:30am  early *blink*) got ready and got to linz's house at about 7:00. no, i'm not just  that  big a lackey to go to my friend's at 7:00am. i promised her i would go with her to wait outside the centre of the arts so she didn't have to sit there for 3 hours by herself. she was buying tickets to the alice cooper show in october. so the doors of the centre of the arts opened at 10:00 and we got there at about 7:30, give or take. so she buys 3 tickets at a juicy $65 each and we head out to phone her dad to come pick us up. i had not known that i was going to the alice cooper show at the time. i thought that i was just being a nice friend by accompaning her waitingness. but in the car on the way back her dad says something along the lines of "so, there's 3 tickets. 2 are for you and a friend, and we will decide on the third later." i don't think she knew that she was able to take a friend until then. so she turns around to me and says "wanna go to a show?" oooobviously i said yes. no, i'm  never  going to a concert  ever  again. i'm going to stay home and listen to rap...fuck. i've been down that road before, and i burned it as i past, so to speak. i'll admit that i don't own a single album by alice cooper. and i don't have too many songs by him downloaded on my computer. but. i've heard their songs  lots . i was fucking raised on bands like alice cooper, ac/dc, motley crue, etc...and i  know  you've heard at least one of their songs. "school's out"?  everyone  knows that song. if you don't, you must be living in a fish factory or something. lol but yeah this concert's 108 days away. that's a long ass time to wait. but we'll manage somehow. we managed getting through the 55 days to distillers. mind you, this is practically  double  to wait. but. oh well.  what else is new with me? oh...it's my parent's 10th anniversary today. i think. we're going out for supper tonight. or something. ooh and its been exactly one month since the distillers concert. i must say, the day 25th is doing wonders for me and linz's concertness.  but yeah i'm gonna bail. laaater.  may  blog later.  maybe.   -joebie

      this is going to be one hell of a blog. lol. alright so last night me n linz decided we wanted to go to a movie. so about 7:00 (give or take) last night linz came over and my dad gave us a ride to the galaxy. we went to see "the chronicles of riddick". everytime in the movie that it said riddick we clapped really loud. it was  so  funny. then buddy in front of us, goes down and tattles on us and the usher is like "um, excuse me guys. but we've had a complaint that you've been clapping and talking loudly during the movie. please cease this, or we'll have to kick you out." lol...fuckin mama's boy, tattles on us...oh well. and then after the movie we took the bus back to her house. it was so funny. when we sat down, i don't know exactly why i did this but i had a big compulsive urge to, so out of nowhere i said "TEE HEE!" really loud in a  really  high-pitched voice. and the bus was like half full so i got obeasty looks from everyone. it was funny as hell, though. so then we get to her house, and after we were sick of her mom and glenn's drunken-ness, we went into her room and i had a good time sitting there pretending like i knew how to play the guitar. lol. i did learn the simplest of all simple songs though. it's played all on the first string. oh, and i learned part of "on top of spaghetti". yeah, then we went downstairs and put a bunch of blankets on the floor and sat there listened to music and talked and shit. it was alright. then today at around 12:00 or so her buddy darby phones and we decided that he would drop by and we'd walk around and what not. so he comes by around 1:00 and we walk around aimlessly around rochdale for a bit and i shared a smoke with darby. then we see the bus driving by and we book it across the street to catch it. then on the bus darby found a purse and he searched through it and stole a bunch of jewelry and some cheques and shit like that. then we decided to go to long n mcquade to fuck around with the guitars and shit. so we went there and i saw my old guitar teacher *shudder*. so. fucking. creepy. anywho, darby's a rank guitar player for only taking lessons for like 2 months. yeah, darby's this squeegee street kid. he's awesome to hang out with though. you can see a picture of him  urlLink  here  . yeah so then after we were done with that we went to b sharp and i watched them play some more lol. then we went to leave and we saw this 2-send cellphone dude so darby was like bugging him lol then i took a picture of the 2-send cell phone dealy (because i'm just that cool) you can see it  urlLink  here  . yeah and then here i am blogging, very tired and hungry. so i'm gonna go. later.  -joebie

      holy shit. where did the year go? i seriously don't remember most of the months since september. i remember walking into knoll on the first day and being creeped out by the people standing there cheering, and i remember christmas, and may 25 (cuz that was the day of the distillers) but everything else, it feels like it didn't happen. and here it's june 23. that's actually quite creepy, me not remembering most of the year. but. i can tell you one thing. it wasn't like this last year. holy fuck. i thought last year wasn't going to end. haha.  but yeah, today i woke up at like 8:30 to my dad bitching at my brother about not having a baseball mitt or something, then i fell back asleep, woke up again at 10:00, and i had to use the bathroom so i did that then woke up finally at 12:20 or so. i don't remember what i did from 12:20-1:00. then at 1 i took my puppy for a walk cuz he's fat, lol. then i got home, made some macaroni n watched part of maury! lol..then i went on the comp then here i am now, blogging. lol.  n tonight..i am not completely sure, but i think i'm going to practice drums. and lindsay might sleep over as well. yeah. i'm gonna go though. may blog again tonight. later.  -joebie

      oh yeah! who was right about her brother quitting drum lessons within 2 weeks?! oh yeah...me!! i was so fucking right. damn. yeah, he quit today. apparently it got too difficult for poor, lazy tyler. lol. like i  knew  it would. he thought it would be easy, but, to no avail. muahahha. while we're on the general topic, my drum teacher. is a crackhead. i was switching the drums around because i'm left-handed and they're much easier to play when they're backwards, so to speak. and, well...   mark: so, you're done school for the summer, are yeh? me: yep. mark: yeah...i can tell you're really bummed out about it being done. me: oh yeah...not really... mark: haha. well, i liked school, too. (sarcastically) that's why i dropped out in grade four, moved to indonesia and made clothes. for my uncles. me: alright then.   yeah. it's really entertaining though. he said a bunch of other dumb things, but it's not like i have a big notepad and i jot these things down or anything...lol. it would be pretty sad if i did, though...  so other than go to drums tonight, i didn't do anything. except drive home from like, sherwood drive. which was entertaining. i heart driving. lol. it's pretty easy, too.  but yeah, i'm gonna go practice drums. later. (if i feel like being a  really  big lackey i'll blog again tonight. lol. buuut i dunno.)  -joebie

      so, today it's linz's birthday. yeees. happy birthday, cretin. i guess i can tell you what i got her now. i got her a sketchbook, these 2-sided things covered in cloth that help you shade (i don't know it's professional name; on the package it said "shading stumps" =\), and these graphite sketching pencil thingers. so, yeah. i'm hoping she liked it.  so far, no call yet from dollar store or any other place that i applied at. mind you, i only applied yesterday. i don't really care about the other places i applied at. i really want to work at dollar store. it was the first place i thought of, and the other places didn't exactly jump at the opportunity to take my resume. whereas the dollar store person said she would give the resume to the lady that hands out jobs (i'm really bad at professional terms, huh?) and she wrote down like "full-time summer, part-time school" on it. or something like that. so, yeah. fingers crossed!  but at the present moment i can't think of anything else to say. it's likely i will blog later on in the day, though. later.  -joebie

      ...yes, i am blogging again today. for the second time. and i am  not  ashamed. admit it. you  love  to read my blogs. they give you perverse pleasure. especially when i talk about kinky muppet sex, as featured in today's earlier blog. and well, if you don't like reading my blog, then you may want to take a look-see at the "about my blog" part on the left-hand margin. That's all I have to say on this particular subject. aaaanywho, so tonight, my mom drove me around rochdale and i applied at like, 5 places for jobs. dollar store (by iga), quiznos, the extreme pita, tim hortons and mr. sub. yeees. i think, if anyone will hire me, its dollar store, cuz it's like brand new, and the chick even said that they're looking for people. and i have cash experience. or so they think. lol. i wrote that on my resume. shh. but yeah, i know how to  count  money. and even if i didn't, the machine does it for me! :) ah, the wonders of technology. but yeah, that's really all i wanted to say. until next time! which is probably tomorrow.  -joebie

       don't ever take away from me my pornography! obviously we don't agree on what's obscene! i have the right to choose what i want to see and read! don't ever try to take away from me my right to privacy...cuz what i do is no one's business but me!  rancid - vanilla sex   today, so far has been relatively pleasant. mind you, it's only like 12:15. i had my pr. arts "exam" (if you can call it that) at 8:30-9:30. but really, we just sat there and watched some britney spears documentary and the price is right. =\ then after i met up with linz and she came over and we ate some pizza and chips...and watched little kid shows. the ones we watched were mr. dressup, sesame street, and part of berenstein bears. and. we just realized how entirely  creepy  those fucking shows are. now i know why i stopped watching those shows when i was like 5. mr. dressup was singing and pretending to be a chicken...and talk about sweetening a fairy tale! they did a re-enactment of little red riding hood, and instead of eating the granny and have an axe taken to him, what happened? they all went to grandma's house, and ate cookies and were happy. and sesame street, particularly the "elmo's world" section they were talking about bugs and where they come from and how they "go", so to speak. and. it's creepy. and mr. noodles, the creepy guy that lives behind the blinds. =\ and berenstein bears is just...creepy. yeah. we're cool. sit there watching little kid shows.  i forgot to add, yesterday after i bought linz her present i went driving =D and on the way home i hit the curb going onto my street! i'm actually not that bad of a driver. my mom just likes to say that. when i first started driving and she took me, every time i made a turn or something she would grasp onto the dashboard for sweet, dear life. it's kinda died down a bit now, but i noticed that every so often her eyes would like widen...a lot. it's kinda funny.  oh yeah, i forgot to add. while we were watching these little kid shows (because we are so very cool) we somehow got onto the topic of kinky muppet sex, and how mr. dressup and the truffles thingy have kinky muppet sex, and how elmo and dorothy (the goldfish) all find the muppets and have kinky muppet sex.   and this concludes today's blog, and probably leaving you disturbed and confused. =D if so, then i've done my job.  -joebie

      greetings. i bring glorious news. news that makes me want to dance. my dad is going out of town. in 2 weeks. for an undetermined amount of time. but still. at most i will only need to see him like 2 or 3 hours a week. my summer will be so much better without his moody ass around. wheee.  in other news, this weekend was  definitely  my antisocial weekend. i didn't do shit all. well. in the sense that i wasn't around people other than my parents and my brother. on both friday and saturday, my lackey ass family had a lackey ass campfire, so i was out there for a few hours each night. and on saturday, i was on the phone with linz for quite some time. we'd just sit there, and talk about entirely random shit. seriously. i don't remember what most of it was, but i know it was all completely random. one of them was something along the lines of "stop! suppertime! (mc dinner)". she is one of the only people where we'd look at something, and we'd look at each other and be thinking the exact same thing. it's kinda creepy. that, or something would happen, and we'd say the exact same thing at the exact same time. like, the other day, we were at the dollar store, and she saw this obeasty necklace with a cowboy boot on it.   linz: hoh...look at this. me: ...these boots were made for walkin'? linz: get out of my head.   yeah...officially one more hour of school left! i've probably said this already but still! wheee. can't wait for summer. go to some shows, get a job, and hang out with people. yeahh and go on stupid vacation with my stupid family. gaah.  so then today i went shopping for linz (i postponed it to go to a different store that wasn't staples) and got her...well, i can't say it here because i know she's reading this. i know this because she's on the phone with me telling me to hurry up and finish blogging in between her singing.  buut yeah lindsay's being an idiot on msn and i forgot anything i was going to say...probably not all that much anyway..but yeah...later days.  -joebie

      ahh. i can finally  breathe again.  i've basically been studying non stop for the past 2 days. brutal shit. yesterday i had my english n social exams, and today i has my health and science exams. english was easy but it took thinking and essay questions like a page long each (there were only 4 qu. on the test, 25 marks each) and i hate writing that much for one question. i'm far too lazy to bother myself to do it. but. i tried. i really, really did. then social was fucking EASY. all either multiple choice, mathing or fill in the blank. mainly because adams is far too lazy too actually make a difficult test. that's awesome, though. thennn health was easy i cheated haha cuz i'm at the other side of the room and i forgot to study the wellness wheel...meh. then science was pretty hard. all multiple choice, but ms. proud is evil and makes them difficult. whatever. i don't care about science. then tomorrow i have my arts ed exam which will be slack, then monday i haave my pr arts b exam. i don't care about that class, i'm failing it anyhow. and this weekend i'm shoppin for linz for a bday present cuz her big day is on tuesday. wheeee. i imagine i'll hang out with people too, if i don't feel like being anti-social. hah.  so..tonight, to celebrate the non-studyage, linz came over after finals n we sat there playin around with the drums, which was more fun than it should've been. so entertaining! hah. play, or 30 lashes with a wet noodle! good times..yeah then she stayed for supper then helped me clean the kitchen..thenn we bussed it on down to walmart then in like beside the parking lot there's the brand new stores. there's like a couple of food places, dollar store, haircut place, etc. anyways we went there and looked around dollar store and i jacked some shit from there. that place is clepto's paradise, man! the store is fucking HUGE, and only thing they have for security is a mirror that runs along the back, and if you stand at just the right angle, you can pocket some shit without beening seen doing so in the mirror. yeah and then we walked to tim horton's and robin's donuts to inquire about jobs (we had already asked at quizno's n dollar store). yeah..job's have been the main operative for the past couple days, seening as i just got my sin card and summer approaching and me oweing so much money cuz i either lose or break shit. that and like, birthdays and apparently now my cellphone! so yeah. joebie needs a job. my mom helped me make a resume (lol) and today me n linz applied for jobs at robin's donuts (the only place around that hands out applications! geez). i don't even care where i work, i just need a job. really bad. yeah. n i think i'm gonna hand in my resume to like..dollar store, quiznos n tim horton's! go me! yeah. i really need the money. baadly.  but this concludes my blog, so yeah see ya in a couple days! or something to that effect..lol   -joebie

       darkness, imprisoning me, all that i see, absolute horror. i cannot live, i cannot die. trapped in myself, body my holding cell.   -metallica's "one"...wheeeee   last night i was on the phone with lindsay, and she was like "what are you doing" so i said something like "watching midget porn" and she thought i said scented porn, soo then we decided that all porn smells like cabbage, and there's cabbage people, who are midgets and live in the plant section at wal mart..and her dad is cab-wah, lord of the cabbage people and scented midget porn. yup.  go home and wheee are my new phrases. i rather like them, actually. it doesn't have to make sense. whatever someone says just, "go home."..."hey i have a dog" "go home." and wheee i just say at random times, soo yeah. i'm actually pretty random. hm.  wheee one more school day..then finals...science is going to be r-a-n-k. gaah. hateful subject. and sometime after the afternoon finals either wednesday or thursday me n linz are gonna go to the  new  new dollar store (=\) on rochdale..not the crappy lame one. anywho we're gonna apply for jobs there so we have something to do in the summer. and plus, no one goes there so it'd be slack as hell. charlie got a job there and she is only 14 she just lied about her age. so obviously they don't make you prove that you're 15, or whatever. but yeah, if we did get the jobs that'd be awesome! fingers crossed.  today..had my slacker than something really slack classes...i dunno...i just generally don't like to be at school anymore...its not like i was ever like "yes. school! i love it" but erm...its gettin pretty bad. anyways then yeah after school lindsay came over and like just left now. then tomorrow i have drums. i   erm...ashley and linz have offically decided that i am a stalker. and i guess it's true. there's a couple of people that i talk about constantly and one i stalk kinda sorda but not like im gonna kill them or anything? and but the other one i can't because he's always on tour :(...but oh god...if crowned king comes to regina again (and they will!) i am so stalking shaun until he lets me on their tour bus! wheeee! and linz, you don't get a choice, although i don't think you'd be that keen on  not  seeing their awesomedy tour bus! oh god...i lead a sad sad life... :D (n linz...i don't want shaun to be my fajaa! thats icky and wrong...)  shit. i'm so not prepared for finals this week. =\. welll...english, health, social, arts ed n practical arts b should be relatively easy, dont know yet. but. science is the one i'm worried about. i mean, i'm failing pr. arts b n possibly science, but hell. i don't  need  pr. arts b next year. but i  do  need science. and now way in hell im goin to summer school! nuh uh...none of that for joebie. ooh. quick question: i know i'm dumb, and someone explained this to me before, but what's the difference between midterms and finals? theres something significant, i know there is! (besides the fact that midterm is in the middle of the year, n finals at the end) someone please tell me!  but i suppose i've ranted enough for this fine evening. i'm gonna go figure out what i'm going to do tonight. later.   -joebie.

      Oh man. Finals are approaching. Very fast. Faster than I want them to. Gaah. Oh, by the by, I got my binder back. My english teacher brought it to me in TAG. Apparently it was in the hallway. =  Mr. Adams: Well, how did you know it was Jodi's?  Mr. VanD: I just counted the safety pins, and I knew it was hers.   and then me and Lindsay had this deadly conversation about the safety pins and how VanD's the safety pin nazi.   Me: So...it's like..."There's 44 safety pins here. It can't be Jodi's. She always has 45. Kill the bastard that this binder belongs to!"  Lindsay: Hahaha. No binder for you!   Yeah...=/  But so today after school me Lindsay and Ashley decided to go 'Bus-trotting.' just riding the bus until it makes a full circle and just watch things. It's really entertaining. So on the bus I was being loud and obnoxious-like, and Lindsay's like "hoh! Look out the window! The little man!" Now. She was pointing to a painting of a little man on a window. I thought she was talking to some guy standing at the cross walk. So I said really loudly "HOH! HE SLICED OFF HIS HAAAND!!! BUT...NOT REALLY." Then Lindsay's like "...you're an idiot. I don't even know you!" And this guy sitting at the front of the bus turns around and like laughs at me (I think he thought I was talking to him) Then we get downtown and the bus driver comes to the back n is like "Where you guys going?" And we weren't going to say oh we'll just wait for the bus to make a full circle. So Lindsay's like "Erm...Ashley's house." "Where's that?" "Erm...I don't really know." So. We got kicked off. But. I think the reason she kicked us off was because A) She thought we were harrassing that guy, and B) We were being pretty loud. But. It's her job to tolerate obnoxious teenagers!!! She drives a public bus for fuck sake's!! anyways so we just ended up walking around downtown and we went to Carma chameleon, Uforia and some book store. Oh and this deadly candy store. Where I "got" the deadliest thing ever!! It's like a spiderman whistle dealy! You can see it here (Copy/paste link into a new Explorer window):  http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v291/MorbidMonkey/Random%20Crap/spiderman_whistle.bmp  Anywho then tonight...Well I just finished cleaning supper dishes, folding a load of laundry n puttin that away...and cleaning the basement...and this weekend...well I'm plannin on gettin some studying in for finals, driving and possibly practice drumming so Mark doesn't beat me with a drumstick...yep. but yeah there's my weekend in a nutshell

      Wow. I have a lot to talk about. I have to think though. I suck at remembering shit. I usually write topics on my hand. Ha. Been a long time...  Sunday we went out for supper to Melrose Place. Never go to Melrose Place. It's the  nastiest  restaurant. Ever. Ew. I got a hamburger and it crumbled before me. It was so nasty. And. They have lemons in  everything.  In the water, "lemon rice", the ribs...everything. And if they couldn't find a way to add lemons into the recipes of everything, they would put a piece of lemon on a piece of lettuce on the plate. It was rather creepy. Also, when I got up to leave, I happened to look around. I don't think I saw anybody under 95 there. And they have ENORMOUS creepy fish. And creepy paper mache parrots. =/  Monday my dad flipped on me cuz Tyler neglected some homework and erm...apparently Tyler's turning out "just like me". Whatever the fuck that means. I don't even care anymore. He's so fucked up in the head. I'm so used to it now, and I don't think that's normal. But I have better things to blog about, so I'm not going to sit here and bitch about something thats not even worth the time of day. :) I think most of school went rather well that day...not 1st or 2nd though...  Tuesday...rocked. lol. We had to paint these cars in 5th and I wrote Nick's gay in paint on the newspaper covering the table and put a arrow pointing to him. So Nick tattles, but blames it on both me and Travis. So we get hauled down to the office, and my teacher's like "Ok, stay here. I'll be right back." "...And what if I leave?" "Just stay here!" "...Yeah that's so not gonna happen." k. I made the mistake of sitting in the office during 5th for the ENTIRE time already, I'm not gonna do it again. So I went to Lindsay's 5th period class, and luckily there was a sub (Labatte, her regular teacher, knows I skip, I skipped a lot of classes when I had him as a teacher) So I sat there and talked to her the entire time.  And today. Music was. Awesome. I got to listen to people play Led Zeppelin, Metallica, and other assorted bands. On the guitar. And by the way. Wa-wa pedals are GOD. If you don't know what a wa-wa pedal is, you need to DIE. In the corner. By yourself.   Dollar Store. Is god. Especially if you're really cheap like me and don't like to spend a lot of money on shit. Ha. I got this $4.00 bracelet (maybe more) from there. I only paid $1.25. It was awesome! And I got discounts...cuz someone I know works there! Score! But. Maybe she's just an idiot and doesn't know how to work the cash dealy...either way, I win! HEHE I'VE GOT ZEETZ! (Silent z's...)  Also, today. Me and Ashley rode the bus for 3 hours straight. Simply because we had nothing better to do. I took pictures of shwans (don't ask) and random people. You wouldn't believe how funny people look in pictures when they don't know you're taking a picture of them. It's great. People on the bus are rather creepy, I might add. When I got off the bus, my legs felt like rubber. =/  ALSO today, I lost my binder. I think I just left it in the science lab, and I figure Halbert like took it and put it somewhere. At least I hope she did. I had my myth's book, a lighter, and ALL my fucking sharpies in there. And not to mention all the fucking work that I  need  to pass my finals and, you know,  not  fail grade 9. My marks are pretty iffy right about now. Mainly because I've been so slack since like January. Oh well. I'll pass. Somehow. I always do. =/  I'm sure there's something I forgot to blog about. But whatever. Until next time!   -Joebie

      Hello! I have lots of topics to talk about today! ...Kindaaa. Not really. But enough to make a nice tasty blog :S  So last night, I slept at Autumn's house. It was so funny. We were walking to my house, and there was this lady, and she had a dog and a kid, both of which were on leashes. Anywho, this kid kept looking at Autumn, and every time he did he would yell "SAAANDY!" in a big ADD voice (if you've seen the movie "Cabin Fever", he sounded like that Dennis kid that was always like "PAAANCAKES!") Anyway he kept doingh this until finally we were able to like walk away from them so he didn't have to be creepy. And the kid's like "SAAANDY WITH CAAANDY!" I shit you not. It was severely creepy. He must've been like 3 years old. I think he had tourettes or something, sereiously.  Yesterday at school, I had english, then TAG, then I went home sick. But. In TAG, we went on a walk for some reason.   Me: I don't wanna walk! I wish I didn't have legs.  Ashley: You don't know how creepy it is that you said that.   Then she explained to me about how lately she's been thinking about if you had to eat your own legs, what kind of situation you would have to be in to do that, and how long would it take for it to rot if you were in a deserted hospital of some sort. It's kind of complicated and a strange story and hard to explain and stuff so...yeah. And then we were all sitting in this courtyard after the walk.   Ashley: Nicole, how long would it take for meat to rot?  Nicole: If it's out here in the sun?  Ashley: No, like in a hospital room or something...  Me: Does this have anything to do with eating your legs?   Yeah anyway it was pretty funny. I was going to blog about people and things like that but I'm lazy and stuff so I guess that won't be happening. But. There's only 7 school days left! WAHOOOO! haha. Oh. I got my gradebook for Pr. Arts B today. My overall average in that class is like 46%. I guess it's a good thing I don't need that class next year, or else I'd have been fucked! Haha. Ah, well.  But, I must bid you adieu. The topics have been of the bye-byeing. lol. If that's a word. Anyways. Bye.   -Joebie

      School today was thoroughly boring. Basically in all my classes, I did nothing. Then after school me and Braun walked to 7-11, I stole some shit then we sat in some grass and talked and ate candy lol. Then I went home. Then after supper Ashley came over and we went to Knoll for this Young Readers Appreciation thing where Lindsay was one of the 16 people (of like, 400) to read her story thinger, which was really good. I think I gave up writing for lent, then times it by like 12. I used to really love writing, but now, I'm too much of a lazy bum and I can't be bothered to write really in-depth and all vocabulary and sophisticated-like. All the people there were either 8, or older than time. I think that's what everyone is. You're either 8, or older than time. Everyone sounded mono-tone and it made me depressed and want to sleep. And I had to sit by Lindsay's fajaa! Which was not very fun because he's creepy and sounds like a STALKER, and the only time I ever met him before (I think) was at the "drug meeting".   God. It is. So bloody hot in my house.  And  we have air conditioning. I'm like the only one who uses it. Christ. Although, part of the reason that I'm melting with heat would probably be because I wear nothing but hoodies, jeans, and sometimes sweatpants. All year round. But I'm quite alright with my choice of apparel. See! I know big words too! I play PICTIONARY! Not really. I don't see how that game has  anything  to do with dictionary. Oh wait. Picture. Dictionary. Picture dictionary. PICTIONARY! I've gone too far down this page. Too lazy to use backspace, so just deal with my mistake. This is basically what all the conversations in my head are like. Wow. I went from how hot it is, to clothes, so pictionary. Who'd a thunk it?! ...What the fuck. :|  Buuuut my time is almost up and my mom wants to play games and have a jolly old time. Erm. Yess. Well. Bye.   -Joebie

      In health today we were talking/learning about consent. The presentation person said that, "Consent does not exist if the person doesn't say YES, consenting it. If you try 'something' and the person doesn't say anything, even no, then it is considered sexual assault." Which brings me to something that the Cult (don't ask...) and I use all the time basically (again, don't ask...) "Silence gives consent". So, if silence gives consent, then yes can't possibly give consent, because  silence  gives consent. And if silence gives consent, then if someone says nothing at all...it's not sexual abuse. It can't be, because SILENT GIVES CONSENT, and the person was silent. SO THEREFORE CONSENTING. I suppose this topic is debatable. Maybe I just have too much time on my hands and I think and rant about too many things, too often...NAH! I love to rant. It's just a habit now. I think almost everyone of my blogs has a rant or a rant-related object in it.  I had drums today. Drumming is really fun and a good way to vent anger. I don't need to kick holes in doors and walls anymore!!! And...when I screw up, I can just beat the hell out of the drums, whereas when I screwed up when I took guitar I would have a coneption and end up breaking one of the strings. So...'tis a good trade-off. I'm startin to sound alright actually, and I'm not quite drumming at half the speed of smell anymore! I'm still a beginner though. And my drum teacher is both creepy and hilarious...at the same time...and his name's Mark. Coincidence?! I THINK NOT! Today he said something about he could tell when he looked at me that I liked to dance, and if I wanted to I could dance and drum at the same time. And then that song "We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind" song ( everyone  knows it) came in my head, and then it was  really  hard to drum. Damn you Ashley. And erm...we have to switch the drums around every class because I'm left handed, and I accidentally stabbed him in the armpit with the hi-hat pole, and he's like "AHHH! FUCK!" then all of a sudden he's all calm and he's like "...I guess it's a good thing I am buff and have very muscular arm-pits." Now he's about as buff as an anorexic stick. I'll let you think about that one for a minute. And then he's telling me about how I should go crazy on the cymbol and he's like "Yeah...just go crazy...hit that cymbol like you...erm...never hit a cymbol before...yeah...I got nothing." It was hilarious.  So...school today. I was late for 1st and we did some gay myth shit. In 2nd we had a health presentation, in 3rd we watched a video, in 4th we learned about staffs and treble clefs and all sorts of shiney things like that, and in 5th...I have no idea. I never do anything in that class. She doesn't even care anymore, which is a good thing. Oh ya, I was late for 5th and had to sit outside for like 15 mins with I think a couple other people.  But yeah I'm tired and not really allowed on the computer at the moment. And plus I have nothing else to really say...so until I blog again...(which won't be too long so don't worry :D)...bye bye!   -Joebie

      so today was supposed to be my lazy day. when i woke up, and throughout the entire day, i was  such  a lazy bum. but, sadly today was not a lazy day for joebie. oh no. my day started off with my mom waking me up at like 1:00pm to make her breakfast (eggs, toast..). yeah she was home sick from work today. and then i went on the computer for a little bit. then before i knew it it was like, 5:00pm and my mother, being sick and/or dying, didn't want to cook. so she ordered houston's pizza for supper. then i lazed around and watched like, jeopardy (which i will rant about in a minute), and some other creepy shows. i mean, i  really  didn't want to clean the kitchen. so i finally bring myself to do it at about 6:30, finish about 7:00, THEN i would be lazy for the remainder of the evening, right? wrong. my mother decides to go out, and on her way out "oh yeah. by the way i want you to finish the laundry and vaccuum the whole house and tidy up." my head nearly exploded. i really just finished about 20 minutes ago. and it's like 9:30. it sucked. in the grand scheme of things, it really isn't all that much work, but when you're fucking lazy as hell and don't want to do it, it sucks.  i was doing laundry in the commercials of big brother 5. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. big brother is back! i fucking LOVE that show. i've been watching it religiously for the past 2 summers. that show kicks ass. anywho, while we're on the topic of television, i'm gonna rant about jeopardy. well, not so much the  show  as the  people . but first, i need some more water...ok. all better now. so, if you've watched jeopardy in the past 24 days, there's this one guy. i think today was his 25th day. the dude's got like, close to $800,000. this guy. is such a nerd. just looks like a big mama's boy. and there's things he does EVERY DAY that makes me want to STAB him. at the beginning of the show where they're like "this is suzie from whatever, bob, and our returning champion, ken jennings (that's his actual name, not a random one, lol) who's total prize winning cash totals $755,069 (or whatever it is)" anyway, at this part, he always SMILES and SHAKES HIS HEAD. it bothers the blue hell out of me. i was telling my mom about this today and like, 5 seconds after i finished explaining to her, alex trebek pointed out the EXACT SAME THING. it was  really  creepy. and so is alex trebek. (is it alex, or alek?) anyway...and another thing, is when he selects a category, "cheese for $600" or whatever, he always tilts his head. he looks like a fucking DOG when he does it. ahh he's just really creepy. watch it and you'll see what i mean. jeopardy's on weekdays 5:30pm on channel 6 i think.  so yeah. yesterday i basically did nothing. yeah. oh wait. no. i went driving for like 20 minutes. it was awesome. lol. but anyways i'ma header. later.  -joebie

       "if i may put forward a slice of personal philosophy, i feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling demented child king long enough! and as his empire crumbles, my precious black widow shall rise as his most fitting successor!"  -alice cooper: the black widow. there is actually music to the song, but 2 minutes of ranting about how wonderful the black widow is.   wheee. it's like 12:10 and we just got inside from being pyros with sparklers. we being me and ashley. so tonight we went to the fireworks. which were  okay , but last year's were  way  better. probably because of the 100 year celebration and all. and yesterday was pretty boring. i got kicked out of kailie's house at noon so she could hang out with her now boyfriend JOSHY. lol. then i drove home from some random destination. then i did nothing. wow. it's actually  harder  to blog with someone sitting beside you reading everything you type. and i don't know why. yes, hello ashley. she's apparently not so much  reading  as staring at the computer screen. mmm. chips are good. erm...  i probably have more to say, but i can't remember at this moment because i'm an idiot. and ashley just leaned forward staring at her index finger, mocking me. but that's a whole other story that i don't feel like getting into tonight. so, i bid you adieu.  -joebie
