      Well. Nice Day! There is basically nothing really! My father brought the whole family out for shopping and such, later at the end of the day, he brought my siblings and I to the swimming pool. ( Ah, I love there! ) And I borrowed UT2004 from my friend. Its a great game! You all should go see it sometimes! Well, till i get more nice pictures or a better photo editing software, i'll not really have pictures inserted into the Blog --;. Those who wanna add their site links, please E-mail me @  urlLink HikariNetto@hotmail.com . I'll add you ASAP! Also if you have a button or something like a graphic to indicate your site, please allow me to link to it! ( P.S If you are unable to let me link the button from your site, don't worry. I have other ways to get the button up! )

      Crappy Day i have today. While Playing RO, im so bored that i could die. And during the couple of hours before i going to go to sleep, my grandmother is nagging like hell and my maid refused to clean the room. ( Maids these days are getting more and more "naugthy" ) I feel like just jumping off the building. Man...How i wished that i could just be outside, doing my stuff, without anyone coming here, nagging, dont wanting to do this and that...Like i said, Life is fucking tough.

      Well, first off, my class got into a  REALLY  heated arugment over a incident. My disabled classmate got his bag into the trash bin. There was quite a number of people in this case. The Disable classmate got bullied and then *Inserts alot of Blahs*, in the end we got abit of detention class ( the  WHOLE  class! ) For as far as i know, im not in this case. Im far away from it. Man...now everyone hates that disabled dude. ( Not everyone...mostly... ) - Poor Guy :/  As for my  GREAT  side, is that im happy to know that i had helped my friend and tried to defend him. Well...thats all im gonna say.
