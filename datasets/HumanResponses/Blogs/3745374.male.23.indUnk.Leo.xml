      Lemme tell ya about a new friend that i made...Her name's Smitha..and she never fails to make me ponder about exactly what kind person she is..She's appears to me as someone very honest and down to earth..but there's a catch..she's a Leo..haha And she's always braggin to me about all the hunks she comes in contact with..haizzz..But don't be fooled into thinking she's just another bimbo..cos she isn't..She just gets a kick out of admiring them..nothing more...nothing less..right smitha?? I call her the little devil..cos thats wht she is..I'm just waiting for the time when we get to meet up and hang out..It's been awhile now..All in all,i would say,the female friends that i have,are simply like precious gems.. Oh well..sometimes,i wonder if the label is true in some ways.."Scar,great at friendship,bad at intimacy".... oh..wat the hell...it doesn't matter either way...

I'm sure we will emerge victorious...i make it sound like as if we were headed into a war..lol...but hey,it's that bad for me man..it's do or die in this lifetime for me...will someone tell Avril lavigne to shut the fuck up..that snooty-wannabe,anal-cocksure poseur bitch....!!!!!her song,"don't tell" is so fuckin annoying..it should be given the grammy for "Dumbest,No Brainer Song of the Day"..!!!oh well..the Almighty says,he's pretty sure he can get me out of a mess like that,but avril,he's pretty sure she's fucked!!...ha..hahaha...hahahahaha...\m/..Long Live Rock And Roll....

      Finally,i listened to a song that brought out my inner feelings to light..damn..This song by Nickleback is awesome...   Never made it as a wise man I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing Tired of living like a blind man I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling And this is how you remind me.. This is how you remind me Of what I really am...   It's not like you to say sorry I was waiting on a different story This time I'm mistaken for handing you a heart worth breaking and I've been wrong, i've been down, to the bottom of every bottle these five words in my head scream "are we having fun yet??  it's not like you didn't know that I said I love you and I swear I still do And it must have been so bad Cause living with me must have damn near killed you  And this is how, you remind me Of what I really am This is how, you remind me Of what I really am

      Well,to put it on hindsight,i would say that yes,women these days are becoming way too materialistic and shallow.But let's take a slight pause and realise something..IT'S NOT EVERY WOMAN..!! I know for a distinct fact that there are still females out there who are realy kind at heart,simple and truthful..These females u might be wondering.."where on earth are they" right?? Well,my friends,that's where i tell ya,that these surviving women,are my closest and most trusted friends..They are the living epitomy of successful women,who are drop dead gorgeous,yet still not lured by the emptiness of material wealth or designer labels..These are the only women that i know by far are still what GOD created women to be!! To be worshipped and respected!!  Yeah,perhaps the females that i've fallen for,have been mistakes..after mistakes..But the friends,that i have known over the years and still do,are the ones who have my eternal and undying respect,for they give me the hope that out there,there are and there will be,women like them who stay true to their beliefs that,a good woman,is simple,kind at heart,yet beautiful and not easily lured into succumbing to the temptations of material wealth..For that,i would like all of them,(u know who you ladies are),to smile and tell yourself,that you have done a great job of exemplifying that humanity and women,are still the greatest gifts from GOD to men...  Hopefully,someday,i would find a woman,who would tell me that she loves me for who i am and wants to be there with me in good and bad times..Till that day comes,I guess,I will take some quiet consolation in roaming this evil,wicked land...alone!! The one whom you love,is the one who should take u higher..if u have lost her,you better go back out and find her...\m/

      I must say sunday,was the most boring day of my life.Especially with jamming cancelled and me stuck at home,very..very..bad combination... But as usual i just slept the afternoon away..It worked..woke up to realise it was almost 7pm..yeah,the day was almost done..  But monday...oh man..i had no idea i would get the most devastating call ever..My manager darren was contemplating quitting the band..When i listened to what he had to say,i told myself to just relax and listen.He had a lot of shit goin on in his mind,you couldn't blame the man..But at the same time,i knew that quitting the band wasn't something that was coming from his heart,rather,his mind..So we talked for more than an hour,i listened,i spoke...in the end,we resolved the issues at hand..And i told him,that i was more than grateful and happy that he was our manager...I told him that after everything that we talked about at the esplanade,it would be a real sad waste to let it go...We just have to keep the faith and keep moving forward..It's a struggle,but not for long..  So,Saint Darren,wateva happens man,just remember,we r here for you..Walpurgis is not just about music,it's a living enbodiment of friendship and belief...Remember man,we r gonna be riding high into the light...rocking everyone's world..night after night..peace dude..\m/

      Today,i shall tell ya the story of Miss Angie..my buddy,my comrade,my nemesis..... I got to know her through friendster..thought she would be just another friend,never imagined,we would be buddies..She's a very simple person,very funny,very intelligent(or so i think)..and very..very...good at attracting guys..laughs...she'e on of those women that u don't really see much of these days.. Anyway,she's always there to listen to me and advice me,although 3/4 of the time,i tend to strongly disagree with her points...hahahaha..and we end up annoying each other..but like all real buddies,after a few days,sometimes weeks..(a-hem)..we talk again and we laught abt the previous squabble..Dats how our friendship rides on,crossing whateva obstacles that come along..It's that simple,all it takes is sincerity and effort to keep a friendship going..I am thankful to god,that at least,of all the bad things i have,there are good things too that come in the form of friends like Ms Angie..for thsoe of u who wonder who she is,go check her out on my profile..in friendster..] Trust me,she's a great friend to have..A very good-hearted woman incapable of any evil-deeds...It's true..It's true... Ok,i know ur smiling from east to west angie..but it's all the truth...whateva i have written...so be happy... Ok folks..gotta call it a day now.. I shall retire for the day and resume on monday...

      Well..if you were wondering why i did not blog on saturday,here's a few reasons.. One-i slept like a log..woke up at 11am..still a bit deranged.. Mum,refused to let me use the computer...It's like this,each time i wanna use the com,i gotta type the password..and only my mum knows the password..And has no qualms abt being a bitch abt it whenever she feels like it..can u imagine,A 23 YEAR man having to ask his mum to type the password,just so he can use the computer..it pisses me off daily man..but,what the hell,i'm stuck with it.  For those of u who didnt really know me,don't be fooled by my easy-going ways..In reality,i'm an asshole..why? cos i hate my mum for the way she has fucked our relationship up..I have observed many of my friends and those ard me and how wonderfully they get on with their mothers..and very often,it saddens me..Indian mothers are known to be the most loving women to their children..always there with a smile,always fighting hard to liven up their children's spirits and inspire them and support them..through good or bad.. In my case,it has alwas been the direct opposite.You see,when my cousin from australia created all the horrible mess and left,my mum was on bad terms with my cousin's mum..for that few months,I thought my mum being the matured person,and who has alrdy been through life's trials and tribulations,wpuld have understood what i was feeling and going through..BUT NO!!!!!! She blamed me for the entire outcome..she said in her exact words that i quote.."If u had not gone and shown ur cousin how u live a wayward life with ur friends,she wouldn't have gone and fooled ard with ur so-caled best friend and ruined our family ties".......haizzz.....life... After my mum hurled that at me,I knew I was running to a dead end..I never had a decent conversation with her ever again..It's been two years now since that horrible episode..but my mum still treats me with disgust..The good news is,everythings fine with those assholes in australia..although i know,they r just being hypocritical..I know those sons-of-bitches...they r all the same..!!!  Maybe u still wouldn't understand why my mum and i have such a relationship..down the road..u will.. All i ever wanted was a mother,but instead,I had a mum...!!

      Its was about 4pm..and my hp rang..It was Ricky.,he asked me to join him and Darren for a movie..I declined cos i was broke and i was still stoned in bed..But Ricky lured me out..(sniggers)..with the fact that he had a piece of news for me..regarding a job offer..My eyes lit up..i was like..JOB??..HELL YEAH..FINALLY!!!!  It was a good movie..very entertaining..i laughed my balls off......(oopsss)..fret not,it's still there intact..!! Then.we sat down at the esplanade area and chilled out..we talked..and talked and talked abt everything under the sun,from band issues,to dreams,to families,to chicks...by the end of the night,after listening to Ricky and Darren and what we talked abt,one thing was cemented into my head... EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.  I realised that how the band came together,the people who who joined in and offered their sincere help,and most of all..the five of us who have realised that we have one common dream..!! For once,i knew that the last ten years that i have struggled and persevered with my dream,it's finaly breaking ground.. It was worth the struggle...cos for me,this dream,that i have held so close to my heart,has only two outcomes.. It's either i make it..or i'm dead...there's no tradebacks.. Well..what do u think god???

      You know,i've come to the point now where,i'm gona set the record straight..For quite awhile now,i've been judged and commented about by certain individuals who think my private live is their fuckin concern!! Get this straight u anal-pricks..all my life,i have led a decent and simple life..i never cheated,i never stole and i never treated anyone with disrespect..just because,at one time in life i made a grave mistake,it does not speak of my character nor does it give u the right to label me a "PLAYER" and whatever other "labels" you smart-wannabe asses came up with...  When my relationship with my last galfriend veered off into the abyss of loneliness and obscurity,I realised where i stood.. I didn't plan for anything nor did i expect anyone to come along and change my course in life...She was too busy with her family and other commitments,she didn't realise that i had been dropped to being just second-fiddle..Don't even get me started on why i loathe her fuckin family,no one will ever believe that such a family exists in this day and age..It's simple pure insanity people..But thankfully i emerged stronger and firmer with what i felt was the right thing to do..  Yeah..yeah..so i got to know another gal whom i spent some time hanging out with..Why i got along well with her,perhaps cos we could really talk to each other..A whole load of things started taking place and my mind was like in a whirlwind..My galfriend couldn't be the least bothered that she was busy with every other thing but me..Then came galB whom i hung out with quite a bit..We didn't sleep with each other whatsoever..we merely hung out to talk and surprisingly,she confessd to me one day that she had fallen in love with me..i was shocked!!i was like..wat the hell...? but she did attract me in a way,and i thought to myself,since my gf no longer cares abt me,why should i bother stayin on with her??it's pointless to be with someone who doesn't cherish u...  So,one time,i figured,before i plunge into another major headache,i betta test the waters... I wrote galB a really moving e-mail,tellin her that i did love her and that although she has begun avoiding me,it doesn't change anything..And i added the fact that i was leaving to go overseas to study,which by the way was true...What i didn't knwo was that galB was actually my gf's brother's friend..damn!!  A week later,everything exploded...The e-mail landed in my gf's brother's hands..her whole family confronted me..bla..bla..bla...the sister began fuckin me up... I told myself,either u stand up now,or forever shut up and be a dickless punk.. And so i fucked the sister back,questioning her abt the lies,the acting..and yes,the famous police report that she made against me...and which my gf duely betrayed her conscience and signed.. I knew..from then on,it was all but over..many a times,we patched up,tried to work things out..but we couldn't.. In my entire one and a half years,that was the only mistake i made with her,by seeking the listening ears of another gal..I f i had slept with galB or been physically intimate,then i wouldn't be complaining..  But where my ex-gf is concerned,i have been really patient and tolerant with all her mistakes which she till this very day,refuse to realise..That's why..we hit the end of the road... Call me whateva u want,think of me in whateva way u want,label me whateva u want...but help me understand this,why do we only remember a man for the one mistake he made and condemn him to hell...and forget all the hundred and one good things he has done..??????? I no longer care what u think of me and what u make me out to be...cos i admitted my mistake and faced the consequences..and ever since then,i have never made the same mistake..cos i learnt from it..If u can't see me for the man that i am,then perhaps,ur not meant to be in my life.. Perhaps,people fail to realise that a guy with many female friends is not automatically a "player"...why? just ask my female friends how i am with them and u will get ur answers..when u treat women with respect,the good ones appreciate u..the bad ones,they just find ways to paint u otherwise... dat sums up my thoughts on my prvate life...

      In 1994,I found my best friend in life..or so i thought.. Hemant was his name.We shared the same dreams,the same passion in music.We always believed someday in the future,we were gonna be rockstars..And he being the proud one,always proclaimed himself to be better than me..I usually laughed it off.. I thanked god cos from where i came from,friendship was a  blessing to me..we were like real life brothers..everyone envied us..cos we had a bond that was as thick as oak.. No one dared mess with us knowing we would always be there to stand up to any fight...together!!  He graduated in 1997..i flunged..so off he went into the military and me..back to school again..Thankfuly,i graduated in 1998..Through the years,both of us had wonderful times..we were like two souls without a care in the world..H e also had a girlfriend who was a gem of a person.I always drilled it inside his mind how lucky he was..and that he should always treasure her..and he did..or so we all thought.  As the years went by,nothing really changed.I remember our first foray into the clubbing world..It was one hell of a night.. It was exactly a month before i was to pass out from bmt..me,my 3 bestest bunkmates and hemant took a trip down to boat quay..to chocolate bar..lol..yeah..laugh all u want... Each of them bought two jugs of whiskey coke..that was a total of 8 jugs by 1am plus exactly..and they decided to call it quits..but it didnt happen cos i hadnt bought anything..I will leave it to ya imagination..but by the end of the night,I was pissed drunk for the first time in my life,got the malay waitress's num who eventually became my gf for awhile and i was 200bucks poorer..  but hemant was there to help me home and made sure i was alrite.. it was that moment when i thought back,that i realised how fortunate i was to have a bro like him..i thanked the heavens above..  Exactly a year later...all that changed.. His gf Jane and myself..never would have imagined what laid ahead for the both of us...It was scary,it was painful,it was unimaginable..but mostly..it was a blasphemy..!!!  To make it simple,I lived through every clubbin moment with him watching him flirt,date and bed gals from the sleazy dumb Hendrix Bar we so used to frequent...  My cousin came over from Australia for a vacation..and boy did it turn out to one vacation from hell...!!! Being a nice cousin.I took her to hendix bar to show her the nightlife,and boy did she screw my life that night..with hemant!! Both of em disappeared almost the whole night and when they finally appeared at 3am,hemant had a lovebite on his neck..that son of a bitch i thought to myself..That night was just the beginning of my terrible ordeal..  I'm not gonna go too much into the details cos i dun't want a certain someone who is gonna read this to start hurting all over again..so..i'll just break it down for ya..  He had a fling with my cousin,dumped Jane,and when he realised i found out abt it,he spread rumours that i was having an affair with jane.My cousin on the other hand,assured me that she wasn't interested in him..but i found out she was still meeting him..even right up to his place..When i tried to put an end to it,my whole life came crashing down..Hemant and my cousin found no guilt whatsoever and decided to turn the tables on me..They began putting me in a badlight,hemant even told my cousin horrible things abt me which were complete blasphemous lies which my cousin in turn told her family and mine..u want an example?here's one..I made a filipino maid pregnant!! Can u believe that??My own best friend and my cousin.. Hemant even tried to drive a wedge between me and Jane and even my family..that sorry son of a bitch..i thought..  In the end,when my cousin returned to australia,both our families became like bitter enemies..her family blamed me for bringing her out with hemant..well,if she had sex with him,are they gonna blame me by sayin i taught her how to do it???? hemant on the other hand,avoided me like the "plague",refused to answer my calls..not surprising though,his conscience must have been eating him up..BASTARD!!!  In the end,by the time i started up this blog a day ago,reality stood at this.. I'm still the bad guy in my cousin's family's eyes.my cousin has shown no remorse for all the mess she created as she never once apologised..Hemant has converted to islam and is married.. Jane and i are buddies,as we have always been..Our lives will go on.. Though i would say,the one person who suffered the most anguish and pain,was none other than Jane..The poor gal lost her bf of five years whom she loved with her life and made so many sacrifices for..he was just an asshole..he didn't deserve her..as she deserves the best..Reality will be hard for some time for her,but i know she will pull through and emerge stronger and smarter..hey..She's my sister man..wat do u think..? The lesson i learnt from this whole episode of my life is that,I simply refuse to place my trust in anyone...anymore...but to those who alrdy had it..and never broke it,u will still have it.. Peace..time for me to fly...

      Well..as you would have known..I've gone and done it..and frankly speaking,my bloody mind's a blank..This is terrible,I thought it was bad when i had trouble trying to write music,this is even worse mate..damn..  I realise I haven't really written a proper introduction for my blog..but hey..who cares right..I'm just doing this to relieve my damn frustrations and voice out my 2-cents worth take on life and its stupid backward thinking..  Firstly..to all the gals i have been in relationships with..i thank u for the memories..and for the moments..but i'm not sorry that it ended..I have a penchant for making one point clear..abt me in life..As nice as i may be,as bad i as may be..dats me..But,when the time comes,u fuck with me,and i begin to diss ya,adios amigos..there's no turning back..When I hate ya..that's it..there's no two ways..  Let me just say that,I do not enjoy hating..cos it takes the life out of me..but a couple of people unfortunately for them,they messed with the wrong guy..words are..but mere words..everyone may say nice things or bad things.. But if u judge me based on what others say,whether good or bad,it ain't gonna help ya..U wanna be my friend,just talk to me and get to know me..it's that easy..

      I was thinking to myself..for ten whole fucking years,I have lived one dream and that is to be a famous musician.Now,when the stepping stone has been carved out,I realised Im in for some devastating shit..namely,let's just say that i'm starting to feel really crappy about the music i make and there's nothing great about it..  On top of that,my gf and i broke up after one and a half years..Reasons..? I really do not know what to say except that we have hit the end of the road.She almost drove my sanity into the pits of doomsday..thankfully,I picked myself up and moved off.. It was hard..but for my sanity's sake,I had to. Well that's all for today folks..Time for the fool to get out,but before i go,here's a little saying i have always kept close to my heart.. "Yesterday's a foregone conclusion,Live tomorrow like your only illusion"

      Alrite..i'm not gonna beat around the fucking bush and crap on...  firstly,i'll just like to take this opportunity to tell my ex-gf,im sorry i dumped ur sorry ass..but sure as hell don't regret it..as for painting me out to be the bad one,well,im used to it..one&nbsp;mistake,i got hung for life..but for all the countless fuck-ups you threw on me,i had to accept it huh..oh well,that's what i get for being me..   as for that brother of urs,maran who insulted me and called me names back then and u never said a word,well,frankly,i don't owe him a living..so if u think whateva people tell you is right,live that way..cos for one and a half years that's how u lived...listening to other people..just fucking open ur eyes and see for urself how you destroyed our relationship...just because god blessed me&nbsp;with the true love of another woman soon after we broke up,don't use that as an excuse to feel cheated..cause the fact of the matter is,i broke up with you before i even got to know elaine..and just because now, elaine is the woman who showers me with endless love and stands by me in everything i do,don't feel bad about urself...GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!!   You cursed me and my band saying we would always be nothing but a fucking&nbsp;cover band..well..guess what,sorry to disappoint you...I told you from day one i knew you, that if i ever hated someone,i would never ever change that feeling...now,i hate you..and that would never change..cos i hate you for always making me&nbsp;take the blame for everything...even when ur bloody family made a false police report against me just because i was not ready for an engagement,you fucking betrayed ur own conscience and signed on it...i hated you for that and i always will..Everyone around you is probably cursing and swearing at me,i know..but you know something,i don't give a damn..cos i know for once,i didn't do anything wrong...i broke off with you cause we were going nowhere...and for all the shit i've had to endure the last one and a half years,god sent me an angel to take all of it away...  That's god's retribution to you...the problem i realised is,everyone around you thinks your this really innocent,kind-hearted,incapable of hurtin anyone kinda person...hmm...ridiculous...!!  i am the only fucker who knows who you really are and what ur capable of...but dunt worry,im not gonna run my mouth off like u always do..about me..   Anyway,to sum it up,let me just say that i've never been more happier than now...i hate everything around you...ur family disgusts me the most...as for that whiney,low-life scumbag bro of urs,tell him,if he doesnt like me,go deal with it......don't act like a little pussy-whipped  piece of crap...i will prove you wrong amitha..i will prove to you that there is a woman who can love me for who i am and not expect me to give up my beliefs...when u see that day,i suggest you go faraway,cos you wont be able to face me...  ...fuck...

      Suddenly,when i listen to my wasted reality,the actual reality has already sunk in...It has become a living  epitomy  of reality for me..When i wrote that song,it was based on a real life situation (which i cannot elaborate),that fucking took the life out of me..let's just say i was made to go down to&nbsp;the bottom of the pits...went through a certain event in life i swore never to ever go through..But in the end,i did...for months i was stuck in my own little world,all cornered up,hurt,confused,disillusioned,most of all...i hated myself and i wanted to die... One evening, i was strumming my guitar,when i somehow played a tune that got stuck in my head..it somehow just attracted me...awhile later,i was actually penning the lyrics...i just let the words flow from my heart....When i saw the end product,i realised what it all stood for...i had written my first song based on the face-off element of the truth...  When i sang it for the first time,my soul,my every feeling connected with the song...I knew that was it...I knew i had finally found a way to release myself.... So,when my band actually learnt the song,and elevated it to the status it has today,i know i had done one thing right... Only one person knows the significance behind that song,someday,maybe more people will know..and they can relate to it... For all that its worth,i'll put it down to just one line... I   am leaving that world behind and turning my back upon that wasted reality....   My Wasted Reality is basically my lullaby that puts me to sleep every night...only because it's real.....and i lived it....and it tells me how much i never want to feel that way again...

      As the days go by,I seem to be getting more exhausted..Work has been getting tougher everyday..You know,while most people my age are working in air-conditioned offices,smoking cigarrettes and drinking coffee...i fucking bust my spine doing manual labour work that most times make most people go insane...It's tough,most times,it really is...Worst still,i do the job meant for two people and paid for just one...at 35bucks a day,i was told it was ridiculous..i feel the same way too...but what can i do,while on the journey to fulfilling my dreams,this what i have to do...But you know something,all these trivial things matter not to me,because of one person..and that's my beloved wife,Elaine...  She carries me through all of the exhaustion and pain..better still,she makes me smile&nbsp; throughout that moment...She gives me strength everyday that i live...Whenever my body feels like giving way,just the thought of her, gives me renewed strength,perhaps thats why i can still endure the hardships of manual labour..She's the reason why i can load and unload 107 cartons of jam,50kilo sacks of sugar and being pushed around like some slave..because i feel her love,her strength and her prayers for me....everyday at work...Now tell me,if this isn't love that was meant to be,what else could it be?? To me,it is..and it always will....I'm sorry for all the screw ups i've achieved in the last 23 years..but now i know for sure,that screw ups will no longer be part of my life...why?? Because of my baby....and because of the very fact that im so close to acieving what most people would only be contented of dreaming about... I know down the road...and i say it with the notion of truth,that i would live to tell the story of one man,who dared to believe in himself and his dreams and the woman who stood by him and made everything possible...through her love,her devotion and her never-dying believe in him....  Like my brother,my drummer Ricky always said,we are gonna live the dream and fucking leave a trail....for other like-minded,balls of steel,humans to follow... And when that day sets in and gets cemented in the books of history,i know i would have died a contented man...right there in the arms of my beloved wife,Lane... You see...It's better to burn out than to fade away...I lived my life based on that notion of euphoric proportions.... :)

      Today..seems like a good day to fucking die!!!!When is this bloody madness gonna end??  Why..why...why...must this hell hole get worst every freaking day...???Till this very day,i cannot comprehend what the hell goes on in my&nbsp;mum's head?why does she still fight with my father??why??????????????????Each time they fight,this home becomes worst than a fucking cemetery!!Its like a silent warzone that creeps inside ur mind demolishing every little ounce of peace...I can't stand it anymore...sometimes i feel like im about to lose my sanity at the rate things go.I feel like this little kid who wants to smash up his favourite toy because he got sick of playing it...I felt this way when i was nine...now that im 23,i still feel this way...the gap has never been bridged..if anything,it has simply become worst...I fucking hate this feeling inside of me cause it fucking eats me up inside...it makes me sick...I love my father,the man i am today,is thanks to him and his mother,my beloved grandmother...without them,i might have turned out worst..perhaps be rotting behind bars...You know what my mum taught me???Absolutely nothing!!!i hate her...yet i love her...cos she bore me...but why does she make everyone's life a living hell???   In this day and age,at this point in time,we are supposed to be living like one happy family,but we are the direct opposite..there's hardly any smiles at home...my father returns home every night a tired man,but still making sure nothing runs short in this house.My mum scorns at me every fucking day of my life...Sometimes,i really..i mean..i really wish i could just cut my mother's head off and stick it in the backyard of a cemetery.....not because of the way she treats me...I can't stomach the fact how she treats my father after 26 years of marriage...She should be shot in the fucking head!!!She's talks about how much she has done for us...how much she loves us...yeah right MUm!!!!You fucking meditate every day,u attend all the holy functions,u seek the blessings of holy figures...u fucking preach about god's will of life and retribution....but you know what mum...it's all for nothing when you cant fucking treat ur husband and son the proper way!!!!!And whats worst,you fucking cursed me that i'll never come to a good end,just because i stood up to you and refused to be treated like dirt by you....why are u so full of these stupid,no-sense feelings???what have we done to u??other than stomach all ur shit....   For all the things she done and said,God will show her the right way...cause i believe that her preaching will reflect back on her...You know mum,i dun't ned anything from you...i never needed ur money,ur attention,or ur curses!!!  All i ever wanted from you was love and care...the kind where i could come home after a exhausting day at work and you would sit down with me and talk to me about it.Moments where i can confide in you my fears,my joy of being in love,my everyday life and what i got through..Sadly,you have never once given me that opportunity....All you ever do is to give me a scorned look when you open the door and treat me like im non-existant in the very home we live in...What i ever did wrong to deserve this,i will never know...perhaps,i must have wronged you in my last life....There are days when i sat and cried silently..and you would never have realised that you put tears in your son's eyes....and so much pain in his heart....I could deal with break-ups and physical pain...but not the pain you cause me every fucking day of my life...   Someday..soon...you will live to see me achieve my dreams..my beliefs...and you would then realise that i didnt waste my life and that i wasn't as useless as you made me out to be..And when that day comes,you will look me in my eyes and tell me how much you wronged me..That's the day,i will hold you and for the first time in my life,tell you how much i have always loved you..as much as i loved father...Out of the 3 sons,you would have realised that i was the only one who kept his family roots firmly in himself...Cause at the end of the day,I am the son who never left...i was always there...somehow...someway....  You can let my heart go,you can let me grow...but i'll be coming home...someday....  Till then,would you wait for me forever???

      Hmm...finally..  It's been 4 days now...Really relieved..Demo was finally recorded and completed.Couldn't believe how far we had come already...It was a really tiring night,recording from 9.30pm right till 10am the next day..But i was determined to see it through fully..I felt sad cos elaine couldnt be there..but the very fact that she came with me all the way to the studio just to send me there and then head home was something i could only have dreamt of..She made me really motivated to do my best...   It was one hell of a night..most of us were pretty exhausted..i was thinking,one song was so exhausting,wat about an entire album..???Beats me...  And do my best i did..i completed my vocals in one take..and i made sure to be super angry-sounding in case mickey and ricky decided to punch me..lol...felt sorry for mickey though cos the guy was really pressurised when it came to figuring out his solo...but i kept telling him to play from the heart and do what he did best..i kept my faith with him...and he didn't disappoint...The man did what he did best......   The whole night,i was constantly thinking about my baby..who was sound asleep at home..  She is just absolutely the best thing to happen to me..She's just so damn what i always envisioned in a woman...No amount of words i say will ever do any justice to this precious angel of mine...She's simply one of a kind who makes me feel so fine.....hell yeah she does...   So,at 10.30am,i held my demo single in my hands..as i walked out of the SAE Studios...Ten years,and my dream was finally culminating before my very eyes...I had reached my stepping stone in life...I was mixed with emotions...The first thing i did was to call my baby at 7am...telling her how things were...Ijust really wished she was there with me,cos i wanted to share that joy with her...Things are finally going my way after all these years and she is the only person who knows exactly how i feel...can u believe that??And i have only been with her for 23 days..yet she knows me inside like for 23 years...  She's simply what most men could only dream of......   The part that made me really head up to the heavens was when she looked me in the eyes,held me,and told me how proud she was of me...i was like..woh...she is the one!!!  I thank god for her....She's really my pillar of strength and hope...She keeps me going...That's my Sweet Elaine....oh hell yeah...!!

      Sat night...  The most exhilirating night i tell ya...I went to novena church and actually sat for two services..Being there with my baby was something i had envisioned like since forever..!!!  It felt so fucking uplifting..I mean,can u imagine..staying for two services back to back..  Before the start of the second service,i knelt down and said a long and deep prayer..Just asked for guidance through every step i was about to take in life from then onwards..Things were finally looking up for me now that the dark gloomy clouds of my past was being dispersed...single-handedly by my baby..  &nbsp;  In the evening,we had dinner at kenny rogers..it was pretty romantic with the bright light shining at my bald head making me look like some devil having roasted chicken...hahaha  The best part of the night....????  When i was walking her home...we were singing duets together...practically all our favourite songs...It was so bloody fun...we were laughing,singing,making ourselves look like some weird bunch of kids...We were lost in a world of our own...and i think we will always be...  At least,that's how my baby makes me feel...She's an absolute precious gem...  Leaving her at the end of the night is something that eats me up inside every damn time..  I can't seem to be away from her even a second...For those of u who wanna contradict me by saying its only now that i feel this way,in time to come it would be the direct opposite???  well..to that,i can only say,You're so fucking wrong..She's the woman in my life..and she's the one i am gonna walk down the aisle with...change that if u can,but no one could ever tear us apart...and i mean no one...!!!!  &nbsp;  I will always love you my sweet elaine...My song for you is a living testimonial of my devotion,love and belief in u...Nothing will ever change..not even after I'm gone from this world..  &nbsp;

      It's been a whole fucking week since i found the opportunity to update my blog..All apologies for that..Lets just say that the whole week was a busy one with all the stuff coming up with the gig and work..Work's a killer on some days when u have to do a hundred and one things..But thinking about my woman,always helps..She eases the tiredness and takes away the pain.  &nbsp;For the last 12 days since we went together,we have been meeting up every single day after work..I'm pretty surprised we actually lose all that tiredness when we see each other..Talk about the power of love..I can describe to u in mere words what my baby makes me feel every day on this earth..She came into my life and erased my dark past with her love.Could I ask for more??Hell no i dunt think so..  &nbsp;  Tuesday night...  The most&nbsp; or i would say one the many eventful nights in my life...  &nbsp;  Wednesday Night...  Love is all around...Smell it all round....Feel it everywhere...  &nbsp;  Thurday night...  *heart couldnt stop beating*  &nbsp;  Friday Night  Spent time with her and ricky and mickey..chilled out the esplanade and then went over to burger king for dinner at peninsula..We were gonna head down to chijmes but my baby couldnt make it..*sigh*...i felt screwed up..cos i was a dimwit for not not informing her earlier...  But before she left,she gave a little something to remind me that she's always with me no matter where i went..She left her lip imprint on a piece of tissue with some loving words..wala!!  And when i was at the club,i looked at it...and it made my heart melt..Got back home to her at 2am..talked to her till abt 3.30am..i drifted off to dreamworld for two hours and i was off to work...  &nbsp;  Sat Night..  worked for half a day and met my baby...She was late cos she overslept till 12pm..hahahahaha...despite me waking her up twice..  Supposed to finish up the recording of our demo...but got a nasty shock when we reached there..  Some *anal,lame-assed,fudge-packing,snooty-cocksure,satan-worshipping motherfucking pisshead* had actually deleted our track from the system...I swore in the name of my love i would have destroyed the studio...i was so close to total carnage when i heard the news...our hardwork had just been erased by some piece of worthless crap...I would kill that piece of shit if i ever knew who he was...  Thankfully my baby was there to hold me and keep me calm..thank the lord for her...  She felt pissed too...hahaha..but for other reasons..hehehe...only i know..  Anyway,now we got to do the entire thing from monday night at 9.30pm till 10am the next morning..And my baby can't be there...damn...oh well..she'll be there...in spirit...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Wednesday  I reached a whole new phase in my life..with my baby... Whateva took place,the things we talked about,wateva i confessed about my past,wateva she confessed...God,I felt released...It's like i won the battle with my inner demons..I destroyed em.. Her eyes became an open book.I felt her pain,I wanted to tear..but i couldnt..I had to be strong..I wanted to be strong.. I wanted  to steal her pain away...She just cemented her soul in my heart..She's in my heart..and she'll always be..  That day,when we held each other's hands and poured  out our deepest darkest secrets..I knew I had found the one..As u can see,im having trouble finding words to describe the day...but i think i'll leave em out..In case ur wondering why i bothered even writing,well..let's just say that,im the happiest fuckin piece of crap in the world... She's all i need...damn..

      Tuesday morning..i was never more excited to go to work..Y? My angel from the heavens above was gonna descend on home soil in a few hours time..Throught the day at work,Darren was disturbing me and telling me how he knew what was gonna happen in the night when i met her..lol..that bro..always predicting stuff..just like the Oracle..hahaha  When the clock struck 5pm,i got out of work and headed for home immediately..I was so fucking excited to be seeing her again after 6 days..In the bus,I couldn't keep still..kept looking at my hp again..and..again...ring!!!! it was her..she called from the airport..she had landed..I was like,holy shit!! All that waiting was worth it..We were so excited..couldntwait to meet..When i got home,i quickly ironed my clothes,shaved my freaking head,polished my boots...and ring!!!ring!!! It was her..She was home alrdy..we were just talking and talking..and talking..it was alrdy 7pm and i was supposed to meet her at 8pm..lol... yeah..men..punctuality is never one of their better virtues... but there's where i differ..after bathing and changing,i left home at 7.30pm..took a cab and reached the place at 7.45pm..lol...i was early!! It was fine with me..so i called her up,and she was like..why the hell u reached so early??and i said that it was becos i didnt wanna be late..so i waited at the exact same spot when we first met..at 8.15..there she walked..towards me..like an angel descending upon a prairie...My heart stopped and i swear i could have jumpe in joy..I hugged her when she came...It felt so good to hold her in my arms...And god was she beautiful..She was dressed so gorgeously..My heart melted when i looked at her smile..  Off we took the train to the esplanade..We got off at city hall,she wanted to show me a restaurant she used to be attached at as a pastry chef..We walked..walked..walked...i saw the place..i could see the joy in her eyes as she spoke of her experience..At the traffic light,i held her..as we walked,i held her..`Each and every step,I couldn't take my hands away from hers..  All the way,while walking hoding each other,we talked and talked about numerous things..There was never a moment of silence between us,if there was,it was a meaningful one.. She moved me with the things she told me..I felt her grip on my heart..She had it..It was hers.. We sat at a bench...facing the entire esplanade view..When we sat,iknew it was time for me to confess my felings for her which i had been dying to tell..  That moment,as i looked her in her eyes and poured my heart out,and i saw the look in her eyes...I knew i was no longer dreaming..As the words,I love You escaped my lips,my heart jumped...She just looked me in the eyes and smiled..And i knew,she felt the same..  Wat happened after that???Not for u pricks to know..some things are better left for the imagination... After a while,we headed down to Harry's and had a drink..And talked more..it was such a wondeful night out..i couldnt believe it..When the time came for us to head home,it was a bummer..but we knew,it was just the start of so many more better things to come..I sent her home..right up to her house..well,the lift landing of the fourth floor that is...and i left..  Downstairs while walking away,my hp rang..it was her..But the line got cut..i was like..errr..??? I turned around and i saw her running towards me..I was like..damn...I had forgotten to take the bag of gifts which she had bought for me from bali...Did i tell u she bought me an awesome looking guitar????with a hardcover case???yeah..think EL MARIACHI.. hehehehe...it was a miniature one..which im so fucking in love with..and she also gave me another gift..a little blue band of beads..it's supposed to be beads of faith..keeping the faith in each other...I held her again..couldnt let her go..I was lost in her smile..in her eyes...*&^%$%$#$^&*())*&$$##@)&**$#@.....and next thing i know,i was in the cab on my way home..A magical night...It was my stairway to heaven...

      aloha my friends... mondays!!..always a screwed up day for most living things..lol.. But for me,it was great..i was tired,but i was enthusiastic abt the day..cos she was there msging me and lifting my spirits.. The best part of it all,after 5 days,i finally got the chance to hear her voice..boy,did my heart melt..I couldnt comprehend why i missed her so much...I mean,she was only gone for 6 days,but it felt like eternity..call me crazy,or insane or dumb,it dunt matter...I rather be insane,crazy and dumb if it means my feelings are true..  My hp bill is gonna be a killer this month and so will her's...but im telling u sweetheart,it was worth every cent..to me,ur priceless...Lord,never in 23 years have i fallen so deep for anyone..why is it happening now?is this a sign from the Almighty?? heck,i ain't giving up neither am i complaining... For those of you wondering what's the fuss all about me falling in love..well,if u have been around me since i was 11,u would understand how i feel...but none of u have been my friend for that long right..??so,thats my point..u dunt know me,so dunt judge me...I'm a man who stands on his own.Now that my first dream has come true,it's time to turn the other dream into reality...I'm a man who has always believed in his dreams.. My band is taking off...now,time for the woman of my dreams to be mine...Could i ask for anything better?? hmm..yeah..a few kids...and everything's complete.. peace out ppl...life's too short to ignore the little things we take for granted each day...if there's someone that u love,cherish and treasure that person...dunt be an ass and think life is all good as long as u get laid..there's more to a woman than just sex...go figure...I love my woman,i would treasure my woman and i would do anything for my woman...why??? Cos The Almighty made her for me...and simply cos she's the only one in the world willing to accept my shortcomings and flaws and still love me all the same..I would do the same for her.. ........................\m/...........................

      Greetings people..I apologise for not having been able to update my blog the last 3 days..Just started work and was really busy... Besides that,the band's debut show has been set for 8th August,Sunday..so much work to be done..gosh,its gettin really tiring.. But a certain someone has been giving me strength and lifting my spirits..She has been wiping away my tiredness with her endless loving msgs..She inspires me to fulfil my dream with so much support and belief in me..What would i do without her?? I really do not know..She makes me smile,she gives me hope,she makes me stand tall..She reads my mind like an open book..She's a mystery to many-a-man,but to me,she loves me..and i know that.  Now,i feel that my whole life has finally evolved after all these years of endless heartache,pain and misery..I have been in and out of relationships,but my last one took the sting out of me..i couldn't deal with it anymore..I decided to draw the line..u may think of me in wateva way u deem fit,it doesnt matter..all i know is that i have found the will to move on and do something with my life..  But i never thought she would come into my life so fast and pull me out of my insanity.I thought i was doomed to suffer for a long time..but she came along and changed all that..Is it a rebound feeling?? HELL NO!!!I feel alive..do u know what i mean..DO U KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IT MEANS TO FINALLY FEEL ALIVE???  I do...cos she came into my life and swept my thoughts along with her...She has been in every corner of my mind and heart..She's my best friend,my soulmate,my wings,my hope...and she takes me higher..and higher..each day...  Am I in love with her??the answer lies in my heart..and in hers.. would i finally live to see another dream come true?? I lived my dream to be a rockstar for 10 years..i lived my dream to be swept off my feet by an angel for 11 years..and they r both culminating now,right before my eyes... I couldnt ask for more... To the woman in my heart..I have waited 11 years for you,wat was 6 days??

      to be incredibly honest...i'm fucking pissed off and incredibly devastated!!! After screwing my head inside,out to figure out how it was possible to hold a debriefing with the band to iron out certain conflicts and issues ,i did what i had to do..and many thanks to Ricky too,for if not for him,i couldn't have done it on my own..We put in so much thought and effort and consideration into ensuring that the debriefing would be done in a rational and matured way...And seriously,so many times i kept asking if anybody had any other grievances to air..i said fucking say it out!!!!what was the point of the debrief then??? And after going through everything and discussing about the workplan for the rest of this year and next year,and what our direction would be,and everything agreed upon amicably by the 5 guys..we all breathe a huge sigh of relief and head home..i for one honestly believed the conflicts were over at least for now...I mean,come on,lets be more matured and not let personal issues get in the way....  I told someone from long way back,that this band would someday disband if anyone dragged their personal problems into this band!!!that's a  BIG FIRST COMMANDMENT  that you do not break..  But last night,i get a call from Ricky,my drummer telling me that Mickey the lead guitarist sent out a mass e-mail announcing his departure from the band...seriously,it knocked the wind out of me....i mean,what just happened at the debriefing then???what the fuck was it for??? I feel so fucking cheated man....why are we letting our personal problems get in the way of our proffesional thinking??and why do we keep thinking of our own interests now???where was all of this when we first joined the band???? WHERE'S THE RESPONSIBILITY???? We came together,sacrificing our own interests in music to concentrate on one single direction... now mickey,what were you thinking man??? honestly in the name of christ,what went tru ur head?????why do u screw us this way..just two weeks away from the recording???what do u mean by ur not inspired anymore???what do u mean by u have no more heart in this band???  honestly..i loved you man..like a friend,like a buddy..but right now,my heart doesn't understand why u chose to exit despite ur countless reasons..i still see no light!!!!!! perhaps someday i might..or i might not still... whateva the real reason may someday surface,by then,i think i will fucking not be bothered... Dropping us like this at this juncture,was a terrible thing man...but i'll try to live with it... I'll try to live it...

       As one would have thought,the hangover from sunday night,still hasn't left my brains yet.i'm still reliving the euphoria inside my head over and over again..Oh well,it happens..you can't blame me.. All though,i must say that recent events have pretty much started to take its toll on my mind where the band is concerned.Frankly,i did not step on that stage that night,in front of over a 100 people telling them how i waited 1o years to reach there...i can't drop everything and start all over again for another 10 years.   You see,when i realised that this is what i lived for,everyone around me scoffed..either that,or they just told me straight to my face that i would never make it. Those who did tell me that i may try it out,also told me to at least get a degree so that there was something i could fall back on if my music didn't work out...like duh!!!  Now,call me insane,or stupid or even moronic...i chose not to follow their advice...why??? It's simple,i'm fully focused on making my music dreams a reality and in other words,a success!! I refuse to leave a back road for me to detour should i come to a dead end...There's only one road for me to take and that's ahead...ALL THE WAY!!! and i found that funny,cause when i attended a ADAM KHOO seminar,he preached the exact same thing...How true was that..no wonder Ricky told me that i didn't have to attend his seminar afterall..lol..  But the reality is such for me,i have to and i want to make this reality a success...I want my music to reach millions around the world and hear of how they could connect with it and tell me they felt what i felt when i wrote it..like i said,every song that i write,is based on the face-off element of the truth..Nothing's a lie..every song is based on the life,the moments,the experiences,the ironic truths...You see,to me,   the toughest struggle in life,is growing up and finding your identity  ..Someday,i know i will be able to tell the world,what it was like to come from a tiny dot on the world map,and shock the daylights out of even America...sounds like stupidity???Hell no ... sometimes,you just got to believe that stranger on the street who told you,you're destined to be someone....!!!!!       I'm sick and honestly bored of the typical life we lead here and some people...Honestly,there's more to life in this country than just the latest fashion,or latest food or hell..even the latest club..fuck all of that man..there's so much more to do and see out there...There are a hundread and one bands constantly being suppressed by your fucking corporate dickheads who think they know everything about the music inductry...you think i give two fucking hoots about stephanie sun or whateva other local singers you have who can't fucking write their own songs...fuck that!! You think Geffen Records went round searching for solo artists???They fucking picked up Guns N Roses and Nirvana because they fucking bothered to listen to what they had to offer..  I say,stop hopping onto the fucking "easy fame" bandwagon..and start coming out of the closet... I know for a bloody fact,that WALPURGIS is gonna be thye band that paved the way for a evolution in the music industry in Singapore..Anyone who tells me after today,i'm just full of crap and that i'm just all words..my friend,  PLEASE..AND I MEAN PLEASE... ASK ME FOR MY DEMO..COS THAT WILL SHUT YOUR FUCKING TRAP UP FOR LIFE!!!!!!!   Before i end this pretty honest and frustrating post,i'll leave you with a twisted sense of reality that has helped me through the years... yours truly Scar.D    "Did you know that beautiful music   that came to our senses fast?   Somehow realise that it wouldn't last.   Would you be rotting six feet underground   In some decadent Singapore town   If only you chose to live    that music far abound...."

        WELCOME HOME WALHEADS ....    METAL MILITIA REIGNED SUPREME..         The 5 guys who swore that Heavy metal and Rock music was alive and kicking,proved that just that very statement alone was an act of faith..Personally,August 8th 2004,is a day in my life,i would never forget,not even till i'm dead.For...10 years of patiently waiting and biding my time,finally came to an end as WALPURGIS took to the stage in Zombie Rock Bar.From the start,i was pretty overawed by the crowd presence..but i tried my level best to keep up the show..All those people who came up to headbang in the first set almost towards the end,thank you!!!!You kept the hype going...to antonio..thank you too...you were simply awesome..   For those of you who came to lent your support even though you're not metal music listeners..thank you too...Darren and Grace..you guys were magical...you got the feeling alive and roaring..      Second set began and ended with a bang!!!! people...where have all you people been all these years...Watching you guys come to the front of the stage,song after song,headbanging away wildly and demanding more...was something i told myself would be what made this debut show a roaring success....and it happened..i knew some of you guys..but not everyone...to all the others,i hope you will never stop believing that dreams do come true...To be honest,when i put my leg up on the amplifiers and looked out into the crowd singing,i felt a release...a release from the hell i was in for many years..musically...and when i looked out there and saw how the people connected with the band,it brought a smile to my face and many a times i thanked the lord on stage..      Honestly..i felt like a rockstar that night..and that's one of the greatest feelings in the world...   i want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow walheads for being simply superb..You guys like i said are the finest musicans i have ever played alongside...mickey,you were a legend of your own that night..ricky and marcus,need i say anything about you guys???you fuckers carried the music,you guys were the heart and soul of the music..   Now,let's see where we head on from here...      Lastly,but not the least,i want to thank the woman who carried me up when i fell down,the woman who constantly assured me i was born to do this..and the woman,who never once left me alone to fight my battles...my wife,Elaine.   Watching her sit there, right in front of the stage,her eyes glowing with so much love and joy,her legs beating to the music,her smiles to calm me....that was something most guys could only dream off...and finally,to walk off stage after everything and right into her arms,was like walking down the aisles of heaven with her...it felt magical to walk straight into her arms,it felt like home..it felt secure..so much love,so much peace...   She's the reason why i put on a hell of a show for i didn't want any of her friends telling her that her boyfriend wan't that great after all...After that night,those words could never leave their lips..And to my wife's sista,Maria,who made some of my frend's heads fall off,thank you for being there too..it meant a lot..i knew how much it meant to my baby to have you there with her..my wife really loves you maria..you mean the world to her..so once,again,thank you for being there...      Finally...i realise this whole post has been about saying thank you's..haha..   well,i'm not gonna say much about that night,but this is what i would say...If you thought local bands sucked...well..bite me...cos we tore the house down sunday night..i just so fucking wished MEDIACORP,THE STRAIGHT'S TIME,THE NEWPAPER,FHM,8DAYS,98.7FM AND ALL THE CORPORATE ASSHOLES WERE THERE....THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEIR COVER STORY OF THE YEAR...!!!   am i being too proud???HELL NO!!!!Cause i now   know just what we are made off....   WE ARE ROCKSTAR MATERIAL....      lastly...baby,i love you...that last dance at the end of the night to the song "Carrie" was absolutely the bestest way to end the night..thank you sweetheart...i'm forever yours..faithfully...   your rockstar,   Scar.D

       Hello me...meet the real me.   And my misfits way of life   .A dark black past is   my   Most valued possession.   Hindsight is always 20-20,   But looking back it’s still a bit fuzzy.   Speak of mutually assured destruction?    Nice story...tell it to reader’s digest!!!      Feeling paranoid   True enemy or false friend?    Anxiety’s attacking me, and   My air is getting thin.   I’m in trouble for the things   I haven’t got to yet.   I’m chomping at the bit, and my   Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets.      Hello me...it’s me again.   You can subdue, but never tame me.   It gives me a migraine headache   T  hinking down to your level.   Yea, just keep on thinking it’s my fault   And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance.   Mankind has got to know   His limitations.      Feeling claustrophobic,   Like the walls are closing in.   Blood stains on my hands    andI don’t know where I’ve been.   I’m in trouble for the thingsI haven’t got to yet.   I’m sharpening the axe and my   Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets.      Well, me...it’s nice talking to myself,   A credit to dementia.   Some day you too will know my pain,   And smile it’s blacktooth grin.   If the war inside my head   Won’t take a day off    I’ll be dead.   My icy fingers claw your back,Here I come again.

       Don’t remember where I was I realized life was a game The more seriously I took things The harder the rules became I had no idea what it’d cost My life passed before my eyes I found out how little I accomplished All my plans denied  So as you read this know my friends I’d love to stay with you all Please smile when you think of me My body’s gone that’s all  A tout le monde A tout les amis Je vous aime Je dois partir There are the last words I’ll ever speak And they’ll set me free  If my heart was still aliveI know it would surely break And my memories left with you There’s nothing more to say Moving on is a simple thing What it leaves behind is hard You know the sleeping feel no more pain And the living are scarred

       This has been one sick day for me.Couldn't believe the damn flu and cough bug would hit me now of all times..thank god it's only tuesday..at least i got a few more days to recover..heard mickey sprained his leg..damn,everything and anything that could possibly go wrong would go wrong..   oh well...      Monday night..it was a rude awakening for me..Finally,i saw the true light that was evading me all these years.For what it was worth,let's just say,some people are never really who they proclaim themselves to be..Who am i talking about?     ...  MY DAD..      From the time he got home,all he did was to bitch at me..Not that i wasn't used to it.I always knew he would bitch at me whenever he was upset about something..But last night,it was different..and i felt it.I realised something wasn't right...something didn't click..   I was right...it was all different now and you know why..it was simple..he and MY MUM were back on good terms...!!..Fuck!!!   Here's ten things my father looked me in my face and told me with a voice that i thought never existed,for it broke my heart to listen.....and no,he can never mend it... ever....!!!      1) I am an IRRESPONSIBLE GUY...      2) I am a GONER FOR LIFE...      3)All i do is FOOL AROUND with females...      4)I change females like i CHANGE my shirts....(how in the world my own father could say that to me when it wasn't true.is anybody's guess)      5)I'm a PATHETIC HUMAN BEING..for being 23 and working as a manual labourer..      6)I would NEVER GET ANYWHERE IN LIFE....at the rate i live my life...      7)I'm the most USELESS SON AMONG THE THREE HE HAS.....      8)I've NO AMBITION IN LIFE..(to compliment that statement...he then said..      9)don't talk to him about my music cause it was utter rubbish and that i was just wasting my time...(this coming from the man,who 3 weeks ago,told me that if music was what i chose,go do it right if i believed in it...today,he changes his tune....)      10)lastly but not least,like a little end insult,he looks at me and tell me with disgust in his voice that I RUINED HIS SLEEP FOR THE NIGHT...)      What do i say...i walked into my room totally lost and hurt by his words..as if to add more insult to injury,my "wonderful" mum remarks to my dad,   "go,everytime give him money when he has no money.now you regret right.he's a goner,let him learn the hard way out..That bloddy idiot thinks we owe him a living"....      Those words created a hurt so deep last night,that,for the rest of my life,i will never ever..ever again look to them for anything in life..I always thought a mother and a father were the only two people who would always lift you higher no matter how low u fell,and be the ones who would always open the doors of their hearts to you every second...   Last night,they closed their doors...and it hit me hard,knowing things will never be the same again..why?cause my dad,would never go against my mum...whenever my mum fought with him,he would confide in me and look to me for some release.but now that he's back on good terms with her,i have become the black sheep for him..the best part?i haven't even done anything wrong...To avoid another conflict with her,he decides being on her side is the best...and so,i'm made to suffer the harsh reality...      Well,it doesn't matter anymore...for i have washed my hands off this whole saga once and for all...As of today,as of sunday,my life will change,for the better or worse,i dunno...but i know one thing is for sure,and that is my wife,Elaine..Last night,had it not been for her,i would have broken down and cried..i so wanted to cry my fuckin heart out..but i asked myself,is this how i want the woman who loves me,to see me???   But contrary to what i felt,all that changed..When i heard her voice,when i felt the concern and the love,i knew that i wasn't alone..i would never be alone again..ever.   If there was one person in this world who would never walk away from me or leave me,it was her.She's to me what Sharon is to Ozzy..what the words are to the poet,what the rain is to the roses and what humanity is to the fallen man....      Perhaps,it's safe now to say that,through all these years i have been deluding myself,i'm finally aware...I'm finally aware that this road i'm trudging on,is my very own justification of how my life would turn out eventually..Either,that long winding road leads to peace and happiness,or,simply straight into the abyss of hell....   Where will i end up..that all depends on Sunday night,when i take to the stage for the first time in ten years...Will i screw up..or will i leave a mark so deep and lasting,that someone stands up and remembers...???   For what it's worth,i know i'll give it my all for i believe in myself hard enough...and i want it bad enough...and as an added bonus,i can hold close to my heart the very fact that my wife would be there sitting in the crowd,telling me with every look in her eyes,how proud she is of the man i've become...and i would look at her and tell her with my eyes,that she's the bearer to my heart...      ....."I Tried Hard To Have A Father,But Instead I Had A Dad"........      You can choose not to believe in me anymore like your precious wife,but someday dad,you will live to regret the day you shut the doors on your son..You were suppose to lift him up and support his every dream,not your dreams for him....I hate you dad...and i always will...cos you and your wife have no right to judge me for what i am not!!!!!!   Now that you have decided you have turned the last page of this book,that's where i show you that i will keep going...on..and..on...till i complete that book...!!   You know why dad???   ...............................CAUSE I FUCKING BELIEVE IN MYSELF......................................

      7 days more...to the big over-hyped moment of truth in my life... How in the name of Christ it's gonna be,i have no clue...i am scared..not scared of screwing up..rather,scared of where we are gonna head from here.10 years,i've been patiently striving to play live..with an awesome band..10 years down now,i am in an awesome band,making awesome music..an awesome line-up...and fucking hell of an awesome opportunity to play a debut show in Singapore's biggest rock club,Zombie Rock Bar...God bless us...PLEASE!!!  FUCK HARD ROCK CAFE..PUSSY-WHIPPED CORPORATE ASSHOLES....!!!  I would never ever play in hard rock cafe,a fucking sick place it is now..and you always have your dumb,know jackshit coporate dicks with ties to thank for that...hip-hop,RnB music in a place you call Hard Rock...The founder of that place must have turned in his grave... I have nothing against hip hop or RnB music..just wrong place,wrong music...Imagine walking into a hip-hop club blasting heavy metal music...turn off right..oh well..that's singapore for you... It's all about making money..money..fucking money..... whateva the fuck happened to passion for music...beliefs..???? I hate this way of life...it's so sick...ok..why the fuck am i bothered???? oh hell...when it's time for me to retire,i'll show these monkeys how to run a rock club...  For now,i can only pray that everything goes smoothly till our show...Believe me when i tell you,it was a hard,long road for us ever since that very night we got the go-ahead to perform... so many things happened,so many problems,so much distress...it was terrible..but we are in no way cracking...we have held on this far..and we'll hold on to the end... To my walheads...you guys are never gonna give up on this dream that has now turned into a reality...Leave the rockstar thinking aside,live the reality we are in now...we are musicians,musicians with a cause...Let's bear fruit to that first..popularity and fame,it's just an added bonus....i believe we will make it by keeping our heads and feets firm on the ground.. So guys,keep believing...let's make it as five guys...five musicians...one band....!!

      Sunday,12.07pm. Where do i begin in order to find in me to describe the week i've had..? Lets just fast forward to thursday..first time i couldn't meet my baby in all the time i've been with her..It felt so fucking weird...damn..staying apart was harder than i imagined.. Work was fucked up every damn day..so much crap..so little pay..sometimes i wonder,why is my luck so horrifying???oh well..that is why i remind myself constantly everyday of my existence,that this band,Walpurgis,has to take off...we have to make it..I don't a choice..It may have been my dream since i was 13 to be a successful musician,but in reality,i have to live that dream...and i know i will.  Even though the days seem so faraway,the struggle is getting harder.The tons of people trying to change my conceptions,my beliefs,and the very notion of failure looming all around me,it's just really pissing me off..Why can't people just leave me to do my thing..Why do they constantly try ways and means to instill fear and doubts in you..?? But i choose to believe that in life,there's nothing to fear but fear itself..I know we are gonna make it cause we are not gonna sit around and wait for it to happen...WE ARE GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN...there's no two ways about it...  Friday night,we met up at mickey's home to finalise the song structure for "Living The Dream".. I have no comments on that...  Sat.. it was a whole day at work..tiring as usual..but it was worth it cause i met up with my baby at 5.30pm..we attended novena at 6.30..as per the last two times,it was uplifting as usual.. i'm always at peace with myself there..when reading the passages and singing the hymms,we are always holding each other's hands..and i always start off novena with a deep and heartfelt prayer..asking for the same thing over and over again..not money,not success,not a good life,nor peace...just guidance for every step here on,since my baby came into my life.. And yesterday,after service ended,my baby actually knelt down and prayed for the first time..I was like..woah...finally..watching her kneel down,hands clasped together,she looked like an angel kneeling down before GOD...it was a beautiful sight i tell ya..  After that,we headed down to town and had pasta for dinner..yeah,it was payday..but it felt more like a fucked day...from 297dollars,i only got a 188dollars...why?they minused 109dollars for CPF..gut-wrenching..but hey..wat the hell....it's for the future... After dinner,i had a life-altering moment...A single moment where all the little remainding scraps of black clouds were demolished...forever... We headed down to Zombie Rock Bar as i had to talk to Suresh regarding some issues about the debut show next week..after that,my baby and i,we just sat down watching the resident band play and had a few drinks..To my surprise,mickey,Satan and Grace came..so they joined us..mickey called me out for awhile as he needed to talk to me..so stood outside for awhile talking..next thing i know...my past crept pass me in a flash... There she was,walking some 3 meters away with her friend..she looked at me as she walked past,i looked at her and just fucking turned my head away..while mickey was obvlivious to who just walked by,i continued listening to him although at that point in time,my thoughts were with my baby who was alone inside the club..i so wanted to run back in but i had to restrain myself as mickey was pouring his soul out to me..As soon as we walked in after 10mins,i saw the look in my baby's eyes...i knew then that she knew...and held her hands out to me as i neared her.. It felt so good to hold her...WHILE MY EX-GF SAT A FEW TABLES AWAY BEHIND!!!!BITCH!! when i returned to my baby's table,not once did i even bother turning back to look at that sorry excuse for a human being...yeah..yeah..i know i'm supposed to be all gentlemanly and nice..but you know what,fuck it..someone like her doesn't deserve that.Why??Get into a relationship with her and you would know why.... For the next hour or so,i had to hold my baby and reassure her that nothing was gonna change...she was visibly upset,but thank the heavens for her best friend Maria,who messaged her on her hp..you wanna know what she said? Maria told my baby the words that was on the tip of my lips..Maria understood what my baby meant to me and how i would never chance that for anything in the world.. For that Maria,if you ever happen to read this blog,GRACIAS SENORITA...i am truly grateful to you..  The night ended soon after..and we were home..physically apart,but spiritually and emotionally together..We talked on the phone for quite some time,before we drifted off to dreamland..together...As i watched the week come to an end,i knew i had my last Life-altering moment...I was finally at peace with myself..why? cause my baby finally saw my past...and with that,i erased it for good. Now,that past,is just another foregone conclusion...and that's how it would remain..
