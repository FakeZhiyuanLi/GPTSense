      You know sometimes when you think about life is one of the special things and craziest. It can be good, bad, and sometimes even interesting. Life for me has been so much....that it is kinda hard to explain. Lets see to start it off, my life has been very interesting. Met people that I thought that I would have never know again. During the summer school, I met one of my friends from junior high that I thought I would never meet again ever. We were good friends during&nbsp; junior high, but once&nbsp;I left my first&nbsp;junior&nbsp;high school....I have totally forgot&nbsp;about her....what a good friend&nbsp;I was. Although we went our separate paths,&nbsp;I never knew that she has still&nbsp;remember me since junior high...I thought&nbsp;I have change...guess not. Now I think that we have become better friends, and it has kinda got me thinking.....is God doing this on purpose for something? I got to realize that mayb God is doing something for me, but I don't know what....who knows. Well I made a very close friend now and I also figure what life is about....well through&nbsp;my eyes. I think that life is not about how many girlfriends that you have or how much possesions you have. I believe that life is about having a relationship with God, and for those who are not really religious....just to have fun. Living life to is fullest (in a safe and healty way) is perfect expression that alot of people should follow. God put us on this earth not to suffer and to feel pain. It is our brains that makes us feel unsafe and unsercure, not our heart. Sometimes it is also worrying about what people think....who is the right person for me...or whatever brings us down and unhappy. God doesn't want us to feel that way.&nbsp; He wants us to be happy with our lives and not worry about any of the small details. What you think is good and perfect is the right attidue to have, then you would feel good about urself because it is you who is doing it not somebody else, but be sure it is nothing unhealty or unsafe. Some of the gifts that God have gave us is what we should use to help us out to make our lifes more interesting. For example one of God's gift to me is martial arts...i love doing it soo much. Doing this gift makes me happy and even teaching people makes my day! Anyways using your gifts is a special and should be use wisely and to make you not worry about what peopl think. Whatever the case is not worrying about your problems and just being who you are is the best thing that any person can do!!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Laterdayz

      Well Im going to use blogger.com to wright down my thoughts because i think it is time to wright things down before I forget them whenever I get older. I hope that you enjoy on what I like to share with everybody on the net.   Through my growing through life I have notice that I'm learning new things from my parents, friends, and just watching people off the street. Many things I would like to say out loud to everyone, but my shyness usually slow me down on sharing on what is on my mind. It also has cause me to stay single....which I don't mind. It is very hard for me to share my feelings towards others. I have no idea why. The good news is that Im starting to open up my heart and mind towards the world. Anyways on what ever you do you shall not be scare to speak your mind, but be very careful with that. You still would want to show respect and honor to the person you are talking to. You don't want to get carry away on what you are saying. Honor is a very big thing for me. I hate whenever people would dishonor each other. The word honor is a big thing that in some cases it is hard to explain to somebody. So Im going to do the best that I can. Honor is a peron that has alot of respect for himself and for everyone else. He/she will never think lower of himself/herself or another person. That is what honor means to me......but there is more to it that is hard to explain. Anyways about speaking your mind, you should not care about what people think about because God(the big man upstairs) made each and everyone unique then others. So Im asking from each and everyone to be careful what you say to others, show everyone honor and don't be scare to speak out......the world wants to hear what you have to say.   Well this is my first thought, I will post other things of my thoughts whenever I think of them. Don't worry I learn something new everyday...lol. Anyways I hope that you enjoy this blog.   Laterdays
