        Estremità Del Mondo Da Qui  Così lasci gli aerei cadere dal cielo. Per voi sappia che non li mancherò quando morite. E nel guaime della guerra. Sia sicuro che non li amerò più.   Durante Esso Tutto  So dove ora sto andando male. I suoi piedi non toccheranno la terra. Ma gli chiederò ora e scommetta che geme. Il giorno più lungo ho avuto, ancora non è stato dimenticato. Rimarrà con me, durante esso tutto.   Visto Mio Ballare Del Bambino  Città del cowboy. Visto mio ballare del bambino? Visto il mio bambino che balla su una notte di sabato?

      So, I'm at the bar... (very good Mr. Bain) and there is also Heineken Dave, Paul, and Bill in the vicinity. HD starts telling me about The Residents as he does everytime he sees me and I reply that I'm having trouble with e-mails. This topic is taken rather well and many anecdotes and discussions arise. How very dull, I was also very wet after getting drenched on the walk up. Then Paul turns highly intoxicated in the blink of an eye and starts complaining about road tax. He has none, they are doing him, he thinks it's unfair, no-one backs him up, he shouts at coppers walking past, we laugh, I leave. Very good. And then I came online and I am lost..... Oh SHM! comeback.... I smile at NTL's blog and Wills' loung site. I will write a poem.  The concise nature of life reminds, Me of a ship capsized. The Hull is on the left now Captain! Oh shit we've gone past Rome!

      Grillo says "Hi!"  Everyone seem'd happy enough, sat around the fire that night. But out of relaxation, like a thwarted enemy looking for revenge, comes complacency. And complacency, my friends, had no right visiting us that fateful summer moonlit night. 'Twas half past the chime of eleven when the effect of the alcohol began to affect our minds. A slow, painful process, ourselves to blame, and the lager we had bought and brought. I remember lying back and looking up and seeing something that i instantly knew was not to do... I saw a bright blue flame, like that of a bunsen burner, glowing in the shape of a portacabin. I was amazed I can tell you. Turns out it was just a portacabin ablaze after I'd set fire to it. I'd forgotten all about it until that point, and then I realised that I was absolutely wasted.  This is fiction at it's best!

      Surely to Wilson it cannot be long now....Days spent checking for e-mails, replying to Record Labels, Helpful Friends and Venues... Evrything seeming to be going right.. It's just a matter of time before we either rise to the ascendency of gods, or jack it in with our tails between our legs. Never! Cries of self-satisfaction!
