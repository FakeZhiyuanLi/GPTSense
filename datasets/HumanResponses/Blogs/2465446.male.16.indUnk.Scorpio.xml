      "you cant really get a more two faced backstabbing twat available 24 hours a day for a fuck can you"  The quote of a lifetime when it comes to describing people I hate.  It was just a quickie my friends, tatty bass x

      So it begins that after a long weekend (thursday to sunday) of woopdidoo & huzzah, I must now settle back to obtaining a job.  Kasabian are very good indeed. The played in escape (swansea club) on friday and I thouroughly enjoyed. Spiderman 2 was really good much better than the first one. Probably because I never actually went to see Spiderman 2 and instead took some fun time drinks down by the lake and proceeded to enjoy them muchly.  Today I continue work on the upcoming UCCW site. Whlist also playing video games a la PSdeux.  A link or four for your pleasure;   urlLink Malibu 9   urlLink Girtarted   urlLink Tomato plant wears a condom?   urlLink

      Last night I saw a wonderful play by Noel Coward.  I wont bother with a review or storyline, rather I shall just say i enjoyed very much so and also had a lovely pizza in the italian across the road.  Didn't live up to my promises as usual. Only one fairly pathetic update to the site. I guess i'm just not in a computer art mood recently. I've done plenty of sketches and writing but without a scanner they are useless.  Tatty boules my dears xx

      IT'S OVER!  Bugsy Malone is now done with, a muchly deserved ovation to send us off. Photos will be on shinbiscuit later.  Today I must begin my job hunt. Starting a few minutes ago by filling in my BK application form.  What Skills & Personal Qualities can you bring to Burger King?  Originally I wanted to put down some badass homie lyrics to showcase how great I am. Something about me macking the whores and taking drugs.  Or, I wanted to simply put down "It's a fast food house, who cares"  But in the end I went with, "I'm a pleasant & fun guy to be around"  I'm honest to the bone, tatty bill for now kids.

       urlLink Horizon   Rather than make an article, I'm just putting the one image online. It's a particularly nice sunset in my opinion, and makes a good desktop background.  In other incredibly unimportant news I just bought two pairs of sunglasses from eBay. I bought two because I fond a pair I really liked right after I'd already won the first bid I looked at. At least this way I have an alternate option if I don't like a pair.  I have the feeling that by the end of this summer, Shinbiscuit will not only have several new and poignant articles, but also a short story, the first couple of chapters from a longer story of mine, plus at least 5 (Yes 5, I really mean it this time) new Ed comics. This should motivate me to use all the ideas and concepts that have been scribbled in the past two years. The three poor excuses online currently are far below the potential of Ed.  I'm going to leave Mean Steve & Fucky animations until September, where I shall hopefully have more efficient computer and moderately organised life. However, you lucky young scamps may be treated to some MS&F sample comics in the next few weeks.  My I will be busy. Damn myself and my promises.  Tatty Bat

      I promise I will update the site soon. I know it's not highly important considering the only visitor apart from me is Ramo, who is on the staff and technically the co-owner.  This morning I have been dabbling with Terragen. Some software that I recently downloaded which enables you to make wonderful landscape images, great for making desktop wallpaper. I'll put my few creations in the articles section later.  Saw Shrek2 last night. Fabulous film indeed, and it is unbelievable just how many film, fairy tale, advert, TV program, franchise and modern life references they managed to cram in. Good soundtrack as well I must note, but I'm not overly fond of the slowed down, souped up "I Need A Hero" for the credits.  I have an hour until I have to turn up for Bugsy Malone rehearsals. The show goes on stage Friday 7:30, after that I'm free to get a job and thus safe up and buy myself something nice. A new PC is top of the wish list, a powerful little ditty with stuff & extras, hopefully a video camera so I can make all the projects I harp on about.  Something is in the works, I mean it this time. So expect an article or two by the end of the week.  Tatty Bye xx

      Good afternoon. This would be the newest web blog created by myself, primarily for updating people on the goings on over at  urlLink Shinbiscuit  but also for short ramblings.  For those that knew of it, Banoffee Coffee is no more. This being a more than adequate replacement.
