      Well my first blog I am somebody now.I feel like a million bucks, post my thoughts on the web possibly gain some momentum maybe catapult this into some kind of career. I hardly have any aspirations for gaining fame I can barely stand being around people I know. That is not to say that I am some sort of introvert that never leaves his house or does anything outgoing. Sure I dodge the spotlight at any chance it is put on me, but still I am not afraid. To be afraid is to be a coward and that is just the ultimate insult to a guy and hey I am a guy if you did not pick up on it earlier. I mean hey a selfconscious arrogant prick who thinks his dull life is actually worth talking about. I mean hey this must be a guy, only a guy could be arrogant and selfconcious at the same time. Bullshit what do I know, I know nothing women which is I suppose common and I am not even out of highschool yet. There is no way I can have an opinion about anything simply because I am a child who knows nothing about responsibility, really though I do not have that many opinions so you want find anything on here about the War or any of that shit until I am at least in college drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes letting the world have a glimpse at my infinite genuis. I guess there will be some social commetary whatever that means, I heard the phrase somewhere, makes me sound like I know something. Really the only way I keep the ego growing is by using shit like that and trying to sound smart but arrogant. The whole ego came about when people started calling me smart because I got good grades, hell I did not know that they were good grades because I was always slacking off well not really. I try to downplay the effort I exhaust in getting good grades just to sound like I am some prodigy really it is just to shield myself from whenever someone says I am not as smart as someone else and I can just say well if Iworked as hard as them I would be just as smart. The reason I am not as smart as I could be is because of my mother. Typical blame the mother, but in some aspects it is true she used to help me with homework when I was younger and I can never forget how she would yell at me if kept repeating a mistake. Eventaully I just stoped asking from help from anyone, in class I don't no something I don't ask the teacher I suffer or pray someone else is has the same problem but lacks my phobia of help. That is not the main reason that I do not raise my hand it also comes back to being selfconscious if you did not see that one coming. I always think people wo ask questions are dumb, this is only in class mind you I would question if asked to sodomize an Iraqi detainee. Sorry no political commentary until college, smoking and coffee my apologizes I humbly beg for your forgiveness.Well the people who ask question no matter how mundane always come out with the A not to say that I angry about it I think they deserve if they do not know something they ask. This must have been an extreme waste of your time I went off on to a rant that splintered into another rant that splinterd into another rant that eventually led to you reading this sentence.        This is your friendly neighborhood sarcastic condescending illiterate peusdo anti-social hero off to save the day again.
