        Q: I'm just a girl, who really likes a boy. I have been single for over a year and a half. I've dated several people, but no one had long term potential. I had decided to just give up on dating and to focus on my career. No sooner had I made this decision has the seemingly perfect man walk into my life. And he really does seem perfect, though I've only known him for a few weeks. He's absolutely beautiful both inside and out. Guys usually don't make me nervous, but this guy drives me crazy (in a good way). But, when I dont hear from him I'm a mess. When I do hear from him all is well with the world. I know, I need to get a grip and try to relax and enjoy the ride. What my dilemma is that I havent felt this way about someone in a really long time, and he is someone who I would like to get to know better and possibly be with (if he's willing) and I don't want to mess this up by playing games or doing anything stupid. I want to be breezy but at the same time show compassion. -Girl who likes a boy  A: I think you're making the mistake that all of us girls have made. Banking everything on a guy waaay too quickly. I think focusing on your career and embarking on a new, exciting relationship can be juggled, if handled properly.  I, personally, hadn't dated for about the same time you were out of the game, and, surprise, a great guy came into my life. It's only been a few weeks, I don't think the L-word has been uttered yet, and it's not like you're engaged. Have fun with it, and don't let those stereotypical female neuroses get you down. If you're sitting around the house waiting for his call, go take a walk, get a coffee, and take some time to smell the roses. It's just like how a watched pot never boils. I know this is hard, but if you relax, your breeziness that you're striving for will come naturally.   -Miss K.

       Q: I think I wearing her out. Ladies, advice please. My girlfriend and I have been sleeping together for over two months now, and I am constantly horny. We fuck three times a night and I can last for over twenty minutes each time. She comes a lot, or at least she acts like she does. Some dates consist of me coming over and fucking her. She plans it that way, last time I offered her dinner, but she turned it down so we could get busy asap. I know she likes it, but today after a very long hump session she said I was,"too much." I think her eveready bunny (or is it beaver?) is about to break. Outside of sex we have a great time together, which is why we ended up together in the first place. So why do I want advice from the ladies? I'm thinking that she may need a relief catcher. But I am not sure how to ask her without pissing her off. I'm afraid of asking because it's basically like saying she can't handle me. Also, I already get the sense she won't be very open to another woman sharing me. -I Wanna Fuck   A: Hey sex addict, stop hiding your desire to start fucking other women—if you aren't already—behind the idea you've tired out your girlfriend. Our vaginas are tough. We can take some intense fucking. Although she probably does tire out on occasion, even if you don't. Why do your thoughts automatically jump to other women? If you want to have an open relationship, cheat, have a threesome, or dump your girlfriend, then do what you have to do, ask her if you want to. But don't hide behind this ridiculous notion that it's her. It's you.

        Q: I met this girl 2 yrs ago, not really my type physically, dated her for a month, tried to break up, she told me that she thought I was her soul mate and to please give it a chance. I did and fell in love with her. I've never considered marrying anyone until I met her, she's smart, funny and we generally get along great.   She went off to school (1000 miles away) and we did the long distance thing. She went on medication for depression and gained alot of weight. We didn't know it was the medication at first. So I told her that the weight gain was affecting my physical attraction to her in the most tactful way possible. She said she would work on it.   We had a great phone relationship but when she would visit I could barely get it up for her.   She quit the medication and lost some of the weight, but has much more to go. She says she is going to excersize but doesn't. I don't want to nag her or hurt her feelings. It's been 6 months since she's been off the meds and with very little physical activity she's not getting smaller. She was already a bit too big for my tastes when I met her, but this is bad.   I love her so much, but the weight gain, lack of effort and the long distance thing is really taking a toll on me. She keeps promising to work on it, then quits when she feels comfortable in the relationship again.   I've tried breaking up with her in the past and it's ugly, I also know when her previous boyfriend broke up with her she tried to kill herself, I'm scared.  Any advice?  -Torn    A:  I think you need to think about how this is affecting you as well as her. This is obviously taking a toll on you, and it's at an unhealthy, dependent rut.  I don't know if you have the funds or time to go visit her, but this "talk" if you finally decide to have it, needs to be in person.  Phone calls and emails can take away from what you're trying to convey, or can be misconstrued.  I don't want to suggest lying, but this is a delicate situation. If you gently let her know that you need a break, or even just be friends, but not to the point where you say you want to see other people. It's a lot to put on yourself, but you've invested time in this, and she trusts you. Just try to be an uplifting, inspirational person to her, and try to help her get her life back on track, where she's at a point where she can move on.  I don't know if you want to leave a window open that you can get back together, but if you feel like you would want to, let her know. That might give her the kick in the ass she needs. -Miss K.

        Q: i need career advice! okay, so i was recently shafted from law school and i might have a change of heart in careers. i have a combined BA/B.Ed degree and would like to change careers. Does anyone have any careers or degrees that you would recommend pursuing? I'm interested in something that would provide me with growth and advance that would eventually translate into a lucrative salary. Any advice is greatly appreciated. -schoolbound    A:Schoolbound, Hey it's Friday night and I've had a few, but let me tell you what I think anyway and hope it comes out OK. First of all, you were "shafted." Call me crazy, but I sense some anger about whatever went down. And now you have a change of heart. Are you running scared or is your confidence shaken? Of course. But if your heart is still in law, then step back and regroup and find another avenue to get to your goal. But if you really did have some kind of wake-up call to pursue another career, then that's OK too. Let's dicuss. You said you have a BA Ed. But, your first degree doesn't HAVE to factor into your next, and higher, one. In journalism school one of the grad students i knew was this guy who had majored in math in undergrad 10 years ago and then decided later on to be a writer. So consider whether you want to incorporate teaching, education or whatever your undergrad emphasis was. You may want to or you may not care so much. So what are your options if you diverge from the path you thought was so well laid out? Well, what do you like? What do you love? Keep it simple. Do you absolutely love taking your dog to the dog run, and holy shit while you mention it, you love animals. ALOT. well think about that. Maybe you've always wanted to own your own business. Or travelling would have been nice.... OK I'm not suggesting you be a travelling cat/dog treat salesman. I'm saying that consider what you truly love, enjoy, can tolerate, whatever. Maybe that can play a role, however big and small, in your next move. There may be another side to law you haven't thought about thats a bit more creative a take on it all. The reason why I elaborate so is because it seems to me that in my 5 years of work experience, I've seen people create opportunites for themselves. I've seen jobs created for and tailored around people with passion. I've seen happy people. These have been rare. Most people are miserable slobs. But the few who aren't, well, I envy them every day and know I'll be part of their kind one day if I'm lucky. I heard of a survey once that said young people nowadays will change careers (not jobs) up to 7 times in their lifetime. Why is that? We're looking to do something we love, or that inspires us. This shakeup in your life is just what you need. If you have the fucking balls.

        Q : Have you ever had your heart broken really badly? I just recently came out of a 4-year relationship. I was wronged and left for dead emotionally. He left me for another girl. It's been two months since the mess. Everyday I try to move on, in hope that things will get better. Does it? I find myself slowly losing hope. How does one cope when they've been screwed over by a lover? Have you ever been so low? I just want to know that it will get better, that justice will be served. - -Heartbroken in Cali   A: I like to believe that Karma always prevails. You get what you give, you reap what you sow, and all those other cliches. It's only been 2 months. You have to give yourself grieving time, and 4 years is a long time to invest in something and get so little back in the end. I know this might sound dumb, and very Dear Abby-ish, but maybe you could take a class in something you've always wanted to do, or take up a hobby. I have found that just filling up the time is always hard, so hopefully that will help.  -Miss K.

       Q: I have a question for you ladies. I was out the other night and from across the room I saw a guy I've been on a few dates with recently. But he was with another guy, and they were holding hands and kissingÅ\obviously on a date! He didn't see me, thank god. But now I'm mortified. (By the way, we slept together.) So what should I do? We email and talk alot and have plans for this weekend! Is he gay? What the fuck is going on? -Anonymously Confused   A: You sure are a lucky lucky lady. No need to be mortified (unless you're not having safe sex.. then you should get tested and start taking precautions).. but back to my original enthusiasm for your guy friend. if you're an open lady, you have the great opportunity to have the often wanted but rarely had guy-guy-girl situation!  I'm super excited for you.   However, if this is not your type of thing, then you should stop seeing him. He's not going to reign himself in for you and you shouldn't start to feel like you should open up or become more experimental for him if you don't want to. - Miss I.
