      So, George Bush is still an idiot I suppose..... I mean how f*cking clever can one man be. He fooled all the terrorists and Millitia men by having the transfer of power given to Iraq in the middle of the night last night...... So I give Mr. Bush the First Ever  ' Cap'N Conservative Smartest Man Alive Award '.... But you know what, Big Media doesn't care, NOOOOOOOOOO , they just want to suck Michael Moore's big Hog Ass some more..... I'm listening to Glenn Beck right now talking about somebody's experience who went to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 over the weekend and how there were blatant lies such as Moore saying at the beginning of the movie ' I nevery major recount Gore won the Presidential Election '.... That should make one wanna walk out of the film at the beginning for having a bold face lie perpetrated at the beginning of a 'Documentary '... But then again I'm asking Liberals to use there brain here. I remember when I was younger, I used to like Moore and his tv shows ' TV Nation ' and ' The Awful Truth ' but then I found out his ' documentaries ' were nothing more than acted out personal opinion and vision. And Michael Moore is not fat, He's like that Blob of ectoplasm in Ghostbusters 2, remember when you yelled at it and showed hatred toward it, it grew bigger??? Well that's what has happened to more, he's just like the pink blob and his girth keeps on getting bigger and bigger with all the hate he instills about America and for America. ( Comment : The Producers of this Website wish to tell the readers that the views of CapnConservatives are his views and his views alone, if any ectoplasmic blob of slime was offended by being compared to Michael Moore, we are sorry and we agree with your complaints ). It's a good thing Spiderman 2 comes out on Wednesday, that way this film will be forgotten very soon. I bet Michael Moore smells like a weird cheese of some sort. I mean with his girth and huski-ness it would be hard to get in between most of his fat rolls when he showers, if he showers??? And the dead fat skin cells would just fester in the sweltering heat generated by his fat rolls rubbing against each other when he barely breathes, all sorts of bacteria forming and coming to life. Maybe he takes a shower in Grease and someone needs to buy him one, JUST ONE, F*CKING HAT TO FIT HIS BULBOUS HEAD..... I seriously think Moore just needs to get laid, once...... I swear to God if he gets laid once, his next documentary will be about how Flowers broom in the springtime and love is eternal..... Of course finding a VICTIM like that is like trying to get Parents to send there kids to Neverland Ranch for a sleepover party.        I saw John Kerry on TV today and the guy just looks like he smells, like he's always got the 5 o'clock shadow and it's that weird smell of sweat and stetson that I sense everytime I see him. Everytime I see an ad with ' This ad approved by Me, John Kerry ' I sit back and laugh and think of him saying that like ' This ad approved by John Kerry........ I think...... Did I????? * Papers heard in the background ruffling *..... Ok I did, that's right.... Good.... I approved it...... wait! I mean I didn't..... GodD*mnit, which one is it! ' He's easily confused. At least when Kerry loses the election he can be the National Spokesman for ' This is a Medal, Not a Ribbon Charity ', where he can go around to different vets houses and determine if they actually have a medal or a ribbon. And then he can go work in a bank approving home loans ' Congratulations Mr. and Ms. Jenkins on your new home '.......... Two weeks later Mr. and Miss Jenkins are eating dinner watching American Idol, holding hands when the phone rings ' Mr. Jenkins, I'm sorry I approved your house loan before I rejected it, you'll have to give it back to us. thanks '....... And then Al Gore can come in and console the Jenkins by screaming like his toes are being gnawed on by a metal toothed gypsy gnome ' HE BETRAYED THIS HOME, HE PLAYED ON YOUR FEARS ' And then Teddy Kennedy can come by and crash into a power line pole to give everyone a great chuckle and lighten the mood. And that my friends is your Democratic Party in a nutshell. A bunch of Unqualified Riff Raff given a chance to control the government. I know personally I'll feel safer with them in control............................. FARRRTTTTTTTT!       I think John Kerry wears Sock Suspenders.... don't ask me why but whenever I see him, I see him in an old white v-neck with various weird stains spotted here and there and sitting around in some boxers with his shirt tucked tightly into them and wearing sock suspenders while drinking cheap brandy. But back to my point I made last post, isn't he scary looking, I mean there's just something wrong with him, that's why you never see him holding babies, the mothers are afraid he'd eat them or something. He just looks unnatural. At least at Halloween Time his masks will be a huge hit with the children who want to dress up as the Long Face Hobbit Presidential Candidate. They could also market it to the kids as a way of getting out of trouble to the kids too. *** ' Kids are you tired of getting caught lying???? Not anymore, with the John Kerry Presidential Candidate Long Face Hobbit Mask.... Watch as Little Jimmy demonstrates..... * Parents bust into Timmy's room * ' Timmy you didn't do the dishes, your grounded ' * Timmy looks at the Camera and a lightbulb goes off above his head..... The parents are shown in the kitchen discussing bills when Timmy walks around the corner with a John Kerry mask on ,the chin is scraping the floor, cut the kid some slack, he's only 3 feet tall. The parents scream in horror at the sight of this Massive Gargantuon head and then realize it's Timmy ' Mom and Dad, I actually did do the dishes before I didn't do them '..... The Parents cock there head to the side and smile and go ' ahhhhh, our son... wel love you '.... They hug and everything all better ' Of course this only works if you place the  *Liberal Hearing Aid in the parents ears and then talk.... ~~~Through the miracle of modern technology you can be a liberal too with the Liberal Hearing Aid..... The Tiny Reciever in the bud of the Hearing Aid actually plays all 512 Hours of Al Gore's screaming Hate Speeches, guaranteed to turn your brain into pudding in 3.2 seconds, thus making liberals in the right!..... ~~~~~        Oh and my theory about Liberals was correct. This morning I saw a guy with a Dean and Kerry sticker on there car..... It was a VW Jetta, he had his little thermos cup filled with, what was no doubt, starbucks or some other overly fancy coffee and he had a bike rack on top of his car..... I mean what's the deal with putting a bike rack on your car anyways??? That's like having an airplane with a car on top..... ' I like to show my woodsy side with a frolic through the park on my bike while wearing spandex and smelling like some third world refugee after I'm done , wanna do it? ' No thanks, I enjoy air conditioning and gas guzzling! Peace wolverine1869@hotmail.com

         Hey what's Up.... I'm Captain Conservative. Here to save the day from the Neanderthalic attempts to de-brain you by the Liberals in today's Society. A Little History about myself.... I'm 22 years old, from Nashville Tennessee and pretty poor.... From reading that you'd probably think I was a liberal, but I chose not to wear the sheeps wool and actually use my brain for more than constructing crack pipes and rolling joints and listening to the Dave Matthews Band and watching CNN while talking about the virtues of Scott Stapp and Creed while sipping on my Grande Latte' in which my whole life revolves around if I get the correct double dip whip o cream..... PHEEWWWW sorry to go off on a tangent but Liberals really make my nuts hurt. I'm starting this site because I believe my voice and views need to be heard, because I'm very opinionated,funny,good looking and my chick really hates when I talk politics with her. For instance the other night we were watching ' Behind Enemy Lines ' with Owen Wilson ( Dignon from Bottle Rocket ).... And my chick looks at me and goes...' I didn't know Clinton had a war with France...... '* Insert Crickets Chirping Here *...... So I started this to spout my rhetoric and hope someone sides with me and agrees with the fact that all liberals should be melted from the trapped Alien's eyeball lazers in Area 51...     Who's John Kerry... Does anyone take this guy seriously??? I mean he's a walking joke... I love his new ad * insert pompous shouting like voice here * ' I have a plan to improve this economy and ad more jobs to the marketplace ' * Insert Hollow Eyed Look Here * Now most people would indulge there plan on how to do it, how to improve, but not old John Kerry, he's to sly for those tricks, he's to smart to divulge his plans daddy... WHY???? BECAUSE HE DOESN'T F*CKING KNOW!!!!... He'll get back to you when the Democratic party feeds him some lines.... I envision John Kerry as a big Democratic Party Suggestion box and a Marionette puppet for Teddy Kennedy and his pals to funnel there thoughts through and act out there deeds for them because noone in America would vote for those clownshoes, unless we were in Bizzaroland..... AND KERRY'S FACE..... It's Horrific!!!! What did he do??? Who did his parents piss off??? I mean I swear, if you stared at this dude long enough, your face would melt into lava! His face looks like he is a humongous leprachaun.... and a scary one at that.... John Kerry... Imagine Alec Baldwin in Beeltejuice, remember when he stretched out his face to scare the new owners of his house as a ghost??? Well that's what this dude, Kerry's, face looks like.... I swear it's like the longest face I've ever seen, I heard that on 9/11 he was advised to lay down all day to avoid planes flying into his face.... It was also nice of Kerry to come out the day of the new SpacePlane going into orbit that the government and Nasa opened to the public for and say ' This administration is not doing enough for science '.... I mean seriously he's lost, he has hollow eyes, he must be an alien, look at the guy, do you trust him for sight alone??? Hell NO!!! and his wife.... Whoaaaaaa..... She looks like a drunken Mike Myers Character on SNL' Coffee Talk ', a barfly sitting alone at the end of the bar trying to get the last redneck playing pool to go show her a good time. I wished Dean was the nominee at least then we'd have someone with a shred of personality running, instead of Stone Face Jenkins and his monotone, librarian type voice. At least with Dean you got someone with Compassion and Conviction even if he was an unbelievable moron.... But he was doomed by his Sloth Mating Squeel, like his nuts had been ripped off with no anesthetic....      If you're a liberal and reading this * Grabs Face like Adam Sandler Grabbed the face of the fat kid in Billy Madison and shakes it hardcore * WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU THINKING????? ... Well that's a dumb question... let me rephrase it.... WHY DON'T YOU F*CKING THINK FOR ONCE!!!!..... The Country, Our Way of Life depends on the unity of the parties and the support for the most Billy Bad Ass President to put on a suit, and yet you constantly undermine him, why??? The people we are at war with don't care if you drive a chevy or drive a VW ( liberals ) , they don't care if you go to Kwik Stop for Coffee or Starbucks ( liberals ) they don't care if you have a bike rack on the top of your car ( liberals ) or not, they want to kill all Americans, not just a party and we're not at risk, because of our president we are at risk because they have perfverted a religion and have taken it upon themselves to obliterate all those who oppose them and there struggle for overwehlming power of the world. It's pretty clear, we either get rid of them or they get rid of us. It's as plain as day and night, there's not in between as you liberals like to claim.... If you like your life and the way it is and the security you've had you'll vote Bush... If you want that to change and you want to worry everytime you walk out of your house if you're going to come home at night, Vote Kerry I think the logical choice is right in front of you, but logic seems to escape liberals from time to time... SEE GORE,AL ( HE BETRAYED THIS COUNTRY>>> HE PLAYED ON OUR FEARSSSSSSS ! ) and this is all Because you want power... Brother... you had power once and look where it got us.... If Kerry wins the presidency we're all screwed, mark it down, put it in a book and date stamp it.... He's lack on defense and he has no sack to stand up to anyone, check his purple hearts, he was JFK reincarnated.      Well this is my first post, email me or leave a comment. Remember I'm young, I'm Conservative and I'm Opionated and not Politically Correct, so please forgive me if I offend, these are my beliefs and supported by noone but myself. But I hope people dig this site and get behind it and we can band together to overthrow the Douchecratic Party....

            So I went Monday night to this advanced screening of Spiderman 2, I got passes through my super cool source who supplies me with the hookup. Little Side note that I find completely humorous, people go to these advance screenings for free, then they bring there 18 little drape munchers and go to the concession stand. They wind up spending anywhere from 50.00 to 75.00 dollars on food..... It sorta defeats the purpose of going for free if you're dishing out cheddar on some grub. So I get to the screening and sit down and these people in front of me are talking about how cool ' The Chronicles of Riddick ' was..... I hate to go on a diatribe about it, but I will..... ' The Chronicles of Riddick ' is quite possible one of the worst movies I have ever, EVER had the displeasure of seeing, and I'm only glad that it was free and I didn't have to pay money to see it. I think ' Air Bud 4 ' and Your Local Cable Access Hippie Poetry Show have more entertainment value to them than this movie does. It's the prequel to a movie that maybe 6 people saw and 1 person liked back in 1997 called ' Pitch Black ', it starred a then unknown, Vin Diesel , as a blind dude who helped these stranded space travelers get through this planet alive withought getting eaten by aliens. He could see at night and they couldn't so it helped them out. It was a decent movie, but it didn't deserve a sequel by anymeans, but because everyone loves the Melted Playdoh Faced Vin Diesel they decided to make a sequel. It starts off with some promise, then gets utterly ridiculous. They go to this planet where the temperature in the sun is 800 degrees and the temp. when it's dark is negative 300. We learn that when your Vin Diesel the laws of human physics don't apply to you. For instance Diesel spritzes himself with Tap Water and rides out into the sun on a rope to save the heroine who was stranded. He comes back still with some water on him and smoking..... If it's 800 degrees the only thing left of him would be his Huge Honker @ss nose. Then we learn, you can shield yourself from turning it bubbling human flesh by standing in the shade. In real world the temp in the shade is like, maybe a 5 degree difference, but in bizzaro world with Vin Diesel the temp. in the shade is 725 degrees different. Obviously it was a cool 75 degrees in the shade, while mere inches in the burning sun it was 800 degrees... WHATEVER!!!! Geez, should I go on??? I Must..... Remember when I said when it was night it got down to -300 degrees, well good, here's my point. Diesel and his cohorts were out gallavanting around in -300 degree temps with just tank tops and jeans on..... SWEATING...... That's right I said SWEATINGGGGGGGGGG.... Jeez, could it not hurt the director to maybe make a movie a smidgen realistic here????      Anyways back to my topic at hand..... In Spiderman 2, Peter Parker learns a harsh lesson that, no matter what you do right for the world ,there will always be detractors.... And for Parker and Bush alike - Big Media is the Main Destractors.... For Parker, when he foils a robbery attempt by Doc Ock the papers report he and Doc Ock were trying to rob the bank together. The papers refer to him as ' The Masked Menace '.... Sounds like another superhero I know of, who doesn't wear a mask, just a well ironed suit. George Bush is a modern day superhero. He put all his sh*t on the line to save the lives of millions of Iraqi's, what thanks does he get??? Big Media reporting that Iraq is another Vietnam ( Gee, I had a feeling that we lost Vietnam and I'm under the impression that we just re-wrote Iraq's government ourselves, for the better , wow I must be retarded or something ) He gets the Abu Ghraib Scandal, because didn't you know that George Bush while enjoying a late night snack called up a lowly ranked Prison guard and informed him how to torture iraqi's, I mean it's common knowledge I heard Al Gore and Teddy Kennedy have a copy of the phone conversations somewhere. And we get the Media reporting what a failure Fallujah has become, even though most soldiers and officers I've heard said we defeated most of the insurgents there.... You see there's a conspiracy here..... The Media wants you to think that George Bush is a Villian, an Evil Doer and a Crook because that's what they are, they want to divert the attention off themselves an onto someone else, and who betta??? The President of the United States, Why??? Because it's cool to hate on him... Why???? Because Hollywood and the Elite call him stupid... WHY????? Well..... ( Crickets Chirping ) Ummmmmmm He just is, because they heard it from someone else who said he had a funny accent....      George Bush is Peter Parker minus the Spiderman Outfit, He sticks up for what's right, defends the people who can't defend themselves, has a strong sense or morality and most importantly Sticks true to his beliefs no matter who or what doubts him... Personally with the way Media and Most of America treats him, I would have called a speech and told people ' Fine, you want me gone, I'm gone, I hate you anyways, I've busted my sack here for four years, defended you and kept you safe from those and others intent on destorying us like they tried on september 11th, you want another one??? Fine, you can have it, as for me, I'm gonna go to my super secret hideaway in Texas on a Ranch and relax, good luck with Long Face Jenkins as your new President, you're gonna need it, you ungrateful bastards! 'Then he can put his fingers in the side of his mouth and whistle and a galaint steed could come through the window of the white house and he hops on and puts on a cowboy hat and rides off. He doesn't need this junk anymore..... Personally I'd love to see George Bush go on the Celebrity Boxing circuit and take on people like Al Gore and Ted Kennedy and Hilary Clinton... I'd pay money to see that and for him to connect a few donkey punches to there sideburns.... Then score a fatality like in ' Mortal Kombat '.... Word.... I'm Out
