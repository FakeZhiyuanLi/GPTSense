      lately i have been desprately lonely. i don't know why. i just keep thingking why don't i have more friends? why do i thinkinh that everyone has been up to fun stuff w/ out me? i'm probably just paranoied. but i keep wondering: is this as good as it gets? this is probably my 'oh i don't have a boufriend aren't i pathentic'&nbsp;phase that i go through periodically, but still. i'm turning into one of thoes creepy people who watch shows and get so sucked into them they start feeling ok only when theire watching it. for me it'a buffy. i'm starting to&nbsp;weired myself out. that and my dreams are wicked weired. very frank the bunny. not a&nbsp;good thing. i am trying to figure things out, though. it's probably hte drugs they have me on for my wisedom teeth.  still- i have this feeling that&nbsp;people are just being&nbsp;nice to me&nbsp;out of pitty or something.&nbsp; but then i take a&nbsp;deep breath and it's ok for a bit.  i'll just keep breathing.  just keep breathing.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      dooood! &nbsp; i felt sooo teenagery today. it was more after i went downtown that i felt all teenagery, but still. i had my new shirt, jeans, hair down, and listening to ashlee simpson. I want ashlee hair!!!! &nbsp; blah. i feel so puddly lately. i don't really know why- it's not like anything is soo different from normal life. i guess it's cause i don't really have anything to do now- no more camp. babysitting here i come! i should just call people. i just got a birst of energy. i want to tody my room and clean my makeup brushes. that sounds even stupider outside of my head then in. oh well. &nbsp; bah! boys are dumb.

      periods suck. sometimes. &nbsp; i'm going to leave that at that. &nbsp; lately i've had this lack of all umpf, and i can't figure out why. i guess it's cause i don't have any prospects, guy wise, and it's sort of deflated me. i guess i'm more upset about sam then i thought. which makes me feel even  more  stupid, which makes me feel needy, which makes me need a lot of hugs,&nbsp;which makes me need TV and chocolate. &nbsp; it's all a mean chain designed to make me fat.  poo.

      So I am doing 2 scenes tomorrow for camp: 1 from the crucible where i flip out and slap a girl, and 1 where i'm a gossip queen. i'm totally panicked. then, on one of my characters for the actuall show, i have to make her uber flirty but the guy i have to flirt w/ is totally icky- he;s annoying and flirts like a flopping fish. ick! plus, he's starting to get puppy eyes when we're not on stage- ALERT! ALERT! flirting on stage does not equal likeing!!!!    AAAAARRRRG!  update: i went to cams house (forgot to get cell number- oops >  and my hair was poopy today. >  oh well.

      dear god i'm tired. i went downtown today after camp and it was soooooooo boaring. on the other hand, i was not a nick minion today- or at least i didn't think so. other end of the world: i got an email from greg today- who knew he was alive? i guess he did, and a lot of other people did, and now i come to think of ir, i probably would have found out if he had dies, so, yeah. Hi Greg, if you read this, I miss you! come visit!!!!!!  i like the geston song!!!!! my favorite part:     For there's no one as burly and brawny       As you see I've got biceps to spare  *sigh* happy  so there

      or only one, really. befroe i start: i know this is obsessive, but i really am aware of the nothingness this probably means and how at work my overanolyzing skills are.   so we were ar my house, and cam was all, "hey you want me to run over to my house and get 4rth season [of the simpsons]?" and i was all  "sure" and then he asked if i wanted to come alling and in my head i was all "no shit i want to go!" but i just went "sure!" (please note: he didn't ask claudia) so we were in the car and i ate some nerds and we just kinda talked about neither here nor there. we got to his house, we went in to the TV room, i flopped on the couch, we talked about simpsons and verious crap, we got into the car (again) and lindsay (girlfriend) had left him a message. he was all "does she ever stop talking?" and i was like, "i don't know does she talk in her sleep? if she does, we have a no." he was all, "i think she talked in her sleep once" "then we have a no." he laughed. ^^ we tried to switch CDs- he shifted through CDs while    not  crashing.he did the thing where you go fast and swerve a lot, it was fun. then we went down heather, areound primrose twice, and then down iris.    "I can't remember a time   before  you started telling that story"- Pete *heart*  so there. am i just overanolyzing, or is it just me?

       Oh my God.  so i 'liked' him for, like, ever right? well, he keeps on acting like he likes me, making me thing "oh yay!" when he NEVER LIKED ME!!!!!  AAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH! so now, not only do i feel reeeeeeeeeeally stoopid, i think i never really liked him in the first place! i guess i liked him a bit in the beginning, but it faded pretty fast, but it was 8th grade, so i though i  had  to like someone, right? but then when he broke up w/ claire, i  really  had to keep on 'liking' him. so i feel doubly stoopid. i found out he didn't like me on friday night, and i was all, 'cool! now i don't have tolike him any more!' and then i saw him on saturday and he was all trying to tickle my feet and trying to be all flirty and i was having none of that and i was all 'quit it' i wasn't mean, or anything, i was just not warm. then, when we left, i just sort of got up and was like 'i gotta go- bye!' and he was all 'bye?' and he looked all confused. HA! take that! medicine of your own not tasting quite as fun, EH?   on the other end of the planet, i totally like cam   more later- dinner.
