      I'm surrounded by children.&nbsp; Round cheeked, messy, crying children.&nbsp; They enter the daycare wide-eyed and eager to tackle another day of potty training, learning how to pump on the swingset and baking sandbox pies.&nbsp; Some of the moms are my age or younger and I marvel at them as they gracefully detach their children's arms from around their necks and kiss them goodbye.&nbsp;   Sometimes thinking about having a baby scares me.&nbsp; Once they are there, once the line is blue, they are there forever.&nbsp; It will change our lives.&nbsp; Not ruin it like so many other people say, but it will change it.&nbsp; Our cars will need carseats, we'll spend a fortune on stain removal prodcuts, our cats will be jealous, my boobs will feed on demand, everything will have to be baby-proofed.&nbsp; Our routine grocery shopping will be interrupted by the presence of diapers and pacifiers.&nbsp; And then the baby will grow and talk and cry and yell and destroy everything.&nbsp; By the time it reaches adolescence it's purpose will be to hate us.   And yet I'm excited for it!&nbsp; I think what excites me most is the miracle of creation of another human, made by me and the man I love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human life is considered the most sacred thing on this planet and we can create it!&nbsp; It's like a majestic rite that everyone can practice, that everyone on earth has in common.&nbsp; Everyone can procreate, everyone&nbsp;can in&nbsp;some form or another begat.   I was just pondering this today.&nbsp; Don't worry, I'm not pregnant.&nbsp; We drank the bottle of Casa Larga Lilac Hill.&nbsp; Everyone loves it.&nbsp; It makes me homesick, merely because it came from Rochester.&nbsp; I miss my little city.&nbsp; Newport is okay. &nbsp;I suppose I could be living in worse places. ;)hehe.   Goodnight everybody.

      Moving is such a tedious task.&nbsp; It's so much more than relocating stuff.&nbsp; It involves rediscovery of things you've buried in a forgotten closet, things that fall into the unknown crevices of the furniture, things the cat pushed under the bed.&nbsp; You find yourself dusting not only the dust bunnies in the corner but the cobwebs of your mind.&nbsp;   Something odd I've realized about myself lately is that I'm a closet clean freak.&nbsp; Those that know me and have lived with me are saying, "yeah right" but it's true.&nbsp; I learned this when I started my string of secretary jobs, where the only real skills involved were talking on the phone and organizing things.&nbsp; Turns out, I'd much rather organize things.&nbsp; My first job was pretty boring and the highlight of my day was putting huge piles of work orders in chronological order.&nbsp; I actually found this fun and would get pissy if anyone interrupted me.&nbsp; The second job was slightly more demanding...a lot of writing up documents and running errands.&nbsp; I was the "temp" which basically entitled all full time employees to dump their dirty work on me.&nbsp; Filing seemed to be the time-wasting task everyone despised.&nbsp; In the morning there would be stacks of folders and papers with thank you post-its.&nbsp; I never let on that I actually got off alphabetizing and putting things away in the right places.&nbsp; Maybe I need some pyscho therapy on this one.&nbsp; The  Real Simple &nbsp; magazine has replaced  Cosmo,  each page turn filling me with orgasmic anticipation of how I too can create 33% more living space by storing my cds in archive binders.  So I sit at work daydreaming about this.&nbsp; I begin to "compartmentalize" each room, thinking how I will better organize the things we commonly refer to as "our stuff."&nbsp; We have at least two closets filled with odd-sized, falling apart boxes containing broken pieces of our lives...too ugly to be displayed, too beautiful to throw away forever.&nbsp; The closets are like the graveyards of our past, only visited when trying to regain something we've lost.  I think our closet space would be better suited if things were filed and labeled more specifically.&nbsp; "Jenn's stuff" seems a little broad.&nbsp; But things like  old toys, old schoolwork, wedding memories, unfinished projects and things left unsaid  would be easier to live with.  Red Sox are winning which makes Erik a happy boy.&nbsp; I have Ben and Jerry's in the freezer which makes me a happy&nbsp;girl.&nbsp; (a perfect formula for a happy co-existence) :)  Goodnight.

      Allyson moved into the house next door when were very little.&nbsp; We attended Montesorri school together and played JEM and the Holograms outside at recess.&nbsp; We grew up playing Barbies, having crushes on the same boys and sharing the stories of our lives on the bus ride home.&nbsp; We haven't been best friends for years...neighbors grow apart, move apart and move on but the space between us&nbsp;didn't make witnessing her wedding vows any less special.&nbsp; It was the first wedding we've been to since our own.&nbsp; We were supposed to go to two last weekend but circumstances wouldn't allow us to leave the island.&nbsp; Erik and I found ourselves stealing glances, remembering and reliving the extreme happiness of our day.&nbsp; It was our own 3 month anniversary.&nbsp; Just like with our own wedding, I ended up sick the next day and now Erik is as well.&nbsp; Too weary to travel, we put off returning to Newport one more day.&nbsp; Can't say I mind.&nbsp; Rochester has never been so beautiful to me.&nbsp; Everything is in bloom, the yards are all nice and green.&nbsp; We went to the spot with Susan and didn't have to weave in and out of the tourist crowds to get chai.&nbsp; I miss my family the most, but I miss the mall, wegmans, the movie theaters, walking downtown, blading on the canal, getting ice cream at Lickety Splits...all that jazz :)&nbsp; We've agreed to look into moving back after Erik finishes his masters.&nbsp; Until then, we're moving to Dartmouth beginning of September. &nbsp; That's all for the weekend's news.&nbsp; See you next time.

        I noticed today how everything in the human body contracts.&nbsp; Our heart contracts, our blood vessels contract, our intestines contract, our muscles contract, our pupils contract our stomachs contract... I could go on.&nbsp; I'm trying to think how this can be related to something bigger...like how stars are born...      The contraction of forming stars raises the internal temperature, finally to the point of ignition of hydrogen fusion. Gravity would like to make the star as small as possible, but the fusion reactions stabilize it and keep it from contracting any further.       The entire universe was born by expansion and contraction and continues to pulse.&nbsp; When stars die their dust rained down and formed the planets and elements (calcium for one) that are part of us.&nbsp; We are stardust.&nbsp; We are all made of stars.&nbsp; I can't get over how&nbsp;the world&nbsp;is just one huge constant metaphor for rebirth.&nbsp; "It is in dying that we are born."   Well that's enough meditation for tonight...Coming up in the weekend's news: Jenn and Erik travel to Rochester to see Jenn's childhood friend and neighbor tie the knot.&nbsp; See you next time.

       Life is kinda funny... It's like we forget it's there, it's just assumed like the water glasses the waitress brings out with your soda or margarita.  And then you knock it over with your elbow and the water spills within a second and suddenly you want another one.  Here's a poem I wrote about the beach:  A New Yorker Among islanders I approach the beach  Ill-equipped  A much meaner sun Attacks my fair skin Armies of sand Invade every crevice  I sneer at red seaweed That wraps itself around my ankles And spit out the salt That accosts my tongue  An outsider Among islanders I press my ear to the sand And hear the echo of my heart  This is Jenny signing off.  Thank you for listening.

      But you'd never know it. The jazz festival brought in a ton of tourists this weekend and Thames Street is flooded with people. Thankfully we were away from it all day in Boston. The shopping there is absolutely ridiculous. I was on a quest for a cool lamp for our new living room but the only one I found was of course out of stock. The weekend has been low key and amusing. We were supposed to play poker tonight but we were just too tired. Our poker games end up lasting till 3 or 4am and we'd rather be home when the bad weather hits, not on the road. We have to go to a baptism tomorrow anyway so it would be nice to actually get some sleep for a change. I was just looking at pictures of Charley's aftermath on weather.com. How terrible. Everything you own, everything you work so hard for just be gone with a few kicks of wind. I think nature humbles us, and gives us a new respect for frugality. It made me think of Ecclesiastes when he talked about how everything was meaningless...   "Vanity of vanities! All is vanity." What advantage does man have in all his work Which he does under the sun? A generation goes and a generation comes, But the earth remains forever. Also, the sun rises and the sun sets; And hastening to its place it rises there again. Blowing toward the south, Then turning toward the north, The wind continues swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns.   Ecclesiastes is one of my favorites, I hadn't thought of it in forever until today. Maybe I should read it. I had it memorized once for a class but how quickly one forgets! It's rather odd to me that fall fast approacheth yet I'm not going back to school. It was great when I was done in December and just didn't go back after Christmas but fall is back-to-school season and I'm no longer a part of the school supplies crowd. Maybe since Erik is going back I'll take him shopping and make sure he gets some nice crisp pencils and 200 sheets of college ruled paper. He better get a few new articles of clothing too. Him and Jon are going to start to train for their various local races. I guess the first one is Newport Mansions 5k. They've inspired me to get my ass into shape so everytime they run I'm going to work out and maybe someday I'll even get back into running myself. But I won't hold my breath :) Maybe if I write to Dr. Phil he'll send me a cross-trainer machine! ha. It's time to relax and spend some quality time with Erik. Golen Out.

      Ten at night on a Sunday and people just never GO HOME!  LEAVE!  It's past your children's bed times!  We stayed inside all day today which was the perfect way to unwind after being wound so tight.  Sometimes a full night of sleep isn't enough for the soul.  It needs stillness.  I've been thinking a lot about the soul lately.  The word gets thrown around a lot in many circles.  Trite as it is, to cut and paste dictionary definitons, I'm going to do it because I'm intrigued by its variance in meaning.   Some Soul Meanings:    The animating and vital principle in humans, credited with the faculties of thought, action, and emotion and often conceived as an immaterial entity.     The spiritual nature of humans, regarded as immortal, separable from the body at death, and susceptible to happiness or misery in a future state.     The central or integral part; the vital core     A person's emotional or moral nature      Recent events have led to me new levels of gratitude and respect.  So much crap happens in a day and at the end of it when I'm left standing I just feel like saying Thank You and yet, I'm not quite sure where it should be directed.  To some black void in the sky?   To God, to the earth, to the guy that scans my groceries...?  For tonight I'll send it out into the endless labrynth of the internet, and let it fall upon anyone that crosses paths with my blog :)  Thank You.  And Goodnight.

      I decided we should go on a vacation.  Now that I have plenty of time to sit at my desk and work and plan things, I religiously open up my planner and attempt to plan out all my time off.  For our next vacation we considered going to Florida but we were just there for our honeymoon and I've never been to Florida without being in Disney World so I really don't want to ruin the magic for myself!  (Yes, I know I'm a dork) We both really want to go to Vegas but to do it the way we want requires us to put it off till next year.  We then considered Atlantic City but were told by multiple people that it's ghetto so that is out.  My mom suggested this gorgeous place in Saratoga called the Sagamore but that's more of a spa get-away which only really appeals to one of us...so I guess we'll wait 'till next year and go to Vegas.  Enough of that mumbo-jumbo.  It's been a nice weekend.  We saw the Village.  For Erik it was a let down but for me it was a pleasant surprise.  I completely bought into the marketing scheme but was actually quite intrigued with the moral conflicts!   My first fondant birthday cake was a success.  I do so love to bake!  Kendra's surprise party was today and then we all played poker.  Boze's parties are always a pleasure.  Always a lot of people  and a lot of fun, people never want to leave and end up staying for like 12 hours.  That's one thing I'll miss about Newport.  We've had some fun parties here, despite any parking difficulties.  It was always fun to go down to Via Via at 1:45am and see the amazing spectacle of skanks and drunks parading around, basking in their own stupidity.  I'll never forget when me, Susan, Jim, Olaf and I think someone else was there on our roof talking to the people walking by.  Especially when we got the brody pony girls to eat that guy's pizza while he went to take a piss in the parking lot.  But our parties will be even better now that we'll live in Dartmouth and everyone lives within a 5 mile radius!  My first few weddings are booked.  It would be nice to get to the point where all I do is my photography but until then, work drags on.  Hey, at least I get my own holiday.  Administrative Assistant's Day is April 27th!  Beat that!  Thanks for tuning into my weekend update.
