      In the past 2 1/2 weeks I've slept by myself in my own bed 3 times. From the 2nd to the 5th of June, Melanie McDonald, my best friend from elementary school, stayed with us; it was cool to see her for the first time in a long time. She really grew up. (But I guess I did too.) The Saturday that she left, my mom and I went to the airport to pick up another old best friend from pre-school. I hadn't seen Lindsey in 12 years, it was so weird, but neat. It was like having a stranger stay with me and being forced to get to know her. It wasn't like that was a bad thing, because we were both just really goofy and had fun watching like 8 movies while she was here (including Shrek 2.) After she left, I slept in my bed by myself for 2 nights. That Sunday night on the 13th, I left for church camp to Panama City. Sleeping on a bus has to be on the bottom of my favorite things to do list. But it was definitely worth it. I heard a lot of things I needed to hear while I was there, and worshiped God like I had never worshiped before. It was by far the best feeling I have ever felt. I'm glad to be home now, and it seems like I couldn't be any lazier than I have been for the past two days, but I can think of a few ways. Now I have to search for a job. I'm definitely not prepared for it, but I have to do it. :P  Mark wants to check his e-mail before he goes to sleep. Maybe I'll have fun this summer? That is definitely on my list of goals to achieve. I've been realizing that I am probably one of the most judgemental people I know. I hate it. I care what others think too much. I stress myself by worrying whether or not they're having a good time, worrying that they'll think I'm boring compared to other people. At the same time my mind is judging them, sort of making things up about them. It decides what I think about that person, and it sticks. It's hard to change it. That is also based on things I have heard about that person. I'm pretty sure I judge myself too much... I don't think I know exactly how self-centered I am. (But of course no one really does.) I drive myself nuts. Can sleep make these thoughts go away? Hopefully.

       Like my mom's   hatred for cooking.  When i was a kid, there was a meal on the table every night.  Now, it's only when she wants something in particular.  When my dad goes out of town, it's time for us to fend for ourselves.  I hate fastfood! I love sit-down dinners! That's something I really miss about Chad's family.  His mom loved to cook, and fortunately enough for me, I love to eat. And it was good food...I don't think I ever ate the same thing twice over there.  Anyway, I'm gonna go try to make it easier on my mom and help her out with the homemade hamburgers and french fries.

       i don't want to go back to school, even though this year i can finally drive.  i am excited about that!  the main good thing about my classes is that my friends will be in them, and they are hard, so i should be more prepared for college.  i don't know why people think it's such a good idea to take easy classes your senior year.  colleges don't look at applications and ask themselves, "okay, did they take the easiest blowoff classes they could?" who would want to take easy classes anyway? you get stuck with all the stupid people, probably asking you to give them the answers all the time, unless you are stupid too.  i don't wanna think about school anymore....i still have 2 weeks before i have to.

      I was reminded just now of the time Ashley and I drove to Kemah with the windows down, and Taking Back Sunday blaring. That was really fun, but I'm pretty sure my hearing wasn't as good for a few months afterwards.   Right now I'm chatting to a few people and updating my July calendar. I made it because there are so many birthdays and I want to visit Alabama, so I need things to be clear.  Last night I spent at Megan and Kelsie's house with Stephanie too, and it was so fun. We watched Monster, which was surprisingly disgusting, but holy crap Charlize Theron is the greatest actress ever. Never be fooled by the ugliness she is able to portray in the movie, she is the most beautiful actress in Hollywood. Megan and I tried to watch The Majestic, but we got sleepy. Today we ate Chick-fil-A, bought Megan a strobe light, watched the "Outback Jack" episode Kelsie taped from the night before, got drinks from Sonic, and went to church. Oh yeah, we also shot off a few fireworks. I'm glad they had a lot of bottle rockets, because I didn't get to do any of those on the 4th. My 4th of July was pretty fun. I wanted to have a lot of people over for a huge water balloon war, but due to short notice a lot of people already had plans, or they had to spend it with their family. We still had a lot of fun. Afterwards we went to Whataburger. Later that evening, I went with Jessica, Tyson, Mallory, and Aaron to Shanna's house to watch the firework show. We were so close to the show, it was awesome. Then we hung out with the people who were there for a little while; I can only think of a couple who weren't from our church. They all left to go to someone's house, but Tyson was talking on his cellphone with Kelsie. So I, naturally, told him I needed something from his car, and Jess and I took the car on a short joyride around the neighborhood to relieve ourselves from the small party left on Shanna's street that was lacking in the enjoyment department. (Sorry, but that party is Mallory and Aaron.) After we got him going, we made Tyson buy us drinks from Sonic, and then headed for his house to hang out for an hour. I played DDR for the first time, it was a pretty fun game. It wasn't as hard once I really acted like I was dancing, rather than trying to step on the buttons when the flashing arrow hit the other arrow. I plan to get better at it. The day before, on Saturday, I applied for employment at JCPenney's and Target. I also got applications from Hobby Lobby and Chick-fil-A. I really want to be a hostess at Red Lobster or somewhere, though. I think hostessing (wc?) would be a much better starter job for me.  Right now I'm really hoping that I can get to Alabama before the end of July.  I'm going to bed now. Goodnight!

       School starts tomorrow.  I'm elated...!  I can't wait to see everyone.  It's a 50/50 on the fact that it's our last year though... I like the seniority, but I don't like knowing that at the end of the school year, I'll hardly see any of these people again, and that after this year is COLLEGE!  oh well... I went shopping with Mark today.  We both wanted to get some shoes, but couldn't find the ones we want.  I got to talk to my friend from Auburn today! It was so cool. I've known this girl since I was in first grade, and I got an e-mail from her today.  She's going to AU this year.  What a crazy thought... I made my senior shirt and decorated my car tonight.  I'm so happy about tomorrow :) It's going to be great...

       Zane left yesterday :\ I didn't think I would cry... but I finally did when I got home. I really hope I meet more guys like him, he's really a great one. I gave him a "Thank You" card, and when he was kinda telling everyone bye, he came up to me and told me what an amazing time he had getting to know me, and I said a lot of the same kinda thing on the card I gave him. Well today I read a lot, I only have 1 chapter (110 pages out of 620) left in A Prayer for Owen Meany. I recommend it, it's an interesting and enjoyable book. At 5 I went to a Girl's Retreat meeting. It's going to be so fun :D Our commercial appeared at church yesterday, and the whole congregation was cracking up. The commercial mocked the Six Flags one, it was so funny cus we had someone do the dance too. I'm pretty sure I wanna get some Roos (shoes.) Well now I'm kinda hungry, so I'm gonna see what's for supper.

        I can't wait for school to start. I just need people to take up my time, instead of summer. I'm so tired of feeling unwanted. If I could just fill up my time with things to do, I wouldn't have to think about the fact that I'm bad at conversation, and that I don't have many of them with the people I want to. I'm so sick of this! My family is not interacting! The only thing going on is between me and my mom... painting a stupid floor! And my friends are running...forever. I'm the only kid out of four in my family who isn't gone somewhere right now. Ross is in Alabama with his friends... at Gulf Shores. Amy is in Oklahama with Johnathan and Zach. Mark is in San Antonio with... you guessed it, Sara. (A certain amount of time went by...)   I just    had a good conversation with Laura T. We talked about being shy and starting conversations...and changing yourself with who you are around...and the pressure of being someone in front of certain people...I don't like feeling like I need to interpret what people want from me. It's like I'm actually trying too hard to please, which sucks, because I don't like it when people are obviously like that, they seem so fake. I don't want to think of myself as fake...I feel like I've taken all the things I love and believe about everything from the world... It makes me feel like a thief, like I'm not real in some way. Maybe I'm not?

       Today I woke up at 8:30, went to the training thing at BCS for church, and after that, I went shopping with Lena, Ross's girlfriend (he's out of town.) It was awesome. We spent like an hour and a half in American Eagle, and I got the perfect pair of jeans, and a cute brown shirt. After that I got another perfect pair of jeans from Dillard's, and then a cute long sleeve shirt at Penney's. I love new clothes...they make me so happy :D I still need a pair of shoes. I think I'm going to get some Puma's, I love the colors, and they look comfortable. Megan has like 6 pairs! I'm at  urlLink www.puma.com  right now. While Lena and I were at Penney's, a crazy kid sprinted out, yelling, right in front of Lena and she screamed, it caught her off guard, it was hilarious. We had so much fun! Okay, my dad's making hot  JUMBALAYA , and I'm excited &amp; hungry, so I'm out.   :D

       Well last night was full of much better sleep than the night before, and it was uninterrupted- except for when Ross left. The day before yesterday I had really bad allergies, so when I was trying to go to sleep my face was hurting really bad, especially around my jaw. My whole body was aching...it took me forever to go to sleep. When I finally was asleep, I had a strange nightmare... a drunk guy was in it and I was driving down 2004, it was scary. I woke up at 4:44 all hot and sweaty, I was scared there was some weird drunk guy in my room. There was a tent over my bed (which I took down last night,) that made my room even more scary.  I got up, used the bathroom, and put some water on my face; I felt awful. It took me a few minutes to fall back asleep; I even turned my lamp and the radio on. I had two more dreams, both were also weird, and one involved a couple of bears trying to eat me! How can anyone sleep during such a stressful dream? I woke up at 9:30, and my jaw was still hurting really bad. I brushed my teeth and went downstairs, took some ibuprofen, and went to my mom's room. She gave me an antibiotic, and I felt much better when I woke up 3 hours later. Last night, I talked to Jose until 2:30 or so, and without much hope for a goodnights rest, I went to bed, and slept beautifully. I feel much better today, and my nose is still a little stuffy, but I haven't sneezed since the other day. Today, I went with my mom to Lowe's and Home Depot to get paint for the sunroom floor. I picked out the color, and it's going to be beautiful. We also got a sponge and some accent colors to make it interesting. Tonight I'm going to BCS for a meeting about working with the youth at church, and again tomorrow morning. I can't wait until shopping tomorrow! I'm excited about it...I need pants, shoes, and running shorts. Jose's going to give me piano lessons on Tuesdays... I'm excited about that too. :D

       Man I had such a bad day.  Thank goodness it just picked up.. dinner's almost ready, and it's pork chops.  This week has been sucking, because I've realized how little time I get to spend with my brothers. Ross has a girlfriend, who he spends every waking moment with. We usually joke about it, but lately it just makes me feel like I'm missing out. Mark too, with Sara. It's the same way. And my sister Amy has a boyfriend, a job, and they're both working on their house constantly.  I practically never see her. My dad is always at work, or when he's home he's watching TV/ in a bad mood because of work, or sleeping. My mom...is usually pretty busy doing errands, sleeping, or working on the sunroom floor. Me. I just feel so unwanted lately, except for church stuff. It makes me excited for school starting. I got to page 337 on Owen Meany today. I hope I can get completely done by Friday. As for me never having anything really important to do, I thought for a second that I could go with my dad to his work, and then remembered that I'm the dainty one who can never do any real work. I also spilled my root beer earlier taking the cap off. That's it.

       Subject : Regarding AP Assignment I need to know where you stand regarding your reading/questions.  If you did not receive copies of the questions, please email me immediately. Mr. Weiss      :( I don't wannnaaaaaaa...I really like the book I'm reading now, and I just know that if I start that one, my mind will go *boom!* Especially because it looks really boring. But hey, I guess you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. (Sorry, that was dumb.)  Today was a pretty good day. The girls' retreat lead team filmed the commercial today, and I must say that I am no actress. I just can't wait until Sunday when we can see it! It's gonna be great. I've been talking to a guy from Alaska on MySpace, which is a friend network thingy. I saw that he was atheist, and I was just interested in understanding him, so I added him as one of my friends. We've sent a few e-mails back and forth, and I am pretty sure I understand him as much as I want to. I'm pretty sure he's one of those that is the way he is because he doesn't want to agree with anyone else. He wants to be unhappy. He wants to kill himself, because he thinks it's a beautiful thing. I know you're thinking, "Wow, Lisa, why would you talk to him after hearing that?" I could never do that... stop talking to someone just because of all that. And if they live in Alaska, that's far enough away for me. And he doesn't make me feel bad, he doesn't make me doubt my beliefs. So, why not? Okay, I guess I need to read :P I wonder if I could do it all in one day? Maybe... tomorrow? Tyson wants to see The Village with me tomorrow night, and I really want to see it to.  Right now I'm listening to Celebrity Jeopardy, and ....What is Light Urple? I'm gonna go. Bye Bye

       I finally spoke at High Pointe. It really wasn't that bad. Actually, when I got to sit down, I thought, "That was it? I wanna do it again!" So if I get the chance again, I'll know it isn't that bad. I really think God did something in me, because I didn't look nervous (so I hear.) I asked Mary if I could not wear shoes, and she said not to. At the last minute, I decided it would be better if I did, but I wasn't wearing them because I don't like wearing shoes when I'm sitting down (I really don't like them in general,) so when she told me to go up there, I forgot them. I think it was for the best though. I didn't want to wear them anyway. While I was speaking, my tongue got tied and I made a "pleh" sound to get it straightened out... People laughed. I got so many people coming up to me afterwards telling me that I did so good, which made me feel really good about it. Blair came up to me and said she teared up a little, which I was glad to hear, because I didn't think that my testimonial could make anyone feel anything. Anyway, enough about that. After High Pointe, Zane asked me if I was going to BCS to play "volleyball," and I said yes, and smiled very big, but I don't think he noticed. It was really a party for his birthday that was Friday. He was surprised, and all dressed and ready to play. It was Shanna's idea to get him a guitar, which was suuuch a good idea. The church bought it, and a lot of people signed the case, but I didn't get to. Maybe sometime this week. I really wish Zane didn't have to leave, he is such a great Christian guy. I know plenty of Christian guys, but not all that many that have a heart that reflects so much of God. He leaves next Sunday :\ Tomorrow (well today) I am going to the church again to film the Girls' retreat commercial. It's going to be good, we are using the Six-Flags commercial music. Ahh this is long, and I want to talk to Jose, and go to bed at the same time, so I'm off.
