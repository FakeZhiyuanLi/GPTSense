      If we want Lamar Hunt to hold his own trophy in February... more importantly, if we want him holding the Lombardi 2 weeks after, there's certain things that have to be done. Have to. No question. We're talking, if these things don't happen, the Chiefs don't even win the division.  Here goes...  -Get a new RT (probably Welbourne or Bober) that can hold his own. He doesn't have to be a Pro Bowler. He can even be the weak link. But it's essential that he is the strongest weak link in the NFL.  -Maintain good field possession. Last year was insane. Between Dante Hall's returns and the aftermath of kicking away from Dante Hall, the Chiefs generally started at the 35. If we can do that again this year, the offense will be even better. Mark my words.  -The most important one... the defense must finish ranked -- 15th? Nope. 20th? Nope. 25th? It'd be nice. 30th? Now we're talking. Listen closely... when you have 5 potential Hall of Famers in your offense, you do not need a defense. The defense last year went above and beyond the call of duty when they dragged the offense along to 9-0. If more than just Warfield and Barber had shown up in the post-season, we would have won it all.&nbsp;Stop laughing,&nbsp;I'm not joking. If you have 5-7 average defensive players (which we have, as well as 2 great ones), you can accomodate the best offense in the history of the NFL. Gunther, in his entire NFL coaching career, has always had horrible offenses to work with. He's been forced to generate turnovers, score defensive points, and shut down opposing offenses. Now the tables are turned. If he can figure out that with our offense, it actually works against you to be aggressive, we've got Mr. Lombardi already.  Thoughts? Comments? Violent Rebuttals? COMMENT!

        Dolphins might want a refund without the recipt; Dolphins might be "better without (Williams)"    The possibility to  urlLink ask Williams for a refund  is very likely. Ricky says that  urlLink Miami might be in better shape  without him.  Garth's Response: to #1 -- as well he should give back the money; to #2 -- yes, and the Lions have done so well without Barry Sanders.

      This I still cannot believe or understand, but there are some strong indications that whomever had Ricky Williams pegged as a keeper RB in their Fantasy Football league might have just lost their entire season. It appears that Ricky has been frustrated by the constraints of being a professional football player, and is seeking to get on with his life in other arenas. Considering the fact that he has made a lot of money from the NFL, his financial future is comfortable to say the least. If this is how he really feels, my thoughts are more power to him. I am not sure if this is related to stress of having 24/7 media attention on him, especially since the New Orleans Saints and Mike Ditka traded away all of their draft picks to acquire him upon entering the NFL. I am also reminded of Barry Sanders' early retirement from the game. For now, check out this report from ESPN  urlLink LINK , and stay tuned to see if Ricky changes his mind.

         Every rookie under contract   I was worried about them. Really, I was. I mean, I knew they would be good this year. Maybe even next.&nbsp;The year after? Perhaps.&nbsp;But Willie Roaf's knees won't hold out forever. Scott Boras (Carlos Beltran, and - more importantly - Tony Gonzalez' agent) is going to get antsy. Trent Green and Priest Holmes combined are 5 years away from eating cheap at Denny's.&nbsp;Will Shield's retirement is nigh.&nbsp;There's not many Chiefs with a future in this organization past 2010, if any. But the league's second best GM, Carl Peterson, has again made improvement. You see, in world record time, Peterson was able to urlLink   sign every&nbsp;2004 NFL Chiefs&nbsp;draft pick before Training Camp  .  In an avoidal of a second episode of "When Unsigned Rookies Attack" (see: Sims breaking his leg after holding out), Carl Peterson has everyone under contract in time for camp... And now I'm not so worried about the future. Oh, sure, we've still got a lot of aging Pro Bowlers in their waning years,&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;uncertainty past the next 3 or 4 years,&nbsp;but now we've got a base to build our team around for the next 15 years. If you can't get excited about an entire team being under contract (no veteran is holding out, to my knowledge, either) and having that kind of team-first attitude, you can't get excited about football. Or life. Or anything.  Man, I'm stoked. This season's gonna be a hell of a schedule. When you're #1, you have to play a #1 schedule. And our warriors of red are no #2.

        Ex-Tennessee Titan is now more popularly known as a current Dallas Cowboy    The Dallas Cowboys and FA RB Eddie George have  urlLink agreed to a 1-year contract , sources say. The 1-year deal incorporates a $1.5 mil. Signing bonus and a base salary of just over $600,000.  Wait a minute. There had better be good bonuses for George, because quick mental math here says that George refused a $1.5 mil base salary with the Titans, and demanded at least $3, 3.5, or 4 mil... but then took a $2 mil. deal with the Cowboys. Hmm...

         Ex-Tennessee Titan thinks he can make it big elsewhere     In a fascinating article by ESPN's senior NFL writer, Len Pasquarelli, there are  urlLink many&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;comparisons between George and Kansas City's own Priest Holmes . Among them: Holmes has had, by far, the most successful "second campaign" with another team; that George's hopes of being like Holmes are ridiculous:  "Holmes has averaged 1,530 rushing yards and 68.7 receptions since moving from Baltimore to Kansas City in 2001. In his career year in both categories, the 2000 season, George ran for 1,509 yards and posted 50 catches...&nbsp;Notable is that Holmes is only two weeks younger than George, but has 48 percent fewer career carries."   Also, Pasquarelli adds the Oakland Raiders' name into the hat for George's drawing. All I have to say is this: if Denver hadn't have gotten stupid and traded Clinton Portis away (even stupider than the BoSox selling Babe Ruth, in my opinion) and the Seahawks were still in our division, the AFC West's RB Core would look like this: Holmes, Alexander, Portis, Tomlinson, George...   Wow.

        Actually, Tagliabue Through 2007, but I liked 2002 - it ryhmed       &nbsp;  It was announced Monday that Paul Tagliabue, NFL Commissioner of 15 years,  urlLink will make it 3 more . It's about time! In a  unanimous  decision, one of the NFL's most successful Commishes got another vote of confidence from the NFL's owners. And why not? Citing the article from ESPN (above):  "Tagliabue's ability to generate television revenues and get cities to build or renovate stadiums, has made him popular with everyone&nbsp;-- in the 15 years he's been commissioner, 21 of the 32 teams either have built new facilities or renovated older ones and the $17.6 billion television contract that expires after next season is the biggest in sports history."   Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney shared the feeling from the NFL owners about the Commish:  "He's taken the league to a  new level . The television situation is  phenomenal , the relationship with the players union is  great . We're entering an important period and  we want him to continue to lead us through it.  It's obvious what we think of him."  Quite unlike Commissioner Bud Selig over there in MLB-world, I love Mr. Tagliabue. His impact on the NFL has been nothing but positive. And with the exception of the NHL, the NFL might be the most parity-drenched league around. That's just awesome. A small market hero, Tagliabue has set an example of how a league should be run for Selig, time and time again. Most of MLB's problems reside in revenue sharing (which has a lot to do with TV contracts), and parity (no question Commissioner Tagliabue is someone to learn from). If the world's major leagues could look to Mr. Tagliabue for an example, the sports world would be a better one.  So I leave you with this thought -- Tagliabue has been commissioner now for 80% of his term (thus far) -- what great suprises await us in the future?

         DT is under contract before training camp      A bit of good news for the Kansas City Chiefs' defense - first pick of the 2004 NFL&nbsp;Draft for the Chiefs, DT&nbsp;Junior Siavii,   urlLink  was signed today    (July 21st). Unlike former first-round pick, DT Ryan Sims, Siavii will not hold out and will get all pre-season work in. Skipping work certainly&nbsp;didn't help Sims (broken leg, missed season) in his rookie, so it's a positive thing to see Siavii under contract this early. One certainly hopes Siavii can do what Sims has done for the Chiefs in his first several years, which I think he's capable of doing. One thing to keep in mind when comparing Sims and Siavii (and I'll put money on that the KC Star will constantly make references between the two) is that Sims is a true first-rounder, while the Chiefs traded down a time or two to get Siavii in the second round. Regardless, D.C. Gunther Cunningham tends to specialize in QB pressure and linebacking. If the Chiefs are successful in both of these aspects, Siavii could have all the room to grow and flourish in his rookie or sophomore year. Like Sims, it will be a treat to watch Siavii grow and play for the mighty Chiefs.  &nbsp;

         Tampa Bay, Dallas, and (hometown) Philadelphia remain favorites to pick him up    Well, it happened.  urlLink Eddie George was released by the Tennessee Titans  on Wednesday. George wanted $4.25 mil. The Titans wanted $1.5 mil. It just didn't work.  However, now that the sad part is over, the fun part begins -- SPECULATION!  Where will he end up?   Well, the way I see it, one of two things will happen, both centering around the thought that George's talent and ability are declining. If George believes that his talent is indeed in regression, he will go to the Eagles. Donovan McNabb and Terrell Owens can take off more than enough pressure for George to have a successful season. If, however, George ignores age and declining ability (which I would wager he will), he will want to be "the man." It's a semi-selfish, semi-heroic thing to do. If this is the case, I would wager he would desire going to the Bucs. While Gruden is "the man" off the field, there are no big names still in Tampa. He would be the one and only weapon of the Buccaneers' offense. In Dallas, the Tuna is "the man" both off and on the field. Also, the young secondary has a special identity with the Cowboys.  Another interesting twist in who will win the Eddie George Lottery involves location. Most players, especially older ones, like to play close to home. It's easier for&nbsp;them,&nbsp;I think. It would not be suprising to see him return to Texas to play for the Cowboys if he still has ties with Houston. If his heart belongs in Tennessee, then Tampa might be the best choice for him. And lastly, if&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;his family still resides in Philadelphia, the Eagles might be a shoo-in.  In deciding where George will go, I think you have to look at loyalty/location, and his ability and his belief in it.

        Tennessee Titan desires a move    &nbsp;   Eddie George has announced that his name is similiar to a state in the southeast United States and a country in Asia. Well, not really. Instead, George announced that  urlLink he wants to be released  from the Tennessee Titans' roster. George's agent, Lamont Smith, and the Tennessee front office have unsuccessfully been trying to restructure George's contract, as the Titans are in  urlLink serious cap room trouble &nbsp;and want to sign all of their rookies. They have already lost one huge name as a "Cap Casualty" (Jevon Kearse), and, according to George, are about to lose one more. George announced his request to be released on the Dan Patrick Show, and you can hear it  urlLink here  (click on "listen" under ESPN media on the right hand side).   When discussing where he'd like to go next, George has likely singled out teams that are "on the brink of possibily winning a Super Bowl." The Buccaneers, Cowboys, and Eagles (where Kearse went) are atop his short list of candidates. All three teams listed&nbsp;are powerhouse defensive teams and a solid RB like George could push them over the top.   &nbsp;

       Well, here's the other end of the Pre-Season rankings:    Key Additions: None Key Losses: None [New defensive coordinator, Gunther Cunningham]  RDE:  Eric Hicks  - once a sought-after commodity in the KC circle, Hicks has shown promise, but shown lackluster ability, too. He has the speed to get to the QB, but he can't seem to shed blocks well enough. He certainly is not a big enough threat to recieve constant double-teams taking pressure off the blitzing LBs and DTs.&nbsp;Hicks is probably the only Chiefs defender&nbsp;who will&nbsp;improve considerably under Gunther, but how much remains to be seen. NFL RDE Ranking - 30th in NFL Will Cunningham help? Likely. &nbsp; NT:  &nbsp;Ryan Sims  - after holding out and having an all-around bad rookie year following a leg break&nbsp;2 years ago, last year Sims did vastly better. He generally takes a double-team (but that could be attributed to lack of talent around him), but still gives pocket pressure. His speed is acceptable, as is his run stopping, but some other talent in the D-line could make Sims a Pro Bowl nominee. NFL NT Ranking - 14th in NFL Will Cunningham help? Probably, but to what degree? Unknown. &nbsp; LDT:  John Browning  - Browning's speciality here is his flexibility. Starting at end and tackle for the Chiefs, Browning is a capable gap-filler, and can occaisionally steal a double team. His pocket penitration is below average, but his speed is one of the fastest for a starting tackle. If Browning can figure out how to get penetration, he has the agility and quicks to get some sacks. NFL LDT Ranking - 28th in NFL Will Cunningham help? Only if Cunningham can pay off every C and RG of the opposition to let ol'&nbsp;John-John in the pocket on 10% of the plays. &nbsp; LDE:  Vonnie Holliday  - Coming from Green Bay, Holliday had a lot of expectations. He fufilled them in the first game, getting his one and only sack of the year. He and his defensive comrades were inexplicably carrying the Chiefs' dragging offense for the first 9 games (the 9-0 thing, remember?). Then even harder to explain, Holliday and Co. just started sucking. Holliday was one of the hardest fallers. Luckily, the Chiefs offense picked up the slack now and carried them to the playoffs. But it wasn't enough to save Vonnie. A grizzled vet, Holliday was a solid off-season pick-up for 2003, but will have to improve in order to make an impact, let alone remain a starter. NFL LDF Ranking - 21st in NFL Will Cunningham help? Not likely. &nbsp; ROLB:  Shawn Barber  - Just like Holliday, Barber was brought in to shore the Chiefs' last-place defense. And he did so to first half of the season. Then he disappeared in tackles counts, sack counts, and QB-pressure counts. He didn't show up until the Colts playoff game, where he and Warfield were the only defenders to show up. He is a talented linebacker, but must play like the first half of the '03 campaign to make Cunningham's job easier. An interesting side note: Shawn is cousin to Tiki (NY RB)&nbsp;and Ronde (TB CB)&nbsp;Barber, the two more well-known Barber's in all of the Visa commercials. NFL ROLB Rankings - 14th in NFL Will Cunningham help? Not likely, other than vicariously through the other defenders' improved play (allowing him many more sacks). &nbsp; MLB:  Mike Maslowski  - a hard-hitting presence while the defense was surging, Maslowski suffered a serious injury (memory doesn't serve on this one) and was out for 40-50% of the season. Lacking speed and smarts, "Mad Dog" started his career as a special teams specialist, and probably has the talent to just stay there. However, in need of a MLB, they turned to Mike and he responded fairly well. If anyone can shore his below-average audibling and linebacking, it will be Gunther. However, it will likely take an act of jihad to get Maslowski into gear. Expect 2nd-year Kawika Mitchell to see a lot of playing time if Mike is slow coming out of the gates. NFL MLB Rankings - 25th in NFL Will Cunningham help? If Gunther can break through to him, Mike will be a top 10 MLB. But if not, expect him to drop even further into mediocrity. &nbsp; LOLB:  Scott Fujita  - having heard him speak at a players meeting (my high school), it's obvious Fujita is smart. He was accepted into Ivy League on football AND academic scholarships. From southern California, the ol' nog-nog isn't the only thing strong on Fujita. Adopted by a Japanese family (thus the odd celebration after a sack, or the odd last name for a white kid from California), Fujita is exceptionally fast, and can stop plays from happening in the backfield. It's my hope that Fujita can improve vastly (which would be saying a lot) if the D-line can take some pressure off of him. One of the Chiefs' bright young spots, Fujita has the play-making ability and pass coverage&nbsp;to overcome his below-average tackling. NFL LOLB Rankings - 13th in NFL Will Cunningham help? See ROLB&nbsp;Shawn Barber &nbsp; LCB:  Eric Warfield  - a personal favorite of mine, and a favorite hate-target of the media, it's undisputed that Warfield has potential. Still young, Warfield has the raw talent to be a Top 5 cornerback in his career. I had an oppertunity to watch him first-hand against one of the game's very best WRs, Marvin Harrison, in the Colts-Chiefs game&nbsp;and basically shut&nbsp;Harrison down. He has the speed to be a upper-tier cornerback, and does a very good job at zoning the media (and thus, negative fans) out and focusing on his playing. He isn't considered a "shut-down" CB, but with some work and improvement, could be so soon. NFL LCB Rankings - 7th in NFL Will Cunningham help? See ROLB Shawn Barber &amp; LOLB Fujita -- needs QB pressure to help him as&nbsp;Cunningham likes bump-and-run&nbsp;one-on-one coverage with his CBs. &nbsp; RCB:  Dexter McCleon  - Brought in with the Barber / Holliday generation of oldies helping newbies, McCleon provided solid coverage all year long. Although not what the Chiefs' staff wanted or expected, McCleon did an "allright" job, but has room to improve. Enter Gunther. McCleon is one of those guys Cunningham can make or break, but it all depends on if McCleon can keep up with the faster guys or crisper route-runners. NFL RCB - 23rd in NFL Will Cunningham help? If he doesn't, McCleon could be benched soon. &nbsp; SS:  Greg Wesley  - Wesley, another younger guy, is in the same boat as LCB Warfield is in - if Cunningham can vastly shore up this defense (which, don't&nbsp;just accept that he will) Wesley could be a Pro Bowler. If he doesn't improve the D, his hard-hitting blitzing will help Cunningham's play calling, as the D-Coordinator likes to put pressure on the QBs. NFL SS - 17th in NFL Will Cunningham help? Maybe - either a BIG yes or a BIG no. &nbsp; FS:  Jerome Woods  - This is the way the Chiefs should be balling. Last year's sole defensive Pro Bowler (and very-rightly so), Woods broke his leg in the Pre-Season in 2003 and the effect was evident. When he came back in 2004, the Chiefs realized how much he helped. He is a hard-hitting FS that plays right into Gunther Cunningham's hand, and will probably pick up 5-10 sacks this season. His coverage leaves something to be desired, but the Chiefs will not likely use him in too many deep coverage schemes this season. A win-win: covers up the flaws of Woods, and magnifies the strengths. NFL FS - 5th in NFL Will Cunningham help? More like "Will Woods Help Cunningham?" - the answer: a resounding "yes." &nbsp; Well, there you go. If Cunningham can prove me wrong (I hope he can), the Chiefs will have a mediocre defense. Good for a #1 in the Power Rankings and an easy SB win. If he proves me right (I hope he doesn't), we'll be back in the same ol' boat and just hope that in this go-'round more defenders will step up to the plate in the post-season.

          Well, it's close enough to pre-season to start getting pumped. Red Friday will be here soon enough, so we, as Chiefs fans, must prepare ourselves for the grueling season before us. Regimens of increasing sitting time, good remarks for yelling at the pin-stripes, and maximum chip/dip consumption must be completed before proudly bearing #31, 58, 10, 88, or whatever you please. You're a Chiefs fan. The jersey-makers should be so lucky as to have the mighty business of you.     &nbsp;   Well, the Chiefs themselves have been putting their bodies through some intense training that many of us will never go through in our lives. And it's not even Training Camp yet.     &nbsp;   Let's go position by position, and rank entire units, to find out what we have here.     &nbsp;   Offense    Gained:&nbsp; Bober, Welbourne    Lost: Tait     &nbsp;    QB  -  Trent Green : a savvy pocket-passer, Green made it to the Pro Bowl last year after having a career season. Here's the thing - it wasn't a fluke. With improved recieving play, TE Gonzalez as always, and the best line in the NFL, Green could have an even better year. Look for smart, cool-under-pressure, and exciting play by Vermeil's long-lost son.     Overall NFL QB : 4th in NFL.     &nbsp;    RB  -  Priest Holmes : given a second chance, Preist proved Vermeil right. After being ditched by Baltimore for love child Jamal Lewis, Holmes found himself in need of a job. He never gave up on himself, and apparently, neither did Vermeil. In Holmes' 4th year at KC, he is poised to break a lot of records. Last season, Holmes had a career year, also, breaking the single-season rushing and all-purpose TD records convincingly. And that was with a bum hip. Holmes can run, block, and catch. Trent Green's dream. And now that Holmes is 100% and better than ever, there's talk&nbsp;from him about&nbsp;devouring his old records and making a push towards league MVP. It's not bragging when you can back it up. And look for #31 to back it up decisively.     Overall NFL RB : 1st in NFL.     &nbsp;

       So I was driving home from Lawrence, when Pops stops the tunes (some ZZ Top was playing) and says, all of a sudden, "hey, what's that song they always play after the Chiefs score a touchdown?"  "Uh... Rock and Roll (Pt. 2), by Gary Glitter, I think."  "Put it in."  So we put it in. Then it finally hit me. It's FOOTBALL SEASON. I've never felt so pumped to be a Chiefs fan in my life. Well, that's not entirely true. I was at the Chiefs / Colts Playoff Game last year and when Dante Hall returned that kick, that was... great. But this was excellent, too.  &nbsp;  I'm stoked to see the likes of Hall, Holmes, Richardson, Green, Gonzalez, Boerighter, Kennison, and Morton darting around, kicking some tail up and down the gridiron.  &nbsp;  I'm ready to watch Roaf, Waters, Weigmann, Shields, and Bober/RT-to-be-named dismantle, roll up, and toss aside the opposing D-line.  &nbsp;  Anywho...  &nbsp;  I'm hoping to see the Gunther-as-savior plan actually work, even though I still feel firing (forcing "retirement") and crucifying Greg Robinson was the worst possible thing to do. If Gunther can pull it off, I'll remain quiet and eat my own words. But when a 2-time SB winner can't squeeze blood out of a turnip, I have a hard time believing a 0-time SB winner can, either.  &nbsp;  Regardless, it'll be a great season.&nbsp;3 Nationally Televised Games (4 including pre-season). The season opener in Denver will be big (Sunday Night), and Oakland on Christmas (National TV, here, too) will be awesome, but the game I'm most looking forward to? The defending Super Bowl Champs, the New England Patriots. Monday Night Football. Arrowhead Stadium. SB Champs. MNF. Arrowhead. SB-MNF-KC. I'm pumped.I've looked at the schedule. Pessimistically, we'll be 11-5. Optimistically, we'll be 14-2.  &nbsp;  It's a great day for a football game.  &nbsp;  Chiefs fans, welcome back.

        Is the Pre-Season too long?    The topic comes up every year. It's debated over more than who should be president. Actually, it's not. But in my world it is. The Pre-Season -- too long? too short? too tall? too fat? too aerodynamic? what?  The rabid fans of NFL teams want the regular season, and they want it now. Supporters of the Pre-Season claim it gives the young players and rookies valuable game-time experience. But isn't that what training camp scrimmages are for?  My problem with pre-season is this: injuries. 2 years ago, the Chiefs defense was doomed to a horrific year as soon as Jerome Woods' leg broke. He wasn't expected back to camp ever again. A.K.A. a career-ender. Like all Chiefs, of course, Woods didn't know how to quit, but even still -- it was needless. He broke his leg in a game that will never be remembered as one of the classics. It will never be remembered as a season-defying game. It won't even be remembered by the long-winded record books. Why? It didn't count. He might as well have hit the leg with an axe in a Seahawks' locker room. (That did happen to Seattle's kicker, for those of you lagging behind.)  Exhibit B -- Dan Reeves got fired for it. The Falcons were done for the year because of it. Defenses of the NFC South were relieved to see it. Michael Vick's leg. It snapped. He was out for the year, as were the Atlanta Falcons. He actually returned before the season ended, but that didn't stop Atlanta's front office from firing head coach Dan Reeves. He was scrambling in the traditional Mike Vick style when a defender... well... caught up to him. One goofy-positioned tackle later, Mr. Vick was done for quite awhile.  I can see the point of pre-season, but there has to be a way to tone down the hitting. Make them like training camp scrimmages. No heavy contact, just pop and go. Heck, make it flag football. NFL players will have 16 weeks to painfully harm their bodies. They need no help with that.  Well, I'm done here. It wasn't well-put-together blog, it wasn't really thought out... I wrote it on a whim. Hooray whims!  COMMENT! What do YOU, the reader, think of the pre-season length? The degree to which it's played? Let your opinions be heard!

        Rookies, now more than ever, hold an ever-important place in the market.    In a land of dollars and cents, rookies were never before seen like this. Sure we had the can't-miss rookies. Guys like Edgerrin James (led league in rushing in  rookie  year), Ricky Williams, Ray Lewis. Those kinds of guys. However, this is getting out of hand.  Quite simply, rookies these days are asking for too much. Eli Manning just signed a mammoth deal with the Giants. Larry Fitzgerald did the same with the Cardnials. Even guys like Kellen Winslow, Jr. are holding out for bigger contracts. Hey, Kellen -- dig this: (a) you're a tight end. (b) you're a rookie. YOU HAVEN'T EARNED A PENNY YET. I don't like these big-money, long-term contracts and I think that (at least) 2 of the 3 guys I've mentioned will flop. Big time.  They won't be flops by talent standards. They can't say - I sucked worse than Ryan Leaf. But keep this in mind: Ryan Leaf never signed a mammoth deal. A pretty big one, yes, but Manning's latest masterpiece puts Leaf's to shame. Thus, if Manning or Fitzgerald or Winslow flop, they will be considered the biggest disappointments in NFL history, maybe sports history.  Mark the words that came out of my mouth.

        Williams back in the ring? Brown in Denver? Carter canned?     I apologize for my rash of not-posting. It's been well over 2 weeks since the last posting and I'd like to attribute that to (a) laziness, (b) summer homework, and (c) nothing happening.  However, that's all kind of changed.  Since training camps all over the nation have started, there has been some developments. First, we'll go with Ricky...  Ricky Williams announced to SI.com that if he returns in 2005, he will be an Oakland Raider. In other words, Chiefs fans, oh crap. The Raiders have been an joke for the last couple of years, and it appears to be getting worse, at least for this year. If Williams dawns the black and silver, they might be a much more interesting team to watch. And another personal comment: everyone says that Williams quit because of being caught with drugs. I say (in that cool Dick Vermiel style) "B.S." He bypassed all other drug tests before and was never majorly caught. He took a substance that could make him pass any drug test the western world thought up. He retired and didn't care about the drugs AFTER THE FACT. I don't buy he retired because of the drugs. Besides it was just 4 weeks of suspension. Heck - he's trying to take time off, the suspension would be good for him. No, I don't buy it. He retired because he wanted to.  In other Raiders news, Al Davis & Co. has released Tim Brown, one of the greatest recievers of all time, to Free Agency. Reports say that the Buccaneers and Broncos are heavily courting him. My opinion? I hope he lands in Denver. You heard me. His production has been dropping off and the Broncos, aside from Lelie, have exactly that. He would be snagged in the same rut Rod Smith and McCaffrey had last year. Thus, I really don't mind him wearing a Bronco uniform. Everytime a rival does something stupid, we win.  And finally, Quincy Carter has been released by America's Team, the Dallas Cowboys, reportedly after getting into (what else?) serious drug problems. Again, maybe... but maybe not. It might have something to do with the fact that he sucks, but that's just me. As it turns out, the poor man's Michael Vick, Aaron Brooks, Donovan McNabb, Jeff Garcia, or Daunte Culpepper is just that and nothing more. Thus, I believe that is a major part of why he was fired.  Jerry Jones was quoted as saying that the decision "was not a hard one." Interesting. And I must say I am deeply impressed with the way Carter took it: "I have not one bad thing to say about (owner) Jerry Jones, (coach) Bill Parcells, or anyone else."  So sorry folks for the 2-week hiatus. Hopefully, I'll be back soon with some good Chiefs news.  GOOOOOOOOO Chiefs! GOOOOOOOOO Royals!

      In a poll conducted by ESPNews's Jayson Stark, "30 or so" GMs, broadcasters, Managers, Journalists, etc. were asked about the best defensive players in the game.  [You can read it at http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=1815812 ]  Of course, he must have kept his search in southern California and New England, because only 10% of the players "voted for" were from small markets. In fact, of the "first team" (players with most votes at each position), 7 of the 9 were from --  YOU GUESSED IT  -- BIG market teams. Absolute masters of the glove, such as Kansas City's IF Joe Randa, or OF Carlos Beltran; or Tampa Bay's OF Julio Lugo; or Montreal's OF Endy Chavez; or Toronto's P Roy Halladay, or IF Eric Hinske, were --  YOU GUESSED IT  -- not even voted for once.  As a small market fan of a small market team (3 Million in the KC metro area) with small market aspirations (WE CAN TRY TO WIN 81 BALL GAMES YAY) for small market ballplayers (So long, Beltran), I am sick and tired of being pushed around by the big boys. Everyone said small market teams can be successful, look at the Angels' World Series win. Well..... (A) the Angels had no business winning the Series, and (B)  THE ANGELS ARENT SMALL MARKET . Maybe not as big as a New York, Boston, LA, or Atlanta market, but not even close to a KC, Tampa, Seattle, or Minnesota market.  The day that free agency became legal with no salary cap, all small market teams officially bowed out. Sure, you had the great fan-pleasing owners (Ewing Kauffman) who spent millions to make a team successful, but you can bet Kauffman didn't make a fraction of the profit from the Royals that Steinbrenner is making from the Yanks.   Do you want to know why the MLB is slowly dying, and leagues like the NFL are flourishing? There are three reasons...  (1) It's a game of nostalgia - techniques will never change, equipment will never change, rules will never change; thus the game will  NEVER, EVER CHANGE . The NFL has added many new, exciting rules that make gameplay fun for the fans, fair, and highscoring.  (2) Small market teams don't have a chance - depending on how you define "small market," one could find up to 20 or 25 small market teams in the MLB. I personally find about 16 or 17, which is over half the league. When the league sees constant attendance of 1,500 or 2,000 at a ballgame in Montreal, they blame it on the Canadien lack of interest, Montreal's lack of success, and the Montreal front office. What the MLB doesn't know is that  ITS THEIR FAULT . When teams don't even get to have a pipedream of a championship, fans will not come to a game. The ALMIGHTY NFL, however, has strict salary caps that make the smallest of markets competitive AND THEY DONT LOSE MONEY -- the Kansas City Chiefs have SOLD OUT thier stadium for 3 or 4 straight years. And 3 or 4 years ago, they weren't good. They were a sub-par, under .500 team. AND THEY SOLD OUT.  DING-DING-DING MLB TAKE SOME NOTES.   (3) The players union is too strong - strikes are nothing new (I think the strike count is up to 5 or 6 now in the history of baseball) and the MLB or Owners can do nothing about it. The MLB will constantly cut their fanbase in half with every strike... and I guarentee you that these boring rules will bring in no new fans, either. The NFL's player union is weak, but not too weak. A superstar on a team with a lot of room in the cap will get payed 7, 8, 9 million, tops... a Baseball player?  250 MILLION . Not even close.  If the MLB ever wants to survive to the 22nd century, they'd better wise up. A lot.  And let Pete Rose into the Hall of Fame. urlLink   urlLink

      Mike Berardino/South Florida Sun-Sentinal  Determined to upgrade their two glaring weaknesses, the Marlins have begun contacting teams in hopes of landing help at catcher and in the bullpen.  One big-name catcher who does not suit the Marlins' tastes is Kansas City veteran Benito Santiago. At 39 and due more than $3.55 million through next season, Santiago, the original Marlins' catcher, is viewed as a declining and overpriced commodity.  Instead, recent talks with the last-place Royals have focused on reserve outfielder Abraham Nunez, who could bring one of several right-handed relievers in return: Scott Sullivan, Jason Grimsley or deposed closer Mike MacDougal, now battling a balky shoulder at Triple-A.  The Marlins also could piggyback onto the eventual deal for Carlos Beltran once the Royals decide where to move their star center fielder. High-payroll clubs without a deep farm system, such as the Red Sox and New York Yankees, could use Marlins prospects to facilitate a deal.  Ideally, the Marlins would emerge from such a transaction with both catching and bullpen improvements.  http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/sfl-martrade05jun05,0,6347821.story?coll=sfla-sports-headlines

      Jimmy Gobble took care of business, retiring 15 of the first 16 batters he faced.  It was good to see Berroa hitting for 2 RBIs with a triple as we desperately need him to return his Rookie of the Year form.  Check out the box score score provided by MLB.com that has a story from the Red Sox and the Royals perspective.  Also, you may check out the plays of the game for free  urlLink (LINK) .  Affeldt also picked up his 6th straight save.  Look out today though, as Schilling seeks out his 7th victory of the season.  Darrell May (2-7, 5.24) pitches for the Royals.

      The Wichita Wranglers beat the Arkansas Travelers 3-2 to propel themselves into division lead, last night. They're now tied with Tulane for the East Division lead. In last night's game, Junior Herndon had 2 ERs, 5 Hs in 8.0 innings pitched.  In Omaha, the O-Royals are in last place of their division by 9 games, but there are some bright spots. Young David DeJesus, a Kansas City Royal earlier this season, has a .287 batting average and is showing some promise at the plate. Jed Hanson maintains his solid contact work, batting .315 for the team. Calvin Pickering has a .302 batting average and is leading the team with 16 homers. Aside from batting average, Pickering is the best O-Royal, statistically speaking.  In Wichita, Dee Brown and Ruben Gotay lead the Wranglers to constant victory, with a .294 and .291 batting average, respectively. Andres Blanco, formerly a KC Royal while filling in for the injured Angel Berroa and dazzling the city with amazing defensive plays, is still having trouble at the plate despite his defensive talent. He has a .241 BA and a measly .277 OBP - much room for improvement with the bat.

      I'm listening to this Royals game (Top of 2nd, Royals lead 1-0, w/ 2 outs and a 2-1 count) and already I'm noticing some differences from the last time we got rocked by this team:  -aggressiveness on the basepaths - although, stealing with Beltran IMMEDIATELY after Graffinino successfully stole isn't a great idea -- other than that, the Royals are getting around the diamond like they were last year.  -batting -- along with Harvey, the entire team is doing better with 2 strikes. Instead of curling up into the fetal position and taking a weak out like they're used to, everyone's getting base hits. Graffy and Beltran's hits thus far were on 2 strikes. -- also, everyone's watching close balls go by, and picking out their pitch. it's working.  -pitching -- Gobble isn't getting down on himself like usual. After getting down in 2-0, 3-1, or 3-0 counts, or having a man on third with only one out, he still battles hard - and it's paying off.  I hope this calculated aggressiveness and smart baseball is kept up and we pick up a W tonight - we need it.

      It appears that Baird is not too excited about parting with his All-Star players yet.  In the recap of the last game with Detroit, a writer for the Kansas City Star noted: "... Baird was undeniably upbeat in believing these Royals deserve to stay together for at least a little while longer. So no fire sale. Not yet, anyway." urlLink LINK  This is good news for those who want to see Beltran out in center for a little while longer.  I would not wait too long to get your tickets though, before perhaps the best Royal since Brett packs his bags and leaves town.

      Ben Jacobs of the Hardball Times noted that  Ken Harvey  was #3 on his five hitters on the rise list.  Here is an exerpt (stats used are AVG/OBP/SLG): "Last year, Harvey hit a decent .333/.377/.564 against lefties, but was useless (.234/.282/.334) against righties Since he had 173 more at-bats against righties, his overall stats weren't good. This year, he's been almost as good against lefties as last year, hitting .345/.362/.491 against them. The difference in his season is that he's turned into a young  Ted Williams  against righties, hitting .395/.443/.580 in 119 at-bats."   urlLink LINK    This is good news, though Ben does not think he can keep these numbers up.  I (blinded by my love for the Royals) love Harvey a lot, and see him averaging a .310/25 HR/100 RBI season, perhaps more if the Royals trade Sweeney away and give Harvey some breathing space.  Mike Sweeney is a good person, but I am in favor of letting Harvey's light shine.

      Courtesy of FOXsports.com  A Beltran blockbuser Ken Rosenthal/Sporting News  "...The Royals have expressed past interest in both Padres third baseman Sean Burroughs and outfielder Xavier Nady. But for the Padres to trade Burroughs, they would need to acquire a third baseman in return. That would be Randa, who is earning $3.25 million this season with a $500,000 buyout or $3.25 million club option for 2005.   With Beltran earning $9 million, the Royals almost certainly would need to take back a contract in such a deal — perhaps that of outfielder Terrence Long, who is earning a total of $8.1 million in '04 and '05..."

      The Royals tied up their 4 game series with the Detroit tigers 2-2, after they beat the Tigers 9-6 in Thursday’s game ( urlLink BOX SCORE ).  Leading the Royals were Carlos Beltran and Ken Harvey who combined for 6 hits, 5 RBI’s and 2 runs.  The Royals jumped out to an early lead Thursday when Carlos Beltran and Mike Sweeney had back to back doubles, driving in 3 runs early. The Royals struck again in the top of the 4th with 4 more runs to give the Royals the lead 7-1.  The Tigers caped off their biggest inning in the bottom of the 7th when they put up 4 runs lead by a 2 run double by Craig Monroe.  Dennys Reyes(2-0) picked up his second win for the Royals after he pitched 6.2 innings and gave up 5 runs on 6 hits and 4 walks. Nate Field relieved Reyes in the bottom of the 7th inning and pitched 1.1 innings giving up 1 run on 2 hits.  Jeremy Affeldt closed out the game for the Royals, picking up his 5th save since becoming the closer for the Royals.  Receiving the loss Thursday was Jeremy Bonderman(4-5) who lasted only 3 innings and gave up a whopping 7 runs on 9 hits and 3 walks. The Tigers also pitched Steve Colyer who gave up 2 runs in 1 inning.  The Tigers most effective pitcher Thursday was Craig Dingman who pitched 3 innings giving up only 3 hits and holding the Royals off the board. Esteban Yan also pitched well giving up only 1 hit and no runs in 2 innings.  The Royals now come home to face the Boston Red Sox who are 31-22 this season but only 2-5 in their last 7. The first Game of the series will showcase Jimmy Gobble(2-3) up against the knuckleball-throwing Tim Wakefield(4-3). Friday night’s game starts a very important 9 game home stand that could very well determine who the Royals decide to trade away before the July 31 deadline.

      The Royals return tomorrow night to face the Evil, Evil BoSox. They are bringing a streak of not-lost series - in fact, they haven't lost a series against another team since they dropped all 3 to the Oakland Athletics. The Red Sox, however, have another streak of their own: they're riding into Kauffman after having lost four straight. They have tonight off, and they could use the mental rest - contrary to them, the Bosox's archrivals, the Yankees are riding a 3-game winning streak. This series is crucial to both teams - the Bosox need to win to stay in their division race, and the Royals need to win to stay alive period.  Pitching Probables: Friday, June 4th - BOSOX: Tim Wakefield (R), 3.59, 4-3 /// ROYALS: Jimmy Gobble (L), 4.94, 2-3  Saturday, June 5th - BOSOX: Curt Schilling (R), 3.00, 6-3 /// ROYALS: Darrel May (L), 5.74, 2-7  Sunday, June 6th - BOSOX: Derek Lowe (R), 6.84, 4-5 /// ROYALS: Chris George (R), 4.05, 0-0  Key Matchups: Simply enough, the Red Sox batters will bomb the Royals starting pitching. Any victories will come through solid Royals pitching efforts, and at least 2 to 3 amazing offensive efforts. Ken Harvey's 12-game hitting streak MUST BE CONTINUED. Not for the sake of the streak, but for the sake of the production. Stinnett must be left in and he must also continue good work. Carlos Beltran gets his chance to advertise himself against a possible future employer, and he is another who must produce.  Overall, the Red Sox are a better team. They have vastly superior pitching. They have a better lineup. They even have a cool wall in their outfield that had its' own nickname. Nomar Garciaparra will not be back in time for the Royals series, but that didn't stop the Red Sox from winning before.  The X-Factor: JERSEYS -- The Royals have better jerseys than the Red Sox, period. The only way they could compete is if they brought out thier home alternate red jersey - that thing is sweet. However, they're playing on OUR turf - so, even if the Royals lose, they'll look sweet doing so.  Players to watch: ROYALS Ken Harvey, 1B/DH Mike Sweeney, 1B/DH Kelly Stinnett, C Carlos Beltran, OF  RED SOX Wakefield/Schilling/Lowe, SPs Manny Rameriez, OF Jason Veritek, C (great 6 or 7 hitter)

      I don't want to get into Brandon's entry, but Stinnett has clearly earned himself at least a 1-week continuation of his starting status. Let's face it, Santiago is decent, but an improvement is always welcome. I usually like to stand behind my manager's decision, but Stinnett is too hot right now to bench.

      A 2 or 3 hit performance by Ken Harvey, a 3 for 4 kelly stinnet performance, and a Zach Grienke 7-inning performance all wasted on a loss. We had at least 4, 5, or 6 long, deep hits that would have been gone in 90% of MLB ballparks, but with muggy air and deep fences, it was not to be. In any other ballpark, the Royals would have won. If Zach Grienke didn't let one slider hang early in the game, the Royals would have won. It's just one of those games you play well but can't pull out.  I always try to support the starters on the Royals, especially people who I feel are underperforming (i.e. Gonzalez and Santiago) - but Kelly Stinett has shown, at least to me, that he deserves a shot at starting.  Harvey continued his 10-game hitting streak into 11 games - showing 0 signs of any kind of Sophomore Slump.  And if you're looking for a positive sign, the White Sox lost, too - so we didn't lose any ground - HOORAY

      I read this article today, I wish I remembered where; especially after Dontrelle Willis got into the 7th inning with one. There was one Perfect Game in the '20s, one in the '50s, 2 in the '70s, and between the '80s and now, there have been about 1 every 3 years. Since the '20s, fielder's errors have heavily decreased, and the number of strikeouts by pitchers have increased dramatically as well. I found this interesting, especially since there seems to be a major increase of scoring - from common 1-0, 2-1 games of the '50s and '60s to 10-5, 3-7 games now. I find the simultaneous increase of perfect games and run production fascinating and I wonder where the future will take us.

      Some George Brett Quotes I found:  "I could have played another year, but I would have been playing for the money, and baseball deserves better than that." - George Brett  "I think when George goes to heaven, there will be the Babe (Ruth) and (Lou) Gehrig and a few of the really, really great ones all hanging around together, and one of 'em will say, 'Hey, that's George Brett.'" - Fred White  "If God had him no balls and two strikes, he'd still get a hit." - American League umpire Steve Palermo  "He was clearly one of the best players of his generation, but he had a style that spanned the generations. He looked and carried himself like a baseball player and could have been at home in any era. He was the kind of guy who conveyed something to fans thats very important, which was that he thought of himself first and foremost as a baseball player. There was nothing in the world that he would rather be doing than playing baseball every day when he was on the field." - Broadcaster Bob Costas  "The only way to pitch to George Brett is way inside so you can force him to pull the ball. That way the line drive won't hit you." - Yankees pitcher Rudy May

      Ken Harvey, first basemen, had yet another great game - going 3 for 4 in the clean-up spot with 2 RBIs - he's number 2 in the entire AL with batting average, and number 5 overall in the MLB. and he's 7 games behind everyone else. and guess what? He's not even on the All-Star Ballot. Yep, that's how much small market teams are respected.  Well, him not being on the ballot might have something to do with Mike Sweeney, but I can still feel screwed. No matter whether it's right or wrong, I have been taught since birth that there are 4 kinds of people that always lie: Democrats, Mechanics, Umpires, and Big Market Owners.

      If you want the boxscore, go to the Royals website  urlLink (HERE)  and start clicking around - otherwise, this entry is a ramble.  If you want to look at a bright spot today, notice that the White Sox didn't win. They didn't lose, either, but they didn't win. Thus, the Royals' 9.5 GB was only worsened to a 10.5 GB count... If the Royals win tomorrow against the Mets (which they should) and the White Sox lose tomorrow (which they could), all damage done today would be GONE. Completely erased. Today, we didn't play well. Actually, that's an understatement. We played exceptionally badly, dropping 2 to the worst team in baseball. Actually, losing a series to them (1 game to their 2) might make us the worst team in baseball. Not sure. Regardless, it doesn't matter. I propose to you that every single one of the teams in first place in a division right now will be tied at least once, if not, losing their position atop their division at least once. You see, we're 1/3rd through this 2004 roller coaster of a season, and crazier things have been done in 100 games than getting 10.5 games back. Believe it or not, even the White Sox have slumps. It's days like these that you know who the true fans are. It's days like these that you can find out who the people who know nothing about baseball are. It's those who proclaim that this season is over, FOR ANY TEAM, not just ours. Those people are the ignorant ones who probably couldn't remain a fan for a losing team for more than 2 months. They're the spineless, soulless, gutless, heartless ones who, claim they like a team; but when the going gets tough, they find a new team to cheer for. Just ignore them, noble Royals fans... and I'll give you an encouraging tidbit:  On August 12th, 1951, the Giants were 13.5 games back in the pennant race with 44 games left to play. On October 3, 1951, the Giants won the pennant. Today, we're down 10.5. - We have 2 less games to make up, an easier division to make it up in, and 56 more games to make it up in, too.  If you can't love the team when they're losing, you'll never get the satisfaction out of them when they're winning.

      While Walter Johnson was an excellent pitcher (and he stayed with the same team for 20 years straight - talk about loyalty), you can't discount Cy Young for having the most losses in league history. Walter Johnson had a 60% winning percentage. Cy Young? A slightly-better 62% winning percentage. [Nolan Ryan has a 52%, but I've already thrown him to the wolves - hey, he's only my backup - I just like anyone who consistantly throws 100, 105 mph - it can do stuff for a team's morale] Anywho, I'm not saying that this percentage makes Young better (it's only 2%), but you can't hold his losses against him - when you pitch that many games, you're bound to lose some.  Also, Win Shares. While I love Bill James like a smelly grandpa, Win Shares is based largely on opinion. For one of many examples, "an unearned run is attributed 50/50 between pitching and defense" -- SAYS WHO? I've seen many walks turn into ugly, inning-eating walk-parades, where a pitcher will walk 2, 3, even 4 guys -- but that's 50% the defense's fault? As good as Win Shares are, they're still very unaccurate.  Now I will give you ERA - holding a career ERA under 2.50 for 20 years is very impressive, and really the only stat I won't dispute (although Young did have a 2.63 ERA) However, I will say this: Johnson, on average, pitched 7.37 innings per game. Young pitched 8.12. Again, not a huge difference, but half an inning per game, and all of a sudden Young's ERA looks a little better. Also, think about the value of the team. With 8 innings, you wouldn't need a set-up man, just a closer, a couple of middle relievers, and you could use that extra slot for a spare slugger or baserunner. With Johnson, you need a set-up guy AND a closer.  And as a final stat, Johnson AND Young both has 1.1 WHIPs... In my opinion, they're as close to equal as I've ever seen - the only thing is Cy Young pitched longer, both in his career and in games. The only thing Johnson's got on Young is ERA, and it's not that big of a difference. And, lastly, I'll repeat my main point again:  "Cy Young -- #1 all time Complete Games; #4 all time Shutouts; #1 Innings pitched (by 1,200 IP over the next best); and #1 all time Wins"  P.S. -- Johnson had a .235 career batting average, Young had a .210 career average... I would love to see any NL pitcher do that.

      I know Garth is about to throw a fastball right down the middle of the plate, so I have to launch this pre-emptive strike to protect my new pitching hero,  urlLink Mr. Walter Johnson .  Mr. Johnson was not born on the East Coast, or California, or even Puerto Rico...Mr. Johnson was born in Humboldt, Kansas....that is right folks...Kansas.  I have a quote that makes our current Mr. Johnson ( urlLink Randy of the D-Backs ) shake in his boots...I think you will recognize the name of the player who said it: "The first time I faced him (Walter Johnson) I watched him take that easy windup and then something went past me that made me flinch. The thing just hissed with danger. We couldn't touch him....every one of us knew we'd met the most powerful arm ever turned loose in a ball park." -  urlLink Ty Cobb  Pitchers should be competing for the Walter Johnson Award, not the Cy Young.  It's a shame a player of his magnitude does not get more credit.  Oh, and for the record, he played his ENTIRE Major League Career for one team, the Washington Senators.  He deserves the George Brett Award (display of notable team loyalty though could go to other team for much more money).

       urlLink Zach Greinke  finally gets 'er done with some support from the bullpen (as bad as it may be!).  Greinke pitched another awesome game to pick up his first win.  He is now 1-1 with an awesome ERA of 1.73.  He had 5 strikeouts, gave up 3 hits, and no walks.   urlLink Jeremy Affeldt  barely got the save despite throwing some pretty good pitches.  This included a nasty, nasty 75-mph curveball mixed in with a 96-mph fastball laserbeam pitch.  Affeldt gave up 2 runs, including walking a run in, but managed to make it through to give the rookie a much needed first victory.   urlLink LINK

      Well, well, well.  Looks like little G is stirring up the pot.  What pitcher, and what player would I start my franchise off with???  For now (since its late!), I will counter Garth's decent selections of  urlLink Cy Young  and  urlLink Nolan Ryan  with my selection of  urlLink Walter Johnson  (Washington Senators).  Walter appears to be the only pitcher to have recorded a 50+  urlLink Win Share  season.  Johnson's top 3 seasons (Win Shares of 54, 47, 42) compared to Cy Young's (44, 42, 41).  Also take in to consideration that Johnson's Top 5 season Win Share total was 217.  Cy Young ranks third with 200.  Finally, Walter Johnson averaged 34.09 Win Shares per season.  This is compared to Cy's 32.63 Win Share annual rate.  While Cy Young might have racked up some serious innings and wins, he also racked up the most LOSSES (316 to be exact) by any Major League pitcher.  And where does Garth's back up pitcher fall on this notable statistic ranking???  That is right, Nolan Ryan racked up an astounding 292 losses to his 324 "blue collar" wins.  To top it all off, Walter had a better career ERA (2.17) than both of them (2.63 for Cy, 3.19 for Nolan).  So if I am looking for a pitcher for my franchise, a pitcher for 15 years operating at his peak, its time to call Walter Johnson to the mound.  P.S.  I would actually take  urlLink Mr. "Rocket" Clemens  before I would take Nolan Ryan.  Sorry, just had to replace one Texan with a better one.  And no, this is not because Clemens pitched with the Red Sox...leading me to my Post-Post Script...  P.P.S. If trading away Babe Ruth has cursed the Red Sox ever since, what does losing Mr. Clemens in the late 80's mean for them???  No Series rings for another century???  Let's certainly hope not.

      I propose a question to anyone with half a brain and baseball knowledge --- If you were to build a franchise, which batter and which pitcher would you start with? You get to pick any batter who ever stepped in the Major League batters' box, and any pitcher that ever hurled the baseball from the rubber towards home... essentially, which 2 players, past or present, would you elect to build your franchise around? Oh, one last thing - these players you "draft" are in their prime for 15 years, then they retire. So you're getting 15 years out of whoever you draft, always in their prime, and they're exempt from injuries. So who would YOU draft?  When dealing with the batters, one's mind goes to some of the old greats - ty cobb, babe ruth, mickey mantle, roger maris, jumpin' joe dimaggio.... then, the mind wanders to the recent sluggers - guys like pete rose, cal ripkin jr., mike schmidt, george brett, mark mcquire.... finally, one turns to today's stars, the future of baseball - guys with power at the plate like a-rod, barry bonds, albert pujols, vladimer guerrero, or even the contact guys - carlos beltran, derek jeter, eric chavez  My pick?  Pete Rose -- with the number of hits this guy had, anyone who even thinks this guy belongs anywhere but the Hall of Fame is insane.  Gambling, Scmambling - he never threw a game. He was a competitor. He was addicted to gambling like someone can get hooked on crack. How many second chances did Daryl Strawberry get? I believe Strawberry deserved all those second chances, but I think Pete Rose deserves them, too.   Aside from the Hall of Fame SCAM (p.s. I hate Bud Selig), Pete Rose was easily one of the purest hitters in the game. A sweet stroke everytime he swung the white ash, and a couple of thousand hits later, he was in the record books. Also, his defense was a key factor in many Reds' victories. On top of that, Rose was charasmatic - with the fans as well as with his teammates: he'll put people in the stands, and keep his teammates up - priceless.  My runner up?  Cal Ripken, Jr. -- a lot of people criticize Ripken for his record, and maybe rightly so. I mean, playing in thousands upon thousands of games in a row doesn't inspire teammates at all. Nope, not one bit. And, believe me, while this streak is going, it was real easy for his teammates to sit out with some tiny boo-boo. And his game suffered big time... so big, he only had 3,184 hits in his career... only 1,647 runs... and only 1,695 RBIs... only 2 gold gloves... only 2 season MVPs... gosh, what a slacker! People who criticize Ripken for being "selfish" for pursuing the record never really got the whole idea of America, of baseball, or of much else. It wasn't about breaking the record. It was about, above everything else, being there. Dependability. Responsibility. Cal Ripken got paid big bucks. And he felt like he should earn them. Lou Gehrig held the record before Ripken. How much heat did Gehrig take for the streak? None. Back in those days, dependability meant something. The reporters who called Ripken selfish were the reporters who took a day off and didn't want to look bad. I'll quote Tony LaRussa (a manager who happens to have an impressive track record himself) - "Now here's Cal. You never have to ask 'Now is my key guy going to be able to play today?' He's in there, everyday... There's never a question. What a luxery for a manager."  Now on to my pitcher --  My Pick?  Cy Young -- #1 all time Complete Games; #4 all time Shutouts; #1 Innings pitched (by 1,200 IP over the next best); and #1 all time Wins -- 'nuff said.  My runner up?  Nolan Ryan -- a blue collar and an impressive career with amazing velocity. Simply the best.

      I'm reading this book written in '98 and it's pretty good, but a little outdated. This Jon Miller guy appears to be just another Big Market Idiot (and not at all a Purist), but I'm still reading the book, because any book pertaining to Baseball is a better book than anything else. However, he has made a prophetic statement. He wrote the book talking about interleague play and how, in the future, it will have lost all its' luster. Aside from Mets/Yanks, White Sox/Cubbies, and Dodgers&Giants/Angels&Athletics rivalries, basically Interleague play has died. It was intended to have teams that have never played each other compete and draw big crowds. Well, now the problem is they've played each other too much so it's no longer special and the World Series is heavily tainted. I'm only 60 pages in the 200 page book, but it has some good points if anyone's especially bored on a lazy summer day... if not, and if you want meaningful Baseball literature, read Bob Costas'  Fair Ball .

      Finally.  With the Royals getting bullied around by the Big, Bad, BoSox 2-1, and having an overall rough year, the Royals get to take comfort in something: they get their first scheduling break. The White Sox, the Twins, EVERYONE ELSE in the MLB has had one but us. The Royals get 9-straight games against cupcakes: the Montreal Expos, the New York Mets, and the Detroit Tigers. The Expos and Mets will be part of the MLB's Interleague Play, in it's 6th or 7th year.  LINEUPS: C -- (KC)Stinnett (KC)Santiago (MON)Schneider  1B -- (KC)Harvey (KC)Sweeney (MON)Johnson  2B -- (KC)Graffinino (MON)Vidro  3B -- (KC)Randa (MON)Batista  SS -- (KC)Berroa (MON)Cabrera  LF -- (KC)Relaford (KC)Stairs (KC)Berger (KC)Gettis (MON)Sledge  CF -- (KC)Beltran (MON)Chavez  RF -- (KC) [see LF] (MON) Wilkerson  PITCHING MATCHUPS #1 - Armas vs. Greinke #2 - Hernandez vs. Gobble  #3 - Day vs. Reyes  KEY MATCHUPS There are none. They're a bad team, we're a decent team. I guess, if you're going to keep your eye on 3 Expos, watch out for (2B)Vidro, (3B) Batista, and (SS) Cabrera.

      The Wichita Wranglers (AA) are one of those no-name teams. They have no outstanding players (well, none that have Babe Ruth stats), but as a team, they are tremendous. As a fan of the Wranglers' MLB affiliate, the Kansas City Royals, this news is exciting. Our entire team has places to improve, and we're stacked with some excellent talent in the Double-A level. I'm convinced Andres Blanco has the defensive talent to be a Big Leaguer. I've seen him in person at the Royals' Kauffman stadium -- he's exciting to watch, simply put. With a unstellar .259 SLG, .271 OBP, and .235 BA, Blanco NEEDS to take some notes on batting. If he has an offensive breakthrough, I'm convinced he could unseat Angel Berroa as the KC Shortstop, and vastly improve our ballclub. The only problem is his batting is subpar, even for the AA, so it will be a challenge for Blanco to get to the MLB level with the stick. Of course, while the entire Wichita lineup is filled with talent, there are two names that standout with the offense: Dee Brown and Ruben Gotay. These two young men also provide their team with a 1-2 punch, and have a great supporting cast.   The Wranglers' bullpen is special, too: There are 4 pitchers with truly impressive records for a minor league team -- Junior Herndon (6-3, 3.48 ERA); Ryan Baerlocher (5-1, 4.91 ERA); Mike Natale (4-0, 4.86 ERA); and Eduardo Villacis (2-0, 2.67 ERA) -- the only problem with the Wichita pitching is the ERA, with the lowest being Villacis' 2.67.  Down in AAA, Calvin Pickering has maintained his high level of batting, being the first O-Royal to have over 100 total bases. He has 106. Not too far behind, Jed Hansen has 98, with more of a George Brett, run-'em-out style. Hansen has more triples and doubles than everyone else and only trails Pickering in home runs by 4. But with the exception of Mendy Lopez's 3-game stint, Pickering leads the team in slugging with a whopping .707, nearly .080 over the next highest, (of couse) Hansen. With a 1-2 punch like Hansen and Pickering, it's hard not to fault the bullpen with the O-Royals' lack of success, still trailing 9 games in their division.

      What do the 2 following characteristics have in common: ---hasn't played a major league game yet this year ---leads the AL in All Star voting for the SS position  If you guessed Nomar Garciaparra, SS for the Red Sox, you guessed right. Garciaparra has yet to return from the DL (achilles) this season and, apparently by fan agreement, is still the best shortstop in the AL.  Note to fans: there are 13 other shortstops in the league with much better stats than Nomar, but you don't care about actual talent, do you? No, it's not about who's the true All Star, it's all about who plays for the biggest market. Angel Berroa, a slightly better defensive shortstop, wouldn't have gotten that kind of treatment had he been hurt.      The All Star game is another reason the MLB is dying.

      The Red Sox evened the three game series at Kauffman today, batting, fielding, and pitching their way to a 8-4 victory over the formerly-hot Royals.  The Red Sox main run production was simple: get a man on, hit a homer. 6 of the Sox's 8 runs came from two-run homers. In fact, without these two-run slams, the Royals would have won.  Darrel May (2-8) had trouble with the Boston lineup from the get go, yielding 2 runs in the top of the 1st inning, and giving up runs in every inning but the second. Overall, he finished with seven runs and ten hits on five innings of work. A pitching bright spot emerged in the form of Brian Anderson. Anderson, whose last appearance following May was ghastly, pitched a solid four innings, only giving up three hits and one run.  After the 2-run top-of-the-first for Boston, the Royals came right back with an answer of their own: Mike Sweeney hit a solo homer to bring the score back into reason, 2-1. May pitched well in the second, allowing no one to score. The Royals couldn't put bat to ball and remained scoreless for five more innings. After then, any run production was basically moot, but encouraging, considering that not too many baseball teams would even be trying if they were down by seven runs.  Schilling added another notch to his new Red Sox-issue belt (7-3), striking out three, and allowing a decent three runs and only six hits in seven innings. The Boston set-up man, Timlin, pitched a perfect 8th inning. The closer, Foulke, had one strikeout, but allowed a 2-out homer by Benito Santiago to pull the Royals within 4.  The game had a 22 minute rain delay, and despite the overcast weather, an impressive 30,000 (29,968 to be exact) attended the game.  ALSO: Ken Harvey continued his hitting streak (currently, 13 games) with a double on Schilling. Harvey only went 1 for 4 (a slump for him), but scored a run on his double.  Catcher Benito Santiago might feel pressured for his job - backup Kelly Stinnett did an excellent job in his abscense. Whatever the reason, Santiago is producing better - he went 2 for 3, hit a home run, and had 2 RBIs - he even threw a man stealing at second, an oddity for him. Add Stinnett to the growing list of Royals' possibilities for DH.

      Who let the dogs out?  In the first inning in Philadelphia since the 1980 World Series, the Royals scored 4 runs. They didn't look back again for the entire game, as they broke the Phillies' back hard and early. The 10 runs were helped along by 2 Matt Stairs homeruns (that day off must have done wonders) and another homer by Benito Santiago.  Berroa and Stairs each got 3 hits, Harvey and Randa got 2 apiece. Graffinino, Beltran, Santiago, and Relaford each contributed with a hit. In fact, Kelly Stinnett (who took over for Santiago after he got hit by a pitch on the back of his hand - X-Rays pending) and George we're the only defensive players without a hit. (Mike Sweeney and Dee Brown both pinch hit and got nada)  The 10 points don't seem like much when considering the context, especially when looking at 2 seperate occurances of loaded bases with 0 outs... those 2 events gained the Royals a grand total of 1 run. After the first botch base-loading, Matt Stairs hit a homer to begin the next inning. Had a 2-out walk or hit, and we're talking about a 14-4 game, or even more.  You can view the boxscore, courtesy of ESPN.com  urlLink HERE   Also, with the third consecutive win (the first time that's happened), and with the Twins losing, the Royals are back to only 10 games out of first, and only four games out of the cellar. [Note: the White Sox won and are 0.5 games out.]   As an outlook on the remaining 2 games in this Phillies series, tomorrow, the Royals sent out young Zach Grienke to do battle with the Phillies' 8-game winner, Eric Milton. On Sunday, the Royals face Kevin Millwood, a 4-game winner this year. IF (an IF the size of Texas and Alaska's child, should they mate) the Royals can take advantage of Grienke as field general tomorrow, they have a very real chance of having a road sweep (the first this season), a sweep period (the first one in awhile), and a road series victory (Atlanta yesterday was their first).  I don't want to jinx what the Royals are doing thus far, but with big bats like Harvey and Sweeney not exactly IN the action, can you imagine what this ballclub could look like at home, with a DH, with the big bats a'cracking? I'm sure that's something that would put the sparkle back in Kansas City's eyes.

      Well, it seems our new TRIFECTA segment is off to a good start.  I picked all three series, with both the Cubs and the Cards sweeping their opponents.  Marlins squeeked by the White Sox, winning their series 2 games to 1.  The weekend edition of TRIFECTA brings you more interleague fun.   1. Athletics (37-27, AL#3) at Cubs (37-29, NL#3)  This is a tale of opposite directions for two powerful teams.  The Cubs made off with a four game sweep of division-rival Houston, while the A's lost some ground in the AL West losing their last 3 games.  This series will be the one to watch, as Sammy returns to the lineup and the Cubs begin their march towards that elusive World Series ring.  Don't miss Saturday's superstar matchup with Mulder (8-2, 2.97) taking on the healed Prior (1-1, 3.07).  Sunday will be a great finale with Zito (4-3, 4.67) trying to stop Zambrano (7-2, 2.32).  Look for Sosa to "go yard" a couple of times...   Cubs 2, Athletics 1.    2. Rangers (34-29, AL#4) at Marlins (37-29, NL#4)  Talk about two teams of the future, with the Rangers having the everyday players (Blalock, Soriano, M. Young, Teixeira) and the Marlins with the pitchers (Burnett, Beckett, Penny, Benitez).  Expect this series to be a real battle, with Sunday's matchup a must see: Kenny Rogers (9-2, 3.71) against A.J. Burnett (0-2, 6.28).  Look for Soriano to have a great series...   Rangers 2, Marlins 1.    3. Yankees (42-22, AL#1) at Dodgers (35-28)  Last but not least, who would not love a rematch of old rivals, the Yankees and the Dodgers of old Brooklyn?  Both teams are firing on all cylinders, with LA on a 3-game winning streak and NY going 8-2 over their last 10.  Each game has pretty even pitching matchups, with a good one coming today: Vazquez (7-4, 3.43) taking on the former Yank, Weaver (4-7, 4.54).  Look out for Jeter to come up with some good hitting, but the LA sun will be too much...   Dodgers 3, Yankees 0.   Season to date TRIFECTA record: 3-0

      As many of us have, this morning I opened up to the Sports Section of the ever-so-helpful Kansas City Star and read the headline article about the Royals and how Carlos Beltran wants to stay here in Kansas City. Good article, helpful quotes, quite the pep-rally. But bad idea, very bad idea.  Here is my problem with keeping Carlos Beltran for the rest of the 2004 season. Okay lets say, hypetheticaly that the Kansas City Royals, in a turnaround-for-the-century, Come back from 10 games-out and snatch first place of the AL Central. What have we accomplished? Lets be honest. This team isn't ready for a run at the world series. That is obvious. We do not have the pitching(yet) and the pitching that we do have is just not consistent enough. So lets say, in the BEST CASE SCENARIO. We win the AL Central, Loose the first round 2-3. I would be estatic, this would be a HUGE turnaround. But in the end, would we had actually accomplished anything? We will still loose Carlos Beltran. We will still probably loose Joe Randa, Matt Stairs, Aaron Guiel. It's not worth risking the prospects that we can get from trading Beltran to make a run at the playoffs.  So lets be honest. To us fans, the playoffs are great. But in the grand-scheme-of-things, It aint' shit.

      Well, I awoke to seeing this headline in Today's sports section: "Beltran hopes he can end '04 in KC" -- I know it's unlikely, but the entire team is showing some enthusiasm and optimism:   "I don't think anyone wants to leave here, because we all know the kind of ballclub we have here. You know how many games we have left? Ninety-nine. That's a lot of games. Look at Minnesota last year. They didn't do anything for the first three months last season, and then they played better and won the division. If they can do it, we can do it."       -- Carlos Beltran    "This could be a turnaround for us."       -- Desi Relaford   Of course, I can't be happy with everyone. It's against my God-given talent as a grouch. Jeffrey Flanigan, everyone's favorite fool, decided to point out the 7 worst losses in the season, immediately following 2 of the best wins.  And of course, like a real man, he blamed Leskanic for virtually every one. The only one who can't defend himself is the very guy Flanigan goes after. Oh, and the two worst losses we had this year (back-to-back Expos thrashings) aren't even in here. And Leskanic had nothing to do with either one of them. Coincidence? I'll let you decide. That's true journalistic skill.  I used to like Flanigan, I really did. Then it occured to me that he, just like every other KC Star reporter, has absolutely no opinion that belongs to he and he alone. He simply tells the KC public what we want to hear, not the truth.

      I won't say much except that Ken Harvey was the only defensive starter who didn't get a hit. It was a treat to see Relaford back into gear, and the same with Randa. Dee Brown seems to have come into his own, and should be a contributor to the Royals for years to come. Pena was also able to give Santiago and Sweeney the day off - and we didn't need to use them as pinch hitters. It feels good to win a series on the road, especially in the way that we did (big blowouts for the last 2 games), and I'm especially excited in that Pena was able to shake up the lineup (1,3,5,6,7,8, and 9 were all filled by players who usually aren't there) and the boys were able to adjust. All in all, it's a great set of road wins, giving the Royals some much-needed momentum heading into Philadelphia.  As a side note, the last time the Phillies and Royals played was the first Royals appearence in the World Series, the W.S. in 1980.  As another side not, have you noticed that Super Bowls are the only championships counted by the number of Champions there are?  (i.e. Super Bowl I, II, III, IV, V, etc // World Series in 1976, 1977, 1978, etc)

      In a smash-'em-up game the Royals have desperately needed, the Royals defeated the Braves by 6, pulling the series to 1 game apiece. The come from behind victory was sparked by Angel Berroa's 3-run homer in the 8th inning. In the last 2 innings, a total of 9 runs were scored off Atlanta relief.  After trailing Atlanta for most of the game, the 8th and 9th innings were breakout, rally innings. Every single offensive starter had at least one hit, and the usually quiet Joe Randa had 4 hits.  Of course, Kansas City media never misses a beat:   "Through the pervasive losing and utter disappointment of the 2004 Royals season, manager Tony Pena has kept spirits relatively high. Good luck keeping them there for 100 more games... the players' morale hit bottom after general manager Allard Baird announced plans last week to entertain veterans and play with an eye on 2005." -- Jeff Passan, KC Star   Yes, Jeff, they're so distraught that they win by 6. They get 9 runs in the last 2 innings. Horrible team spirit. Yet, every player gets a hit. That's absolutely horrible mechanics... Frankly, Jeff, strap on a pair and grow your own opinion.  Tony Pena has:   "I still think we have a chance. Honest to God, I truly believe we have a chance to come back and win this thing."   One thing's for sure. Tony Pena hasn't jumped ship yet. If Baird makes this Beltran trade right, we can be better for 2005 AND this year.  P.S. -- has anyone noticed that, since Baird's original firesale announcment nearly a month ago, Beltran has been on a semi-slump, and yet, the Royals have only lost 2 series? Believe it or not, Beltran is a solid ballplayer, but he isn't the heart and soul of this team. If we kept up the pace of this last month for the remainder of the season, and the White Sox and the Twins so the same, we will lose the division by 1 game. Any kind of hot-streak at all, and we've got this division by the throat. It's really that easy.  TOGETHER WE CAN

      Allard Baird gave this team a chance to gain some ground in the AL Central. But, the Royals still find themsleves over 10 games back of the first place Chicago Whitesox. A deal that would ship Carlos Beltran out to a contending team and bring in good prospects for the Royals is an absolutely necessary piece in the rebuilding of the struggling Kansas City Royals.  The time to trade Carlos Beltran is now. Get as much as you can for him.   We will not get Sean Burroughs. We will not get Jose Reyes. I wish that we could pull something like this off, but It simply will not happen. No club will trade away "Blue Chip" prospects for a 3 month rental player. Get as much as you can for him, take the prospects and run. The best thing for the Royals would be to package Beltran with Joe Randa or possibly Benito Santiago and pick up a player that will start for the Royals next year. But as I see this most likely impossible with Randa and Santiago's contract status', a deal that would send the Royals good prospects may be the only route to go.  I will admit, the Royals still have a chance to come back. But to be completely honest, I wouldn't bet Carlos Beltran on it. If the deal that we could get in return for Beltran is better then the compensation picks that we would get for Beltran if he was to sign with another club, I would trade him away in a heartbeat. If we are going to have such a drastic turnaround that we will win the division, I believe that we can do it without Carlos Beltran. Hell we could probably do it without any of our top 5 payroll players.  The time to trade Carlos Beltran is right now.  Do not give up on the Kansas City Royals. Wether it be this year, next year or maybe even the year after that: The Royals will regain their thrown in the AL Central.

       A look at the top three matchups during the coming work week.  Feel free to comment with your own picks or thoughts.    1. Cubs(NL#3) at Astros(NL#2)  The best game should be the first, with Prior recently getting back into the swing of things, facing off against the "Rocket", Roger Clemens(9-0, 2.08).  Other awesome matchups include Zambrano(7-2) vs. Wade Miller(6-6) on Tuesday, and Rusch taking on Oswalt on Thursday.  Chicago barely misses out on a road sweep...   Cubs 3, Astros 1    2. Athletics(AL#3) at Cardinals(NL#1)  Like our first series to watch, you will not want to miss game one of this face-off.  Matt Morris(6-5) will try to cool off the red hot A's and Barry Zito(4-3).  Will Pujols get back on track?  Will Rolen figure out the A's starting pitching?  I think they do...   Cardinals 2, Athletics 1    3. White Sox at Marlins(NL#5)  These two teams are right on the cusp between World Series contender or playoff dreamers.  You will want to catch the bookend games to this series.  Game one has Garland(5-3) facing off with Florida's A.J. Burnett.  Thursday's finale will be the best, with Loaiza(7-3) taking on World Series MVP Beckett(4-4). The fish dine on old, dirty socks...   Marlins 3, White Sox 0

      After spending the season in AA (Wranglers), Dee Brown (RF) has been called up to the big club. He has played well for the Wranglers, leading them in most batting categories. The Royals had not pulled him up before, because, in the event of a need to designate him back down to AA or AAA, he would first have to be placed on waivers. And Brown is the kind of ballplayers a lot of GMs wouldn't mind having on the MLB bench. However, he has finally got the call. The Royals will also be calling up Damian Jackson, a utilityman. In their stead, Brandon Berger, and Wilton Guerrero were both designated for assignment, but must go through waivers first.  Mendy Lopez (AAA Royals), who was designated to the O-Royals prior in the season, has made an impact in Omaha. He has had 9 hits and 6 runs in his first 7 games, and currently leads the team in batting average (.360). Behind him is an O-Royal mainstay, Calvin Pickering (.321 & a league-leading 23 home runs). The aforementioned David DeJesus is 5th on the active list with a .281 batting average. This, in theory, will translate to about a .230, .240 average in the big club, with a large improvement expected.

      Grienke couldn't do it.   On the day Zach Grienke was set to defeat his childhood hero, Tom Glavine, Grienke couldn't put the butter on the bread. It seemed to be a minor crossroads. It would have been the Royals first 3-game winning streak this year, would have completed a sweep of the Mets, and frankly, the Royals could have taken some pride in defeating Glavine.  Instead, following the 2 beatings of New York, the Royals dropped the ball, so to speak. Wearing the old Monarchs jerseys, the Royals had a poor day at the plate (4 hits, 2 runs) and on the rubber (5 runs, an unusually low number of hits: 5 as well). Even Carlos Beltran wanted to ruin the day. As a centerpiece of trade bait in the MLB, Beltran gave everyone in Kauffman Stadium a jolt. On a routine home run, Beltran thought he had a chance. So he went for it. Unfortunately, he slammed into the outfield wall, knee-first. He only slightly bruised the knee, but he got pulled out of the game after the inning.  In a bright spot of game 3 in the Royals-Mets series, Jaime Cerda showed the Mets what a mistake they made in letting him go last off-season. He pitched a perfect inning, and even struck out their slugger, Mike Piazza. Touche.  With the loss, the Royals remain 10.5 games out of first place, and remain within striking distance in the 100 games ahead.

      It looks like  urlLink Carlos Beltran  will not be in Royal Blue for long.  I was reading Peter Gammon's latest when I stopped dead in my tracks on the last line of this exerpt: "There are four teams that we've identified that have the combination of the young catcher and third baseman we're looking for,' says Baird. 'Those are our biggest areas of need. What we're doing is moving on to 2005. We'll put David DeJesus in center field. "  urlLink LINK  David DeJesus?  Did Baird just say  urlLink David DeJesus  (1 for 23 in his 11 games this season) will be playing in center field for the Kansas City Royals???  Please don't tell me that, because we would be better off with Mike Sweeney playing in center than sweet young David.  Here is another good article in ESPN the Magazine, listing the top teams most likely to land Beltran, along with how Scott Boras (Beltran's agent) is hurting the Royals:  "But Baird probably won't get a deal worthy of Beltran because superagent Scott Boras represents the free agent-to-be. Rival general managers are assuming there's virtually no chance they can sign Beltran before he would become a free agent in the off-season."  urlLink LINK  This is too bad for the Royals, as it would be nice to pull off similar deals that the Mariners and the Rangers did with their departing superstars (involving Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez respectively).  Scroll down to the bottom of Olney's article to get the list of teams in the running.  It seems like San Diego is the most likely destination at this point.  I confess that I would love it if either option #2 or #6 occurred.  If I had to put money on it, expect Beltran to be gone by this week or next at the latest.  Stay tuned.

      Well, a good thing never lasts forever.  I missed on all three series, bringing my new record to 6-3.  This weekend's TRIFECTA will be a brief one, so here it is:   Astros (38-34) at Rangers (40-29)  The Rangers continue to hit pretty well, and their pitching is somehow keeping them in games.  I think the Astros get a huge morale booster with the acquisition of Mr. Carlos Beltran.  Astros take the series...   Astros 2, Rangers 1    Cardinals (43-29) at Royals (28-41)  The Royals have pulled off the trade everyone was expecting, sending Carlos Beltran on to Houston for 3 very solid pickups (2 which will be brought up to the Majors immediately).  Even so, the clubhouse will take some time to adjust to the fact that their season is basically over.  The Royals' hearts will not be in this one...   Cardinals 2, Royals 1    Phillies (37-33) at Red Sox (40-31)  Jim Thome is simply going nuts, and it is difficult to see when his ride will slow down.  Pedro will be on the mound Friday, but the Phillies will do well in Boston...   Phillies 2, Red Sox 1   TRIFECTA season-to-date: 6-3

      I just finished listening to Jack Harry (grr) interview a Royals beat reporter (I forget his name, I'll repost if I can remember) and the reporter said that the Beltran deal was as good as done.  Also, the article, although not as well a descriptor of what KC gets, is at www.espn.com -- or the link straight to that article is  urlLink (HERE)    "The Associated Press is reporting that Beltran was told by the Royals on Thursday that he is being traded to Houston."  That quote pretty well sums up the likelyhood of this trade going through. I'll have a follow up post, or just an editing of this one to give everyone the nitty-gritty details of who we get, but from the beat reporter, this is what I've summed up:  -Beltran to Houston -Octavio Dotel to Oakland -From Oakland: 3B Teahan & SP Wood to KC -From Houston: Catcher ??? to KC  Basically, the only team that gets screwed here is KC. But considering the context of the Beltran situation, it could have been a lot worse.  To sum up Brian LeFevbre's comments (an interview w/ Jack Harry today, also - grr):   It doesn't hurt not being able to sign the A-Rods, the Pedros... it hurts creating an all-star caliber player, a once-in-a-lifetime-player, and not be able to keep him.   So, Garth's reaction? I still believe in our chances of winning the division this year, and I strongly believe in them next year.

      Courtesy of Gammons: News and notes.  Royals GM Allard Baird viewed players in eight different places, looking at potential returns for Beltran, Jason Grimsley and Joe Randa. The Orioles traded pitcher Denny Bautista for Grismley late Monday. Baird presently does not want or plan to deal Mike Sweeney.  Baird says there are four teams currently in the Beltran hunt, with the A's, Red Sox and Yankees three of the four (could the Marlins be the fourth?). Baird and Beane worked on the three-way trade that would have included the Dodgers, then spent the weekend working with Theo Epstein on a three-way deal that in the Red Sox's world would have sent Beltran to Boston, Kevin Youkilis and Scott Williamson to Oakland and A's third baseman Mark Teahan (Kansas City's favorite), Red Sox catcher Kelly Shoppach and Oakland pitcher Mike Wood to Kansas City.   But the A's are not convinced that Williamson is their answer at closer, and Youkilis would eventually have to be moved once franchise player and Gold Glove winner Eric Chavez returns in a month from a broken right hand. Every team Oakland talks to wants reliever Jairo Garcia, who throws 97 to 98 mph and at Class A Kane County has 16 saves, has allowed one earned run and has a 49/6 strikeout/walk ratio in 30 innings. Boston may be able to pull off a trade for Beltran, but Epstein will have to come up with some new parts in order to do so.   urlLink LINK

      Monday night, (SP) Grimsley traded his blue suede shoes for those of an burnt-auburn color. That is to say, he got traded. A straight-up trade, the Orioles got Grimsley, and the Royals got AA prospect (SP) Denny Bautista.  Bautista totes quite a resume: he's Pedro Martinez' brother, he tops out at 97mph, and he's got Royals GM Allard Baird's unconditional support:  "If (his control) gets worked out this year, we should see this guy in our opening-day rotation next season."   The nail of Bautista's problems was hit on the head when Baird spoke of Bautista's control. He's walked 191 batters in 448.6 AA innings.  In what I hope was a fluke, Denny gave up 8 runs in his only 2 major league innings, as well.  In AA Bowie, Bautista has a 4.74 ERA and only 3 wins in 14 starts. This season, however, he has struck out 72 batters in 62.6 innings of work.  If Baird has confidence in this young man, then I do, too. But now the more curious question remains: Who will be the new Royals representitive to the Players Union?

      If this is your first read of TRIFECTA, you do not know what you are missing out on.  For the first set of games, TRIFECTA went a perfect 3-0.  Surely, TRI would fail us this past weekend with a loss...surely TRI would not be perfect again!  Alas, TRIFECTA hit a triple, foreshadowing the Dodgers taking 2 of 3 from the Yanks, the Rangers reeling in the Marlins, and the Cubs taking care of the first letter of the alphabet (the A's).  There is no chance for a triple-triple, TRIFECTA going 9-0, is there?   1. Cubs (39-30, NL#2) at Cardinals (41-28, NL#1)  This is the series to watch during the work week, with a possible foreshadowing of the National League Championship Series.  Maddux vs. Marquis, Rusch vs. Suppan, and Clement vs. Carpenter are not exactly super-stellar matchups, so expect the bats of Pujols and Sosa to fly (2 HR a piece??).  Chicago presses onward for a tie in the division...   Cubs 2, Cardinals 1.    2. Dodgers (37-29, NL#3) at Giants (37-32)  The Dodgers might finally become what the West Coast wants... a Hollywood version of the Yankees.  By taking 2 of 3 from their New York nemesis in interleague play, the Dodgers are well on their way for competing for the NL West crown.  But the road goes through San Francisco, where Bonds continues to see how many balls he can put into the water.  Like our first series, the pitching matchups are mediocre, so expect a lot of action.  Los Angeles takes this 4 game marathon...   Dodgers 3, Giants 1.    3. Twins (38-30, AL#5) at Red Sox (39-29, AL#2)  This matchup is the best in the American League, as the Red Sox looks to close the gap on the Yankees.  Schilling may pick up his 9th win on Tuesday, but the game to watch will be on Thursday: Brad Radke (4-3, 3.17) takes on the knuckleballer, Tim Wakefield (4-5, 4.92).  Look for Radke to find his groove to save the Twins from a sweep...   Red Sox 2, Twins 1.   Season to date TRIFECTA record: 6-0

      Well, mainly because I'm jealous of Glen, I'm making up my own awards to give out, just this one time. (AKA Not Weekly)  One will be for pitchers: the Mr. Effective Award -- the pitchers who use the least amount of baseballs thrown for the longest amounts of innings, for the best possible results.  The other? Not pitchers, but.... anyone? anyone? Batters. -- the award for batters given out by me will be the Mr. Production Award -- the batters who get on base, score runs, and get around the diamond. A poor man's award resembling Bill James' RC (runs created) stat.  To get the Candidates for the Mr. Effective Award, I take the Top 10 lists for P/IP, K/9, K/BB, and WHIP -- anyone listed on two of these gets looked at and the list is honed down into 3 Candidates.  The Long List: -D. Wells, SD -G. Maddux, CHC -M. Mulder, OAK -O. Perez, LA -B. Sheets, MIL -R. Johnson, ARI -J. Santana, MIN -J. Vazquez, NYY -J. Schmidt, SF   The Candidates: (1) Ben Sheets, MIL 2.58 ERA, 0.91 WHIP, 15.20 P/IP, 6.28 K/BB, 9.39 K/9  (2) Randy Johnson, ARI 3.04 ERA, 0.88 WHIP, 15.00 P/IP, 5.16 K/BB, 10.07 K/9  (3) David Wells, SD 3.25 ERA, 1.04 WHIP, 13.84 P/IP, 3.67 K/BB, 3.58 K/9   Mr. Effective Award Winner: Ben Sheets -- Although Johnson gave Sheets a run for his money, in the end, it all comes down to how many runs you give up. Johnson's WHIP is amazing, but so is Sheets'. The pitches per inning are comparable between the two. The Ks per Walks lean to Sheets. And Johnson does get some revenge in Ks per game. Overall, though, Ben Sheets is Mr. Effective.   The Mr. Production Award isn't so scientific. Mainly, becuase I don't have that kind of time. So here's how I did it: I perused through SB stats, Batting stats, and all others that don't really count (RBIs, etc) and if I saw a name pop up several times, I nominate them. Hooray for simplicity.  The Long List: -A. Rodriquez -B. Bonds -C. Beltran -A. Pujols -V. Guerrero -M. Mora -J. Thome  The Nominees for Mr. Production (along with whatever categories they are Top 5 in the league with)  (1) A. Rodriquez .376 Batting Avg., 108 Hits  (2) B. Bonds .353 Batting Avg., 22 HR, 63 Runs, .798 Slg. Percent.  (3) V. Guerrero 67 Runs, 107 Hits, 67 RBIs  The winner of the Mr. Production Award: Barry Bonds. Not really even a close race either. Really, his OBP or OPS alone are enough to win, and the IBBs he gets are about as numberous as the vowels in this blog entry. The production he adds to the Giants line-up gives them all the freedom in the world to simply use money for defense and pitching. Bonds is, by far, the biggest reason the Gaints are in first place (Schmidt would be added in the acclaim, but he plays 20% of the games, whereas Bonds plays 95%). Quite simply, Bonds is Mr. Production. Mr. Baseball, maybe, too.

       A Deeper Look at the DH Rule    The Issue:   If you know anything about the game of baseball, especially pertaining to differences between the NL and AL in the big leagues, you certainly know of the DH rule. In it's simplist explanation, the DH Rule says you have a slot in your lineup for a batter who bats in place of the pitcher. That's all fine and dandy. Peaches and cream. Sunflower seeds and baseball games. The only time the DH rule becomes a problem is that the MLB has taken it in the worst possible way: the AL has it, the NL doesn't. And the controversy rears its' ugly head three times: Interleague play, the All-Star Game, and the World Series.  To everyone else, the problem is simple: we've got a lack of uniformity and when NL teams play AL teams, pitchers who have never batted have to bat, and things get goofy.  I see it much differently. By keeping the DH rule in its' lopsided manner, we're tampering with many things -- old records held by players in non-DH times, statistical anaylisis, and league-to-league strategy that should be the same all around the league. A facemask isn't 15 yards in the AFC and 20 in the NFC, and the NFL is the most successful league in the world, so I say we follow their lead.   The Numbers:    AL Pitchings' ERA: 4.52 NL Pitchings' ERA: 4.31  AL Batting Average: .271 NL Batting Average: .262   I'll show you some stuff that I found in Baseball Prospectus' League Averages. You can take a look at it for yourself  urlLink (HERE)  I would highly reccomend going there. It's a great page on a great site.    AL DH (all season) Batting average: .259 NL DH (Interleague play) Batting average: .250  Advantage -- AL slightly, but over a full 162 game schedule of interleague play, I would expect to see the NL's DH numbers go down.   AL 1B Batting average: .256 NL 1B Batting average: .281  Advantage -- NL big time - the AL can depend upon the DH for their power, and 1B for more defense, but the NL has to fish for more power at 1B, and loses some defense. As a side note to prove my point, the NL's 1B have .040 more of isolated power (all non-single hits and bases, basically -- noted "iso") than AL 1Bmen.  For the grand finale:  AL Pitchers (I-league Play) Batting average: .098 NL Pitchers (All season) Batting average: .143  Also, NL pitchers draw 3 times as many walks as AL pitchers do at the plate. Advantage -- NL big time - like the NL DH, I would expect even worse numbers from the AL pitchers if a full 162 game interleague season was played.   The teams in the different leagues are built very differently because of this rule. When they play each other, you have to pick one set of rules to play by. It's like asking a fish to wrestle a bird in the air, or a bird to brawl under the sea.   Ways to Solve It:  (1) Make the DH rule apply for ALL games. (2) Make the DH rule apply for NO games. (3) Some crazy idea I came up with that, in theory, allows the teams to pick whether they want to use it before every game. But I know it will never happen, so I'll proceed only considering Options #1 or 2   How to Choose?   Pros of the DH Rule: -Added scoring, thus, added excitement. -Giving the pitcher undivided attention towards his pitching, in theory, making his pitching better. -Allowing older sluggers (Frank Thomas, Larry Walker, Barry Bonds, etc.) to stay in the game longer.  Cons of the DH Rule: -Lack of strategy (you line up your boys, I'll line up mine, then we'll just run at each other).  [A side note on strategy, namely the All-Confusing Double Switch: I'm convinced that no one, including umpires, really know what a "balk" or a "double switch" is, but it's like a cover-all penalty... "Sir, I was just stepping out of the box to adjust my batting gloves." "Is that backtalk, son? BALK!"... But that's besides the point.]  -Tampering with old records held by players in Non-DH eras. -Covers up batting pitchers like Dontrel Willis, etc.  You decide for yourself what you think on the matter and debate your point, but I hope I've convinced you of one thing: something must be done.

      Well, I figure that from the results of my last opinion (Cumby got fired the day after, and Jeffrey Flanigan -- we all know how i feel about him -- produced a lineup in KC Star's "Top of the mornin'" section very similiar to mine) That I'd better come out with another right quick.  The focus of the day: The Minnesota Twins  There's an article over at the Hardball Times about their zany season, the inconsistancy of the bullpen, rotation, and lineup, but the seemingly miraculous season emerged anyway.  All I know is this: The Twins are 41-36, have a .532 winning percentage, and are only 2 games behind the White Sox. Not bad, not bad at all. Here's the scary part: they have 352 runs scored, and 374 runs allowed. According to Bill James' pythagorian charts  (basically, throughout the history of baseball, the # of wins squared divided by the # of wins squared plus the # of losses squared should give you your winning average, or something unbelieveably close to it)  the Twins should be giving the Royals a run for their money as cellar dwellars in the AL Central.  Their current winning percentage: 53.2% Their expected winning percentage: 46.9%  That's not very much, right? only 7% difference? Well, it's enough to earn them a distant 4th place, with only the Royals beneath them.  The discrepancy between expected win% and real win%? Luck. That's what most say, anyway. In my opinion (and this was true of last year's young Royals), it's psychology. Think about it. The only way you can win that many games, but lose that many runs is simple: win by 1, 2, or 3 runs, and get blown-out often. How do blow-outs happen? A team gets down by 3 or 4 runs and just quit. Shut down. Wave the white flag. Then, likely, they stop trying, the other team doesn't -- voila. A blowout. The Twins can win the tough ones, but when it rains in the Twin Cities, it pours.  With the White Sox trading for Freddy Garcia, the Twins' "luck" just might be running out. It's unsure at this point whether the barometer in the Minnesota locker room points to "just plain lucky" or "underrated" -- keep it tuned in, the race should be a dandy.

      Without further ado, the weekend edition of the Triple Play:   1. White Sox (42-33) at Cubs (43-35)  These two Chicago teams are playing two distinct and different styles of ball:  the White Sox are pounding the ball out of the park, and the Cubs have no doubt the best rotation in all of baseball (when healthy: Wood, Prior, Zambrano, Maddux, Clement).  Pitching wins it:   White Sox 1, Cubs 2    2. Indians (38-39) at Reds (42-36)  Who would have thought these two teams from Ohio would be doing so well this season?  This will be a fun series, but Ken Griffey is about to go nuts...   Indians 0, Reds 3    3. Rangers (44-32) at Astros (40-38)  The Rangers continue to amaze, by actually taking the lead of the AL Wild Card spot to the powerful Red Sox.  Astros are about to fire on all cylinders, however, with Beltran taking the reins:   Rangers 1, Astros 2   Triple Play Season-to-Date (Last): 9-6 (2-1)

        How We Got our Name      Powder Blue Pinetar is a blog for baseball fans of all ages, inspired by our  urlLink Kansas City Royals .   The Royals have a  urlLink proud history  that includes two trips to the  urlLink World Series , with a victory over our cross-state rivals, the  urlLink St. Louis Cardinals . Our old road jersey was in beautiful Powder Blue (hence the first part of our name, picture below). As for the Pinetar part of our name, this is a tribute to the greatest Royal of all time,  urlLink Hall-of-Famer  third baseman  urlLink George Brett .   If you don't know the great  urlLink Pine Tar Game , click on the Pine Tar bat below (now in the Hall of Fame) and read about this classic game (and view the box score) between old enemies: the Yankees and the Royals.      urlLink     urlLink

      As much of an optimist as I'd like to be, the Garcia trade for the ChiSox (thus giving them that elusive fifth starter they've badly needed) and the Royals finally giving away Beltran has sunk the KC ship. The DL is getting fuller by the second, also (Randa, Ascensio, Affeldt, Gonzalez, Appier, Guile, Hernandez, Santiago, Stinnett) -- and that's just MLB-level players.  If I'm Baird, I hand Pena a 3-year contract extension. I then get together with him and settle for what every small market GM/Manager duo has to settle on during failure: a plan for the future. Be it next year, 3 years, or 5 years from now, every small market duo has to begin planning. You've got to plan way ahead with your farm clubs, you've got to get amazing coaches, and you've got to start taking chances on young players. Follow the Indians' plan: kill off anyone over the age of 27, get good developmental coaches at all levels of the farm, and pray that you get to your target readiness at your target season. Then you follow the Marlins' lead (they've done it twice): you sign/trade for 1 or even 2 amazing vets in contract years that used to play on slumping teams (i.e. Beltran-like players) and win the World Series. Then start from scratch again.  If you want to make it simpler, you put all your resources into drafting and player development, trick young players into signing long-term deals, and make sure your stadium lease is air-tight. (don't wanna get kicked out of the city, do we?) Add in one inspirational and unconventional manager (McKeon for the Marlins last year, Pena for the Royals last year) and you've got a 1 in 10 shot of winning a Series. The year ends, you dump the 2 vets you bought, and you start from scratch. FIRESALE!!!  If I'm Baird/Pena, the plan goes like so:   (1) Rotation -- YOUNG GUNS:  Jimmy Gobble; Miguel Ascensio; Runvels Hernandez; Zach Grienke; Jaime Wright/Chris George/Jeremy Affeldt (Note: all under the age of 25)   (2) Lineup -- AGILE, MOBILE, HOSTILE:  C - Whoever survives Spring Training, likely John Buck 1B - Ken Harvey 2B - Andres Blanco (you heard me) 3B - Whoever survives Spring Training, likely Mark Teahan SS - Angel Berroa LF - Berger/Gettis/FA To-be-named CF - David DeJesus RF - Dee Brown/FA to-be-named/Matt Stairs if we resign him (Note: all but Stairs under the age of 27)   (3) Coaching -- NEW, SCRAPPY ATTITUDE  I'm sick of coaching this year. I HATE when fans blame coaches for players' shortcomings (see: my opinions on Greg Robinson), but this is too much. John Cumberlain had 2 seasoned veterans to control his young pitching staff with. He couldn't utilize either one. The Trainer (I don't care to know his name) needs to be canned, too. The ongoing joke of a DL is a testament to his can-worthiness. The Batting Coach (again, no idea about the name) is about the only one doing his job. The Basepath Coaches and Pena need to get that fire in them that they had last year. The Bullpen Coach (again with the name) doesn't keep his relievers paced right in their warm-ups, and the relieving period has been below average (although, sadly, one of the best spots in the season). When good levels of talent -- which we had this year -- isn't translated into wins, it's generally going to be bad coaching.

      Joe Randa, third basemen and defense extraordinaire, has been put on the 15-day DL for some arthoscopic surgery on his knee.  Desi Relaford will play 3B in his wake, most likely, although the Royals did acquire Bautista (a different one than from the Grimsley trade), a third basemen who has yet to escape from High-A class. Baird has high hopes for him, though:   "He's a prospect. He has above-average arm strength and some defensive ability. He has a line-drive stroke, but, obviously, not the upside of a Mark Teahen."  When asked why he did promote Teahen to the job, Baird said:  "A player with a year and a half of professional experience who is already playing at Triple-A, that's asking too much."

      Another new name for a regular article, the old TRIFECTA has been switched to a name more fitting to baseball: the Triple Play.  This is a bi-weekly snapshot of the top 3 series being played in baseball.  This feature includes a quick overview of each matchup, and my selection of how many games each team will win.  On with the show...   1. Red Sox(42-32) at Yankees(47-26)  This is perhaps the biggest rivalry in all of sports, at least so in the United States.  Cowboys-Redskins (NFL) is pretty tough, as is Oklahoma-Texas (NCAA football), North Carolina-Duke (NCAA basketball) and others.  But in my opinion, this is the best...   Red Sox 2, Yankees 1    2. Astros (39-36) at Cubs (41-34)  Houston is trying to get back in the NL Central race with their acquisition of Beltran, but it might not be enough to challenge the twin powerhouses of St. Louis and Chicago.  NL Central continues to prove to be the best division in baseball.  Look Sammy to continue his homerun display against the Astro pitching...   Cubs 2, Astros 1    3. Giants (43-33) at Dodgers (38-35)  These old New York teams continue to be powerful franchises.  Look for LA to make up some lost ground on the Giants, who have been rolling with Bonds and Schmidt posting huge numbers...   Dodgers 3, Giants 0   Triple Play Season-to-Date: 7-5

      So, Weekly 5 has been renamed the more appropriate title for baseball: 5-for-5.  Regardless, here is the top AL and NL teams to date:    American League 5   1. New York Yankees (47-26) 1st East (Last week: 1) 2. Boston Red Sox (42-32) 2nd East (2) 3. Texas Rangers (42-30) 1st West (4) 4. Oakland Athletics (41-33) 2nd West (3) 5. Minnesota Twins (41-33) 1st Central (5)   The American League 5 remains about the same, with the Rangers and A's flipping positions.  The White Sox picking up the services of Freddy Garcia will help them put pressure on the Twins in the Central.  Enjoy the age old rivalry: Yankees and Red Sox.     National League 5   1. St. Louis Cardinals (46-29) 1st Central (1) 2. Chicago Cubs (41-34) 2nd Central (2) 3. San Francisco Giants (43-33) 1st West (NR) 4. Florida Marlins (40-35) 1st East (4) 5. Cincinnati Reds (41-34) 3rd Central (5)   The National League Central is by far the dominant division in all of baseball.  Perhaps that explains why they consistently have 3 teams in the NL 5.  Houston tries to get back in the Central race with their new addition, Carlos Beltran.

      Well, following the Beltran trade, a couple of things happened -- firstly, Stinnett is out for the year. That sucks big time with Santiago not due back for another 2 months or more. Secondly, Affeldt is out for anywhere from 2-8 weeks with a strained oblique. That also isn't any fun, whenever you lose a closer semi-long term like that. Thirdly, the Royals got swept by the Cardnials. The Royals had a 1-1 tie in the bottom of the ninth, with 1 out and 2 men on, but couldn't take advantage. St. Louis quickly made them pay. The Royals lost that one 3-1, and the other 2 were blow-outs.  On a VERY good note, David DeJesus, Carlos Beltrans' replacement, got a hit in each of the first 3 games he played in (all against the Cardnials, and all against good pitchers), and collected a pair of hits in 2 of the games. It's a shame he can't erase the 1 for 21 stint he had in the bigs earlier this year, because he's hot right now.

      Moments after the 5th inning of the Diamondbacks-Giants game ended on Friday, SP Randy Johnson got in LF Luis Gonzalez' face. Gonzalez had to be held back, as did Johnson, and the two were inches away from a full brawl in the dugout. Johnson then went down the tunnel into the clubhouse and wasn't seen for the rest of the game.  Why?  Luis Gonzalez dropped the third out of the 5th inning. If that's not bad enough, here's another tasty tidbit:  the bases were loaded . A throwing error by CF Steve Finley ensued, and the bases were cleared, with the exception of Edgardo Alfonzo smirking on second base. He hit the line drive to left.  Now hold on a second.  Big Unit, listen to me closely. Everybody makes errors. Even your ugly face isn't perfect. Cy Young winner, Future Hall of Famer, sure. Arrogant loudmouth? That applies too. I'll repeat: everyone makes errors. Babe Ruth struck out in his last at bat. People aren't perfect. As leader of the team, you have every right to chew out anyone you want. But you didn't chew out Finley. He made an error. He isn't perfect. When you didn't chew out Finley, or anyone else, you lost my respect. Are you a good pitcher? Sure. Are you a good leader? Absolutely not. You were cranky that you were getting lit up by Bonds and the gang, and you took it out on Gonzalez. That shows some yellow in that belly of yours. Anyone can pick on the little guy. Congrats, you can, too. Now here's something else for you -- it was YOUR fault those men scored. If YOU hadn't allowed THREE men on base, and just gotten one of the three out, YOU wouldn't be in that situation. Instead, YOU allowed them all on, and your outfielder didn't back you up. His fault? Yes. YOUR fault? You'd better believe it.

      It's that time of the year again -- the Mid-Season Stuff! Huzzah! Well, first, let's go through division by division and see who will win each one.  AL West Champion: Oakland Athletics  Runner Up: Anaheim Angels It's tough to say no to the Texas Rangers, but rarely do upstarts sustain themselves (see: last year's Royals).  AL Central Champion: Chicago White Sox Runner Up: Minnesota Twins Only because of the Twins' RS and RA thing.  AL East Champion: New York Yankees Runner Up: Boston Red Sox Is it any question?  AL Wild Card: hard to say, but I give it to the Red Sox by default.  NL West Champion: San Diego Runner Up: San Francisco Diego's the only constant team out of them, SF, and LA.  NL Central Champion: St. Louis Cardnials Runner Up: Chicago Cubs See: AL East  NL East Champion: Philadelphia Phillies Runner Up: no idea, but I'll guess Atlanta Braves It doesn't really matter, anyways - the Cubbies will get the Wild Card  NL Wild Card: the biggest market I could find - Chicago.  Okay, now for the First Half Awards! Huzzah!   Cy Young:   urlLink Jason Schmidt   Runner up:   urlLink Ben Sheets    MVP:   urlLink Ivan Rodriquez   Runner up:   urlLink Barry Bonds    Rookie of the Year:   urlLink Joe Mauer   Runner up:   urlLink Bobby Crosby   Agree?

      In their last 50th anniversary poll thing where they poll an entire state on sport preferences as well as give a brief history of that state's historical athletes, SI gave the entire nation's results.  Now I know why Carlos Delgado won't stand for the national anthem. I'm close to riding the pine for the Star Spangled Banner myself. Well, not really. But you know what I meant.

Yet, they're also the Most Hated Team (all sports). Mr. Steinbrenner is the most hated sports figure, as well. Odd.  A couple other parts of interest: -Pro sports punched out college sports 59% to 19% as "more of a fan for" -The top 3 favorite sports to watch on tv? football (a HUGE 78%), baseball (leading the rest of the pack at 50%), and the two olympics (winter - 48%, summer - 46%). -Favorite sport to play?

       The Reds.  The Red Sox.     What do these teams have in common?    They're both successful. They both have led their divisions for a significant amount of time. Basically, good teams with very real chances to win their divisional races.    What do these teams not have in common?    The number of Save Opportunities. Sounds weird, doesn't it? Ol' Garth's off his rocker -- he's coming up with the weirdest comparisions between teams and using stats that, frankly, don't matter. I can't close this internet window quick enough! Well, hold your horses. I have a point, now. Just try to follow along and don't get lost.   Before we get anywhere, though, let's run through the requirements of a "save". According to MLB.com's Official Rule Book, section 10.20, ( urlLink LINK ), a save is awarded when the following is true about a relief pitcher:     "(1) He is the finishing pitcher in a game won by his club; and (2) He is not the winning pitcher; and (3) He qualifies under one of the following conditions: (a) He enters the game with a lead of no more than three runs and pitches for at least one inning; or (b) He enters the game, regardless of the count, with the potential tying run either on base, or at bat, or on deck (that is, the potential tying run is either already on base or is one of the first two batsmen he faces); or (c) He pitches effectively for at least three innings."    The Red Sox have the lowest amount of save opportunities in the entire league. Aside from the White Sox, the bottom of the "SvO" category is covered in filth. The Mariners, Expos, Blue Jays, Orioles, and teams of that sort surround the bottom of this stat.   The Reds are at the top of this "SvO" category. In fact, they're the only team in the entire league with more SvO's than Wins.   See where I'm getting at? Any team in the league can win - it's all in the way you go about doing it. In the words of Tubbs on Happy Gilmore, "It's all in the hips, now, it's all in the hips." Well, that quote has no relevance to what I'm trying to convey here, but it's a good movie and i try to quote from it when I can. The Red Sox win in the 7th, 8th, and 9th innings; the Reds win big early and just try to hold on for their dear lives.   In conclusion, Mr. Baird, there are more than one ways to win. Find one.

      Sometimes, batting wins championships. Mostly, though, it's the pitching. Good pitching is how small market clubs like Oakland manage to stay afloat, even constantly competitive. It's just as important for the big market clubs, who are always looking for that elusive 5th starter that completes the rotation.   So, without further ado, I give you the divisions with the most batting coaches to pity. That is, the best pitching divisions in baseball.   Worst division - top, best division - bottom  Within each division: best pitching team down to worst pitching team.

      Before I write anything, I just wanted to share this special quote with you. It's by Stephen Cannella. You can read his entire blog  urlLink here .  "To borrow a line from Seinfeld, I love the snub. (And don't you hate people who drop lines from that show into every conversation? We get it. It was culturally relevant. Ten years ago.)"  He completely blasted himself  for  us. It's amazing. The grouchy-fan-inside-of-me's work is done.  ...Anyway...  In a world full of suprises in baseball, this one is the biggest: out of the Top 5 offenses in the wnite MLB, the AL Central (a.k.a. the lowly acclaimed "worst division in baseball") triumphs over the AL East easily with 3 of the top 5 offenses. The AL East only has the Orioles in the Top 5.  It was discoveries like that which prompted this investigation. So which division really is the best with batting?  Well, we'll start with everyone's favorite: OFFENSE. (Tomorrow I get to the nitty-gritty: DEFENSE)  Well I put together the lists of best divisions... Here are divisions, in order from weakest to strongest, in terms of offense. (Also, within the divisions, the best team is at the top, with the worst at the bottom): [(MLB Rank)Team BA OBP SLG]   NUMBER SIX --- NL EAST -(16)Phillies .265 .350 .447  -(t21)Braves .259 .327 .421  -(t21)Marlins .259 .326 .410  -(29)Mets .250 .322 .414  -(30)Expos .238 .299 .373     NUMBER FIVE --- NL WEST -(t7)Rockies .276 .346 .455  -(t14)Dodgers .267 .329 .416  -(t14)Padres .267 .336 .388  -(t17)Giants .264 .354 .420  -(25)Diamondbacks .256 .318 .421     NUMBER FOUR --- AL EAST -(t2)Orioles .281 .348 .424  -(t9)Red Sox .273 .354 .453  -(t17)Blue Jays .264 .334 .395  -(t17)Yankees .264 .356 .456  -(24)Devil Rays .257 .323 .403     NUMBER THREE --- NL CENTRAL -(t7)Cardinals .276 .340 .447  -(t11)Cubs .271 .330 .454  -(t11)Pirates .271 .327 .419  -(13)Astros .268 .342 .419  -(23)Brewers .258 .331 .398  -(28)Reds .252 .338 .415     The Runner-Up...AL WEST  -(t2)Rangers .281 .340 .474  -(6)Angels .277 .334 .423  -(t9)Athletics .273 .341 .437  -(t26)Mariners .254 .323 .376     AND THE CHAMPIONS...AL CENTRAL -(1)Tigers .285 .352 .450  -(4)Indians .280 .356 .435  -(5)White Sox .279 .350 .473  -(20)Twins .262 .327 .421  -(t26)Royals .254 .316 .394    Interesting, eh? The "Worst Division in Baseball" happens to have the best offense in baseball. Fascinating...   Stay tuned. Tomorrow I'll have the low-down on divisional PITCHING. Huzzah!

      As the voting for the All Star game wound down today (Oh, don't forget the Final Vote you can make to send one last player to the AL and NL roster! What a joke.), it reminded me that this All Star Game really could use a facelift. Or just go the John Kerry route and BoSox (get the pun there? Instead of Botox, it's... nevermind.) its' face to death.   Problems:    --1--The "This Time It Counts" slogan that was thought up in the depths of Bud Selig's mind. Apparently, the winner of the ASG gets home field advantage in the World Series. (Ironically, Selig made this rule up the year after he declared the All Star Game over with a tie.)   --2--Every team gets a representitive. If they don't get voted in, the manager has to appoint them.  --3--Big market teams have well over 80% of the players from well under 10% of the league's teams. Fans from all over the nation won't tune in to watch when they know no one on the screen.  --4--All-Star Game? No. The All Popular Game. If you're well known, you're in. Ichiro Susuki has 30 RBIs (tied for worst on team with Kansas City's own Ken Harvey) and is starting RF for the AL side.    Solutions:    --1--Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just take off that goofy rule. If you want to base it on talent, why don't you base it on who has the best record or something? (phone rings) Excuse me I have to take this. (5 minutes delay) Sorry, that was Bud Selig. He told me that basing it off of who has the best record is a good idea, thus, it will never be used in the MLB. My apologies. Seriously though, you're tampering with the game. It's supposed to be fun-loving, get everyone an inning of play and smile real big. If I'm Joe Torre, I stick a fork in Selig's ass, yank Ichiro from the starting lineup, and keep my best players in for 9 innings. Can someone say Pedro --> Rivera???  --2--As a small market fan that I am, it's especially hard to say this, but, no, the little guys don't deserve to have representitives when they're no good. Ken Harvey has 30 RBIs and will be among the elite. A joke.  --3--I have no clue how to fix this. Maybe take the vote out. Or do the opposite of the "Every team must have 1 player" rule, and just put a cap on things. There's 3 Yanks in the in-field. Maybe 3 from each team is the max.  --4--Only allow fans who answer 5 out of 10 baseball questions right to vote. Simple stuff. "How many feet to first base?" Then you eliminate the stupid fans who go to 1 game a year for the Fourth of July fireworks and vote for ICHIRO because he's just so darn cute and adorable.

      Welcome to another rousing round of Triple Play, our bi-weekly examination of the various MLB series being played and which three you need to keep your eyes locked onto it.  This past weekend we hit a Triple by choosing all three series correctly, bringing our season record to 12-6.  A .667 winning percentage is good enough for the playoffs, right??? Right???   1. Oakland A's (AL#2) at Boston Red Sox (AL#3)  After the Red Sox got swept by the Yanks, it looks like Boston has the fire back in their bellies to make a run at trying to catch up with Goliath.  Oakland is playing the best ball in the AL, winning their last 7 of 10.  Zito vs. Wakefield (Tuesday) and Pedro vs. Redman (Wednesday) are both games to follow.  The Red Sox will get back into the AL#2 spot by weeks end...   Athletics 1, Red Sox 2.    2. Cincinnati Reds at St. Louis Cardinals (NL#1)  The Cardinals are playing some outstanding baseball, even despite some lackluster pitching (minus Mr. Chris Carpenter's first-half season madness).  The Reds wield some pretty powerful bats as well, and may bring the Cards back to earth this week...   Reds 2, Cardinals 1.    3. New York Mets at Philadelphia Phillies (NL#4)  This NL East matchup pits the hot Mets going off against the under-achieving Phillies.  The Mets seem to be picking up pace with the recent acquisition of Hidalgo, but their momentum will not let them carry the series.  The problem is, the Phillies will only be able to draw this one, ending in a tie...   Mets 2, Phillies 2.   Check back Friday for the weekend edition of the TRIPLE PLAY. TRIPLE PLAY Season-to-Date Record: 12-6

      There is hope throughout the baseball land once again, that the mighty Goliath can indeed be slain by little old David.  The downtrodden, overshadowed Mets swept the invincible Yankees this week.  The sad part is, it has not affected the Yanks position in 5-for-5, our weekly rankings of the top 5 teams in both leagues:    American League 5   1. New York Yankees (50-29) 1st East (Last week: 1) 2. Oakland Athletics (46-34) 1st West (4) 3. Boston Red Sox (43-37) 2nd East (2) 4. Texas Rangers (45-34) 2nd West (3) 5. Chicago White Sox (42-36) 1st Central (NR)   The suprise of course was the Mets sweep of the Yanks, but before that the New York Yankees dismantled the Red Sox, sweeping them in 3 games.  That pushes down Boston one notch in the AL 5 with the Athletics grabbing the 2 spot with a record of 7-3 in their last 10 games.     National League 5   1. St. Louis Cardinals (49-32) 1st Central (1) 2. Chicago Cubs (46-35) 2nd Central (2) 3. San Francisco Giants (45-37) 1st West (3) 4. Philadelphia Phillies (43-37) 1st East (NR) 5. San Diego Padres (44-37) 2nd West (NR)   The Mets got back into the NL East race by sweeping the Yanks, but not well enough to crack the renowned NL 5.  At this point, I hope to see the Cubs pitchers facing off against Pujols, Rolen and Edmonds for the NL Championship.  What a way to really light a fire into the rivalry, huh???

      Frankly, I'm sick of all of these pity parties for Royals "phenom" Zach Grienke. He's 1-5 and he's gotta be more talented than that, right?   Well, no.  Zach Grienke is decent. I might even venture to say he's good. But he's vastly unproven, and has a lot of growing to do. In his last appearence, he blew the game and the Royals lost 3-2. But poor ol' Grienke, the young kid, he didn't deserve to lose... Right?  Well, not really.  When the lackluster Royals offense produces 2 runs early in the game, you HAVE to hold on for all your life. Grienke held down the fort for awhile, but - lo and behold - he, too, is a mere human. He gave up the runs and somehow that's the offense's fault.  Wins are generally the offense's work, and loses are the pitcher's fault. It's true, the Royals' offense has only provided 1 win for Greinke. No dispute the offense hasn't been there for Grienke. However, instead of pushing the loss down to a set-up man or other reliever, Grienke supplies the opposition with all the runs they need. His ERA (3.58) is indeed good, but not at "savior" level which many people in KC believe he's at. In 3 or 4 years of serious training, Grienke will be a fine pitcher, even a great one. But right now, stop the pity parties. He's a major leaguer, so I expect major league production. 5 losses in 6 decisions is pathetic.  Muse on this: if anyone but the prized prospect of Kansas City would have a 1 out of 6 chance to win every game, would they still be on the rotation? Surely not.

      As a baseball fan, and an amazed spectator of Barry Bonds, I'm getting sick and tired of watching coward pitchers pitch right around him. I know it's the smart thing to do, especially when Bonds' supporting cast isn't exactly a top-notch crew, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. We're about halfway into the season, and Bonds is fixing to shatter his personal season record (his best is 198, he's got 119). I believe he's also 4 walks away from the all-time career walks record, too.  Here's a gander of what would happen if Barry Bonds would have never been walked this year.  Actual Stats: G//AB//R//H/HR/RBI/TB/ BB //SLG//AVG  71/175/63/62/22/45/139/ 119 /.794/.354   Estimated Stats with no walks:  G//AB///R///H//HR/RBI/TB/BB/SLG/AVG 71/294/106/104/37/76/234//0/.796/.354    Actual Stats +/- Est. Stats  --At Bats + 119 --Runs Scored + 43 --Hits + 42 --Home Runs + 15 --Runs Batted In + 31 --Total Bases + 95   Theoretically, slugging and batting average would stay the same, which they did.  Estimating that Bonds would get about 4 more home runs in 10 days (before the All-Star Break) and would maintain his pace for the second half of the season, Bonds would again break his own single-season HR record with 76.  41.5% of Barry Bonds' potential has remained untapped largely because of the walks he has earned. The fans in San Francisco and the fans in cities Bonds travels to don't pay money to watch Barry trot down to first. They want to see the World's Greatest Hitter... well... hit. I'm not sure if there's anyway to stop pitchers from walking great batters, or if we should even try to stop it,  but it is sad to see that while the strategy of the game leans towards walking the big-time sluggers, Barry Bonds' show-stopping ability is wasting away.

       Do you remember when that trade went down? It was official. The Yankees could buy anyone. Even the Pope. Imagine that... Your attention please, now pinch running for the New York Yankees, Saint Pius XII!!!    Anywho, back to the topic. The A-Rod/Soriano, New York will be the end of baseball, Red Sox packing their bags to go to LA or whoever else would have them, sickening, frightening, payroll-expanding trade that happened so late in the off-season that it wasn't even shown in all of the major baseball video games.    Well, turns out Soriano has a pretty solid bat, too. Let's review the trade, see who has won thus far.    (AVG/OBP/SLG///FLD%)   A-Rod with the Rangers in 2003: .298/.396/.600///.989   A-Rod with the Yankees in 2004: .270/.361/.510///.965   Also, even though he's with a vastly better team, A-Rod is projected to finish the season with 2 less RBIs than last year.    Alfonso Soriano with the Yankees in 2003: .290/.338/.525///.975   Alfonso Soriano with the Rangers in 2004: .289/.330/.466///.967   Also, even though he's with a worse team, Soriano is projected to finish with 19 more RBIs than last year.    Basically, Soriano has taken a hit in slugging (like A-Rod), but (unlike A-Rod) maintained batting average and on-base percentage well.    Also, as a team the Rangers are doing much better. Having all of your resources and money go into one player doesn't work for the small markets.    Another thing, Soriano's about 8 years younger than A-Rod. To me, that's a big advantage to the Rangers.    Let's give it the rundown.    2003 Production -- winner: Yankees (A-Rod had best #s)   2004 Production -- winner: Rangers (Soriano had best #s)   Total team change, 2003 --> 2004 -- winner: Rangers   Age -- winner: Rangers    Although I slanted it to look like the Rangers won (which they did), the Yankees also won. The Rangers were able to dump off a monstrous contract, get the best second basemen in the game, and win a lot more games. The Yankees got A-Rod, and it didn't hurt their bottomless budget. A win-win.

      Although I don't know why anyone would go to lengths to figure out how bad their team is, the KC Star's "Sports Daily" has, in their true style, done so. The Royals are doing bad. Duh. But here was something else that was actually interesting:  In the NBA, the LA Clippers haven't been in the post-season since 1993, worst in the NBA.  In the NFL, the longest drout belongs to the Cincinnati Bengals (1990), although they are outliers because they almost made it to the big dance last year and the next worst drout (which belongs to the S.D. Chargers) year is 1995.  In the NHL, the longest drout has been traced back to -- you might sit down for this -- 1997. The New York Rangers belong to that drout. 7 whole years. Wow.  In the MLB, the longest post-season drout can be traced back to 1981. 23 years. 23 years. Twenty. Three. Years. The Montreal Expos (poor guys) hold that shameful streak for their own.  The whole goal of the chart was to show how bad the Royals were (again, I don't get going to all that trouble to state the obvious), and KC's drout can be traced back to our lone World Series win. Game 7 against the Cardnials in '85 is the last time the Royals tasted the  good  October.  Instead the chart showed me how lopsided baseball really is. 1981, Expos; 1982, Brewers; 1985, Royals. That's compared to 1997, Rangers; 2000, Panthers; 2001, Penguins. Hey, Selig, you taking notes?   Well, I'm done here, I just thought I'd share that clipping with everyone. Interesting stuff. Sad stuff.

      It is about time that  urlLink Mike Sweeney  earned his keep.&nbsp; Making $11 million this year for the Royals, many have called Sweeney to be shipped off to another team so that the Royals can rebuild.&nbsp; Many critics (including myself) note his poor play in the field, thus the need to permanetnly shift him to the despised DH slot (though, if the AL got rid of this stupid rule, we would not have this argument).  Though after  urlLink Beltran  was traded away, something happened with our blessed little Mikey.&nbsp; He realized that he had to step up, otherwise he might find himself on the trading block.&nbsp; Actually, I think the real reason of his recent success is two-fold: 1. He his finally healthy again (unlike half of our normal roster), and 2. He has been married long enough to get over the honeymoon effect.  I kid you not about the marriage effect.&nbsp; The casual observer only has to note the powerful  urlLink Tiger Woods ' downfall, and realize that this occurred (yep, you guessed it!) after he got married.&nbsp; I think what happens is after they get married, they have less to prove, so they are less driven to perform at the top of their game.&nbsp; Some wake up out of this, and some do not.&nbsp; Perhaps that is why Lance is doing SOOOO much better as he takes his record sixth  urlLink Tour de France  victory... he got divorced and is now dating  urlLink Sheryl Crow  (he won last year by just over a minute, his smallest margin of victory).  Regardless, Sweeney hit 2 homers and 7 RBIs, so things are finally looking good for his role on the team.&nbsp; Oh, and  urlLink for the record , Sweeney was batting DH.

       Royals fell to defeat against their AL Central division opponents tonight, with the  urlLink Tigers win 4-2  ( urlLink AP Story ).&nbsp; Darrell May pitched a pretty effective game, going the&nbsp;complete game&nbsp;and giving up only 4 runs (3 of which were homers).&nbsp;  urlLink John Buck , the catcher the Royals acquired as part of the Beltran trade went 0-for-3, dropping his season average to .161 (that is 39 points below the Mendoza line!!!).&nbsp; I wonder if the Royals plan to just let him take his knocks and hope he doesn't get too down on himself, but for our futures sake, the Royals management better be careful.

        Retaliation is over-rated   &nbsp; A lot has been made of the Royals' hit batsmen this year. There was even a front-page (of the sports page) report about it in the Kansas City Star. Basically, the Royals are getting hit by pitches a lot, and doing very little in retaliation. Ex-Catcher and Royals manager Tony Pena is constantly scrutinized for this, but he always says, "we don't play ball that way." And you know what? Good for him.  Here's how I see it. Giving up a free base just to improve team morale is outlandish, outdated, and dangerous. You'll see a lot of old-time managers ordering the pegging of the oppositions' star sluggers.&nbsp; Guys like Lou Pinella, Jack McKeon, and the such...&nbsp;Sparky Anderson and Earl Weaver&nbsp;were&nbsp;pros at it. But just like the run-it-up-the-middle approach in football, it's getting old real fast.    If you want to retaliate, how about being a man and start&nbsp;striking people out?    &nbsp; Not only is retalation very stupid, but it's very dangerous. I pray to God that it never happens, but I'm just waiting for the day that a batter is paralyzed or killed because of the opposing manager's refusal to be the bigger man. As pitchers get more accurate and pitches get faster, it's only a matter of time. &nbsp; Baseball is a game of nostalgia, and it's no more evident than in the practicing of beaning in retaliation. I'm&nbsp;so proud that our manager has taken a step up in the game of baseball instead of backwards. At the end of the day, there's no question who's the bigger man and who's the best sportsman.  Thank you, Tony Pena.

       Garth and I found ourselves at the Royals game this past Saturday, and we enjoyed the Kansas City bats (finally!) coming alive against the Twins. Dee Brown came up with the bases loaded, and with 2 strikes, took a Radke pitch just over the right-field wall for a Grand Salami.     Then a disturbing thing happened a couple innings later...Brown approached the plate with the bases loaded again! We wondered aloud if anyone had hit two grand slams in the same game before. Fortunately enough, Brown squeezed out an infield single, knocking in at least another RBI.    But then the luck just got a little over-the-top. Brown came up, and lo-and-behold, the bases were loaded yet again! While the Royals mopped up on the Twins, Brown struck out, but the question was raised: Anyone ever hit  THREE  grand slams in a game before???      Well Garth found the answer  urlLink HERE . For those with no time, 12 batters have hit two Grand Slams in one game, while none have ever done it thrice. Interestingly enough, of the 12 batters in all of Major League history, 5 of them (that is 41.7 percent for all those math illeterate out there) have happened since 1995. Either pitching got weak (expansion in 1993 and again in '98) or performance-enhancing drugs became more readily available (or the likely answer, both!).

         Randy Johnson Rumors Swirl    &nbsp;  Apologies for all the random photos, but we wanted to get some up to bring a little more life to the home of all Powder Blue fans.&nbsp; Anyway, the All-Star break is over, and the 2004 season is beginning to really heat up.&nbsp; The main speculation is where is Randy (Johnson, of course) going?&nbsp; I pray that the Yankees do not get to enjoy his services.&nbsp; I would love to see him in a Cards or Red Sox uni.&nbsp; Regardless of where Randy goes, 5 for 5 presses on, striving to predict the post-season teams and how well they will do.  &nbsp;    American League 5      1.

      Here are a couple games on tap for this evening that you will not want to miss...    urlLink Cubs  (53-46) @  urlLink Brewers  (48-50)   urlLink Greg Maddux (9-7, 4.03)  against  urlLink Ben Sheets (9-7, 2.45)   Maddux will be going for his career victory 299. He has an 8-2 lifetime mark against Milwaukee, with a 1.19 ERA. He has been brilliant in his last two starts, throwing a complete-game shutout against the Brewers on July 17, a 5-0 Cubs win, and beat the Reds in another complete-game performance -- a 13-2 Cubs victory -- on July 22. Sheets was noticeably angry after leaving his last start in St. Louis, mad at himself for allowing four runs. He is 0-2 since the All-Star break and the Brewers offense has gone scoreless in both of his starts. (Courtesy of MLB.com)    urlLink Twins  (55-44) @  urlLink White Sox  (52-44)   urlLink Johan Santana (8-6, 3.44)  against  urlLink Freddy Garcia (8-8, 3.18)   Santana is coming off a no-decision, in which he struck out 10 against Tampa Bay, and is 4-1 with a 3.75 ERA in night games. Despite the White Sox putting runs on the board behind the right-hander, Garcia still has the American Leagueys worst run support per nine innings. Garcia is coming off of a strong effort against Cleveland, improving his record to 4-1 and ERA to 3.15 with the White Sox.

He gave up three solo home runs and has surrendered a team-high 23. But he's done well since starting the season 2-8, winning five of his last seven decisions. &nbsp;Brazelton has pitched well his last four starts but has nothing to show for it. He has not won a games since June 30 but, with a little luck, he could have had at least two more wins. (Once again, courtesy of MLB.com)

      To sum up the last 24 hours if you are a Royals/MLB/NFL/Other-Sports-Like-Cycling fan such as myself, you have been seriously intrigued. The highlights:      urlLink Lance won  his record-breaking sixth Tour de France.&nbsp; No suprise here!&nbsp; I consider him to be the best athlete, pound-for-pound, of our generation.&nbsp; We will let history decide that question.  The  urlLink Red Sox went after A-Rod , and then they finally defeated the blasted Yankees.&nbsp; Perhaps this is the motivation that this erratic team (and sport)&nbsp;sorely needed.  Ricky Williams, star running back for the Miami Dolphins, is retiring.&nbsp; That is right, I said retiring!&nbsp; After 5 years, and at the age of 27, he has had enough of the NFL life.&nbsp; Head over to&nbsp;our KC Chiefs/NFL blog,&nbsp;" urlLink Red Zone Blitz ", to read more.  The Royals lost  urlLink both   urlLink games  in their double-header against the mighty Cleveland Indians.&nbsp; No suprise here!  After all that, I really do not have much to say.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; What a day to be a Royals/MLB/NFL/Other-Sports-Like-Cycling fan such as myself!!!

       Serrano takes on Mr. Garcia of the White Sox today. Hopefully the Royals can continue their winning ways from yesterday. Also on tap, the young phenom Peavy will take on the resilient Clement of the Cubs in this Wild Card battle. The Cardinals take on the World Series champions Florida Marlins, in what may be a transferring of the National League mantle. The Cardinals look virtually unstoppable with the likes of Pujols, Rolen and Edmonds.  Here is the latest scouting reports from  urlLink MLB.com  for games you will want to follow today...
