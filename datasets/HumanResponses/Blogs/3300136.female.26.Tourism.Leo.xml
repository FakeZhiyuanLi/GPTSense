      Well, memories will stay the same. Wherever you go, they will be "just" memories. Happiness and sadness color my life. They will be "just" memories when I recall them.  Lately, I recall about Norway.  We had a great time up there.  December 2003, the winter time.  We insisted to go to Norway and struggled with cold and snow. I "just" can recall the memories. Just like a sea, they rush in my brain. Just like a movie, they play beautifully in my head.  Once upon a time in my life, in Norway, at a small island near Oslo, by the shore.  Beautiful view, great panorama. We could only make pictures of it, but could not bring it home.  The sunset, orange and blue blurred into one great spot spreaded up in the sky.  By the shore. "When we were sad, please remember this very moment together, this beautiful time and place. Take it as the sweet memory of us. If I knew you longer, I would have asked you to be part of me, here, and at this very moment".  Wind blew its power and forced us to leave. Powerless and forceless. We were too stubborn to leave. Our love was greater. Lying back on stones, watching the sky, and silencium. Cold and wind, it was 10 degree under zero, maybe. But, they could not stop us on imagining, dreaming, and reaching the future.  I want to go back there, one day, with you. And only with you. Lord, it was marvelous! I miss everything.  Each senses. The smell of the sea, the falling leaves, the blowing wind, the roaming of the shore, the cracking stones, the rushing air, the kissing. Each feeling. The longing, the loving, the loved, the praying, the holding hands, the solitude moment,the hugging , the conversation, the silencium.  Every single minute. With you. Yet I know, the show must go on. The journey should process. The time runs. The life progresses.  Memories will be "just" memories. But, I pack them in my head, unwrap them when I am longing and place them as one sweet piece of my journey. Never ever never can I forget them. Once again, my journey will continue. There will be another journey and another journey and another journey. In another place, another part of the world. Another step I am looking forward to. Not to leave behind the sweet memories, yet to enrich my journey.  Life as a journey with God's hand holding me tight.  I believe in Him, as I believe in my, our future.  God blesses you, me and us.

      Aku ingin mencintaimu, dengan sederhana dengan kata yang tak kan pernah diucapkan kayu kepada api yang menjadikannya abu  Aku ingin mencintaimu, dengan sederhana dengan isyarat yang tak sempat disampaikan awan kepada hujan yang menjadikannya tiada  (Sapadi Joko Darmono)

      saat ini ku datang, membawa keluhku padaMu sungguh berat, beban yang menghimpit hati dan jiwaku kucurahkan sluruh hatiku  dan ku dengar suaraMu berkata padaku  "Ku tak pernah tertidur, tak pernah lalai tanganKu slalu menopang dirimu  percayalah padaKu, datang padaKu Ku slalu setia padamu  saat kau tinggalkanKu Ku slalu setia padamu saat kau melupakanKu Ku slalu menunggumu kembali"  (VOG,tak pernah tidur)

      time flies. i can't desist. struggles with problems. puzzles in life.  life,.... sometimes it is tiring. it is tiring to reach the dreams and to keep on dreaming.  yet, dreams make me alive and keep my vibes on and hypnotize me and fill up my soul. soul is fragile. feeling is hurted and hurts.  pain is such a traffic, come and fro.  solitude rejects me, fights me, squezzes me, yet throws me down.   heart is flame, flamable. flamable till it ruins.  happiness ruins me. it visits me, many times, uncountable. loves waltz me.  they rush, they crush, they rock, they break, then, fly. perfect! i say. gorgeous! i admit. cry! i do.  and pray, i be.  believe and trust and surrender i, am rotten. i kneel.  by: Wenny (Wageningen, May 11, 2004)

      Masih (Sahabatku, Kekasihku) (by: Ada Band)  http://www.musikmu.com/audio/index.php?sort=2&page=1  Rasa Cinta yang dulu t'lah hilang  Kini berseri kembali  T'lah kau coba lupakan dirinya  Hapus cerita lalu  Dan lihatlah  Dirimu bagai bunga di musim semi  Yang tersenyum menatap indahnya dunia  Yang seiring menyambut  Jawaban s'gala gundahmu  Walau badai menghadang  Ingatlah ku kan selalu setia  Menjagamu  Berdua kita lewati  Jalan yang berliku tajam  Resah yang kau rasakan  Kan jadi bagian hidupku bersamamu  Letakkanlah segala lara di pundakku ini  S'tiap waktu wajahmu yang lugu  S'lalu jagai langkahku  Telah lama kunanti dirimu  Tempat ku kan berlabuh  Cahaya hatiku  Yakinlah kan kekal abadi s'lamanya  Seperti bintang yang sinarnya terangi  S'luruh ruang di jiwa  Membawa kedamaian    It was my song a year ago,...  when we met,  when every thing began,  when each element in me started,  when all bursted into one,  when dream stepped in our lives.
