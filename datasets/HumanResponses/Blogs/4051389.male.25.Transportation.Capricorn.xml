      There's a new movie coming out called  urlLink Cellular .  Basically, a kidnapped police officer gets through to a guy on his cell phone and asks him to help her out.  All I can say is that if the person she called has  urlLink SprintPCS , she might as well just give up now.  Her call will certainly be dropped!

      As my friends and my waistline are well aware, my favorite meal is dessert.  So, I consider myself a bit of an expert on all things sugar-related.  Recently a friend of mine mentioned to me that he had seen  urlLink Reese's Pieces  with Peanuts in his Chicago office, and since I enjoy both Reese's Pieces and M&Ms with peanuts, I thought I should try this new product.  Well, two weeks later, the new RP variety made a cameo at my office out in the suburbs.  From the title of this post, you've probably gathered that I did not care for this latest Hershey creation.  Luckily, it's a "limited edition" so it won't be on the shelves forever, but I urge you not to give into the flashy packaging and intriguing idea!

      Back in college, my friends and I celebrated Hostility Day on Thursdays.&nbsp; Essentially it was a way to blow off steam from the rigors of Wake Forest.&nbsp; So, in the spirit of Hostility Day, I'd like to share " urlLink Ode To the Morning ."&nbsp; It's a completely random rant, but it always makes me laugh.&nbsp; Enjoy!

      My parents, my mother especially, raised me to stay away from the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister and I were restricted to 1 hour of TV a day, and over the summer we had to read to earn TV time.&nbsp; Is it some sort of act of rebellion that I enjoy watching now?&nbsp; Anywho, I would like to take this opportunity to recommend  urlLink The Amazing Race  because it is the greatest show ever.&nbsp; Here's why:   1.&nbsp; No voting off.&nbsp; Teams are eliminated because they come in last on a certain race leg.  2.&nbsp; The editors don't take the show too seriously  3.&nbsp;  urlLink The host  is hot  4.&nbsp; You can read the funny recaps at  urlLink Television Without Pity &nbsp;after you've watched the show or to catch up if you miss a week  5.&nbsp; You can discuss the show with me!

      So I signed up for this just to comment on another blog, but why not jump right into sharing my thoughts with people who didn't ask for them anyway?&nbsp; As a character in Annie Hall once said, "I'm shallow and don't have anything interesting to say."&nbsp; Still, perhaps something witty will come to me eventually.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; If it does, I'll be sure to share it on here!   Interesting thing:&nbsp; when I spell-checked this entry, the only error it pointed out was the word "blog."&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; I understand that it's not a word, but I would think this particular website would allow it.&nbsp; Crazy Internet!

So we all know John Cusack's sister Joan from her own acting career (shared a few movies with her brother, made some annoying US Cellular  commercials that are so bad that you decide to stick with SprintPCS, etc.).  Can you name the other 3 Cusack siblings?  For bonus points, complete this song lyric from the movie "Say Anything": "Joe lies.  Joe lies...when he [blank]s."  Please feel free to post your favorite John Cusack movie as well...I'll give you a hint: it's Gross Pointe Blank ;)

      So the latest Princeton Review rankings are out!  urlLink Check out how your alma mater compares ...  Some findings of note:   urlLink Wake Forest  is Number 6 in "little race/class interaction." Come on, folks, surely we can get that to number 1...stop talking to the poor people! You're better than they are! I guess "poor" is relative at Wake: usually it's the person driving the pre-2002 BMW :) Odd that WFU didn't make  urlLink this list  isn't it?   urlLink NCSU : Number 17 in the "Campus is tiny and/or unsightly" category. Sure, that's not an encouraging finding, but have you seen  urlLink Harrelson Hall ?? Designed by some brilliant engineering minds, and yet it's sinking into the ground. The only reason to go to that part of campus is to sit in those giant ear things (or " urlLink sound reflectors ")! At least they're not  urlLink number 1  in that category, however!

      Today's trivia quiz is brought to you by Nissan, without whom I would not have my 1999 Maxima SE 5-speed with which to get to work!  So, because I spend hours on the road in the evening and morning on my commute, I can quasi-identify with the title of the recent Celine Dion song "I drove all night."  Of course, we all know Celine's a big phony because this song was originally recorded by what 1980s-not so much 90s-back in 2000s pop star?  BonusStalkerPoints if you can name the color of my Maxima!  Good luck!  "What happened to us, Philip?"  "We just grew apart, Celine Dion" -- South Park

      Back from hiatus and brought to you by ExxonMobil oil, it's the trivia quiz!  Sadie leaves Topeka, KS heading south (or "down", depending on how you're holding your map) on I-335 and continuing on I-35: The Kansas Turnpike. In Wichita, she'll get off on US 400 heading west. Sadie's Toyota Corolla has seen better days, but thanks to a recent tune-up, it gets about 30 miles per gallon. Since she fills up her tank after using exactly 10 gallons (don't even ask about her OCD -- she's getting it under control!), in what city will she first stop for gas? AND, what distinction does this city hold? You may also speculate as to how many Vivarin Sadie will pop to stay awake on this boring trip across Kansas!  Good luck! Perhaps I'll post hints in the comments section if people request them.

      Here's something fun to do in your spare time:   urlLink The USGS orthophotography site!   You can check out the instructions, but basically you can find aerial photos for anywhere in the US for free.  Thanks, USGS!  Big Brother is watching you...

      Sorry it's being posted so late, but today's trivia quiz is brought to you by the George Washington Historical Society.  According to a law in Vermont, what is it illegal for a wife to wear without express written permission from her husband?  Good luck!

      This trivia quiz is brought to you by a button I saw today that said "ABBA: Anybody but Bush Again."  It's more of a free-write, so in other words, you can't find the answer on Google!  Abba was a great band from our past, and they recently came back into prominence with the musical "Mama Mia."  Make up a good phrase whose acronym would be "ABBA."  Good luck, and be creative!

      Today's trivia quiz is brought to you by the urge to fly.  Please do not try jumping off tall buildings!  We all know that Chicago Midway Airport's 3-letter code is MDW.  It's fairly simple to see how they came up with that one.  However, Chicago O'Hare Airport's code is ORD.  What is the origin of this code?  Why not OHR or something?  Bonus points if you actually fly to O'Hare to find the answer to this question :)

      This article just in from  urlLink Fitzgerald, GA . Beware the chickens, as they have been known to fly through lawyer's office windows! Sometimes, I really miss the south! Thank you to Jenny for bringing this to my attention.  As one of my college band cadences used to start: Drum line: "Have y'all heard about that quake?" Band:  "Yes...we...have...CHICKEN!"

      This one's a bit of a cop-out, but it's brought to you by the lovely weather we've been having in Chicago lately!  Name the movie, the actor or actress who said it, and the actress about which it was said:  "I think we should shoot her."  Good luck!

      As I commute in the mornings, I'm often a tad sluggish. I am simply incapable of going to bed at a reasonable hour, so I'm dead for the drive to work. Sure, this is not a good idea. In the winter, I go to the gym before work so that I will be more alert, but right now sans gym membership, I'm just using the caffeine method (Thanks,  urlLink C2 !) As a public service, I thought I'd post the link to a website about  urlLink drowsy driving .

      So I thought I'd start posting random trivia questions for you to ponder. Everybody should exercise their minds, right? Today's question is brought to you by NCAA basketball withdrawal.  Name 5 NCAA Division I teams whose primary mascot does not end with the letter "s." Hint to get you started: Syracuse is no longer the "Orangemen."  Good luck! I'll be posting the answer the day after the quiz under the "comments" section.
