      So, I talked about Beirut a few posts ago.  Where to begin?  Ah, yes.  MATTYHO.  MattyHo is a friend of ours from the northeast.  Actually, he went to college in the same town that my dad lives in, which made us instant friends, bonding over such luxuries as TastyKakes and Steel Force at a certain  unbelievably good  amusement park.  So he went to this very nice private university where the game originated, and now the entire student body plays this game 24-hours, nonstop.  Nice imagery.  I hope my unborn children do not spend my hard-invested cash on such things as a year's supply of large solo cups and ping-pong balls.  Anyhoo, MattyHo taught us all how to play, and it's become a squadron tradition when there's nothing else to do out here in the prairie.  So this is how you play: you have a makeshift table, usually 7-9' long and 3-5' wide (depending on who you talk to), painted in some identifying and meaningful manner to the owner.  It's basically just a sheet of plywood, set upon something else--another table, 4X4s, whatever.*  You set up 6 solo cups, each 1/3 full of beer, in a pyramid at either end, with the point facing your opponent.  You also need a rinse cup of water at your side, because balls fall on the floor, and you don't want that grime in a beer you will eventually be drinking.  There are two balls in play, and you throw at the other person's cups, trying to get the ball in.  Once a ball has landed in a cup, the other person has to drink that beer.  If a ball lands in an empty, the shooter drinks a beer from their own side.  (Optional: when two shots have been made, you can rearrange the cups into a diamond formation.  After another, back into a pyramid with three cups.)  When there's only one full beer left on both sides, you go to sudden death, removing all other empties from the table and centering the last one.  Sound easy?  Give it a shot and let's see how well your motor skills hold up after a few rounds.  For doubles play, use ten cups instead of six.  Teammates each take one shot when it's their turn.  There are many, many, many (endless) correlaries and addendums to the rules, but I didn't include them here because I simply don't know them.  Or remember them, if I've ever been told while playing.  *Do a google on "beirut table" and see what you come up with.  It's amazing, the things some people will do with plywood and paint, all in the name of drinking.

      Just taking a break from (finally) switching my closets around--winter stuff in the guest room, summer stuff in our room, putting cedar balls all over the place, etc.  Thought I'd write a blog while I relax before doing The Shoes.  It's going to be a big job, as my winter and summer shoes are climbing all over each other on the closet floor--everything is really dusty down there and probably needs a cleaning while I'm at it.  I told my mother I have 18 pairs of flip-flops last week, and she gasped, absolutely horrified, as only a liberal social worker can gasp at her decadent Republican shopaholic daughter.  Well, the joke's on her, as the count is now up to 21, after a well-timed shopping excursion proved that Reefs are half-price at the mall.  New shoes!  Wheeeee!   Had an early start to the weekend with the annual squadron picnic at the lake on Thursday.  It was an all-day affair, with a roasted pig (yes, an entire pig), sand volleyball (never one of my favorites), waterskiing (I was shameful, as predicted), jetskiing (whee), and my new favorite: waist-deep-in-the-water-frisbee!  There was a lot of fun and I got nice and sunburned.  No scolding, please.  I wore waterproof SPF 30 sunblock, kept applying all day long, and STILL got fried.  It's the prairie, people--there's not much you can do about the relentless, evil sun out on the water.  Actually, I didn't get it as bad as some of the hotshot single guys who either slathered on the SPF 2 oil or didn't put on anything at all.  Those stupid-heads thought they would get a good tan, and now they're just hurting and itchy.  Duh.  Stayed until about 8 pm, then decided we were RAVENOUS from all the water sports and being out in the sun all day, so a big group went to dinner at the Roadhouse.  Afterwards we were all so tired we couldn't keep our eyes open at the table.  I grunted my good-byes, came home, and was in bed by 11 PM.  It was a long, fun day--one of the ones that makes you glad you have the friends you do.   Woke up early on Friday, just did housework and laundry before going to Bunco with friends.  Bunco is a women's dice game where you win money...but it's NOT gambling, apparently.  Whatever.  It costs $5 to play, and last time I won around $20.  This time I won $10.  I call that gambling.  Man, this paragraph is boring.  Sounds like I'm some stupid housewife.  Wait, I am a...  Um, never mind.  Random facts about today: 1. I'm totally ill and could really use some sort of put-you-to-sleep-so-you-don't-feel-a-thing-type medicine.  Unfortunately, I can't possibly go to sleep yet, because I have a Physics test in the morning.  Bah. 2.  People who have many, many more than 15 items in the "15 items or less" line at the supermarket are going to hell first.  I mean, before ANYONE else. 3.  Physics really is NOT going to help me later on.  I'm 26, and I know how to walk, breathe, not jump off buildings, make sure I wear clothes out of the house, etc.  Actually, I know much more complicated things (AutoCAD, anyone?), but I'm just talking about the basics, here.  I really do NOT care that my weight is different on the moon, but my mass stays the same.  Hateithateithateit. 4.  OK, I'll end things with a positive: I have not had to do my least favorite chore of watering flowers in DAYS.  The only nice day we've had recently is the day at the lake, and every other minute it's been raining small mammals.  Yay.

      That year, however, did teach me a lot about what I wanted to do in life.  I tried substitute teaching a few times, and decided I was right to quit the English program...I do NOT, in any way, shape, or form, want to be a high school English teacher.  Kids are great, but I don't want to be in charge of shaping their minds.  They would spend all day writing stream-of-consciousness journal entries and listening to music while I took a nap.  This is not a good thing.  So in the few jobs that I managed to obtain while I waited around to move to the next duty station, I happened to discover that I absolutely loved interior design.  I've always wanted to change rooms around, paint the walls, do something crazy with an old lamp...I even drew floor plans on graph paper when I was little, asking my mom what she wanted in her dream house and drawing crude sketches of the kitchen island she would patiently describe to me.  When we finally were stationed here, and we knew we'd be here for a while, I started taking a few classes.  For my first couple of semesters, I took it nice and slow, not knowing whether I would actually enjoy studying ID or if I only liked the idea of the career.  Turns out, I don't only enjoy it...but I'm good at it.  I've never been so happy as I am when I get a new assignment with some horrendous problem that I have to solve, like "Such and such law firm in Charleston has hired you to redesign their small office suite, and has given you carte blanche in the design scheme.  The building in which they currently reside is a historical landmark, and so you must research the local building codes to discover what you may do to such a site.  The lawyers want such and such amenities and X amount of additional square footage, but you may not actually add on to the building--any additional square footage must be obtained by redesigning the interior."  And so on.  I will finally graduate from the ID program in May, a full 4 months after my husband leaves for his next duty station.  We are planning for me to rent a small studio while I finish school, and I must say, I'm looking forward to it.  Please don't get me wrong--I love my husband very, very much.  But we were married so young--a month after his 23rd birthday and a month before my 22nd--and I think we both feel a little cheated out of an independent, singleton existence.  I'm already looking around for a studio and getting very excited about scouring the city in search of ultra-modern furnishings to play with.  That's all for now.  If you're still reading, thank you for being so patient.

      Maybe I should backtrack a bit.  I've been reading other blogs on this site, and only just realized that I may have been impolite, or at least careless, in not first introducing myself, my situation, and why I've decided to blog.  After all, who wants to jump into someone's story without knowing who and what they're reading about?  (Upon a reread, I've decided to do this in two parts so that you can take a break if you get bored or need to stretch your legs.  I apologize in advance--I am long-winded and like to tell a story.)  So, here we go.  My name is Emily.  I'm 26 years old and have been married to Travis, an active-duty Naval Aviator, for 4 years.  Yes, I am a Navy Wife.  It sounds a whole lot more glamorous than it really is--people always assume that my husband does some terribly dangerous job like dropping bombs directly into Saddam's lap (a la Hot Shots), and that I spend my days wrapping bandages and looking forlornly up into the sky, waiting patiently for my hero to come home.  Uh, sorry to disappoint, but nothing could be further from the truth.  For almost three years, my husband has flown a plane that's stationed in the middle of the US and flies over both coasts...so we're landlocked and haven't smelled the ocean in forever.  Terrible situation for a gal who's always wanted to live by the sea.  By the end of this year, however, my husband will move back to the place where we briefly lived when we were first married, which does happen to be on the coast...and I am not going with him.  That's something else I should tell you: even though I'm 26 and should have gotten my degree a long, long time ago, I quit school when my husband (then-fiance) graduated, because I didn't enjoy being an English major anymore and didn't want to waste the money on tuition and books when I could have a beautiful wedding reception instead.  How incredibly stupid of me.  Since we spent the first year of our marriage moving around from base to base for Trav's pilot training, I didn't have much chance of finishing any kind of degree, much less keep a steady job.  The shop owners and companies in those little military towns know better than to hire a military wife, because we're all going to be gone in a few months.  I don't blame them, but it did make for some boring months here and there.

      Man, what a long weekend.  And it's only Saturday!  So far this weekend we've had the squadron picnic at Lake Thunderbird, a Green Light at the Skipper's house, a Bunco game, and quite a few games of Beirut.  Tonight we have Trav's indoor soccer game at 9:30 PM, and tomorrow we go to the Redhawks game with Cherie...if the rain ever clears up.  Wish Trav luck--he's trying for another hat trick tonight!  Every time I can't make it to a game, he pulls those three goals from out of nowhere and I never see them.  I've been there for the games when he makes 2, but he can't ever get that third one for me.  I think he's getting superstitious about my presence at the arena!

      Well, my next-door neighbor is pregnant. And while a person may think that's reason for celebration and general happiness, in my utterly small and feeble mind, it's not.  This woman is a single mother of two young girls, both of which, she has informed me, have different fathers. This woman is an officer in the military, raising these two girls on her own, with no help at all. She lives hours away from her family, and the fathers have, so far, never visited in the year she and her daughters have lived here. She works early hours so she can be home with the girls when they get home from school and daycare, and she does everything she possibly can with them over the weekend. I've seen her attempt a very nice--although completely amateur--fast pitch at the older one, who is entranced with all things baseball. She fills up the pool and gets in and splashes with them (personally, I am much above such nonsense--or rather, will be, when I have children of my own), then dumps it out, long after the girls have forgotten the amusement, and goes in to make dinner. She rather reminds me of my own single mother, whom, even if she really didn't have time, always  made  time for us and our current hobbies, amusements, and obsessions. I feel for my neighbor, and always have since she moved in. I've even offered to babysit (horrors!), so she could go out with her girlfriends some evening...Lord knows, my mother never got to do anything fun. Probably because she didn't have nice friends like me.  Smirkety-smirk-smirk.  Anyway, I just spoke to her outside for the first time in about two months.  She was looking quite beautiful, almost glowing, in fact, (waitaminute) and wearing a loosely flowing top that just screamed "Maternity".  Oh, God.  There was a man out in her front yard mowing the lawn, and he waved harmlessly as he passed.  I felt a sudden rage build up inside of me.  How   dare   he impregnate this poor woman!  OK, that's going a bit too far.  I do not blame the entire male gender for babies being born, or anything so silly.  But why did he have to ruin their nice little, "getting back on our feet after the last asshole left us" kind of life?  Well, he really did look nice...  Shit.  Time to smile back, or  I'll  be the asshole.  He stopped the mower, extending his hand, and said hello, nice to meet you, blah blah blah.  The girls, hitherto invisible, jumped from their hiding place onto his back.  Both at once.  Aaaawwww.  If that's not beautiful to see, I don't know what is.  Oh, wait.  I do know: the fact that he started wrestling with them and letting them chase him around the yard.  That, my friends, was beautiful.  And so I started wondering what was happening to my convoluted value system...could he possibly be a nice person?  Perhaps not a man who would leave her on her own?  I started to get a fuzzy feeling.  Then my neighbor ruined it by speaking sharply to her daughters, telling them to leave him alone so he could finish his work.  What the---?  I don't know what to think about this, besides the absolute worst I've ever thought of any member of my gender  (Could she be using her body as a weapon?  Could she be using him to gain security?  [Evidence certainly seems to support this theory, with two children of different fathers under the belt...]).   Oh, fuck a duck, this is so completely not my business.  Nowhere even close.  I shall start to think about something else altogether.  Riiiight...now.  But if I never say a single thing beyond this, please allow me to say: Lord, help her.  Please. And if you're quite impressed that I actually used the word "hitherto" in a sentence, well then, yay for me.

      My best friend in the entire world is my godbrother. I've known him since the moment of his birth, we went to the same parochial school, and we try to get together at every available opportunity--not an easy feat, considering the fact that we live 6 hours apart. We find this incredible combination of absurdity, biting cleverness, and similar theories which no other friend can possibly match (...so don't even try, if you know what's good for you). We've never been angry with each other--at least not seriously--and have unashamedly admitted that we are each other's platonic soulmate, forever, regardless of what happens in our lives. He is the kind of friend for which you would gladly lay down your life and your pride, time and time again.  And he is hurting, and I can't stand it.  He is in love with a friend, and wants to tell her. Not a good idea, as far as I'm concerned. It never works out, and then everyone is uncomfortable and angry, and wondering why the instigator had to go and complicate everything. But then again, can one possibly turn away from their feelings? The answer is "no", in my opinion. So I can only hope the very best for this fool's errand, this Shakespearean tragedy in the making, this downward spiral.  I wonder if this girl knows how wonderful he really is. I wonder if she understands how much he has thought and thought and then thought some more about not ruining their friendship. I wonder if she is like me, unable to say no and hurt someone like that...but then I wonder if half the problems I face would be easier if I were a little colder and unfriendly, able to detach myself from interested parties' feelings and sear them with a single look of contempt. Perhaps things would be easier if I were just cruel.  Why do I always hurt so much more for other people? I hurt on my own behalf, too, but then drop the idea rather quickly, because I'm usually hurting because of my own stupidity or reckless behavior, and I refuse to waste my time with retrospective forehead-smacking. But for other people...I am a regular Mother Theresa, taking on their pain and holding it close to myself until I am consumed with remorse, guilt, shame, sadness. I'm like Heath Ledger's character in that movie "The Order" (which was utterly unremarkable, save for this analogy), in which he takes a person's sins away from them at the moment of their death so that they may ascend to glory unfettered. Is my concern for him borne of a selfishness that whispers, "Don't let yourself be caught up again," or of true compassion?  No conclusion to be drawn from this. Just some painful thoughts in which to wallow while I contemplate changing my entire personality for the billionth time.
