      I had quite a wierd dream last night. I was given the task of collecting all these keys from various locations, and once I had the last one I somehow managed to lose them all. Upon losing them I found myself inside a falling  lift/elevator, but survived by tieing my trouser belt (I dont normally use a belt!) to the ceiling and hanging from it, thus avoiding the impact. Now, im not sure if this piece of physics actually works in reality, but I hope I never have to find out ;) I am however intrigued about the meaning of this particular dream.

      I must be geting old. I'm not as quick to hear about bands that I like, as I used to be :) My friend at work lent me the  Unleashed Memories  CD of this band, and I thought it was only their first, when in fact they have at least two others. The music is very similar to Evanescence, but the female singer's voice is not as strong as Amy Lee's. That being said, the combination of female and male vocals adds something extra to the sound. From this CD the stand out tracks for me were  When a dead man walks ,  Purify  and  Cold Heritage . By the way, did I mention they were Italian? Dont worry though, most of their songs are in english ;)

      I told my closest friends at work today about my decision to go for surgery. They both thought I was nuts as they saw nothing wrong with my nose (Is it really all in my head? hmm) but they too have known me for 4 years now, so maybe they just see past my appearance too. Anyway, it was a bit of a relief to tell them, and now my mind, as it has a habit of doing, turns to the more practical issues of the decision. How will I get home from the surgery? Do I need to have someone stay with me while i'm recovering? How long do I need to take off from work? I also realised that it might be an opportune moment to quit smoking, as after the surgery I will only be able to breath through my mouth. I'm not sure i'm talanted enough to breathe and smoke at the same time :) Roll on September 2nd so I can get some of the answers sorted out :)

      I took a big decision over the weekend, and acted upon it today, by organising a consultation for cosmetic surgery for my nose. I spoke with my parents about it yesterday, as I was afraid they might be upset that I was disowning my family traits (we have a lot of people with big noses in our family) but they were supportive, if not a little surprised. I guess they dont notice my facial features as being odd, as they only see their son and nothing else. Anyway, by the end of the year I could have a new, more compact nose. One that doesnt cause people to stare so much (I hate being looked upon as some kind of freak). I first thought about surgery about 5 years ago, but now I feel its the right time, plus I can easily afford it now. I have no expectations that it will turn me into a more attractive person, because it will only be 'cosmetic', but I've become so self-conscious about it in the last years that it will surely make my life a bit more barable. I just now have to get my head around looking like a car crash victim for the weeks after the surgery, but hope my first consultation with the surgeon will ease my nerves about it. I look forward to a more pleasing profile :)

      I'm a happy bunny today. Arsenal, a.k.a immortal champions, got off to a flying start with a 4-1 win away to Everton, and the best thing was that Henry didnt score any of them. We had 4 different scorers...Bergkamp, Reyes, Ljungberg and Pires. Two more games and we set a new UK record for being unbeaten (43 games).

      Ok, so this is not really part of my 31 songs, so I guess I really am blogging afterall ;) Its just while I was on holiday in Portugal, I was introduced to a Portuguese band called The Gift, who really deserve to be more known throughout the world. From their latest album, Film, there are two songs I just cant get out of my head. They are "Front of" and "Me, Myself and I". Sonia Tavares, the lead singer, has such an amazing and distinctive voice. I cant however include either of them in my 31 songs, as songs that invoke memories are not strictly allowed, although that wont stop a certain someone from cheating ;)

      Ok, so I'm a Blogging newbie...be gentle. The reason I started this Blog is based on a conversation with my friend Rita, regarding the book "31 Songs" by Nick Hornby. We decided to write about the 31 songs that have moved us, in the stylee of Mr Hornby, and a Blog was the best way of doing it. I'm not sure at the moment if I'll do them all at once or one every once in a while (i.e. when I get the time), but I'm already drawing up my list. If it becomes as addictive as they say it does, i'll continue to Blog on other topics...beware ;)
