      I have a feeling that this is gunna be a shitty day...I dunno...just a feeling. I got up like 2 hours ago...and then i just layed in bed for a while...just thinking...then i got dressed and went to visit my dad at the cemetrey..i dunno...just esspically today i'm not sure why but i really miss him...makes me wonder how different life would beif he were still here...if i'd be happier...i dunno...honestly i would trade everything i have or would ever in the future have just to see my dad one last time...i would trade all the people in the world, all the things that i have...everything...just soi could see him one last time...so i can properly say my good-bye to him...i miss him so much...i hate being home alone, i know i have my dog and everything...but i just wish my dad were here...like when i was little and i came home and he would be here...i just wish i could give him one last hug and a kiss...why must people take away the people i love the most? I wish i had a normal family...with a mother AND a father...i envy those who have a full family...and also those who have more than one father (like a step-dad). I don't think anyone is ever going to realize the pain of loosing a parent unless they have themselves...loosing a close uncle or grandparent is so different...no matter how close you may be to them, you are never as close to them as your parents...whatever...i just want a hug...i just wanna see one of my friends or something so i can get a giant hug...or just to talk to them...whatever...i dunno...i just don't like being alone at home...i know i should go and work out but i'm just not in the mood for it right now...i just want a friend or someone....

      Well its 4:14am at the moment...and i just got off the mic with Matt...we had a nice 2 hour convo on the mic:) although it was a little fustrating to talk to him in the beginnning cause i was trying to get stuff outta him, about what he truly thought about me, whether or not he liked me. He sai dhe was different, and didn't like expressing his feelings to people, he doesn't like sharing his emotions to the world...so i just asked him simply to tell me if he liked me...and he said i knew the answer,and i said i sorta do, but i wanna know the actual answer instead of assuming, he never ended up telling me but he made it clear i guess. Heres the convo for those who care:  matt says: no need to get stressed now is there baby {OuT iF nEeDeD cAlL 905-580-9982}   WoO hOo VaL's AlL tAnNeD!    ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«   AsIaN/iRiSh  PrIdE! says: the longer that your taking tonot tell me i dont' think you like me....at this point i think you don't me, and thats what i'm going by {OuT iF nEeDeD cAlL 905-580-9982}   WoO hOo VaL's AlL tAnNeD!    ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«   AsIaN/iRiSh  PrIdE! says: and yes there is a reason to get stressed matt says: think what u like val matt says: why would i bother txtin matt says: c mon online when im fucking fucked matt says: talkin on mic matt says: why would i bother doing these things matt says: its not like i have all the time in the world to waste on a person i dont even like matt says: u get the drift {OuT iF nEeDeD cAlL 905-580-9982}   WoO hOo VaL's AlL tAnNeD!    ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«   AsIaN/iRiSh  PrIdE! says: but then it makes me think cause your probably doing the same thing to other people i don't know if yout talking to other people you know matt says: i talk to no one online matt says: im never online unless im talkin to u matt says: i have about 9 contacts matt says: 3 of which only ever come online {OuT iF nEeDeD cAlL 905-580-9982}   WoO hOo VaL's AlL tAnNeD!    ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«   AsIaN/iRiSh  PrIdE! says: ......and the other 6? matt says: just kinda linger there on my account matt says: doing nothing matt says: i dont use the net like i used to back in the day val matt says: i only come on to check my mail matt says: which is from u most the time matt says: n if u are online i stay and chat matt says: if not then i go  so that was what he said to me...so i guess its safe to assume then?  *shurgs* i dunno...but yeah...so we left that subject alone...but i dunno...we got to talking...we talked about drugs lol...an odd conversation...i dunno...it was still nice though...fustrating cause my mom's sleeping so ihad to be quiet and his voice kept cutting in and out...a little fustrating but meh! i'm still happy... My eyes are getting bags cause i can feel them, but i'm still talking to Mike right now...he wants to come down and see me right now since we're both up...even though its 20 minutes away...silly tard...by the time he gets here it'll be 5am...grrr i wanna see him...but i have to sneak outta my house...OH THE BACK DOOR IS STILL OPEN!!! SCORE!!! hmmm*valerie ponders* okay she needs to stick her dog somewhere where he won't bark. Okay Val shall venture off and try to figure something out with him...oh well look at that pretty sun...alright! val is off into the wonderful world, and shall write in this later...what time is it...bloody 4:26am...alright!

      I had a very good night tonight with my dear friend Cisco. We didn't meet up till about 9 ish, which is usually really late for me but actually it worked out REALLY well today cause i was out helping my mom gardening and cutting down trees (thats right mother nature! i destroyed a shit load of trees!) and by the time i was done it was like 8:00 which is perfect timing cause i went inside had a superb shower and was on my way to meet Cisco. We went glow in the dark mini golfing (only thing to do in oakville) and then after that we just chilled out in my car, talking and stuff...i know it sounds super boring but i had a lot of fun:) hey come on! he had an accent! i could listen to him talk about shit and i would be happy to hear it all cause of his sexy accent. So we had an excellent night and everything went well. Tee hee he paid for mini golfing and i got spin an wheel and he got a damn free cookie and i got a damn cupon for 15% off golfing. So yeah i had a really good night, nothing went on...my mom never called my cell phone once cause well i earned the night away from yelling or screaming..OMG! MY MOM VACUMED THE HOUSE AND I'M NOT BEING YELLED AT WHEN I GOT HOME! tonight was an awsome night and i haven't had one of those in a while!  Considering i didn't get home till like 12:30am i didn't get yelled at or anything at all...my mom was in a happy mood so thats awsome... Well i'm on the phone with my sexy friend Chris and he needs someone to talk to  so i shall save my sexy man! ta ta people! Good night!

      So Bren came to my house just about an hour ago, to drop off the nail polish that i left at his house...then i had a talk with him. So apparently my boyfriend thinks that he's worthless, ain't that GRAND?! So because i'm talking to other guys and what not makes him feel worthless, but i never said to him, that did he ever think about how he was making me feel? The fact that i have all these guy friends is cause they make my feel important to them, that out of the blue they would call me or text message me or drive down here to see me for only an hour or so.  At times the way that Brendan makes me feel is that he considering i see this kid once a week and i talk to him once a week doesn't make me feel very good o very important to him. Despite what he may tell me that he misses me and what not...if he misses me does he know i'm only 15 mintues away? or simply just a phone call away? but no...he decideds to tell me when he finally gets to see me. so Whatever! I gave him my blog site cause he wanted to read my thoughts or whatever, so he better not flip out about anything, these are my thoughts that no one can change, when i write in here i'm not going to consider the thouhgts of other people in here...i don't care if i make spelling mistakes or whatever...so piss off... My feelings are still mixed and not sure what the hell i wanna do...i still do like Bren don't get me wrong, but theres all these other emotions that are running through my head.  He also decideds to tell me that he misses my closeness and whatever, aand with him saying that it seems as if he is putting blame onto me, as if i dont' wanna be close with him. If anyone knows me they know that i'm quite an emotional sorta touchy person, and for me not wanting to touch my own bf tells you something. Hearing that he told me that he doesn't trust me is enough. I heard him say enough stuff to me that hurt me and me simply blowing it off i couldn't handle it anymore. Him saying to me that he didn't go for the welsh girls cause i was so much closer to home, and also the first things out of his mouth when i went with his family to pick him up at the airport was "the girls there were so hot!"  and just alot of other things that he knew bothered me. So even at times when he says to me that he thinks about me or whatever, i find that hard to believe, cause if he was thinking about me he would know that certain things hurt me, yet he still goes ahead and does it.  Brendan is a different kind of boyfriend, never have had a bf like him, i'm use to hearing my bfs voice before i go to bed, instead now i hear the voice of one of my sexy friends Cisco with his hot spanish accent. Like he's not obligated to call me, i never even told him to call me at times, yet he still goes ahead and calls me, to ask how my day was, how is everything going, and at timmes even asking what i'm wearing! lol but yeah.  So i guess i'm sorta saying that my own boyfriend is not making me feel very significant.  I told him that i don't know how long its going to take for me to get close to him again, because of all the boyfriends i've had i NEVER had one tell me that they don't trust me. It hurts, it even hurts to talk about it. So yeah, *shurgs* i dunno....mind still thinking, not sure what to do. Still thinking about my dream boy, my "date" with Cisco tomorrow....crap what am i gunna wear?!, uhhhh school, summer school, if my dear Sabz is alright cause she seems a bit down, and i dunno...just shit going through my head, when the hell is Matt coming online?! grrrrr anyways...i'm heading off now. Thinking about more shit in life, and when is everything going to come together?  Ta for now

      So it turns out my brother has JUST left work so i got me some time to write shit again, oh i have a feeling i'm going to be using this A LOT! So yeah...theres basically my problem, is i know that i have a boyfriend, but at the same time theres this guy who i've known so long and i'm getting REALLY strong feelings for... Yes my boyfriend is an idiot, had a nice talk with his father, whom also agreed that he ain't the brightest star in the sky when it comes to common sense.  Now for me, the number one thing in a relationship is TRUST, and i finally heard out of the mouths of my "boyfriend" that he doesn't trust me...i just felt like someone stabbed me in the fucking back, that hurt like a damn bitch! He hasn't had a REAL gf before...so i guess thats an excuse. But yeah, now see Bren, when it comes to situations where its about friends and what not, he doesn't have many, although he may say that he does, he doesn't, he's always likea buddy of mine and this and that, but he doesn't have many friends, he doesn't have a best friend at all...which is weird for me cause i'm quite a social person, and i flirt with guys, but it doesn't necessarly mean anything...its just flirting, nothing serious, i may grow feelings for them but all in all i know that Bren is still my boyfriend. He goes all silent when i tell him things, like if i'm talking to a guy or something....blah...mom in the room...gots to go...oh wells i shall write later

      Alrighty, seems as if this is my first entry...and just basically i decided to use this "blog" yes i put it in quotes is because i got a lot of shit on my mind, and i dont' feel like writting this out on paper...fingers move faster and what not...but either way people won't be reading it anyways so its all good! But its here FOR the public to read anyways.  So heres my situation. I'm torn. As I always am. Too many thoughts. Okay I know this is stupid, and I'm simply going to tell you now that this is mostly about boys. Okay the situation is this, I do have a boyfriend, and his name is Brendan, I met him through one of my very good friends Laura, which I am without a doubt very thankful for. Me and him have been going out for about 5 months now, 6 coming up...then 7...then 8....okay well i'm sure you get the point, well anyways there is a slight problem with me, and that is that i get tired of boys VERY easily, which explains why my longest realtionship is the one right now, and before this one, my longest relationship was 3 months. Its just me, I need to be constantly entertained, so which is why i either get annoyed of the boy or i just plain and simple am tired of him. Now this happened to most of my ex boyfriends, well actually lets go through them  Andrew - first boyfriend, stiff (but we were young), total sweetheart(gave me a ring:)), still friends with now, slowly gaining a crush on him...but we'll get into that later Andy - got bored of, total sweetie, turned into a pot head though Raf - i'm not even going to start with him, he is one in a million and also a guy who i still love dearly *muah*  Chris - sweetie, got bored of..., and another long story to it Shane - omg, my black man, love him to death, but i wasn't being fair to him, Tyler - oh tyler, lol got bored of him by a month and a half, sweet and a little heartless Brendan - my current bf, surprisingly i'm not really tired of him...just tired of the stupid shit that he does all the time which gets incrediably fustrating all the time cause he's gotten to the point where his only thing to say is "i'm sorry"  So those are all the exboyfriends, now for the past few months, i've gotten to know a few boys, some more than others. I'll start off with the simpler, less complicated boys. Uh Mark, oh Mark *sniiiiffffff* YUMMY! does he ever smell YUM! but yeah, he's more of like a "friend with benefits" I actually met him through Brendan, cause i went to a retreat with him at his camp and its was a Christan camp, i am NOT a churchy god this god that sorta person, so i was a little bored till i met mark, who was forced to go to this camp deal-o so me and him got to talking and since the retreat back in February we still keep in touch. Go down to see him occassionally. Yes Brendan wasn't a fan of him, probably cause he knew taht Mark was "my type" of guy... and then we got a few other ones that linger in my mind from time to time, like Mike, Cisco, Marek, those are other ones that i won't really get into at the moment cause they aren't my majour problem yet, their my little crushes, some which i like more than the others.  But theres one guy that stands out to ALL the guys i've EVER dated...whom i have known for 3 years, 4 years soon. To me and most of my friends he is known as "My Dream Boy - Matt" now...i've known him since i was in grade 9, and i am in grade 11 going into grade 12 now, and we still talk. Now when i was younger and more stupid when i met Matt i used to have a list of my "dream boy" which consisted of (Blonde hair, blue eyes, six pack, tattoo, piercing, ACCENT...) and the list goes on and on and on and when i was younger Matt fit every little part of that, and from that point on we always talked all the time, but unfortuantly for a period of time we stopped talking, more so because i was being a little bit of a bitch and didn't wanna talk to him cause he had a gf, so i was playing jealous...yes i was young and stupid leave me alone! Oh oh, see i forgot this one part, HE LIVES IN FUCKING ENGLAND!  yes...my dream boy....my dream boy since i was 13 is in fucking England! So anyways yes, we just kinda talked all the time on the mic and what not, i was ALWAYS happy to see him when he came online, back then and even now, he is the highlight of my day when i get to talk to him.  So for the past year and a bit, my feelings for him are growing stronger and stronger, i know this sounds bad and whatever, but i find that i'm more in love with Matt then i am with my own boyfriend, as a matter of fact i don't love my boyfriend, i take love quite seriously, i don't say it unless i mean it, and i honestly mean it when i say to Matt that i love him, but i don't think he exactly realizes that at all. He says it too, but in my eyes i'm just thinking, blah whatever he's just saying that to me cause i said it to him. But yeah, i care about this kid so much, and i know it sounds stupid cause i met him over the net and what not, but i'm truly getting stronger feelings for this guy. Like he sends me text messages whenever he gets home from work which is at 6am...and i dunno....like we talk more and more often...i think about him quite a lot even when we're not talking on the internet, which is why i have spent 15 minutes writting about my dream boy. And i dunno what to do, he tells me that he's going to come down to Canada and visit me...actually he promised me many times that he would come down and visit me, and i feel stupid cause i'm actually believing him...but should i be feeling stupid? i certaintly hope not...i care about him so much, more than he would ever realize. *sighs* i keep all his text messages on my cell, so if i'm having a shitty day i just read them and i smile... Anyways yeah...i dunno what to do with him...i like him a lot...as a matter of fact i love him...i duno what to do!

Yes anyways, at first Val was pissed because people continually steal shit from her car...she has just lost her rear mud flap on her car so she has to go and get THAT replaced, yes....*shakes fist* stupid people stealing Val's shit!!  Anyways but before that of course i had wonderful summer school for the whole day...but you know what? i absolutly love my class to death! Yes i have the sweetest funniest guys in my class and i love them all! We just all sit and chil around...Yeah i ended up drawing all over one of the guys Sami's arm....at first i wrote "I love penis" but he started scribbling that out so i kept trying to write it...so he got to the point where he wrote in big letters "I DO NOT love penis" and i kept trying to take away the not....but yeah....being his body and all he kept pulling away making it difficult for me to scribble...but yeah so i used up a lot of energy from that class the whole day cause i was laughing the whole time...so i got INCREDIABLY exhausted after school....Sabz can verify that and say so....kinda got cranky too ...anyways yeah i was getting more pissed than every because i brought back the peat moss that i bought for my mom and returned it...then i went to the body shop and asked them if they have mud flaps to sell there and their like no you have to go back to the body shop so i was getting fustrated...and i dropped Sabz off at her house and she forgot her keys so yeah....i was also getting pissed cause i wasting gas too....driving back and forth...anyways so i droped her off and went to Canadian tire and it turns out that they don't have it so i had to go B ACK to sabz house to drop her off and again wastin gas but whatever...so then i went and headed off to Rob's....i didn't really wanna go because i was thinking that if i went then it would look like i went to see Richard...but i really wouldn't care if i did see him or not..i just want my baby fixed...so i went there....didnt' bother to go in the shop and i went into the office to look for Rob. So i was in the office and the secritery was paging him to come...but while i was waiting Richard walked out....but i thought it was a coincidence and that he just happend to walk out but he said that his buddies saw me and told him and he came out purposely to see me...so i was talking to him for a bit and i was ranting a little bit on him too cause of my car...but i dunno....i just looked at him and his sexy eyes and it just smiled...but anyways his dad came and we went out to check out my car and Richard came too....so we were outside talking for a little bit and then his dad(rob) went back in and called the company to give me a quote in the price....so while then i was outside talking to his son...same ol' flirting and everything...so yeah....we were talking and his dad finally came out to give me the price quote and he told me....and thne Richard started begging for money to eat lunch...poor kid....i feel so bad for him...he was working the whole day and when i got there...he's like, waht time is it? Noon? and i was like...omg...its 3 somthing darlin' and he's all surprised cause he's been workin all day...poor thing hasn't eaten a bite of anything...i felt so bad....i offered him the mints in my car though! but yeah....so i gave him a dime...which his dad found on the floor and gave it to me...lol so then his dad was leaving cause our conversation was done...and i was about to go and Richard wouldn't let me...he's like wait, stay for a bit and talk....so i stayed....ended up staying for like an hour and a bit....we were outside talkin and stuff....OH OH OH OH OH! something made me VERY happy about him though....he has a treasure chest line! he was for some odd reasons rubbing his tummy and lifted up his shirt but i didn't get a good look so i told him to show me again and he went all shy and wouldn't....so i stupidly agreed to something which i took back right away...cause he was telling me to show him mine, but i had a full body skirt so i couldn't cause i would be lifting up my skirt! anyways so yeah....i stupidly said "k lemme see yours and you can see under my skirt" but i QUICKLY took that back and he's like NO NO NO NO NO YOU ALREADY SAID IT!! but anyways yea....i finally got to see.....but yeah....so then he jokingly tried to lift up my skirt....not seriously....but yeah...he ended up pushing me against my car and pretending to lift it...then he kissed me *blush* and yeah...that was for a bit...then his stupid dad came out and told him to do stuff for him...and he had to leave so i gave him a hug good bye....but yeah....the secritary told him to do stuff before but he kinda ignored her...but yeah... but when we were outside he was like "so when you gunna go out with me?" and yeah...i didn't really answer him i was more like "I dunno" and twirled like a girly girl...but yeah....gave him a hug and he's like i'll call you...but yeah....when i first saw him he didn't full out say sorry for apologizing but he told me that he didn't have time to do anything at all cause he was working with his dad the whole weekend through...and the only time he had time for himself was when he was out with his sister who bought him to a male strip club lol....poor boy....but yeah....he was a cutie....but yeah i totally understood that he didn't call me....cause he didn't ahve time to call...which is totally fine...i wasn't asking for an explaination but it was nice of him to give me one anyways....so yeah....see....i think i'm falling for this kid...but i know a shouldn't....but i cna't help myself....his such a damn cutie!!! most gorgeous eyes in the freakin world!!!! i dunno....just thinkin about him makes me smile for sure:)&nbsp; i dunno...seems sorta like a playa to me....*shrugs* but he told me that after our date he went home and his ex girlfriend was waiting for him and she wanted to grab her stuff and leave...and yeah....i dunno....i'm smiling again....so he made my day....he definitly helped start my week off great!&nbsp; BLAH! boys!! them silly boys and their ways!!!! grrr!! awwww....*smiles* it doesn't even bother me anymore that he's a smoker....he still smells damn good after....he has the sexiest softest lips....*drool* but yeah...i dunno....the only thing i think bothers me about him is that he admits to being REALLY and Bad tempered...like his doctor even suggested him to go to anger management...i dunno...but yeah....he told me that he would never hit a girl or anything....and to a certain degree i do believe that.....but i think i'll truly believe that when i see it with my own eyes... to see him quick tempered and then then see waht he does...i dunno....argh....but he's so CUTE!!! ARGH!!! it should be a sin! Ah must work on essay due tomorrow now! ta!

      Honestly my days are getting better and better as the days go on:)&nbsp; Summer school is getting better and better, the people in my class are super nice and actually super cute:) which is totally awsome. I dunno just everything seems to be gonig well at the moment. Scares me about when its going to go downhill...but honestly i deserve a longer happy days because&nbsp; i've had shitty times for like 3 months straight. Anyways yeah....theres one really cute guy in my class...i think his name is Mark...and yeah, he's a cutie:) and another guy that sits behind me and is quite cute...i think the main reason why i like him is cause he remindes me&nbsp;of the chris i made out with at the bowling alley...and yeah....he's a rocker type of guy....got the huge shaggy hair....more hair than sabz for gods sake! lol but yeah...the guys are awsome...the other people are awsome too...anyways yes...tomorrow...it seems as if Sabz has a date which i must attend also to see if i like this kid...but i can already tell you now that i don't....i'm just going for my dear sabz...then after that i'm going to go and get my hub cap for my car...and hopefully go back to Senca and get it put back on properly....so yea....i guess we shall see shant we? :)&nbsp; Meh....i really need to ACTUALLY go to the gym some time soon...getting that "i'm feeling fat" again....so oui....i actually need to go to the gym :) bah i must leave now and type up my english crap!

      i am on fucking cloud nine baby....i've had the best day today!!! haven't had a day like this in AGES!! Richard actually called me...surprisingly....cause he was a player type...at least he seemed like it...but he called me and asked me to meet up with him...and so i did...told my mother that i'm going to the "gym" and i met up with him at like 6:30....and we hung out till like 9....it was so much fun....he was a total doll...cause he said that he'd treat me to dinner...we went to Demities instead....yummy! we got a black velvet and pink slips...so yum...and so much fun with the whipped&nbsp;cream;) tee hee *blush* yeah...he was super yum....yeah...blonde hair blue eyes nice gorgeous toned arms, and nice football build...but another thing that he got was a lotta scars...although he hates them and he was cute and kept hiding them but to be honest i found that damn hot...i dunno...guys and scars makes them seem so much more dangerous....tee hee i got a nice little massage from him *blush* yeah...i dunno....i had a lot of fun though....too bad he's a smoker....he had like 3 ciggys while we were together....but he only had half of the ciggy....so he had like one and a half ciggy....i dunno....he's a total player but another thing was that kinda freaks me out about him is that he has a REALLY bad temper...like REALLY bad...he gets into fights on a daily basis....hence all the scars that he's got all over his arms...but he's like the kinda guy that is my type...like the bad boy type ya know? smoker, fighter, and we asked each other all these questions i dunno....but yeah....*shurg* before i&nbsp;left (which i didn't wanna only cause my&nbsp;stupid mom called and asked me to come home)&nbsp;he asked if he could call me again and i said of course you can, and hes like alright i definitly will call you...and gave me a nice long kiss....yeah...so me superb happy:) &nbsp;cloud nine baby!&nbsp; Blah blah, i know i'm stupid, whorey, slutty&nbsp;and whatever, i did kiss him...and i dunno...like i knew he had a girlfriend so i guess its his decision on whether or not he'd cheat...anyways we were eating&nbsp;at demetries and he asked me again if i had a bf and i said no we JUST broke up like yesterday, and he's like yeah yeah i know what you mean, me too...she came to my house and grabbed all her stuff and left....which i was 100% sure he wasn't telling teh truth...but its just i remember him talking to one of his friends about it...and he said something to his friend about his girlfriend going to his house and leaving last night...so i'm not really sure...either way i went with him still having a gf...but then we ate and we talked more and more and after we decided to go for a walk, which was fun....i think we walked around the amc complex about 15 times....but anyways yeah...we would be talkinga nd walking in the middle of the road, and he's a little oblivious and when i saw a car come i would pull his arm to the side with me so the car could pass and when i did that he'd give me a flirty look like " ohhhh" sorta thing ya know? so i said to him "i'm pulling you aside cause i dont' want you to get hit by a car!" and obviously as a guy he said something macho "no, no car would hit me" and then he said "anyways i should be protecting you" and he grabbes my hand and he like covers my body and says "woah woah car, woah, woah i better cover you" and then he didn't let go of my hand....instead he got more comfy with it...like a better position. So we kept walking around holding hands and what not...and we went down that wooden ramp close to Alice Fazzoolies...and we went like a quarter of the way down&nbsp; and he slows down and he pulls me in....and like he was so sweet cause he started like nosing (not sure if thats a word) and then he kissed me....i didn't stop it...lol i couldn't....well i could....but i didn't wanna...i wanted to kiss him since i first saw him hell! he has the hottest lips int he world!! So yeah...we would walk a little and kiss a little along the way....so yeah....meh, he's a player type but whatever....the good thing about him is that he's got his life pretty set...like he works for his dad, but not one of those "because your my son" sorta deals....he actually WORKS for his money....he gets paid the same amount as the other mechanics there....so he's a hard worker, he's got a lot of qualifications and he's already got his own apartment house sorta thing, with his own cars and stuff like that...so yeah...but oh wells....i guess we'll have to see now wont' we?:) anyways, i'm not too serious about this guy so its all good...he's just a friend...with a little bit of benefits....lol *blush* but yes i challenged himm and i said that he doesn't know where i live and that he couldn't look it up because when my car was getting fixed it was put under my moms name and she uses her madien name which he doesn't know...and then he says that he'll just look under my car model....and i was like aw fuck! lol and he says dont' be surprised if i show up at your house;)&nbsp; and yeah....so thats my ranting on Richard....so yes....i guess we shall see shant we?&nbsp; Although i did find something about myself too...he asked many questions....and if my questions were i don't know he'd try it out on me to see if i'd like it...but to be honest i think whatever he did i would like it anyways....its all good...he's definitly got his moves, and thank god for those sexy lips...okay i must leave before i drool all over my keyboard!!

You know what one of the great things are though? when people hit on me i can tell them i'm single now!!! but yeah...i just got back from my autobody shop car dudes Rob...cause yesterday i bought him like a tire wheel clock sorta thing just to say thanks for his help...and then his auto mechanic guys were there and one of them said "what do i get" so i felt bad so after summer school i went and bought them a box of chocolates....and yeah...it was fun talking to them...i got hit on by all of them...and i turned them all down except for one...i like him since the start so i gave him my number and he told me that he'd take me out to dinner with him and what not! lol although he has a gf....grrrr....he's so darn cute too...but anyways yeah...one of the guys working there got mad cause i kept shutting him down everytime he tried to ask me out sorta thing...but i said no because for two reasons...#1. i didn't like him #2. he was asian...so yeah...then after a while he kept trying to inslut me and stuff...but i kept shutting him down...cause he went back into the body shop and i kept talking to the two guys outside and we were talking and he walks out and he says to me "Hey keep that body banging cause thats all you got goin for ya" and so i screamed back at him "Hey its not my fault you can't handle me" and the guys talking with me went OHHHHHHHHH....yeah...i can hear rach saying "snap"...*shakes fist* anyways yeah...i had a lotta fun...and a kinda cute black guy was hitting on me....but i didn't wanna give him my number....cause i wanted Richard to ask for my number...which he constantly did...but i wanted him to work for it...so yeah...he kept hittin on me like&nbsp;he told me to turn around cause he wanted to see what was on my butt cause i had "princess" written on there..and yeah... so being the bitch i am i said no...and i said you can walk around and see for yourself sweetie;) and yeah...so we kept teasing back and forth till i had to go....cause of piano lessons....and finally i gave him my number and he's like i'll take you out to dinner i'll take you out to dinner...come on i'll come pick you up and take you out to dinner...so i asked him&nbsp; what are you going to pick me up in? and he's like whatever you want! all these cars here...pick one and i'll come pick you up in it. and yeah i thought that was a really cute line....anyways yes...i ahve 15 mintues to get down to my piano lessons now...so yes i shall drive away....ta ta people!!

      Well it seems to me that Bren is trying to make more of an effort thsese days...but its still too early to tell...but i know for a fact that he is trying...so i guess that shows something right?....someone answer me!!! but yeah...i dunno...*sighs*  &nbsp; Okay another issue...Mike...he's got a bit of an asshole personality...like he's the type who said that he wouldn't date a girl because she's fat...which i guess sorta makes me feel good cause he is still talking to me...but i dunno...like when i'm talking to him he's like if me and you were going out i'd treat you like a queen...and from the stuff that he has told me about the things he did for his ex girlfriends he does treat his other like a queen...like for his ex gf he spent like $2000 on his girlfriends 20th birthday present....the one thing i really like about this guy is that if he is sweet he's ACTUALLY being sweet...he's not being sweet to try to show off or something...so i know if he is being sweet its true to heart....he tells me everything full out as is...i dunno...i think he's a doll...i've known him for maybe about 2 weeks...maybe 3 weeks now...and i talk to him just about everyday! He told me about a problem he had last night which was Sunday....but i had to leave during the convo because i had to head back inside my house...and i thought he was mad at me for i guess cutting him off...and i didn't hear from him at all today which is quite weird for me cause i talk to him just about every single day...but like 20 minutes ago he logged on, and he's like good your here...and he told me about the whole update of his problem, and he actually purposely came online to tell me....and then he went offline after he told me (of course he said bye and stuff) but yeah...he came online just to "update" me...which i found SUPER sweet...cause it showed that he was thinking about me....i dunno...i'm weird i guess....but still...he seems like such an ass...but he's just like me and into the whole anti-cheating deal thing...like we're both VERY against it...which i absoloutly love..but actually he takes the cheating line VERY seriously...like he finds it cheating if his gf went to the movies with another guy...he would find that cheating...but we went into a whole discussion about it and it really quite depends on the situation which is totally true....but yeah....he says a lot of sweet stuff and actually seroiusly saying it....like the one thing i REALLY like about him is that he knows when to joke and when to be serious....which means a lot to me....but one thing that i'm thinking about now...i've never been upset when i'm with him on the phone...ever time i see him name on my call display it actually just puts a smile on my face...like&nbsp; i love to hear from him...and i feel so bad too cause its long distance for him to call me....but i keep telling him that he doesn't need to call me and that i can talk to him over the net or something like that and he's like no no no its fine your not a waste of money at all...i love talkiing to you....ARGH! boys! anyways yes...i hear the garage door opening which means my brother is home...i shall write more of my ranting stuff later.... Ta Ta Y'all...HEY MA WHATS FOR DINNA?!

      People i really dont' know what to do...i'm so confused...am i being stupid here? what the hell is wrong with me?&nbsp; I need to rethink my feelings for matt...well its not that i need to rethink my feelings for him...cause i know my feelings for him...but i need to rethink about what his feelings are for me...and if they are true as to what he says...i'm getting extremely ticked off...and i felt bad cause i was on the phone with Bren so i sounded pissed when i got off thep hone with him but it had nothing to do with him at all...its matt...i'm not sure whast going on anymore...and i don't nkow what to do...i think my feelings for him may be a lot stronger than his are for me....but he said that we're going to talk on the phone tomorrow hopefully...but after he gets home from work which is at like 3am my time...and i'm most likely going to be asleep considering i have summer school the next day...maybe i wasted that $4 for a calling card...i dont' even know anymore...i'm fucking confused...and i spent half an hour crying over a guy...i NEVER cry over a guy...this is over ONE single guy...who i have never even MET in real life before...i dunno what to fucking do....i just don't wanna be wasting my heart and soul on liking this guy if he ain't going to return any feelings back to me at all...i didn't even ask him but i was going to ask him if he has even written me a single word at all on a piece of paper....but i'm pretty sure the answer to that is no...but i'm afraid to find out although i want to find out...i think i care for this guy more than i know myself...i know i care abot him a lot...but maybe its more than i know myself....and if thats the case i think i might have to tone it down a bit...cause i dunno...inmy case i'm not use to being head over heels for a guy without having the returned feeling....but i dont' know what he's feeling cause he won't tell me...cause thats the way he is...which is totally unfair to me...but at least he told me that you likes me...but i felt that i had to squeeze it out of him...and that he only said that he did just to satisfy me and shut me up......fuck i dunno what to do anymore....everything is falling to pieces for me....i dont' know what to do....i dont' know what i feel anymore... &nbsp;  matt says:   hi hi  HoMe AlOnE {CaLl If NeEdEd 905-580-9982} ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«AsIaN/iRiSh PrIdE! says:   hi  HoMe AlOnE {CaLl If NeEdEd 905-580-9982} ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«AsIaN/iRiSh PrIdE! says:   surprised you still rememeber me  matt says:   hehe  matt says:   quite the comic aint ya  HoMe AlOnE {CaLl If NeEdEd 905-580-9982} ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«AsIaN/iRiSh PrIdE! says:   i'm serious...

      You know whats weird that i've noticed for a while? I've been wearing one of my ex-boyfriends braclet for quite a while now...i'm not too sure why i am though....i'm trying to think if its telling me something or what...but i haven't taken it off at all for almost 2 months now...like i don't even take it off in the shower...i'm not too sure why that is...i think the only time i took it off was when  i went to Brendan's prom and the only reason i took it off cause it didn't really go with my dress...hmm...makes me think....bah...i still need to talk about the talk i had with Bren last night... &nbsp; not sure if i should've given him a second chance....does he deserve it? most people....*sabz* is telling me no....she's telling me that he deserves it...but i shouldn't of given it to him...but i'm pretty much giving him till the end of this week to show improvement....and then i'm giving him another week to change my mind...i'm not sure how its going to go...and at the moment it still isn't going too well...but i guess we'll have to wait and see won't we?

      Alright...its 1:38am right now, i'm on the phone with my dear friend Sabz and i'm pissed... Techincally today is Saturday, July 17...which means that me and bren's 6 month was yesterday, 6 months, that half a year, i didn't get a call, or even an e-mail....i'm pissed...he didn't even remember...once again if he's going to say something to me like "i was busy" then i'm going to assume taht he was even too busy to pick up the phone and say a sentence....and if he doesn't even have time to pick up the phone and say something for 2 mintues then don't have&nbsp; a fucking girlfriend. for fuck sake.

      So yesterday i went to visit a friend of mine Sean. He is a total cutie pie, and he pretty much fits my "dream guy" sorta thing, even though i don't care anymore.  Blonde hair, blue eyes, tattoos, ear piercing, nice and built (he's a personal trainer) and also he's the sterotypical bad boy:)! I went to his place and chilled at his house for a few hours. We definitly had our fun. But then i headed home and picked up Sabz and got my mud flaps installed, thanks to Rob:). I didn't really talk to Richard cause he looked crazy stoned and he was up and about, its weird, he's just fun to look at, one thing about him is that he has gorgeous lips...very kissable:) So yeah....then me and sabz went shopping and we had fun buying stuff...later on in the day T (black guy who hit on me in summer school) called me and asked me to chill with him, so i agreed:) Today i got up and took a shower and headed over to T's house, and i realized that i got a blooody hickey from Sean!! i had to use my candy necklace to cover it up! But yeah....i had fun at T's....and i also found out his real name which is William:) how cute is that?! the only reason why he tells people to call him T is because he got that name when he lived in Jamacia:)   Then i left T's place and me and Sabz went shopping at Square one, where i saw Bilal, with his cousin, he's a cutie pie:) so adorable...then Sabz decided to blow $40 on a little wolf which she wanted, and then yeah...we won't get into the after parts of that whole deal cause i am sure that Sabz is typing away on her blog right now as i am typing myself:)  As for tomorrow, i have piano lessons but i'm going to go chill with Sean again before i go to piano:) so it should be fun, and its good cause his crazy roomate isn't there to go metnal on me so its all goood:)  For the past week i have been on cloud nine! Nothing bad seems to be happening *kocks on wood* so hopefully it'll just get better:) considering this is my alst week of freedom, then my mom is here everyday for the next two weeks....:yeppie: Anyways i must finish my mcdonalds which has gone all clod on me :( anyways TTYL! ta ta

      We were right weren't we Sabz? so are we going to follow through with what we had discussed...and how we are going to handle the situation and how we are going to act towards the situation? I dunno...not sure if i can still respect what happened...or if i can deal with that situation and still talk like normal...dont' look at things the same way anymore....

      well..Val got about 3 hours of sleep...didn't end up going to bed till 6:30am or 7:00am...my dear Rach was having a crisis...which definitly wasn't fun for her at all...but its not my place to discuss so i won't get into it...but we talked enough about it and yea...she's on her way to Cuba...she's probably on the plane right now as we speak...hope she has bundles of fun. So updates on the guy situations. Mike V. - see i invited him to come to Darien lake with me cause everyone else couldn't come. And he asked where it was and i told him it was in the states...and he apparently isn't allowed to go to the states....so i knew there was that bad boy in him. Tee hee...ah he's such a cutie...but still trying to stop myself for liking this guy too much...but i got my other boys attempting to keep my mind off of him... Sean - total sweetie, a random. But a total sweetie, he's so cute and adorable...a little scary though...i don't think he's necessarly dating material...but i guess we'll see...whatever happens...but still i dunno...he's the hardcore bad boy:) the kind i like;) Matt (dream boy) - aw my baby....i dunno...my feelings are now confused about him now...he sent me an e-mail the other day just randomly...just saying and reassuring me that he still likes me dispite what i think, which is really sweet, which means i still need to write him back...but its fustrating...cause like when i was loosing my feelings for him he gains it all back just by saying and doin little things....i like him so much.... T - busy doin his recording studio stuff...will call when he gets back... Cisco - he is a sweetie, but nothing there...just friends...i thought i liked him...but i dunno i saw him and i guess it just wasn't there...whcih is totally fine, love having more friends:)  So my mind is constantly running on about Mike V. and Matt....*sigh* oh Mike M. also was talking to me on msn and he was so sweet, i thought that he lost interest in me and everything but i was talking to him and he was explaining to me that he's had a lot of shit going on in his life right now. With his family's health issue which definitly comes first and i was so happy to see how sweet he was and what he was doing for his family. But yeah...he's a sweet heart and i get to see my other Mike E. on thursday! woo hoo! :) so excited:)  Friday...piss bored...waiting for my brothe rto leave the house so i can Sean back...blllllaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh So feekin tired maaaaaaannnnnnn okay val shall go make food and hopefully my brother will be gone by then.... Alrighty people ttyl :) ta ta!

      Oui oui, woo hoo! Val only has 3 more bears to collect from McDonalds! ain't she cool?! YEAH! Anyways yeah, its 3:00pm...Val's been up for maybe about 2 hours, due to Mike's wonderful wake up call :) its a cute voice to wake up to for sure:) I love talkin to him, although he does more of the talking than anyone else, but thats alright! I still need to ask him some questions though. He told me a story that made methink and want to ask him more questions...so i'm just waiting for him to call back....and i dunno, don't see to be ablet to work up the courage to talk to him, probably cause i'm scared of what i might hear. But theres only one way to find out right?:) So i guess we'll see then:) I shall up date and get back to you on that:) But yeah, Mike's tellin me he wants to be my boyfriend and stuff, cause i was tellin him about one of mine, and that one of the sweetest boyfriends i've had was Shane, and he said "until i come along" and i said "well we're not going out" and then he said "oh just not yet, oh so you dont' want me to be your boyfriend" yes i refused to get into a battle wtih him about that so i just said i'm not playing this game at all. so yeah. but i dunno what to think. like he talks to me the most ont he phone, we talk every night. Like yesterday we did talk, but he said that he was going to call meback. Mike is the type of person who calls back if he says that he does, if he doesn't he says sorry or has a reason to not call. So by then 12:00am rolls aroud so i'm thinkin alright, whatever he's busy. Then i get a text message from him saying that he's sorry he didn't call and that he'll call tomorrow and he misses me. Blah here i'll type out the message: Hey sorry i didn't call tonight will tomorrow miss you night. So that was it, i got the mesage and it made me happy. But then he calls me today and tells me that he was ont he phone with a chick from 10 - 12, when he text messaged me. So i looked at this in many different perspectives. #1. He got off the phone with a chick and he still took the time to message me before he went to bed, which shows that he was thinking about me #2. he was on the phone with another chick, and he's telling me that he wanted to talk to me. I dunno, i know that we're not going out or whatever, but i dunno, he goes telling me about this chick Jenna, and i dunno whats going on between them. He sounds fond of her, but then he doesn't, so i really don't knwo what to think, and he actually told the girl Jenna abotu me, cause she asked him sorta jokingly "so how many other girls you talk to?" and he told her that he talked to me. She got all defensive and shit like that, questioning him and stuff. I dunno...like i said i need to talkt o him to ask him a few questions. So hopefully that'll be figured out. He says he doesn't like beating around the bush but sometimes he does it without realizing it even. He's a cutie too cause when i told him i went to playdium with Sabz, Raye, Fabio, and Shane. The first thing out of his mouth was, ohhhhhhh so your cheating on me now? but he's always like that, i know he ain't serious so its all fun and games, but whatever. Why am i thinking so much about a guy that i've never met before?! i think its just cause i've been talking to him so much ove rthe phone, so he kinda grows on me i guess. *shurg* ....3:13pm....do you know where your children are? i'm hungy.....val wants food...but she doesn't wanna make it...SOMEONE MAKE HER FOOD GOD DAMN IT! ARGH!!!! okay! i'm pissed it just made me think! Yes! see okay, my brother was suppose to be working on Tuesday, and i was going to have my friend Mike come over while he was a twork cause my brother was suppose to start work at 2....but then at dinner the other night he tells me that he doesn't work for 6 days and i'm thinkin, uh nooooooooooooooo your workin Tuesday, and he's like NOPE they didn't want him working then anymore. I was flippin pissed off cause i had to cancel my date on tuesday! so now i have to push it back another week, which hopefully my brother will be working every day next week!! grrrrrrr so pissed!!!! i was totally looking foward to seeing Mike....okay...wait....this is confusing for you people....there are two different Mikes, one on the phone and another one is my friend...okay Mike V. is the phone on the phone and Mike E. is my friend. Mike E. was suppose to come over and we were going to rent a movie and watch it and stuff....but FUCKING BROTHER!!! ARGH!!! BLODDY HELL! *shakes fist* i'm pissed now! a house to myself, a hot guy and me, either in my room or in the famiy room watching a scary movie! FOR FUCK SAKES! SON OF A FUCKING BITCH! alright breath *deep breaths* *sigh* okay, i'm good....everything is good and well:) *mumbles* Alright so val is going to sit on her ass today, and watch tv...tomorrow she has a piano lesson, and then the day after is my exam! :S eeepppp i'm so nervous, i'm so scared i'm going to fail! ARGH so stressfull...actually this is the most stress free summer so far, i'm on top of the world! everything has been going well and i'm thankful:) ah shit, i gotta go see my dads, bah, i'll go tomorrow before piano...anyways yes, Valerie must part you now cause her mother is bitching about finding the address to the RCM examination tomrrow, so val must go hunt. Ta!

      Well i haven't written in here for a while! Busy busy busy lady.... As for you Brian...i swear, if you touch ANY ONE of my bears, i will make it my goal in life to run you over in my car:D Have a nice day! :P Anyways yeah...i don't know the last time i wrote in this was about two bears i got from mcdonalds...well...those two bears have no grown to a collection of 6 bears! Yes...from the skills of me and Sabz travelling to just about ever mcdonalds in oakville and mississauga we got most of the bears! only 6 more to go!!! *high five sabz* Then...i can't really remembertoo much of what happened.... oh i went to wonderland yesterday....see overall it was fun cause i got to chill with my two best girls:) but it BLEW because of the HORRIBLE guy situation....*sigh* honest to god, from the time we were there at 10:30am (would've been there at 10 if it weren't for the damn trucks blocking my exit for the 400) but from the time we were there at 10:30am till 9:45pm....we only sawa a HANDFUL of hot guys...HOW SAD IS THAT?! but yeah...so the boy situation was totally disapointing...along with the piss ass weather....so fucking cold!!!! good mercy! we didn't even get a chance to go to splash works! how much does that blow?! blah...anyways it was still fun....people had their moments during the day....Sabz got a headache so couldn't go on all the rides...then me and Rach finally got to talk to each other...which we haven't gotten the chance to in a long long time....But yeah so it was nice catching up Ohhhhhhhhhhh memories....flashback! tee hee...watching that GOD DAMN SEXY BLACK GUY dancing about on the machine....*drool* almost as hot as ex-con right rach.....NAH!!!! come on...no one can beat ex-con!!! yes the damn crazy and pathetic DDR people were taking over the machine so me and Sabz couldn't go on it...so we busted the money and went on the Para Para...or as sabz calls it Pala Pala...i dunno she's asian...but yes....made a fool outta myself...didn't think people were watching cause i thought they were watching the DDR ....but yeah...went around in a few circles and waht not...it was quite entertaining! But yeah...oh mercy....i just had the image of that yummy Funnel cake in my head...*drool* Man sabz...i have no idea whats wrong with you....how could you not LOVE funnel cake...she ain't normal raye.....psst its cause she's asian....shhhhhhhh don't tell! but yeah...so i had quite a lotta fun.... DJ...UHHHHHH Anyways yes...as for my guy situation....grrrr....i dunno...Val's getting so many mixed emotions....see....i like Mikey.....a lot....buuuuutttttt i dont' trust him yet... i think i can't trust him is only because i haven't met him yet...like...its hard to explain...it was different with Bren...he didn't trust me...but its not that i don't trust mike...cause he hasn't given me a reason to not trust me...but for me i think its easier for me to trust him if i see him in front of me....and also because of all the things that he says to me is SOOOOOO sweet...well...most of the things lol...but yeah...i dunno....its hard for me to believe that the things that he says to me is true....because he hasn't met me either...and he judges on looks ALOT...so it makes me nervous and iffy cause i don't believe him when he says things to me...cause for all i know he's saying it to the other girls taht he's talking to too...but he says that he doesn't talk to that many girls but i dunno if i believe him...hence the whole trust issue...blah! i dunno....i like him....but should i like him? there is no reason why i shouldn't like him...but the reason why i do like him has many reasons for it...like....he's sweet, gorgrous eyes....sorta considerate, welll i know he is....cute voice, one thing i absoloutly love about him though is that he's soooooooo goal oriented....he knows what to do in life and how to do it...he has his whole life figured out and that impresses me so much....i dunno....starting to like this guy more and more...but i'm trying to stop myself from liking him SOOOOO much...blah...i dunno...i talk to him like EVERYDAY...well the longest time i didn' talk to him was like 3 days...and even then he text messaged me....i dunno...he seems too good to be true almost....and for all i know all the stuff he's saying to me he doesn't mean it at all...i don't always know what he's feeling, thats the down side of it all...he tells me about all these girls that hit on him and that he flirts back, and i dunno...makes me question a lot about him....its weird cause now i'm actually having the feelings of me missing him...wishing that i could hear his voice...hear him talk...i dunno if thats a normal thing...god damn...i'm confizzled...i dunno i think the main reason why i'm so confused is because he isn't very clear on his emotions exactly....like we talk like we're friends which i totally love and i dunno i wish he'd tell me more about himself, then the people that he flirts with and that he thinks is drop dead gorgeous....*shurg*....blah! Okay...other boys!!! Although Mike is my main boy, other boys.....r....my dog is choking....anyways yes...Richard...he is just a toy...lol....nothing special...he's cute....closest to my dream boy....Blond hair, gorgeous blue eyes, cute little new yorker accent sorta thing, got scars....and then some...like he hit on me....i gave him my number....he took me out to demetries....and whatever....but i dunno....nothing too special....the only time i really see him now is when i go back to the automotive place where i met him so his dad can fix my car....but yeah...so he's not too special...just a cutie....like the bad boy type....next boy.... T, my god....hot sexy black guy! damn....he hit on me while i was at summer school....offered me alcohol....told me i had nice legs apparently...and he calls me, and we're going to chill sometime...he's a record producer, so very...uh...P Diddy...so he's sweet....anyways yeah.....i dunno whast gunna happen with that....probably nothing....i don't even feel anything for him anyways...so its all good.. Cicso....i've known him for quite a while now....total cute....la de da....bought my cell phone off of him and he gave me a deal on it...but yeah....we chill occassionally....so its cool.... other boys too lazy to write stuff on ...Mark, Mike M.
