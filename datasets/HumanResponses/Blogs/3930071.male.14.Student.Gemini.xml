         Following the retirement of Ricky Williams the Miami Dolphins are left with a troubled offense to begin training camp. The Dolphins do not currently have a quality runningback or quarterback, leaving us with what options to score touchdowns. The lack of a runningback will just put our mediocre quarterbacks under more pressure. I am usually very optimistic about Miami teams but this team is hard to be excited about. I think they will have to get moving if they want to pull of a WINNING season, let alone a playoff season. Unless A.J. Feeley develops into a great quarterback and Travis Minor has a breakout season (which in fact I believe he can) the Dolphins are not looking very good. Ricky Williams says the Dolphins will be better off without him. I sure hope that is true, but frankly I dont care what that guy thinks. I have lost all respect for Ricky Williams. I do agree he has the right to do whatever he wants with his life, even if that means retiring from football. What I do not agree with is that he did it this late in the offseason when we have no time to make any big moves, and right after Eddie George signed with Dallas. That was wrong on his part he messed everything up. I would like to hear your comments on how you think the Dolphins will do next season, and on the Ricky Williams ordeal. See Ya, Carlos

Hopefully they will continue to produce National Championships.  See you guys later, Carlos  &nbsp;

          Hey guys I'm back from the Dominican Republic. It was a good trip as it always is. The country is wonderful and the people there are very nice. Anyways I get back from my trip and the next morning guess whats on the front page of the Miami Herald, a headline saying Ricky Williams retures. Now a week after the Heat gets Shaq and Miami is looking like one of the best sports citys in the country, Ricky Williams trys to mess it all up. He has always been a pretty weird guy, but retiring in the middle of his prime. Things were looking good for the Dolphins until today, now were stuck with Travis Minor. Ricky Williams can go to werever he is going in Asia and leave us alone. Thanks for ruining the fun Ricky.

         Hey guys , The Miami Heat now have Shaq the most dominant player in the game. Although last years teams was great and i loved them, the addition of Shaq is a big step for the Heat. He's excited to come here and play with Dwayne Wade. I think the fact that Shaq is motivated to win a championship before Kobe will lead us far into the playoffs. The Heat finally have the piece they were missing for so many years. We did not give up to much for him. The biggest player was Odom and although he was good, he was not great and is not such a price to pay for possinbly the most dominant player ever.&nbsp; Caron Butler was OK but came off a bad season again not much of a price.&nbsp; Briant Grant, although he plays hard and i like that, is undersized and aging. Im certainly excited about the new season and thik Shaq will lead us to the NBA finals.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other news, I drafted my fantasy football team today and what a team it was. I think this is the best team i have ever had. At QB i have Chad Pennington which is due for a great season. But it gets better at runningback I have Clinton Portis and Marshall Faulk, two of the best in the league. At recieviers I have Joe Horn and Terrel Owens, also both excellent recievers. I am really looking to win the league this year.  Ill Write again next week,  Carlos  &nbsp;
