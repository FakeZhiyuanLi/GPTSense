      Hmmm.. So I have been thinking lately .. I need to change my ways ... smoking including weed . Drinking everything .. i just need to get threw school .. concentrate on school .. get a good job and get out of this hell hole that i am living in. Hang out with new people. Get away from all of these Bad influences.wow do i sound like im going all molly moroman and shit no but im .. i need to change for the better .. so my little sister doesnt grow up thinking that everything i am doing is good.. i dont want to see her miserable like me. Im my sisters only influence now that tiffany is gone and .. i have never really lived up that that responsability.. not many have i lived up to . I think i just need to go somewhere for a day and just get away from everything .. Just me and one of my good friends go somewhere and hang out and talk the whole day. I need to find myself .i also need to quit cutting ... i have people i really care about and need in my life pist off at me because of this .. and thanks to zack i should be getting some help soon psst ( go to www.zackshutt.com he rocks ). Maybe when i am 18 i should join the air force or army or whatever it is they'll let me join . I really need to do these things .. so if i am ever talking to you about drinking or smoking or cutting .. ask me why i am doing this .. and what about amber .. i know this stuff but sometimes it takes more then just me saying it to help me . Thanks again Zack for helping me with cutting and Mat thanks for not laughing at me last night . Until next time ..
