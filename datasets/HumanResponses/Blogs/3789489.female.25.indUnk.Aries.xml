      Dear God:  Yesterday was an awful day for me...  My husband ran off with his secretary,  My son pierced his eyebrow,  My daughter tattooed the bald spot on her head,  My dog mated with the neighbors cat,  My neighbor sold her house to a mental institution,  My Mom told me I was adopted,  My Dad told me he's gay,  My boss told me I was laid off,  My sister was arrested for prostitution,  My house has termites,  My car was stolen,  All that came in the mail was bills,  A plane, crash landed on my garage,  OJ Simpson came to my door selling rug cleaner,  And my TV blew.  Lord, please be with me today.   I was able to live through all that misery yesterday.   And I will be able to make it through anything today! But please....  DON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO MY COMPUTER!!!!!  AMEN

      This is dedicated to all of you looking for jobs.  Climbing the corporate ladder is not that difficult if you can impress your 'Boss'   (I just hope my boss isn't reading this one ;-))   All you have to do is be in his good books and it really doesnt matter as to how you work. If you are still confused about the whole things, take a look at the two stories pasted below and you'll understand what to do!  It's a fine sunny day in the forest, and a rabbit is sitting outside his burrow, tippy-tapping on his typewriter. Along comes a fox, out for a walk. Fox: "What are you working on?" Rabbit: "My thesis." Fox: "Hmm... What is it about?" Rabbit: "Oh, I'm writing about how rabbits eat foxes." Fox: "That's ridiculous! Any fool knows that rabbits don't eat foxes!" Rabbit: "Come with me and I'll show you!"  They both disappear into the rabbit's burrow. After few minutes, gnawing on a fox bone, the rabbit returns to his typewriter and resumes typing. Soon a wolf comes along and stops to watch thehardworking rabbit.  Wolf: "What's that you are writing?" Rabbit: "I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eatwolves." Wolf: "you don't expect to get such rubbish published,do you?" Rabbit: "No problem. Do you want to see why?"  The rabbit and the wolf go into the burrow and again the rabbit returns by himself, after a few minutes,and goes back to typing.   Finally a bear comes along and asks, "What are you doing? Rabbit: "I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eat bears." Bear: "Well that's absurd! Rabbit: "Come into my home and I'll show you"  As they enter the burrow, the rabbit introduces the bear to the lion . So what is the moral of the story?   IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW SILLY YOUR THESIS TOPIC IS. WHAT MATTERS IS WHO YOU HAVE FOR A SUPERVISOR.   In the context of the working world:   IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BAD YOUR PERFORMANCE IS; WHAT MATTERS IS WHETHER YOUR BOSS LIKES YOU  .   Now, we come to the second part of the training! Before you proceed, here's a small piece of advice for you. Never ask too many questions to your boss. Remember he is always right.    It's a fine sunny day in the forest, and a lion is sitting outside his cave, lying lazily in the sun. Along comes a fox, out on a walk. Fox: "Do you know the time, because my watch isbroken" Lion: "Oh, I can easily fix the watch for you" Fox: "Hmm. But it's a very complicated mechanism, andyour great claws will only destroy it even more" Lion: "Oh no, give it to me, and it will be fixed" Fox: "That's ridiculous! Any fool knows that lazylions with great claws cannot fix complicated watches" Lion: "Sure they do, give it to me and it will be fixed"  The lion disappears into his cave, and after a while he comes back with the watch which is runningperfectly. The fox is impressed, and the lioncontinues to lie lazily in the sun, looking verypleased with himself.   Soon a wolf comes along and stops to watch the lazylion in the sun.  Wolf: "Can I come and watch TV tonight with you,because mine is broken! " Lion: "Oh, I can easily fix your TV for you" Wolf: "You don't expect me to believe such rubbish, doyou? There is no way that a lazy lion with big clawscan fix a complicated TV" Lion: "No problem. Do you want to try it?"The lion goes into his cave, and after a while comesback with a perfectly fixed TV. The wolf goes away happily and amazed. Scene: Inside the lion's cave. In one corner are halfa dozen small and intelligent looking rabbits who are busily doingvery complicated work with very detailed instruments. In the other corner lies a huge lion looking very pleased with himself. Moral:  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY A SUPERVISOR IS FAMOUS, LOOKAT THE WORK OF HIS SUBORDINATES.   In the context of the working world:   IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY SOMEONE UNDESERVED ISPROMOTED, LOOK AT THE WORK OF HIS SUBORDINATES.        Now you know who's there behind the success of your boss. So have you realised the moral of the story? Try not to displease your boss, coz both of you need each other equally.
