						   Jody is one of my beloved doggies. She is 17 years old. Tomorrow we will take her to the vet and I know what the vet will say. She will say, "It's kinder to Jody to put her down"  Yes. Kinder.  At what point do you decide that? At what point do you decide that she is better off dead? Hm?  I am angry, at myself, I think. Damn it.

						   I have been wondering and musing about instinct.    The old 'reptile' that lives deep in the recesses of the subconscious mind. The set of signals and codes hard wired into the brain over millions of years of evolution. The question I would like to ask is not "Is it still active?" because I have no doubt whatsoever that it is. Not because I have read about it or heard about it, (which I have, but didn't truly understand) but because I have seen it in action.    For some reason we as 'modern' human beings, have learned not to trust it, or rather, to doubt it or discount it. Why?  "How much of it do we use in our modern, daily lives?" and also, "Can we still trust it?" or rather, "Should we still trust it?" We come from a society which has emerged from an era which stated that only science, and scientific observation, should be trusted, in other words, cold hard facts and logic. But what are facts? Things which we deem 'facts' are sometimes proved otherwise.    The idea that absolute logic, and nothing else, should determine our decisions, excludes that ancient and wise 'beast' which lurks at the heart of us, at our core. It has been that beast that has brought us through our process of evolution and it is that beast that kicks in and keeps us alive when we are under threat.   The other side of the argument is that knowledge and intelligence provides the tools with which to override that programming, when it is wise to do so.    What brought me to these thoughts was my first ever experience of panic, over which I battled to maintain control. I have been through a period during which I doubted my own mind. There is nothing more terrifying than that. During these panic attacks, logic and reason seem to abandon one, and one is unable to pin down reality, and as the fear mounts, reality becomes more and more elusive. It is a terrible thing to experience. I am now learning, with the aid of medication and therapy, to develop the skills necessary to overcome these attacks. I had always had mild ones, and with sheer force of will, was able to control them and keep them at bay. However, during or after periods of extreme stress, the old defenses crumble. Well, not quite.    The saving grace comes from the people around you, the people who love you, and also from the grace of humankind, which is the heart of compassion.    Sometimes I think of our arrogance, the arrogance which makes us feel that it is our intelligence and our intelligence alone that has determined our survival and our 'success' as a race. I would say compassion has had more to do with that advancement than we realise. It's something we should never lose sight of, because our survival depends on it.   The lives that we live today, with the stress and the 'empty' food and the 'empty' entertainment and the 'empty' relationships and this insane desire to do more, better, faster, is eroding those reserves that we require for survival. I now understand better than ever before, from bitter experience, that if you don't look after your health and your loved ones, if you don't make that decision, it will be made for you.    On a lighter note, let's not forget our doggie friends and thank them for their part in our evolutionary process. It's not just because they're cute and loveable that we love them and have them around. They have been with us since we sat around in caves. They were the eyes and ears that we didn't have. We love them because we have grown and evolved together. They protect us and are alert when we are not. Thanks doggies!

						   I used to have so many flying dreams  Souring over wonderful hills and dales,  All the way down to the ocean  (that sparkle on the ocean that blinds you)  Buildings and lakes, people, trees  Lovely, surreal   I once taunted the Ocean  My home was an Island, and She was threatening to engulf me  With the audacity of only the very brave or the very young  I took Her on  Shook my fist at her, stuck out my tongue  I used to have dreams where I would soar vertically up, like a rocket Then I would hang there, suspended, until I became fearful And plummet, just like in a cartoon  So is that what I long for, then? To soar, where only the wind can find me To take that Ocean liner To fly, fly.

						   I know I have been strange. No-one knows that better than me. There's a reason I take pot-loads of medication and almost went to a psychiatric clinic. Not everybody is open-minded about mental illness. There is still a huge stigma attached to it, and if you suffer from it, people are afraid that you are some sort of loony like they see in the movies. Most people just want to slap you about the cheeks and say "Cheer up. Pull yourself together. There are lots of people who are much worse off than you."   What am I, then? A bad person?  Most of my trouble comes from the fact that I am willing to go the distance and not abandon the people that I love. My parents lost their business and almost lost everything else too, had I not stepped it and helped out. Not many young people today would do that. I will never see my Mom in an old age home. Never. I will get a nurse/help at home, do whatever it takes, but she will not end up all alone in some place that is not her home, with a bunch of people that she doesn't know. I want her to live out her days in peace and tranquillity; sitting in her own garden and doing all the things she never had time to when she was looking after us.   That's what I wanted for both of them. To sit in their beautiful garden, fill the birdbath, feed the birds. Our garden has so many birds! It is a chorus out there and it’s very healing. Being at home convalescing has given me the opportunity to sit out there and just listen to the birds singing, trees rustling.    My parents worked hard to give us as much as they could. They both came from poor families, my father was a prisoner of war in the second world war. The war ruined his family as it did so many families. They gave us a pretty great upbringing, considering. We live in a very good area and went to good schools, all of which was way, way beyond what my parents had had. I’ve read somewhere that each generation strives to improve the next generations prospects for education by at least one socio-economic level. My parents managed to bridge two, because neither of them had a high school education, and yet my two sisters both managed to get tertiary education; one of my sisters has an honours degree in psychology and is in the process of furthering that. The other has a diploma in journalism, and is busy doing courses in architecture and drafting.   So, I am proud of my parents and grateful for everything they sacrificed to give us those opportunities. It wasn’t their fault their business failed and left us with no money. That’s just life. By that stage my Dad was already in his sixties and could not get work. My Mom got a job doing telecanvassing which didn’t pay that much, but helped. But we pretty much depended on my salary, my sister was running a small business which had only just got off the ground.  In some ways, I had to grow up very fast, because suddenly I was responsible for a family. In other ways I lagged behind, because I didn’t do all the things that young people do; go to varsity, have a great social life and meet lots of people, travel, whatever young people do. I must admit that I allowed this to depress me. It was a long haul and it has taken it’s toll on my health. It has been very stressful. There’s a reason children are supposed to leave home! Luckily for us, our home is in a very good area and is now worth a lot of money because property is booming. We will take best advantage of this, and my Mom will have a comfortable retirement and we will also be able to live well with no real worries. So it has been a venture that has paid off. At last.   My sense of commitment, which was required of me very early in my life, has cost me in terms of emotional well-being. When all my classmates were happily going off to varsity to have a grand old time, I had to get a job and help with the family income or we would have literally been on the street. So this stress had built up over the years; well 15 years, culminating in the loss of my father. He had cancer. My father never took so much as a headache pill. He was a vital man. Strong, healthy. He mowed an acre of lawn, at 75 every two weeks during the rainy season. So when he got sick, we were all very, very shocked. He was the last person we expected to get ill.   What we went through with my father's illness and death was something I hope I will never see again in my life. He died December 28; 2003. I try and express how I feel in words, but only tears come. To write it down seems to diminish it. Just the act of trying to express it, well, it’s impossible. For me anyway. Maybe one day.  This last six months has been a blur. I believe I was in a state of post traumatic stress which was exacerbated by taking medication that was wrongly prescribed by the doctor. People have said that I said or did certain things which I don’t remember doing. I have never said the “F” word in front of my mother. She said I swore like a trooper at the breakfast table. I lose all track of time. What feels like 20 minutes turns out to  be 3 hours. I forget where I put things in the space of a few seconds . I am preoccupied and analyse everything to death; which ends up in panic because I feel like I’m going to die. I jump at the least little noise, jump out of my skin.    The fear and anxiety is terrible. One night, after not having slept for about 3 nights, not at all, I began having these terrible and dreadful, fearful, crazy thoughts. I was hallucinating. The next day I tried to go to work because I had a deadline, I tried to log in to the computer, I could not understand anything on the screen. My files are sorted and arranged very carefully and methodically. I didn’t even know which ones to open to find the file I was looking for. It was like I was sitting at someone else’s computer. This is work that I can do in my sleep. I had no idea what I was doing. The more I realised what was happening, the more panicked I became, until I was in a terrible state. My supervisor had to take me to the doctor because I was unable to drive. I didn’t even remember where I’d parked the car. The doctor sent me straight to the hospital. The time in the hospital was also a blur. I was sedated. People came to see me, and I was aware that they had been, but only remember snatches of what they said to me.   My dearest friend’s Mom, Sarah, put her hands on my head and prayed for healing. I believe in her prayer. I believe in the love of my family and friends. I believe in me.   Everybody's got a hard luck story. That sounds like the title of a country song.

						   I am not good at the dance  I have two left feet  I have a soft little soul  Like a child  In a hard world  Parts of me just never grew up  Because I didn't want to see  Didn't want to believe  How ugly some things could be

						   It's so frustrating not being understood. It's even worse when people don't care to understand. Especially when it's the people that are supposed to be there for you, for example, family. That's all.

						                 We have an Avocado tree in our garden.&nbsp;It's been a family legend that  you&nbsp;get&nbsp;'male'&nbsp;and 'female' avo trees, and that&nbsp;supposedly  you only get avo's if there is one from the 'other' sex nearby.&nbsp;I  don't&nbsp;know if that's true, but whenever we've got avo's on it, someone  would make some sort of remark&nbsp;that goes along the lines&nbsp;of, "Guess  we're still okay because no-one's&nbsp;cut the&nbsp;old bugger down yet," amid  much hilarity. It never ceases to amuse us; I guess because we're anxious about   not  being okay. It's strange that one of 'her' branches is dead.  Everywhere you look in our garden, there is a flourishing&nbsp;tree, with one  dead branch. There is a Yellow-wood out in the front garden which is dead. It's  winter&nbsp;here at the moment, so the garden is a bit sparse, but nevertheless,  it still sticks out like a sore thumb. I keep wanting to rip it out of the soil.     &nbsp;   We've had bulldozers next door, flattening the house and carting it away.  We've lived here&nbsp;for about 28 years. I remember&nbsp;all the different sets  of people that lived next door.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   I fell&nbsp;in love with Andy at the&nbsp;age of ten,&nbsp;but&nbsp;before  that we had&nbsp;mudcake wars over the fence.&nbsp;Occasionally a passerby on  the street would get&nbsp;a close call with&nbsp;one of our missiles too.We had  a tree-house. We used to clamber up there and assemble  our&nbsp;arms,&nbsp;strategically placed&nbsp;to&nbsp;pelt Andy and his friends  with mudcakes. In the true spirit of war, we sought to improve our artillary, to  make them more offensive to our enemy. We did this by collecting dried-up dog  turds and mixing them in with the mudcakes, until my Mom found out and put a  stop to it, and rightly so! We declared a ceasefire&nbsp;because&nbsp;we decided  that we rather liked each other after all. Well, I liked Andy. I think he gave  in because of our superior warfare.&nbsp; ;)   &nbsp;   Ja, well.&nbsp;We took Jody to the vet on Saturday. Not this&nbsp;Saturday  gone by, but the previous one. What would that be?&nbsp;We didn't think the vet  would give her back to us because of regulations and all that, but she did. We  buried her under the Avo tree. I haven't been out there yet, since then. Maybe  I'll go tomorrow.
