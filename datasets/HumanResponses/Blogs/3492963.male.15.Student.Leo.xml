      Well, this is my first post and I really don't know what to say. I'm doing this at 2:29AM and my room is clean. School was over on the 26th and I only have 2 weeks left till I goto Europe (England, France, Italy) for 27 days! Then I goto Indiana for the last 2 weeks of July. Ummm, I am bored. I have to ask you this...now take all the time you need to answer...How has your Clorox been?...Tell me your answer at DeadlyY2KVirus@aol.com...hehe. Ok, I have to go, satan's here. Damn.  urlLink    Rubber bands to Shane's stomach.

      Hey blog, well I haven't been updating because it turns out that my phone cards don't work internationally and computer use on the base is pretty scarse. So I've had some pretty fun moments here (England.) I went to Bath and Stonehenge today, but stonehenge was closed so I just got a couple of pictures from the gate. It was pretty cool though. I also went to Oxford and Cambridge. London and some other place. It was all awesome. Well it's getting late, so I g2g. TTYL,                                     Scott

      Yo, blog, how you been doin? Well I'm good and PSYCHED!!! It's wednesday and I can already feel the plane taking off (or is it that the helium from my water balloon?) I had a pretty good day. I saw Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban. It left out some important parts but I give it a 9 out of 10. That's about it, I woke up at 1PM and came home,watched tv and now I'm doing this. I'm pretty tired. Good night.

      Hey, I got my headphones today, noise-cancelling aiwa's and they are AWSOME!!! even if I dont have music on and I have noise cancelling turned on, I can't hear anything. It's awsome. They'll be awsome on the airplane rides :). I'm happy. And I got a new cd player a couple of days ago and it plays MP3-CD's. I can listen to 143 songs on one cd. I'm happy. I wen't to bed at 6:30AM last night(well, technically this morning), so I woke up at 1:30. I love it.  I'm happy. Well I can't wait, and it turns out that I'll be staying Friday at my sister's, who is married and has her own house in tampa. I'll be spending the night and she'll take me to the airport in the morning (saturday) Then I'll be on a 2 hour flight to D.C to stay 2 days and then leave to Canada for a connecting flight to London. D.C-Canada-London-France-Rome-Milan-London-DC-Home. thats alot. Then I spend the last 2 weeks of July in Indiana with my dad :(. I don't like him. He's loserish (is that a word?). That meen's I'll be spending my 15th birthday in Indiana...probably working..sealing parking lots(recovering parking lots with new asphault) It gets up to 120 degrees on there in summer and it smells REALLY BAD. Plus if you get it on you or on ur clothes, their ruined. O well, life has its cycles and mine is going to go through Suck-Mode. Least I'll have memories of Europe in Indiana.   PS: I'll have enought frequent flyer miles to escape to Japan. AND THEN FINLAND!!! YAW!!! lol.

      (june 6)Hey, Well today, my mom got pissed, because last night, me and Shane we burning the inside of a shoe and a piece of paper in my room and my mom smelled it and we said it was incense and I don't think she believed us. But we did blow up like 4 stuffed animals with fireworks. One little guy shot 20 feet in the air and exploded-hehehe. I've noticed that for all my blogs so far, I do them in the early AM, so technically it's the next days' blog but it isn't, it's summer, so I stay up late and i get bored and do the blog. And I really only goto bed because I'm bored. Well I'm bored. goodnight *fake yawn.*   urlLink    This is Shane.   urlLink    This is Shane headbanging.   urlLink    Shane likes Sprite.

      Hey, well it's 1:40 am and this is June 3rd's entry. Ok, first off. I woke up at noon(because I went to bed at 4) I did my daily chores of taking out the trash, doing dishes, and laundry. I sat around all day, mostly at the computer. I did go outside to take a broken comp monitor to the trash, but I decided to go out in the alley at hurl it up in the air and throw it on the ground, via its power cords. it's in a million pieces waiting to be picked up by the garbage men(it's in a bag.) Then 7 came around and I went bowling with my youth group at the local bowling alley. I bowled a 124 :( and then a 195 :). I got tired of bowling so I went to play pool and won all 3 times. I paid for my games..blah..blah. I played the grabby-clawy thingy and one a tye-dye stuffed teddy bear. It's disgusting, too cute. Then I came home, watched ER and South Park. I just got out of the shower like 10 minutes ago (1:49AM) and now I'm typing this (1:49AM.) HEHE...I'm so retarded.

      Ok..nothing really happened this past 11 days (last time I posted.) I got my X-Box from England that I bought myself for $100 at the BX-brand new w/ 4 games, controller, DVD playback kit, etc. All because it was an air force base so everything is cheap. I cleaned up my room a little bit, updated my site, etc. I got some new clothes, money for my upcoming birthday (Jul.29)&nbsp;and tomorrow I'm going shopping for a backpack.

      Ok, this is my list of what I did for my trip:  I went to England and stayed at the RAF Alconbury base and visited London, Bath, Stonehedge, Cambridge, Oxford and a couple of other little things. In France, I went to Paris and went to Notre Dame, the Louvre and saw the Mona Lisa, etc.,etc. and a couple other places for 3 days. When I got to Italy, I went to Rome and visited the Vatican, Ancient Rome (inc. the Colloseum), and just the whole city. I went to Florence and went to some markets, the Ponte Vecchio, Trevi Fountain, some Duomo's, and lots of other places,while staying at a B&B. I was in Milan for a day and went to the Duomo and a couple of monumental things. Then we went to London for a night to fly back to the states and it was pretty cool, we were in a 5 star hotel. We had a connection flight to DC from Toronto and there was a 6 hour layover in Toronto. Our flight was cancelled for 'equipment failure' for 2 hours and then it rained/lightninged for 3 hours and then the pilot didn't show up for an hour. The trip was good, except Sorcha is a skank-ass whoring bitch. I give the trip an 8 because of her. If she wasn't there, it would've been a 10. BTW: I'll post lots of pictures once I get all my film developed and a scanner. PS: I lost my brand new CD player on my flight from Paris to Rome and tripod on my trainride from London to Paris. yay -.-'
