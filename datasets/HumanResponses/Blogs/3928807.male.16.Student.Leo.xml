      Camp was good today. I don't feel like getting into the details.&nbsp;I do kind of miss sleeping in. I will definately start savouring the weekends. Max was on another day off yesterday. So the whole gang came over to his house again. Right before I had to go (at a lame 12:00) we smoked some hash and weed. I got very mildly high. I was thinking of smoking tonight - i'm just deciding if its really worth doing it alone. I mean, what am I going to do after? Go on MSN? Go into a chat room? It doesnt sound that appealing. I guess I could go to Harrison's house or something. I'll have to think more about it.   &nbsp;

      Today went pretty well. Because we mostly stayed indoors. We started off with nature, where the kids got to see some lizards. Then we went swimming, and that was easy too. Then after lunch we were doing something else, but I got pulled aside to help put up a sheet of paper that covered an entire wall so our group could paint a mirale on it at 2:00. That was a tiny bit stressful but overall okay. They pained for an hour, and then we were basically done. The kids behaved pretty well today - it might have helped that one of the worst kids wasn't there. Nicholas is still my favorite camper. Or did I say that Evan was? Whatever. I signed up for a potluck on Thursday and I have to bring fruit. There's going to be alchohol there, but&nbsp;I don't know how strict they're going to be with letting underage people drink (hopefully not very). Anyways, the day was alot less stressful than yesterday.  It still rains everyday. It's miserable. I'm too tired to do anything tonight.

      So to conclude last day's post, I ended up having to go to Barry's party but it was okay since there was alchohol. After that, Harrison came over to my house - played Super Smash Bros.  Today was the first day of camp. I was nervous on the way there but I became pretty relaxed when I got there. We had to open up doors for kids when they got there, so I ended up opening a door for a girl name Erica. Because of this, I believe, she ended up talking to me throughout the day. Then we did those stupid camp songs, and got into a circle to break the ice. There was this one kid who I think is awesome because he reminds me of myself at his age. When asked what his name was and one thing he enjoyed he said "I'm Nicholas and I sometimes watch the news and it makes me sad because of all the bad things they show.. blah blah blah.. and I saw a monkey". Unfortunately he didnt stay the whole day. Of course, there are a few bad kids and they are annoying but I'm pretty damn patient and tolerant, so it's no big deal.   After that we went to arts and crafts, where this one kid who I thought was bad, named Evan, became my first camper friend. We talked about video games and he would design characters and I would draw them. He said we make a good team. He is probably the smartest kid there. After lunch, it was time for "swim activities" or something. I tried to put on my bathing suit but it didnt even go up to my waist, so i'm buying a new one tonight. The swimming period was okay, but kind of boring. After that, everyone got changed and it was time to go to the closing hill or whatever. It was a tiring day, perhaps because I didnt get alot of sleep. I know this sounds stupid, but I want to smoke a bowl before going to camp one day. The problem is I can't think of any concievable time where that would be possible. I guess 7:50. It would give me about 15-20 minutes.   Anyways, overall it was an okay beginning. Now i'm going to go to the convienence store and buy some gum. Then i'll come back and try and sleep or something.

      so I forgot to make a blog post yesterday. This is what yesterday was all about:  I woke up around the usual time, and I got a call from Harrison. He wanted me to come over. So I plan on smoking some weed in a field near his house before I come over, to make things more fun. Well they were playing football outside his house (they = harrison, mike, and aten) so they saw me before I&nbsp; could go to the field. It didn't matter anyways, because later that night I would discover that my pipe was too plugged up to smoke from. I play Risk at his house until 4:30 - at that time, I went back home.  I came home and Sam told me that Darren had called. I phoned Darren and he said he wasnt going to Mike's, so we planned for him to come to my house. Darren also called A.J, but A.J felt like staying at home. So Darren came over at around 9:00. We played Super Smash Bros. Melee for about an hour or half an hour and then we went outside, with me saying "we're going to the park to play hacky sack". We go to "the field" and we smoke three packed joints. We were already more than high enough when we smoked the third. We make our way back home and I tell Darren to imagine he is walking in one spot. That was trippy. We got home and everything was fine - I hardly had to say anything to my parents. Then we went into my room and started talking on MSN. I'm pretty sure I have never laughed that much or so hard in my life.&nbsp;Then I turned on the movie Memento, and Darren fell asleep before the first scene even began.  So now, today. We got up, had breakfast, watched some T.V, and then I walked Darren to the bus stop. The bus didn't come for over half an hour. I had lunch and then my parents left somewhere. I went to the shoppers drug mart and bought visine. I talked to Andrew last night and he said he'd come over to my house soon. Soon as in&nbsp;a few days. My parents are going to Barry's birthday party tonight (I dont think I have to go - i hope not) and so maybe I'll smoke a bit and go to Harrison's house. The only thing I'm wondering is if it's any fun being stoned and hanging out with someone who isn't. And is it shameful to smoke alone?   Tomorrow I start my first day at camp. I hope it goes well.

      Today I woke up at around 1:00. I took a shower. Then I get a call from Darren. He wants me to come over so we can split 80$ of weed. So I came over, and he gave me my half. Then we smoked a bit. We sat around for a while, and then I decided to go home. Before I left though, we went into this hilarious chatroom on Soulseek - I need to download Soulseek now. &nbsp;So I took the bus and now i'm here. Dad comes home in probably an hour or an hour and a half and he'll make a barbeque. I'm probably going to smoke some during the day tomorrow. Oh yeah, and it's still impossible to conceal my bald spot. Fuck you barber- fuck you all the way to the bank. I'm never getting my hair cut by him again. Oh yeah, and Sam is in the kitchen so I can't get any food. Because he'll ask me stupid questions.   Stupid bastard

      So, let's see what I did today. I woke up at about 1:30 pm. I ate and showered or whatever and then I sat around for a while. I got a call from the camp telling me about some open house thing from 4:00 to 5:00. I went there, and it wasnt too bad. I'm in Megan Fischer's group and there's also this really hot CIT girl in our group named Cassidy. I biked home with Harrison and we made a deal to go to camp together in the mornings.   So then I get back and me and Harrison play the obligatory Super Smash Bros. Melee.&nbsp;I get a call from Darren just as I walk in and he wants me to come over later. So Harrison leaves at around 6:30, and Dad comes home at about 7:00. We eat Harvey's hamburgers. Then I leave to Darren's house. We sit around and listen to music/watch T.V. Mike calls, and I hear about this "ultimate weekend" thing they are doing. The Ultimate Weekend is comprised of the following: going to the CN Tower and getting ridiculously stoned. Sounds good to me. I just hope ill be able to go- since my mom is coming back on Saturday. I think i'll try and finish all the chores tomorrow so I don't have to do them on Saturday.   Hmm.. looking back, this day was far less eventful than I thought it was.

      so I woke up at about 1:00 pm today. Took a shower. Then I got a call from Earl Bales. Turns out I got the CIT position - I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I'm not getting paid and I have to take care of a bunch of kids all day. On the other hand, I'll actually be busy during the day and then next year I'll be able to make money as a counselor. I think the pros outweigh the cons. It rained again today. I'm really getting tired of all this rain. It's suppose to rain again tomorrow.  I talked to Darren on MSN. He said that he could supply me with all the weed I want. This is good news. I was semi-planning on going to his house tonight but of course dad came home pretty late so now we'll be eating dinner at like 8:00. By the time I get home, it'll be too late. And it turns out that mom comes home Saturday, not Monday. Unfortunately Sam got his G1 today.. stupid bastard. But i'm the one with the job. Heheh. I found a pair of sunglasses in my drawer that I previously thought were broken but they're actually fine - one of the .. henges I guess? Anyways, one of them is a little loose. I like sunglasses. Maybe i'll wear them to camp on Monday. Do clothes naturally smell bad when you dont wear them in a long time? I need to buy some Febreeze.  And now it's off to Swiss Chalet.

      So I woke up pretty early this morning: 9:00. Way earlier than I needed to be up... I went to the interview today - got there 30 minutes earlier. Boy, did I feel like a fool. The interview went... okay. It could have been a lot better. Honestly I'll be a little surprised if I get hired. I busted the front wheel of my bike on the way there somehow, so that made riding home a pain in the ASS. Especially since I got caught in a STORM. I was drenched by the time I got home. I just took a shower. &nbsp; Since it's raining, I can't go outside. Oh well, I'm tired anyways. Damn, it's been raining alot lately. Damn, why did A.J's dealer have to flee to Iran? What the fuck. If I don't get this Earl Bales job, it's back to motherfucking square one. Where am I going to look next? I'm tired of biking around, going store to store, asking if they are hiring. And I hate going downtown to the job fair. I tried to get drunk before I went to the interview, so I would be calmer. I drank a beer and a little whiskey. It didnt work. At all. Apparantly,&nbsp;I actually can keep my liquour. And at the interview I was nervous and a little unconfident.  &nbsp; So, what shall I do now? I can play Gamecube- nah. I can watch T.V - nah. I can watch a movie on my computer... nah. I can "surf the web".  &nbsp; ..damn, I'm just reflecting on the interview, and I realized I actually did horrible. It was a truly horrible interview. The only way I'm getting that job is if the other people who apply are even more incompetent than me. FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!

      Well yesterday I didn't make an entry because our internet unexplainably went down. This morning I went to downsview and..&nbsp; GOT MY G1! I thought I'd be more excited when I got it, but then again I can only drive with a G2 driver as my passenger. But maybe now I can start driving&nbsp;a little bit. Sam didn't come with me because he wasn't ready- I will seriously be surprised if he actually goes without me.  &nbsp; In other news, tomorrow I have an interview with Earl Bales. Things are looking up for me, aren't they? With good news always comes bad news, because apparantly A.J's dealer fled to Iran. Perhaps it was for the best. Shit son, if I get a job at Earl Bales, my dad will finally get off my case. And Sam will&nbsp;be jealous. And my parents will start saying "why can't you be more like Ben?" Hahaha.  &nbsp; Ok, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. But today after getting my G1 I feel alot more confident in acing this interview tomorrow. I know I can do it. Just like I made MacRadio.  &nbsp; It's 1:41 and I don't know what i'm going to do for the rest of the day.. I could call Cary but then we'd just end up playing Super Smash Bros. Melee and then watching T.V or something equally boring. Darren is at work. Harrison is at work. Don't feel like calling Andrew. Max is obviously at camp or what not.  &nbsp; Damn.. I need to make some more friends.

      Actually, it's July 18 but it's only about 2:00 am so I count this as part of the 17th. I did absolutely nothing today, after I woke up at 2:30 p.m. A.J was suppose to come over and bring weed but he never got some from his guy. So I sat around all day and then I went to Harrison's friend's house for an hour to play risk. I was going to win, but I left early with the excuse that I needed to go to a jazz festival with my family. &nbsp; Tomorrow could be a good day. I'm probably going to read the driver handbook again. Andrew might come over. I might get stoned. I might get a call from Earl Bales. Here's to hoping.

      I woke up at noon today. It was nice out, so I read the driver's handbook outside. I was going to go get my G1 tomorrow until I realized that tomorrow is Saturday. Still good to study it though. Last night, I went to Max's house - a bunch of other people came too, and we smoked Darren's weed and then AJ bought a shitload of weed but they smoked most of it after I left, because I had to go at 12:30. It turns out Taylor has a job at Starbucks. I really am the only person who doesn't have a job (besides my brother). I hope I get a job at Earl Bales. That would be pretty nice. I havent done anything today except eat and listen to music and read the guide, but it's been&nbsp;good- it's been relaxing.  &nbsp; I was just wondering earlier if Sam is actually a big enough asshole not to tell me if Earl Bales leaves a message on his phone. I've been thinking and I think he might be. He's a spiteful and jealous bastard. &nbsp;  Tomorrow, Darren may come over with his good pal Mike, who&nbsp;I actually like hanging with. Or he might come over on Sunday. I'm home alone with my brother all day so that leaves open lots of possibilities... possibilities revolving around alchohol and drugs. I don't get to partake in these things often, so I take an opportunity when I can get one. I have to go take a shit now, so maybe I'll post again tonight.

      So last night, I gave harrison my resume to Earl Bales which he's going to give to them.. this morning I had to go down and get my teeth checked, to make sure the healing process for the wisdom teeth went okay. I only got 4 hours of sleep, and I'm tired now. After I got home, I biked to Mcdonalds and handed in my application. I think the fact that I left the "past experience" section blank doesn't bode well for me. Last night, Darren asked me "what my opinion on shrooms was". I said "I don't know much about them". I think it's a bad idea to try them and I hope he doesn't- I did some research and found out that if you take a bad shroom, you can die of liver failure. I don't know how common that is though. In fact, I'm worried because I think he's the kind of person who can easily be led into harder drugs. In other news, I hate Sam more and more every day. I can't wait until I move out- or he moves out - preferably him, because I think I might like to stay at home during university- although I would seriously have to consider the pros and cons.  Max gets his day off in Toronto today. Darren wants to get high (surprise, surprise) and go see anchorman. I don't know if I even want to go out in public, because my hairdresser is a complete douche and has left me partly bald. Nah, i'm just exaggerating. But it's still frustrating- to think I gave him a two dollar tip. Anyways, hope it's a funner night tonight than last night, when I played super smash bros. with harrison and his friend.  By the way, why do all my friends have to have an additional friend they always hang out with, and whom I can't stand?   Anyways, I'm feeling okay today.

      I remember once I told myself that I would never make an online blog. So much for that. I am mostly doing this because I am bored and because I'm sort of lonely, with everyone being away at work or what not. Whether I will continue posting in this or not and whether I plan on showing this to anyone in the future hasn't been decided yet.  Today I went to look for a job, like I promised my dad. I really only went to two places - The Brick and Mcdonalds. I'm going to give my application in to Mcdonalds tomorrow. I found out yesterday that Harrison got a job at Earl Bales day camp. If he can get a job, I should be able to as well. But, then again, I said the same thing when Michael Leethwood got a job at Blockbuster. I am motivated to get a job only by my need to get outside the house and not die of boredom. I'm also suppose to get my drivers licsense. Damn. Damn, damn damn. Getting a job occupies my thoughts every second of the day. I feel like if I don't get a job, I'm worthless. Am I being too hard on myself? I don't know. Sometimes I seem so sure of myself in my abilities to handle a job, and other times I very much doubt myself.  I am going through a struggle right now of trying to keep up my self confidence and not becoming obsessed with my insecurities. I feel like every day I become less and less happy with who I am. Maybe it's because I've been spending too much time alone. Maybe it's because I've been watching too much T.V.   Tomorrow is a busy day. At least, I hope so.

      Well I haven't posted in a while. I did my CIT programming at camp a few days ago, which was a treasure hunt, and it ended up well. I think I have a fairly good chance of being invitied back next year. I have a Mcdonalds interview on Thursday. I'm not sure whether I want to work there or not. It is the last week of camp and tonight is the staff banquet. Last time I went to a staff party, I got high, which just backfired. This time i'm going to get drunk. Damn, I am pathetic. Whatever.  I tried shrooms with Darren... they didnt really work because we didnt eat alot. Basically I only got the very very small effects like feeling warm and comfortable. I'm not going to try them again for a long time. They are unsafe. I talked to my cousin Adam yesterday about pot. It was an akward  conversation but for some reason I felt I had to. When I was with Darren, I saw Ricky again. He seems to be cooler now, but looks can decieve. His girlfriend is amazingly stupid. She didn't know what a bigot was. I think Max gets back from his camp pretty soon. I have to get gum surgery 5 days after camp ends, which sucks. Speaking of sucking, tomorrow at camp is parent day and it ends at like 8:00.. and then on Friday we have to clean up the camp.  Summer is almost over, but I don't mind. I think I had a fulfilling summer. Sam got some sort of part time job every Tuesday working at his friend Chris's mom's place where he has to tutor kids or something. I would pay to be able to come visit him and work and see what it's like. Today is his first day. So anyways, i'm trying to figure out if I really want a part time job during the year. I have to worry about community hours and homework and universities.. not sure if I have the time. Plus I think I lost my community hour sheet when I was throwing shit out. Which means I lost like 8 or 9 hours of community service.. I hope grade 12 will be cool. I know it's not going to be a walk in the park.

      so I started with my new group today. There were only six kids there and three boys. Damn, it was so easy. The next two weeks should be alot less stressful. On Saturday and Sunday I sat around playing video games and surfing the internet, while high. I bought a filter for my pipe and some new magic cards. I went over to harrison's house to face him in Magic. Not much else.

      Well, my cousins from Israel are here. I found out next week at camp I am switching from the oldest group of kids to the YOUNGEST group. How messed up is that? Mike told me that Darren's family is going to be at the cottage still for the next week or two. Mike might come over this weekend, which would be cool. We're going to take a poloroid picture of ourselves standing in front of Darren's house. We're probably going to smoke alot. I'm going downtown tomorrow.  Hm.

      Tomorrow is this thing in camp where I have to lead my kids into a game. Godamn, I hope that goes well. I talked to Mike Mcglennan on MSN a few minutes ago.. turns out that while they were at the cottage, Darren's mom caught Darren stoned TWICE. Jesus christ. The first time, they were both watching a movie with their parents and then Mike bit a can or something and said something about a triangle can and they laughed their asses off for 10 minutes. Then something happened that let her find out the next night. He's probably grounded for eternity or something. I bet he won't be able to come over to my house for the rest of the summer. You know how much that would suck ass?  There's practically nobody else to hang out with. Mike Leethwood and Harrison call me every night to ask me if i want to come over. Fuck off, you annoying terds. Cary is cool, and he came over a few days ago, but it seems harder to get together with him and do something. Plus, Darren is my smoking pal. I can't remember if I put this in another blog post, but I smoked alone  a few days ago before I went to Harrison's house to play risk. It's definatly not as fun alone, but that could also be due to the fact that harrison is a complete bore. Damn, I wish A.J and Taylor would invite me in their nightly little adventures.  Shiri is here now and Maya is visiting in September. I know Maya smokes pot and I really want to muster up the courage to tell her I smoke and I want to smoke with her. Maya is one of the coolest people I know, and she is the first sibling I would share my pot with. I need a new filter for my pipe. I tried using that silver crap (cant remember what its called), and i ended up choking on ash or something. On the weekend i'm going to go downtown and buy some magic cards, and maybe a filter at the Friendly Stranger (because i'm pretty sure i won't be seeing Darren on the weekend since he is probably grounded). This blows, because now I have nothing to look forward to on the weekend. I guess it's kind of pathetic that I look forward to the weekend because there is a chance of hanging out with darren, but he is pretty much my only close friend besides Cary. I never talk to Jeff outside of school for some reason. It's been a long time since I hung out with Anton or even Andrew zirone. Even Ryan Stobnicky was fun to hang out with. This is all to blame on moving to Blue Forest. Darren at least has Shane, Joey, Andrew Jack, and Mike (to an extent). I could hang out with Harrison and Mike more, but I'd just be lying to myself - they are not fun and they are not really my friends.  I guess I'm okay with the friends I have. It's better than Sam with his one asian friend. Whenever I need to feel better about myself, I just compare myself to Sam now. It is quite uplifting. I wish Sheldon lived closer to my house. He's cool, and I wish he could come over to my house sometime this summer. Maybe even smoke a bowl. Shit, I am becomming obsessed with weed. It's almost like a lifestyle. Which reminds me, I may have lost my hackey sack. That makes me sad. I am also in the process of losing all the muscles I built during grade 11 fitness. That also makes me sad.  I'm still wondering just how much trouble Darren is in

      nothing much happening lately. Camp has been okay. Shiri is back in town for the next 2 weeks or so. Didnt hang with Darren this weekend since he went to his cottage with Mike. So on Sunday I got stoned and played Risk with Harrison and Michael, and then today I invited Cary over. I had to write two journals for camp. Doing homework outside of your job is lame. Oh well.
