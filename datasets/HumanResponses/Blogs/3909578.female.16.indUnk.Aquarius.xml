      Can anybody tell me how to get the links on the side of the page? so I can put links for my sisters site and a few more. I feel so bored Yester day I went to "K" days ("k"= klondike) I went with Stephanie, my best friend, she is a very daring person, and I'm a very smart person, she goes on all the "puke-your-guts-out" rides, and I being smart, don't. Well its not like I didn't go on any scary rides, I just didn't go on "the drop of fear" or the "G" force".( both sickening) but I led a troupe of people through the pitch black caves of the terror trench, kind of like a haunted house, except you cant see any thing and there are sticky webs hanging from the roof, and rubber hands on the floor. I walked calmly through, pulling a chain of people, who were to scared to go in by them-selves, behind me, while Steffie was whimpering " lets get out of here" sorry Steff, but you were. my bravery lies in different places, those places being the more sensible ones. I can lead people through any obstacle ( except for riding a motorcycle over a flaming pit filled with crocodiles) I can lead a team very well, I can deal with being scared, I just can't deal with throwing up! thought I'd leave you a quote by me  "oversleeping doesn't make dreams come true, it just makes them last longer." :) "all that glitter ain't gold, its glitter glue" " it may not be made of gold but it sure is lined with silver!" " lord give me the courage to do what I ask you to allow me to do, instead of just asking and not following through." okay that last one was lame, but who really cares? if you did care you'd comment more often. No really I love you because you are reading my blog, I'd just love you more if you commented on to.   Synthea

       hey here&nbsp;I am, blogging from the Valentine residence .   it is quiet now almost too quiet, but wait thats because three of the five that are here right now   are sleeping, and the others are playing playstation 2 sonic  something or other  game .   for now here's the setting. "The rooms are quiet, the doors are al open, the windows are   covered, the air conditioners are on, their gentle hum drowned out by the sound of sonic   commenting on how he will beat the certain boss. The thumbs moving quickly over the hard   black controller. And the gentle hum of my computer as I click away at the key board, nothing   beats silence."    aren't I ridiculously dramatic? &nbsp;&nbsp;    i just helped abram( 6 almost 7 years old) install his grade two, math game, yes grade two .    his family goes like this   Brian Valentine Dad'   Linda Valentine mom   Jesse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grade 9/8 male   Nathan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grade 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; male   Aleashea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grade 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; female   Abram&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; male   Andrew&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grade 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; male   Shanna-lynn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preschool&nbsp;&nbsp; female   Jedidiah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preschool&nbsp;&nbsp; male   Daveena (spelling) 14  months  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  female    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  and i am baby sitting all of them except Aleashea and Andrew for two weeks.   what a work load, ontop of teahing swimming lessons.    &nbsp;  love ya all, though i don't know who you are,    &nbsp;   your in christ    S  ynthea

      So someone might ask 'where on earth did I get the name?'  well to tell the truth I got it from a Newsboys song&nbsp; "strangely normal" I still don't really get the song but I felt the title&nbsp; described me ( although somewhat toned down) I like to think of myself as normal eccentric, with eclectic&nbsp;taste.  &nbsp;the rest of the family think it's strange that at one time&nbsp;in the day I will be listening to hard rock ( you know the stuff were you can barely hear the words) and then an hour later listening to pianist play some symphony no one knew existed.&nbsp; or listening to punk rap( also containing&nbsp;hardly discernible words) to singing along with Celene dion, (not too tone deaf I hope) .  actually I'm not tone deaf I just don't have one of those voices test sing well, but I have taught myself to play the piano ( I only just started)&nbsp;and I can whistle Queen of the night from the magic flute, Beethoven's fifth, and i&nbsp;almost have his ninth down flat ( no not flat as in tone)  and i can wistle almost all the tunes in the red psalm book.  also today i recieved the picture of our sponsor child his name is&nbsp;Kasango and he lives in the congo. he is the age that my moms' fourth child would be had&nbsp;she had one between chris and Jonathan. ( my brothers)&nbsp; meaning my mom still has four kids, if that was hard for you to figure out, well i'm not going to voice ( or blog) what i think you are. :) just joshing ( kidding)

      (( this in the third installment from the holi tree the other two installments fallow below please read them first))   Ehrick Hesmud was the most likely to pass. He was handsome, smart and self-assured. His joining of the ceremony had already been confirmed to his father. But now Ehrick had broken all the rules. He had eaten that which his attendants had given him, and he had sneaked out of his closet. Yet Elhor, Storack, and Maydar were passing with flying colours they all sat in the farthest corner, closed their eyes, crossed their arms, and all hummed the same tune. It was obvious now that they were all brothers.   Elhor tired to concentrate on his humming and his telepathy, but for one so learned at it, he found it hard. He could hear his brothers arguing in the back of his consciousness. 'No Maydar, Ehrick must not pass. He is a hindrance to our fathers' plan."  "As would I be had I not agreed to marry, brother Storack."  Elhor stopped humming, he could not listen to his brothers any longer, and though they were older they were definitely more stupid than he was. The only hope for the tree to live was that one of them, hopefully two, would marry for love. Elhor stood, he walked over to the door. Elhor bellowed.&nbsp; " Chatvek, you had better let us out now it has been three days and the ceremony is tonight, we have passed the test. Let us out." &nbsp;He heard a deep rumbling and the door to his closet opened with a swift breeze of air, fresh air.   Elhor tried not to squint in the bright light, but he found it nearly impossible, when his eyes adjusted, he could see Chatvek twitching nervously.&nbsp; " Well you three all passed, it is a strange occurrence for siblings to pass together." Elhor spoke smoothly  "Not if we were raised the same way, with the same integrity's. " Elhor was not surprise that Chatvek knew of Storack and Maydar being his brothers, he was more embarrassed.&nbsp; " And it is not very often at all, that you see any man using telepathy to ward off insanity."  "Yes, isn't it? My brothers and I are all telepathic. Strange that it should be between brothers? My father is the famous for his telepathy. It runs in the family." &nbsp;With that Elhor strode past Chatvek into the dining room. Chatvek stood dumbfounded, surly these were not the sons of Heeltar the mind reader. Surly not  " Aren't you amazingly perceptive today Chatvek. Let's see if you can guess the rest." &nbsp;Elhor walked into the room eating a jiater fruit.&nbsp; " Yes Elhor let us see." His brothers walked in unison into the room.  Elhor scowled at his brothers, they were playing the part extremely well. The only way Elhor knew they were lying was because he could read their minds, Not they, his. Soon though they would have Chatvek willingly on their side, soon very soon.

      i am a swim intructor, meaning i teach little kids how to swim. i have been teaching swimming lessons for three weeks. each individual set of lessons go twice a week fro 4 weeks. i give four lessons a day four days a week. and get paid 8 dollors an hour averaging 4 dollors every class to teach five kids, unfair. and really i could do better. right now i worl at the YMCA but if i worked at a city pool i could get paid up to 12 dollors an hour. the reason i'm not working at a city pool is beacous i paid two hundred dollors for the teachers course to work at the "Y". and if i wanted to work at a city pool i would have to pay another 2 hundred dollors to take another course. but if i had taken the city course first ( which i wasn;t smart enough to do) i would only have to pay $20. to take a 2 hour course to work at the "Y". when will i ever learn?

      (( hint read the post below this one before you read this one.))  The Holi tree was in blomm. The Holi tree was in bloom! Eleah had turned 17 this very night. If the tree bore enough fruit she and two other girls from her town would pick thier half of the fruit. If the tree bore enough fruit three men from the town of Hered would pick up the fallen fruit and plant thier fruit by the girl of thier choice. It was imperative the boys not know the girls, or the girls know the boys. Every town in the world had been given a  certain planting that they could host. And in th 87 replanting of the Holi tree the towns of Holi and Hered, finnaly had thier chance. At the age of 17 Eleah was the picture of Holdini beauty. She was tall and lean (not thin) and had purple eyes, wich was very common in holdini girls, but her knee length brown curly hair was excedingly uncommon. The average Holdini girls hair was hip lenght red and strait. Eleah was the daughter of a poor man who's only riches were his 18 daughters of which Eleah was the youngest and only unmarried one.

      the holi tree was in bloom, between the two sharply pionted mountains, hellot, and hetell`e.  the tree only bloomed every 30 years. it was a good sign a sign of prospertity. yet this time the tree had bloomed purple instead of blue, a sign that the tree was ready to produce fruit. a tree only produces fruit twice in it's life time, a span averaging 500 years. it happened to the last 87 trees, 3 years before they died. it was now happening to this tree. once the fruit had ripend half were to be picked by females and the other half were to let fall and be picked up by males. the trees always produce an even amount of fruit. the fruit was to be planted in two rows. one belonging to the females the other to the males. the rows were to be 1 foot apart and each pair of fruit were to be planted 10 meters from each other.the only hope for the fruits to grow into trees was that the couples who had planted them would marry for love. the couples had three years, after thet the fruit would rot and the tree would die.  but if even one couple married for love the old tree would live untill the new tree was three feet tall.it would then bare its last fruit, from which could be squeesed the water of life. every 500 years the people would drink of this water and live the rest of thier life in perfect health. thus bagan the histories...      "As long as the tree liveth       the peace liveth       as long as the peace liveth       the people liveth       when the tree die       we die." Elrael (aka thea)

           Memories  By: thea Paarup From a distance all to be seen is a lone figure standing, her skirts blowing in the wind. Moving closer, six fresh mounds of earth are visible. Closer inspection reveals the figure is a young woman, four months with child. Within the folds or her skirt is a young girl, looking up at her sister Chloe’s stunning face, striped with dirt and tears. Marie was only five when her mama died. The center of her world was now lying in one of the six mounds along with Marie’s seven year old brother Jack, her Papa, Tamara her sister, Tamara’s husband Jean, Matthew, Chloe’s husband of four and a half months. Marie stood grasping her sisters skirts understanding completely that her Mama was gone.      Chloe’s back ached; she had no one to help her move the bodies, no one to dig the grave, no one to bury her family, no one but God. She had no idea how she would survive. With no men to work the farm, there would be no money to pay the mortgage. then she would have nowhere to live, nowhere to give her baby life, nowhere to grow a garden to feed her sister. She was alone and she felt it. She let the shovel drop; it made a dull thud as it fell on the nearest mound. Hastily Chloe knelt, picking it up she patted the grave, as she did the earth fell away revealing the silver bracelet Matthew had given her as a sign of their union. With a silent tear she stood and slipped the bracelet on.  “ Why did you go oh my darling?  Why did you leave me my friend?  Why am I stuck here without you?  To live to my bitter end.”  My life is an opened grave My soul is a rotting corpse My heart is a place were no love is Cause you left me on my own” her heart sang these words, for her mouth could not form them. Tears streamed down her face once more, as she drowned herself in self-pity She felt a small hand clutch her skirt. Wiping the tears from her eye’s she looked down Chloe saw the sad and studious eyes of her sister looking up at her.  “Chloe, mama go away, I miss her.” the sad declarative tone bit at Chloe’s heart.  The child’s soulful eyes, looking so deep into Chloe’s sent a feeling of hopelessness course through her body, she had to look away. “Come on Marie, Chloe’s got to make some food, and then we will go.” “Where go to Chloe?’ Marie said, hanging her head. “To wherever God leads us Marie, to wherever God leads us.” The last half of the sentence whispered quietly to herself.  “That’s what you say. Chloe, do you think God will lead us hear?” “ I don’t know Marie, Perhaps”  Chloe’s insides were like ice, odd for such a warm, sunny day. She could now see the two room cottage looming on the hill. The house seemed to be fine, but Chloe knew it would hold the haunts of her memories. Reminders of what had once been, happiness.  She could not stay in the house for her ghost like memories, and the bitter pain would surely kill her. If not the memories then the Mortgage would.  “ Oh, and don’t worry God will pay the mortgage.” Marie said, paused for a second in her walk. Chloe stood thunderstruck. “Who said anything about a mortgage?” Chloe said turning to look Marie in the face. “Papa was always sad about the mortgage. I told him God would pay it” “Marie.“ Chloe gently held Marie by the shoulders looking her in the eye. “Dearest money is of no importance to God he doesn’t need it” with those word she felt the emptiness pinch her heart, only to be released again, by the pureness of a child’s faith. “But we do Chloe, and God wills to take care of us, so why shouldn’t he care about money? ” as soon as these word were spoken Chloe knew in her heart everything would be fine.  In the distance Chloe herd the sound of an approaching buggy. “ Marie go inside dearest.” Chloe said with a pat on Marie’s thick, black, curly hair. 	Marie walked slowly toward the front door of their two-room cottage. Marie did not want to go inside, the memories of her mama, papa, Jack, and half sister Tamara, still fresh in her memory. So instead Marie stood on the front step, just out of Chloe’s sight, twisting her hair around her long delicate fingers. 	Chloe wiped as much dirt from her face and hands as possible then gave up knowing it was useless. Looking up she saw a brand new, shiny, black carriage make it’s way up the driveway. Sitting in the back seat, where she had expected to see the bank manager sat a man she had never seen before. A man dressed as fashionably as she had ever seen a man dress. His gold curls shone in the sun and his green eyes shimmered with uneasiness. 	 Joseph Renault sat back enjoying the view of his child hood home, it had aged greatly in the last twelve years, and it was smaller than he remembered but it still had the same effect on him as it had when he was a child. Looking at the front door he saw a small girl toying with her hair, seeing her caused a memory to rise in his mind, a memory of his sister. The little girl could have been his sister’s twin if it were not for the girl’s violet-blue eyes and black hair. He ordered the driver to halt the carriage seeing a movement to his left he looked, and there stood the focus of his memories, Chloe. Though she was older and taller, it was most definitely she. Then as Chloe got closer he noticed two things: her face was covered in dirt, causing stark contrast with her pail cheeks showing under the tracks of her tears And, she was pregnant. Recognition came, the man dressed in such finery, was her brother. Her heart leapt with Joy and her feet moved her forward as if a hand were gently pushing her. She ran. “Joseph?” she called “ Joseph is that you, oh how I have missed you!” “I have missed you too Chloe.”  Joseph stayed were he was not daring to come closer, but Chloe Jumped up into the carriage to hug her long lost and beloved brother. “Joseph were have you been? I have missed you so much.” Joseph hugged her back answering “I Joined the railway Chloe, helped them build it right through to the Pacific Ocean, well almost.” She laughed. “ Oh tell me more Joseph.”  “Not now Chloe, first I must speak to my, father.” Chloe’s face immediately fell. “He is dead Joseph, their all dead, all of them.” She buried her face in her hands and wept. Joseph choked,  “Dead, Papa is dead, mama is dead, Tamara, Jack, Jean, and even my Matthew, their all dead Joseph, all dead.” She wailed, her sobs tearing the heart of Joseph to ragged little pieces. Joseph began to cry silently at first but then nearly as loud as his sister was. He had come to apologize to his father now it was too late; he would never get to say ‘sorry’. Another wail was added to that of Joseph and Chloe’s. Out of the corner of his eye, through the tears he saw the little girl. She had her pointer and middle finger bent backward into her mouth as she tried desperately not to cry, but her tears would not comply and fell freely down her face. “ Chloe, who is the little girl? Joseph whispered into Chloe’s ear. Chloe wiped her sleeve across her face “Oh, forgive me Joseph, this is Marie our sister.” “Since when did we have a younger sister?” Joseph frowned and looked at the little girl “Oh Joseph!” Chloe was gaining control of her sobs. “You didn’t know? Mama had another baby after Jack. Marie is five now. I thought for sure papa wrote you.” “No, he didn’t.” Joseph stated bluntly. Tears threatening again “Oh Joseph!” she gave a tinny sniff. “ Joseph come in side. I have a lot to tell you. Come on Marie, let’s go make tea for our brother Joseph.” Marie looked slowly between the two adults, her eyes pooling with tears. she shook her head and ran of on the direction of the woods.

      Marie’s eyes shot open. The dream had been so real! She had felt herself in each character, yet had felt as if she were them, and not herself. Slowly she rolled over still dazed from the realistic dream. Once she had rolled over, her nephew’s golden curls tickled her nose. He had golden curls, so different from her black hair, so like Chloe’s hair. Sitting up a little she leaned over Mickey to see his face. She was startled to see resemblance’s to Chloe in his face, she had never noticed before. Yet he resembled the Chloe of her dreams not the pampered one in the picture frame on top of the mantle down stairs. Marie tried to picture the dream-like Chloe’s face again but the dream had faded. Marie lay back, and closed her eyes. Tears began to fall from the poor little orphans eyes, and sobs from her throat, but soon the sobs turned to a yawn, yet the tears never stopped their down pour from the sleeping eyes.    ( hey this will be put in the next chapter but just so you know Chloe was killed in a fire five years before this date, Marie is ten, now and Mickey ( Chloe’s son) is almost six, they are living with Joseph but he is very busy and doesn’t see them much.)

      i know some of you whant to read the next chapter, but it needs alot of brushing up, to satisfy you untill then here is a poem i wrote about three years ago, i like it. and let me say it was a healing poem for me.   THANK YOU GOD, FOR LOVING ME, AND FORGIVING ME. ~ A letter to GOD our Father in heaven Who, I thank for His never-ending love and forgiveness. ~ Father, I run from you all the time, Will I ever run so far? That I will not be welcomed Back into you r arms? No! Even unto the end of my life You will always love me, No matter what I do. I keep thinking, "This is it, I’ve gone to far." I sit and cry. You bring me back Even if I don’t know it. You hold me, and comfort me, You tell me your will for me, And, You love me. You tell me you love me, I am thankful.  When something happens, I blame you for it, When really I should thank you for You promise that it will work out for good In the end. I run, oh, ever so far and long. Then seeing and knowing what I do is wrong, I run farther trying to escape you. I’m angry with you. I rebel and run farther. You leave for a while, All those who follow You unquestioningly, And chase after me with loving, Loving, loving mercy, Mercy that never goes dry, Mercy that is always waiting for me, Mercy that is ever existent, and loving. Your love reaches beyond the extent of the universe! You listen to my prayers. When I ask forgiveness, You are waiting for me, Right behind me carrying me, Even if I don’t know it. You love me and will never leave me. Though I may run from east to west, You will follow me. Though I run from west to east, You still follow me With your ever-standing love, Love that never dies, Love that never turns to hate. The only true and pure love, Your love, You are God and your love is eternal. You love me, And I Love you. ~ To: God our loving Father, who never gives up on us. ~ ~ From: the running sinner, who has been forgiven, and will ever be forgiven. ~

      i read a friends blog today and he said somthing about, having driven a girl back to her house. and than thinking about her on the way home. and i was thinking,' isn't he supposed to be a reformed christian, believing in courting, and chaperoned outings? it really disapointed me. to think that just because he is away from home, he can drive girls around in his car ( plus i thought his car was back at his house in Canada, right now he is in the U.S.A. let me post a little about my belifes in courting. if somone whanted to court my sister ( this is hypothetical) 1 sophia would have to be at least 17 2 he would have to ask my mom if he could ask sophia to court him 3  all outings would have to be chaperoned 4 no touching 5 never aloud to be alone together, ever! 6 he would have to ask my mom, every time he whanted to take her out. ( the reason i say he'd have ask my mom, is because my dad is dead.) ;)  it has already been 5 years since his passing. :! love in christ ><> synthea

      The Gift by Synthea Paarup   There once were four children. They had only a mother to care for them. The children loved their mother dearly, but she was often sad.    The children tried to make her happy and the mother would be happy. For a while…    Soon the happiness would fade. The children would worry. The mother would get sad. And the children would only worry more.    The children wanted to make her truly happy. So they talked among themselves while they worked and played.    And finally it came! Something that their mother loved. They would ask God for the gift of song. To sing to their mother of the joy they wished she would feel.    The children prayed, and asked God for the gift. God granted the gift. The children went to bed. In the morning they presented their gift.    The first child sang. The mother laughed. She told the children she loved them and the gift of their song. But the children knew a song was not what she needed.    They pondered. They thought. Then, they knew a gift that would please her. Surely it would make her happy forever!    The children prayed, and asked God for the gift. God granted the gift. The children went to bed. In the morning they presented their gift.    The second child painted a beautiful picture. Their mother cooed and said she loved them and the picture. But the children thought, “This can’t be it!”    They thought some more and this time they thought hard, for surely they could get it right. When the idea came, they were sure it was good.    The children prayed, and asked God for the gift. God granted the gift. The children went to bed. In the morning they presented their gift.    The third child danced to the music of her sister’s voice on the backdrop of her brother’s picture while the littlest sat with his mother. The mother was happy for days and  days.   Not a day would pass without the music of the first child’s voice, the beauty of the second child’s paintings, or the rhythm of the third child’s feet, but as all things mortal, her happiness faded.    The children worried again. The mother tried not to show her sadness, but her children knew her well.    The youngest thought, “It is my turn for a gift. What can I give her?” The youngest prayed. But to his inquiry it seemed no answer came.    The other children were discussing the gift they would give their mother. The first child spoke, “The youngest has not yet given his gift. Perhaps the gift of music would make her heart sing forever? Surely that would make her happy!”    So the children prayed once again and asked God for the gift. God granted the gift. The children went to bed. In the morning they presented their gift.    The youngest played a happy melody on a harp. It blended in harmony with the first child’s song, in tempo with the second child’s paint and brush, and in Rhythm with the third child’s steps.    The mother was happy, for the gifts her children had given her were surely good. What the mother did not know was, God had something bigger planned.    The children thought for sure she was happy, and she was, but not for long. Now don’t you dare think this mother was unthankful. She was very thankful. Her children had tried their humanly best to make her feel happy and ultimately blessed. However no matter what happened she always lacked true joy.    Then along came a blessing and a chance to make their mother happy. A gift she would love. A gift that would make her heart soar! A gift so great, only God could give it.    That day the children went to God in prayer, they offered their gifts in return for their mother’s happiness.    God smiled as he handed the gifts back, “You keep the gifts I have given you. To see you use them to make your mother happy has given me delight. You have glorified my name. For, as you have seen, the gift your mother has need of, only I can give it. Your love for your mother has proven to me that you would do anything to make her happy. I will grant this gift.”   “ Your selfless hearts have moved me. I will bless you further; you and your children shall have the gift of great love and faith to bless those around you, and yours. Your hearts will be filled with riches this world cannot take away.”    “Your mother’s days will be filled with peace and joy. Now go; obey your mother the rest of your lives. Give her grandchildren and I will fill her cup.”    The children smiled as they felt the love of God smiling upon them. They thanked God. The children went to bed. In the morning they found their gift.     Their mother was singing, their mother was dancing, she would play the harp, and she would paint a scene. She called to her children and with joy in her heart she blessed them all freely.    She had found a new start, the love from her King, the love from her God, and the love from her children, had filled her cup, past overflowing!    They lived their days to the fullness of God’s plan. Their hearts communed with God in their joy. And when their mother’s time had ended, she was welcomed to the place she had been searching for all those years ago. She found her eternity with God. When her children joined her, her happiness could not be measured, even in heaven. They were together in the only place where joy is forever…    They lived happily ever after, throughout eternity! <>  <>><>     Note from mom.  There are many things in this world that are very beautiful and worthy of praise. There are many gifts that are good to have and use to bring others joy and happiness. However true joy can only come from The Almighty God, maker of heaven and earth, through faith in His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. This story is a reminder of where true long lasting happiness is from.     Back cover>1  Four children try to give their widowed mother happiness, as they struggle to give her gifts on earth, as God reveals his plan.     Back cover>2 Four children struggle to give their mother a gift that will fill her days with Joy and peace, God plans an eternity.

      I had my sweet 16 birthday exactly 3 months ago from now. my party was a costume party (masquerade) everyone wore a costume and had a mask. At 7pm we met at sears were they were hosting a gala. We all had a makeover. There were 15 girls at my party and6 moms, they just couldn't resist the fun of having a makeover. At the gala, the derks wedding company had people walking around in wedding apparel. Every representative for the company commented on my dress, which I had bought at value village and 'supped up' if I knew how to put pictures on here I would show a picture I'll try to get one of my dress and one of the guests up soon, but it all depends on my computer knowledge, which although the highest in the family isn't too strong, so have patience. But the dress was gorgeous. i can't describe ti in writing. My auntie linda took me to have my hair done at a hair salon, a couple of hours before the party she then took me out to lunch. when we got back to her house we got dressed and made our way over to sears. later at 8pm everyone came to my house and sang karaoke, it was really fun, the neighbors said they had a few laughs, i sang karaoke to a celiine dion song, she is really the only femail singer who i can sing along with, shes rite at my level, although she sings much nicer! then we opened presents, and had cake some of the girls had to leave so we finnished up by voteing for bets costume, lady-gab-alot, miss ants in her pants, and many more atleast 15 more, after some of the girls left we sang karaoke again. untill 12:30, (which seemed kind of early) i had so much fun, but now id on't what to turn 17 cause that means i will soon be an adult, and when i turn 18 i will have to pay rent. also after my 17th birthday my body will start to degrade, because right now i am at the hight of my growth after that my body (organs) start to grow old ( heart attack here i come, just kidding. it happens to everyone, also i read somewhere that by the time your 8 years old your life is half over. because when your one one year is your hole life, whren your two one year is half your life, so slowoly years seam shorter, but by the time we are 8 our memory of time will make it seam as if our life is half over! also by the time your 87 a year seems really short cause its 1/87 of your life, got a blistering headache and i have to go bye   Synthea

        You know the strange thing about blogs is, that when you wake up in the morning, you have something else to check other than you e-mail !   I'm the kind of person, that if I feel lonely or, well bored, I check my e-mail,  ( which by the way usually depresses me more, cause there is nothing new.)  then I feel bad enough to check my blog, but really I should remember, that if blogspot didn't e-mail me, no one has commented on my blog.   ( the only really good thing about it:)   then slightly more depressed I check my sisters blog, she has about 10 comments on every post, but the thing that always cheers me up is her spelling, not that mine is any better   ( sometimes it is, sometimes it's not .)  and I click on her comments link and find that half the comments are on her bad spelling,  ( I start to giggle here)  and the other half are correcting her bad grammar !( insert hysterical laughter)    that is really my only good use of this blog, no just kidding I really like to write down what I'm thinking, and as of now it feels kind of private, you know I can write and write and no one  ( at least for a while )  really cares.    oh  I don't mean they don't care about me, they just don't care what I write about! Which makes me kind of happy, not having to please anyone  (except when it comes to spelling!)   ~insert exasperated sigh~    in light of my new findings  ( which aren't that great)  I propose a cool aid toast, to blogs.   "the only good things about blogs... Is they don't have to make any sense!"     ( i just guzzled a hole 7 oz cup of cool aid, gotto go.)     yours, in a rather chipper mood,   Synthea
