      As my first little exercise on this blog, I want to post my notes on all the photo posting sites I can find.  Below is an entry that a stole from the Blogger site which lists a few Photo posting sites they recommend.  In the next few posts I would like to post my notes on each one.  I have been trying to upgrade my photo skills.  I have been taking photos since my dad bought me a brownie camera in second grade and we developed the first roll ourselves.  I am pretty much of an amateur, but I have been paid for some of my work which means I can be called a pro, I guess.   I am a canon freak...  I had an AE-1 in High school and since then I have not been able to buy any SLR that didn't have the Canon label.  As far as I am concerned, there is nothing else.  Right now I am shooting with an  urlLink original Elan  that I bought in 1995 which is a feature-laden, mid-class multi-mode 35mm AF SLR.  I have a lot of related equipment such as my image stabilization lenses that keep me from looking at other camera manufacturers.  Up until just recently I considered this the best camera in the world for me.  Its got all the features I want and nothing that I don't want.  This opinion only changed when I got the EX550 flash from Canon which has a more advanced through the lens exposure system than my elan can handle.  Someday I will upgrade...  but until then I am still very happy with this camera.  Some day I will post about why I don't have a good Digital camera right now...  As an Apple Employee during the days of the Quicktake 100, I have a lot of experience with the very first digital cameras. I lust after a digital camera back for my slr stuff...  But I am waiting still for a few things to happen.  More on that later....  Anyway.  I have done a few things for hire in the last few months and I have been looking for a site that gives me a bit more than the standard place to post my photos.   I have used Apples .Mac site but its totally for amateur consumers.  In fact, it has a very irritating limit of just 40 pictures per page.  Its tools for actually posting the pictures are fantastic, but very limited.  Right out of iphoto you can pick your template, some caption choices and then tell it to go... It does everything for you.  And with idisk mounted on the desktop, you can edit the results from any html editor.  Folks, I don't think you can make it much easier than this.   But unfortunately, it lacks any professional features.  So, what do I mean by professional features?  Well, first off...  It should be able to handle really large catalogs of images and have no limit to the amount of photo's I can host.  I would like to have some kind of control over the catalog on my computer, so I think having access to a good client software program that runs on my Mac is going to be a must.  I want to find a place that can be my home for these photos forever... So it better not have a time limit for the hosting.    I have no desire to get into the photo printing business so I am looking for a site that my clients can go to and order stuff.  The more stuff the better actually and I want a cut of the action.  If they order a coffee mug with one of my pictures on it, I want a buck or so.  If they order a full blown album of 200 or more I want to get about $250.  What I am really looking for is a site that can be my business partner.  Lets both make some cash.  Its great if they want to offer me a cut rate deal on prints.  But what I am really after here is a way to keep from having to run to the developer and do the snail mail shuffle for every job.  I want people to go to my photo hosting site, get what they want and then have the site send me a check.  So, that's the basic criterion and the focus of this site for a while...  I will let you know how it goes.

        Photo Albums, Photoblogs and Moblogs    [Back to  urlLink Search Results ]     Photo albums often make great companions to blogs. For instance, you might be blogging about your latest trip to Hawai'i and have dozens or hundreds of photos to share with your friends. If you create a photo album and upload your pictures there, your readers will be able to click a link and browse all your photos in easy thumbnail or slideshow formats. They could even order prints for themselves, and you wouldn't even have to worry about keeping track of how many reprints to get of which picture. It's very convenient all around.   There are a number of sites that offer free photo album services services. You can do a  urlLink Google  search to find them, or you can start by checking out some of these links:     urlLink DotPhoto     urlLink Fotki      urlLink Ofoto     urlLink Shutterfly     urlLink SmugMug       Another fun thing to do with your photos is to create a photoblog. This is like a blog, but rather than a series of text entries, it's a series of photos. You can upload them from your computer, or even email them in, which means that if you have a camera phone, you don't even have to be near a computer to send in photos. A free-roaming, mobile blog like this is often called a "moblog." A good place to go to create a free photoblog is  urlLink Buzznet . They even have a way you can syndicate your images and display the latest ones as thumbnails on your website.   Windows users can also post photos directly to their blogs with the  urlLink Hello BloggerBot .
