       The study skills depend on one thing, and that is your willingness to WANT to improve and do well in school. If you really don't want to make the effort and sacrifice, no amount of suggestions, ideas, or outlines can help much. You are the one who is responsible for your education, and effective study skills can help you.

       I was in a restaurant for a birthday party, then suddenly, breezing through the doors from the entrance I saw her. A vision in pink. I said to myself, "Who is this vision? Surely, she must be the understudy to some fabulous Broadway star. Look at her skin. Who does her hair?" In that moment, I knew that someday we'd end up like this, like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza. I said to Lolo, who was supposed to be one of my friends, "Dude, I'm in love. Could this siren love me? Are the gods that kind?" Lolo turned to me, opened his drowsy eyes and said, "Who you think you are? A knight in shining armor, riding a white horse? Why don't you just go to sleep again and stop exclaiming from you god damn dream?"

       In the world war II, paratroopers of the 101st Airbourne were totally surrounded by the Germans in Bastogne. They were short of food, equipment, ammunition, and even lacked winter clothing. So two days before the Christmas of that year, which I think is 1944, General Mcauliffe received a letter from the German Commander demanding the 101st's honorable surrender, the only way Germans offered to save the USA encircled troops from total annihilation. Guess what, the German Commander got the following reply, "To the German Commander,  NUTs !" On December 26, General Patton's Third Army broke through the German lines, allowing supplies to flow in and the wounded to be evacuated. But no member of the 101st has ever agreed that the division needed to be rescued.

       Children who watch a lot of television produce less melatonin, new research suggests - the "sleep hormone" has been linked to timing of puberty.  Scientists at the University of Florence in Italy found that when youngsters were deprived of their TV sets, computers and video games, their melatonin production increased by an average 30 per cent.  “Girls are reaching puberty much earlier than in the 1950s. One reason is due to their average increase in weight; but another may be due to reduced levels of melatonin,” suggests Roberto Salti, who led the study. “Animal studies have shown that low melatonin levels have an important role in promoting an early onset of puberty.”  Salti and colleagues studied 74 children aged between six and 12 years old, who normally watched an average three hours of television in the evening between 2000 and midnight. The youngsters, from the Tuscan town of Cavriglia, were encouraged to watch more TV than usual for a week preceding the study.  From: urlLink Television watching may hasten puberty

       For all their similarities, guys also display great variance. As satisfying as it would be to cynically insist that every man on earth is interested only in willingness to copulate, bust size, leg length and sympathy to scheduling issues during football season (in that order), it's not a fair judgment. Many qualities guys look for are intangible, so if you're in the market, be advised that most men value these features above all others.    1. Tolerance  This is often interpreted as "sympathy to scheduling issues during football season," but it's really much broader than that. Guys like what they like — whatever that may be, and it will certainly differ from guy to guy — and though they might make an effort to respect your feelings about their pastimes and viewpoints, they're not likely to change them for you. Guys want to be with women who don't roll their eyes when they head out to play D&D or insist that a visit to the shoe store is more important than hockey playoffs. Respect their idiosyncrasies and they'll respect yours.    2. Compatibility with friends  His friends aren't necessarily going to become your friends, but you need to be able to stand their presence. In fact, it would help if you like them a little, always remembering that they are his friends, so a certain boundary needs to be respected. There will be times when he wants to be with them rather than you, and if you like them it'll help clarify why. Similarly, a guy's friends and his relationship do not fill the same section of his heart: he needs both, and prefers when they fit together comfortably.    3. Honesty and decency  Men don't like being cheated on or lied to any more than women do. If you're a chew 'em up and spit 'em out type, your life will be a string of one-night stands followed by a bitter spinsterhood. You man must feel he can trust you without question, and it is your behavior that will ensure he does.    4. Independence  This is a tricky one, and it doesn't apply to every man in the wild, but there's a good chance he prefers to be with someone who can own and operate their daily lives. The complaint that he needs his "space" when a relationship sours is actually an indication that he feels constricted by your failure to manage your own affairs and respect his occasional need for privacy. You made it to adulthood without him; surely you can continue being self-sufficient now.    5. Comprehension of differences  Men, being from Mars, think before they feel. When men discuss problems, they do not commiserate, they offer solutions. This creates a huge communication gap in relationships, because a woman wants emotional support while the guy uncomprehendingly suggests a resolution. Neither side is right or wrong, but women are hard wired to be feelers and men are hard wired to be thinkers. Understanding that he is not being callous or short when he tells you what he thinks rather than what he feels will score you lots of points.   Men are complicated beasts, and it's no wonder that women still struggle to figure out what motivates them. We're all people, but there are some fundamental differences, and equally fundamental misconceptions, in what each gender wants from the other. But men aren't the shallow goobers they're sometimes made out to be, and giving them the benefit of the doubt in this will mean lots of potential mates from which to choose.

       Most computer companies are saving money by outsourcing the majority of their calls. This is actually not new, for a long time Dell outsourced its calls to local companies that did the hiring and firing and training, the service was actually better than Dell reps alot of times. Then Dell decided to "cut costs" and started outsourcing their calls to India, support has definitly gone down. I really don't have a problem with sending jobs somewhere else, I think it helps the global economy, but if your job is to talk on the phone having a heavy accent is usually not a good idea.  Recently Dell had to pull a large amount of it's support from India because a super large corporate customer was threating to switch because the support was so bad. But don't get confused, if you are not a huge company, chances are your call is going most of the way around the world.

       月华收，云淡霜天曙。四征客、此时情苦。翠娥执手送临歧，轧轧开朱户。千娇面、盈盈伫立，无言有泪，断肠争忍回顾?  一叶兰舟，便恁急桨凌波去。贪行色、岂知离绪。万般方寸，但饮恨，脉脉同谁语?更回首、重城不见，寒江天外，隐隐两三烟树。

        2  舒四犹在天地间漂游，远方却传来似真似幻的声音。 “该叫他起床了吧？” “嗯，时间差不多了。” “这次先丢什么？” “电池还有吗？” “只有1号的了，”这个声音忍不住叹了口气，“5号和7号都在他床上了。” “那就丢一号的！” “砸死了你负责？” “砸死了就往衣柜里一塞！” “强悍，敢问阁下可是姓马？” “然，鄙字家爵！” “原来阁下就是传说中的家爵兄，真是闻名不如见面，见面不如闻名。佩服！佩服！” “客气！客气！” “今日得以见君风采，小弟的敬仰之意真是犹如滔滔江水，绵绵不绝，又如. . . 哎呀，你丢我做什么？” “少废话，拿这个丢他。” “手纸？” “不要全丢，撕一点撕一点的丢，积少成多是游击战成功的要诀。” “Roger.”  一水隔天之处竟然下起雪来，舒四抬头望着天空，白色的雪花从黑色的夜空飘然而下，浑然不知来自何方，去向何处。舒四信手拈起飘落脸上的雪花，入手却毫无沁入肌肤的凉意，舒四不禁拿起来闻了闻. . .  “哼，积少成多？都丢完了还不是照样睡得像只猪。” “丢完了？你不是把盒子底下的也丢过去了吧？” “是啊。你该不会还要吧？底下的那些都被你揉成团了。” “我考，那是我平时在床上打手枪时塞进去的。” “啊！不是吧？打完手枪还塞到盒子下面去？” “半夜三更，不塞回去难道给你？” “喂，阿岚，他拿着你的纸在干什么呢？” “好像在闻. . . ” “他，他不是要塞到嘴里去吧？” “不会吧。不过好像. . . ”  一水隔天之处忽然风云变色，波涛再起，两个歇斯底里的声音响彻云霄，“不要啊――舒四――” 大惊之下，灵魂迅速归还本体，舒四一个转身，抱着毛毯从床上滚了下来。同一时刻，两个人拉开宿舍大门，嗷嗷大叫着冲到厕所吐去了。

       玩了半年，终究一场闹剧，不过好坏总算有个了结。回想起来，对此事终归是不上心，一切都交给老天爷去做主，自己则拖拖拉拉，唧唧歪歪，最后也终于把自己推上了失败之途。无心之际开始，便也于无心之时结束，只是却不知道到底是我根本就不是很想去，还是一开始就怕失败，所以总希望洒脱些、看轻些。不管怎样，品评失败的滋味却是不太好受，看着机会就这样从手中溜走，也不禁比平常更懊恼些。 是否失去了才懂得去珍惜？非也非也，再来一次只怕仍是会如此。近年来，想豁达处偏偏有些事情放不下，想作番成绩时却怎都无甚豪情大志，于是越来越不晓得该何去何从了。进而只懂发白日梦，整天等咱怎样了，便如何如何的。这样的人生，不打击一把实在是活得有够无趣！放得下放不下的，终究都是要放下，何况这次还俨然不属于放不下的范畴。失败的证据已经贴在书桌旁边醒目的地方，可以把它取下了的时刻我相信不会等太久。久违了呢，想狂傲一把的日子！ PS：也不知道是凑巧还是有缘，这次yossi又发短消息给我，就在我写上面那段话的时候。上次我为她订了60岁之约，可惜此约貌似会爽。转眼间，这次已经无法为她做什么了，只能祝她快乐，顺便把考试过了！

        urlLink Gmail Filter Tips : "I haven't seen anyone cover some of the undocumented filters trick you can do with Gmail. Gmail doesn't even have a 'how to' on filters yet. The reason they don't have a 'how to' is because it's pretty dang simple (oh yea, and its in beta still). You can setup a filter to automatically do actions on an e-mail such as: Skip the Inbox (Archive it), Star it, Apply a label, or Move it to the Trash. These filters can be based upon a combination of: From, To, Subject, Has the words, Doesn't have the words, and Has attachment. I haven't pushed the limited, but from this tricks 'n' tidbits page I see that Gmail currently has a limit of 20 filters. So I offer the follow tip for creating less filters: Use '|' (OR) and '*' (wildcard) characters to catch multiple e-mail addresses and apply a general filter.   Example 1:  Starring and Labeling e-mails from specified buddies of mine. I setup a label called 'Buddies'. Then I go and create a new filter. The 'From' field can contain multiple e-mail addresses, but not a comma delimited list like one might first expect. You need to separate each e-mail address with a '|' (pipe) which means 'OR'.   From: joe.shmoe@hotmail.com|Bob.Dole|geek@foo.com   The above example will catch e-mail from either joe.shmoe@hotmail.com, Bob.Dole@gmail.com (notice in my filter I didn't specify '@gmail.com', this is because you don't need the domain when referencing other Gmail users - same for when composing an e-mail), or geek@foo.com.   Click 'Next Step'...   Then just select the "Star it" option, and select the "Buddies" label. Now all new messages from these three friends will be starred and labeled automatically.   Example 2:  Very similar to example 1 but now using "*" wildcards. This filter catches all e-mail from vendors I frequently make on-line purchases with. Some vendors like Amazon.com will use multiple e-mail addresses when I make a single purchase - one when I first place my order and then another when my items ship.   First I create a filter "On-line Shopping". Then I go and create new filter with the following...   From: *@amazon.com|*@paypal.com|*@ebay.com|*@thinkgeek.com   The above covers a few places that I purchase items from - your list of course will vary, but you get the idea. And depending upon how avid of an eBay seller/buying you are - you may want a separate label.   Personally, I "Star it" and apply the "On-line Shopping" label to this filter as well. Then, when an order arrives and the transaction is complete, I manually unstar and "Archive" the e-mail, and it will always be available by the label search.So, I hope I was able to open a few eyes to the possibilities of using filters. Now... to test Regular Expressions in filters???

        urlLink Wi-Fi finds the way when GPS can't : "In the concrete canyons of city centres, GPS satellite positioning systems often fail because high buildings block the signals they rely on. But an unlikely back-up for GPS is emerging: Wi-Fi.  A Wi-Fi based positioning system developed in the US and the UK works best where GPS fails: in cities and inside cavernous complexes like shopping malls. And because cheap Wi-Fi technology is already appearing on a raft of gadgets like PDAs, cellphones and laptops faster than more expensive GPS receivers are, the developers predict that Wi-Fi could become central to new location-based applications. They say emergency services in particular could find the system an essential back-up. Wi-Fi allows people to connect devices wirelessly to the internet. Base stations are springing up in coffee bars, libraries, universities, airports, phone booths and other public places. Each base station broadcasts a radio signal to announce its presence to devices within a range of around 100 metres. This signal incorporates a unique network address code that identifies the base station. Anthony LaMarca of the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues at Intel's research labs in both the US and the UK, have developed software that constantly records the radio signal strengths from nearby base stations.  It can identify the origin of the signal from a database giving the location of 26,000 Wi-Fi base stations in the US and the UK. Using the signal strength from at least three base stations, it can then triangulate the user's location. 'This is a poor man's GPS,' says team member Bill Schilit of Intel Research in Santa Clara, California. "
