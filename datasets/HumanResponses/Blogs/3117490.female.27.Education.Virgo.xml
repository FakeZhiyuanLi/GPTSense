      Telah lama sudah bersama Bercinta berbagi asmara Namun kau tak dapat Tinggalkan dirinya untukmu Telah kuputuskan untuk menjauh Karena tak mungkin terus bersama Perpisahan jua lebih baik adanya  Harus ku akui Aku masih sayang kamu Namun hatiku tak mungkin dapat Untuk memiliki hatimu Walau pedih... Tapi ku baik-baik saja Tak usah kau tangisi pergiku  Bila kuteruskan semua ini Hatiku akan makin menggilaimu Walau aku tahu kau masih mencintaiku  Thinking of you,my heart's till beating I miss you But i m closing the door now And I m gona be alright I know I am.... PS.Thanks for the words,Ratu

      I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling She living she golden and she lives for me Says she lives for me Ovation her own motivation She comes round and she goes down on me And I make her smile Like a drug for you Do ever what you want to do Coming over you Keep on smiling what we go through One stop to the rhythm that divides you And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse Chop another line like a coda with a curse Come on like a freak show takes the stage We give them the games we play She said I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say Good-bye  The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there Smiling in the pictures you would take Doing crystal myth Will lift you up until you break It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock With a tick tock rhythm and a bump for the drop And then I bumped up I took the hit I was given Then I bumped again And then I bumped again she said How do I get back there to The place where I fell asleep inside you How do I get myself back to The place where you said I want something else to get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life baby baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say Good-bye  I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling an earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right, all right When the plane came in She said she was crashing The velvet it rips in the city we tripped On the urge to feel alive but now I'm struggling to survive Those days you were wearing that velvet dress You're the priestess I must confess Those little red panties they pass the test Side up around the belly Face down on the mattress One, and you hold me and we're broken Still it's all that I want to do just a little now Feel myself heavy as the ground I'm scared but I'm not coming down no no And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile But nothing is all right, all right  The sky was gold it was rose I was taking sips of it to my nose And I wish I could get back there someplace Back there in the place we used to
