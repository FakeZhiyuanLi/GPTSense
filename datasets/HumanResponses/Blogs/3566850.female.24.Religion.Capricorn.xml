      so i love photography.  right now, in fact, i am waiting for a guy in washington to post his darkroom stuff on ebay, so i can snatch it up and have pretty much everything i need. we emailed and arranged it ahead of time.  is that right?  what are the ethics of ebay, anyway?  i dunno.  whatever.  all i know is i am excited for this whole thing to finally be within my grasp.   i have been pining over the lack of darkroom because of space, time, and/or money, for over two years.  The soft glow of the dim, red light, the faint smell of chemicals, the excitement of dropping the paper in the developer and watching an image appear, before my very eyes.   excellent.    i love the process of taking pictures and developing film and watching it all come together in my hands.  it's going to become more of an anomaly as the digital age trudges forth, but maybe that will make the old-fashioned stuff all the more special and interesting.  i'm not one to prefer convenience, generally, where artistic endeavors are concerned.  it took me a long time to be comfortable with even buying a digital camera for snapshots, because i was afraid convenience would override my desire to print my own pictures.  it hasn't!  (that's an interesting topic, by the way.  tell me what you prefer, people, and why!)  where is the guy?!? must go check again.....i've hit refresh on my internet browser and checked my email about a hundred times in the last hour......    ooh! he emailed me, saying he's posting it at 1pm!!!   where is it???  it's 1:03.... *sigh*

      okay. so i am tired of being fat.    i realize i mentioned the atkins diet in my last (first) blog, and here i am again, about to talk about 'dieting' and being fat again.  one might think this is an ongoing thing for me.  or that i am obsessed with my appearance.  not really.  well, amber might argue with you on that one.  she has accused me on several occasions of obsessively looking in the mirror.  it's weird that i am one to do this, as i rarely like what i see there.  i guess i think if i keep looking, again and again, maybe i'll look better than i did the last time.  sadly, this doesn't seem to happen for me.    anyway, i am tired of being fat, like i said.  so, i have officially decided to change my life and stop mistreating my body by way of neglecting it.  i don't really believe in diets like atkins, or pills like hydroxycut or whatever other ones are out there.  i don't believe in quick, easy fixes.  the only thing that's ever worked for me before is changing what i eat, or how much, and exercising regularly.  period.    so, it's dumb to post about dieting, maybe, but i'm doing it because i'm finally making a decision to really make something happen here, and i consider this a way of holding myself accountable.  maybe i'll post progress on here or something.    my plan is to keep records and charts and all that stuff.  i like to see progress, or i'm get all discouraged and quit.  i'm going to try to write down what i eat, and what i do in the way of exercise, and i'm going to measure my big ole self once a week to see how it's all going.  i'm going to put it all in a folder, and on the folder, i am going to write "OPERATION STOP BEING FAT" on the front, all decorated-like.  oh yes, my friends.  yes.    post number two.  i'm certainly not any cooler.  maybe i'll be healthier, though.  if anyone has any ideas about exercise or anything, do let me know.

      so here it is, ladies and gentlemen.  the blog craze is becoming like as unto the atkins diet, exept that  a) blogging, to me, seems cooler than not eating bread b) see reason a.   beginning a blog now, i feel a bit like i felt when i began to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  even though my friends tried to convince me that they were great books, i didn't start reading them until about a month before fellowship came out.  so i was officially not as cool as everybody who read the books based on their own merit, but boy, am i glad i didn't let that stop me from reading them.    anyhow, i named my blog the bandwagon to sort of make fun of myself and my one-step-behind-everyone-else-ness.    what will i write about?  beats me.  i don't have a theme, unless ME is a theme.  oh well.  maybe i will talk about sam, the little baby sitting behind me in his chair.  maybe i will post a quote i like.  maybe i will put some pictures on here or talk about taking pictures or developing them in my almost darkroom ('almost' because it is neither completely dark, nor completely equipped yet).  maybe i will talk about your mom.  i dunno.  anyway, i will post something other than an introduction soon.    later, friends.  *elclang*

       crap the bed is what my good-and-no-longer-in-arkansas friend, rhonda, would say when something went wrong.  so i typed a big ole post and titled it "ketchup," cause i was catching up on posting.....i am clever. but not clever enough to save changes before i magestically erased them.  *sigh* i will try to recall said  erased  writings and ramblings.  updates on life.  operation:stop being fat! is not a complete failure. i still manage to semi-faithfully drink my giant jug of water. i haven't been so diligent about the notebook and charts and whatnot since vacation early in july. BUT! like i said, it's not all lost. i've dropped about 8 pounds and managed to keep off about 6. it's a start, i suppose.  the darkroom. it's getting there! amber and jess came down a while back for a fun and productive day of light-proofing the closet. it is now splendidly dark, thanks to caulk, insulation, foam, black plastic, and about 200 staples. i've processed 6 rolls of film (successfully!), but i haven't yet printed anything. that, however, may change as soon as today! mom's coming up with the enlarger table, and i bought a safelight bulb yesterday. i actually have two safelight bulbs now, thanks to amber (and sorry about the confusion, by the way)  anyhow, i may get around to it soon. i hope so. life is too busy, and i when i stop to think about what it is i've been doing that eats up all the hours, i can't really see that i've done all that much. is that how life is as you get old?  hmmm.  anyhow, go me for ketching up. i have some introspective-y things to say, but they wouldn't seem to flow here. perhaps i will post another while i wait for mom. i dunno how likely that is - Sam seems to be waking up!
