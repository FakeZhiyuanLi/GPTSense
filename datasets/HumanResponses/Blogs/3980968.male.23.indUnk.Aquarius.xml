        just ended a wk of fun n siong orientation...  &nbsp;  met new frens and fostered stronger relations with old frens... but din really get to know any freshies leh... how sad... mayb getting old liaoz... generation gap getting wider between the 81's n the 85's.  &nbsp;  i&nbsp;think most Sg gals can be materialistic or should i say more practical... theres this incident in camp where my fren got to pair up with a cute freshie for&nbsp;his SP (Special Partner ) nite...  &nbsp;  SP Nite is a program during our camp where the all freshies will be paired up to form couples and the guys will have to treat their gal partners to a romantic dinner out. being in a camp where the population of gals was twice tat of guys... the poor seniors&nbsp; (like me) would have to "top-up / sacrifice" their wonderful nite for this event so as to pair up the remaining gals (haha).  &nbsp;  blind dates... tats wat&nbsp;we called it... kinda SDU&nbsp;stuff but hey&nbsp;SDU pumped lots of $ for our camp leh... so ok lah... win-win situation mah :)  &nbsp;  as i was saying... when my fren met up with his SP tat evening, the first question his female partner asked was  "Do u have a car?" &nbsp;Woa... tat was kinda shocking&nbsp;for the&nbsp;"first impression"...&nbsp;my fren&nbsp;whos a nice guy&nbsp;and&nbsp;doesnt drive was rather sad when he heard tat... hmmm mayb&nbsp;there was a slight drizzle&nbsp;tat evening when they met up... having a car to drive her for dinner was definitely a bonus... but hey dashing in the rain to the bus stop to catch 179 could be as romantic as well... hmmm errr mayb not in NTU bah... too many slopes in campus... hahaha  &nbsp;  sometimes&nbsp;i just have&nbsp;to&nbsp;believe tat cars are the babe magnets... its not surprising to see gals crowd round&nbsp;guys who drive... tink theres just too many examples out there tat show cars are great tools to woo gals...  &nbsp;   no cars = no gals   i've still&nbsp;got&nbsp;prob&nbsp;to prove tat its wrong...
