       I BELIVE IN LOVE   Singer  : Tata Young  Writer  : Martin Ankelius/Henrik Andersson/ Carola H?ggkvist  I feel the heat around me I feel the beat surrounds me Could this be for real, I wonder No need for hesitation Itâ€™s time for celebration Will this be the night Iâ€™ve waited for   When angels fall in love Heaven knows, does it show, oh If this love, will last for eternity Set me on fire  (Chorus) I believe, I believe in love And like the stars above They shine, let it shine over me Set me free I believe in you And that our love is true Oh I believe, I believe   I see that people dancing Boys and girls romancing They want this to last forever   Cause underneath the moonlight Everything is alright Weâ€™re reaching our hands up in the air   To where the souls alive Heaven knows, that it shows oh If this love, will last for eternity Set me on fire  (Chorus)  How could I doubt, what was meant to be Everything I needed was in front of me Your healing touch, will lift me up in the sky, so high  (Chorus)
