						   I want Bush to be reelected this year. I do. Don't get me wrong. I don't like him, nor do i like any of his policies. I support him for "all the wrong reasons", according to my friends and colleagues. But I do think my support of his reelection is justified. Here goes my argument. One reason I want Bush to be reelected because I think America needs to learn a harder lesson.  For the past four years Bush etc. have done many bad things: cutting funding for education, screwing up medicare,  polluting the environment, handing money to the rich,  raiding wars on other countries, and getting many many foreigners and Americans killed. But obviously not all people have got enough from them. Actually more than half of the country agree with him and try to get him reelected, including many who were actually harmed by his policies. So my conclusion is that people haven't learned enough about the bad time yet. Therefore Bush should be given another four years so that he can do more damage to the country and the world. Maybe in 2008 people will finally realize how awful the country is under the management of the republicans, and then they will make better decisions for the next several terms. Another reason I want Bush to be elected is that there is really no real difference between republicans and democrats. On surface, it seems they are debating on every front. However when I look deeper into the issues, I am scared because of the similarities I see. For example, both are claiming that the US should stay longer in Iraq. Even the democrats are claiming that they will be more responsible and get the UN back to the mess, it is not clear to me that they are actually admitting that the fundamental cause of the war evil. Another example will be the attitude towards gay marriage. Kerry has already announced that he will not support gay marriage. There are also the issues of protectionism, isn't it ironic that after Bush imposed the tariff on steels now it is the democrats who are yelling about protecting American manufacturing industries? Some people may say all these are merely campaign tactics and the democrats are indeed much more liberal. But that will eventually put them into a situation where they have to break many of their promises and get people angry with them. The fundamental problem lies in the American public sentiment and the political system.  After all it is the people who are electing government officials. It is the people who decide to give the government power of doing all kind of things and implementing all kind of policies. So can I say the American people deserve Bush for four more years?

						   This is my first blog.  I don't know how it will go but I'd like to give it a try.  There are so many random thoughts I have everyday, most of which get lost because of the magic of time.  So I would like to keep them somewhere from today.
