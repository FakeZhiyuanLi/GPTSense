      my friend and I were walking to school and on one part of our "trek" we have to go down this hill, which leads to a path in between backyards of some houses. So as I'm walking down the path, I see this dog in a backyard. Although it didn't look quite right, it was about knee to waist high and was black with dark grey splotches. It also looked like it was half wolf. So me liking wolves, I walk up to it and let it smell my hand (of course I was hesitant at first) and it was okay. Then my friend tried to go closer but the dog looked up at him and growled as he approached. Then somehow the dog got out of the backyard and next I know, I'm on the ground getting licked on the face by this dog. This part is a little hazy, but I think I was able to talk to the dog too, but I'm not sure. Then my friend said we had to go to the train station (yea, that's a little messed up). I didn't want to leave the dog but I did, so we went to the train station, but I couldn't bear to be away from this dog, so I went back. So when I came back, I saw the dog and then woke up.

      Okay so I'm indirectly following this kid down a curving hallway. After awhile it turns into a maze/paintball field (but it's indoors). By now everything turned into shades of black and blue. So there's an empty space with this other kid crouching in it. I turn around, hear something, turn back and next I know I'm hit in the face with a brick.  Scary part: Well the brick in the face woke me up with a jolt. But afterwards it literally feels like I've been shocked by lightning. I was even shaking a bit. It's not the dream that scared me but the aftershock.

      Last night I had a dream with a husky in it. It was odd though because the husky was almost albino except for a slight blonde tinge. I feel like that dream was trying to tell me something, but I don't know what. I love dreams with dogs in them (especially huskies and wolves) and never want them to end.

      I was at my school and there was some kind of extra class/period in the morning. It lead me to some part near the back where I've never been before, it looked like a maintenance area. So I went down the hall, took a right, then a left and wound up in a room that looked like a hockey changing room (with that black plastic stuff on the bottom too). There was only a few people who were there before me. After awhile more and more people came in and then our teacher finally walked in and started talking. I don't remember what he said, but I doubt it was that important. Then he either opened this door or they just appeared, but I saw all these monitor lizards. Then he opened a door that lead outside. Then after about 2 more minutes of the teacher talking, one of the lizards went outside. Everyone, including the teacher, just stared at me. I guess I was the one who was going to have to get it. So I went out the same door, and found the lizard just sitting about 10 feet away from me. I started approaching it, then it ran up and tried to attack me. Well I think that, because it didn't' really bite anywhere bad, it was going for my neck, but not viciously or aiming to kill. At least that's what I think. Then our teacher came out and got the lizard off of me. Then slowly the rest of the class emerged with their lizards on leashes. But it was weird, 1) I was the only one without a leash on my lizard (was I special?) and 2) they attached the leases backwards. The loop that you're supposed to hold was around the lizard's neck and the student was holding the metal clip. I guess that since there was no collar, they had to attach it that way. Well now we're in the schools back field. I think it was spring because there was still snow out there, but it was melting and the air was quite warm. I don't think the snow bothered the lizards. So I followed my lizard around without a leash. He took me to the side of the field, where there was a ravine and a deep creek running through it. My lizard decided to jump into the creek, regardless if the ravine walls were too steep. So I tried to jump into the ravine and land on a little part beside the river to get the lizard. I realized that I screwed myself. The walls were too steep and muddy for me to get back up. I turned my back to the river, jumped up and tried to grasp something to pull me up. I don't know how (well I do, dreams don't have to make sense) but I saw my lizard staring me in the face. He hissed at me like he was planning that kind of fighting or play game. I called our teacher for some help, he restrained the lizard and helped me out. Then he finally gave me a leash, but I found it quite awkward to hold and keep it from slipping out of my hands.  In my short time in the ravine I decided that I had to name my lizard. I named him JoJo. So without much time, JoJo pulled on the leash and with a bit of a stuggle on my part, he got away and headed for the part of the creek that was level with the field. There was a group of kids near the edge and as a walked closer, I found out their lizards were digging themselves into the creek-bed. Of course JoJo decided to join in. I let him go in a bit but then, with quite a bit of struggle, I tried to pull him out. He pulled harder inwards, the leash slipped and somehow he climbed out of a hole in the field. I grabbed the leash and led him around the perimeter of the field with the teacher. I'm pretty sure we talked, but I forget what it was about. So we reached the other end of the field, which was a bit darker from the clouds and I found out we had, well used to have, a hockey rink in the snow. After walking the perimeter we headed back into the school and into the same room. I let JoJo run around the room off leash, but he just sat there. After awhile a couple more people came in. Then JoJo went into the hallway. He started "attacking" this garbage can that was on wheels. The teacher started laughing and told me to come and see this. JoJo bit onto one of the wheels and was pulling the can around the hallway. It was quite funny, but then I had to go get him, then the dream ended.

      It was winter and I was with my older brother, his friend and my mother. We seemed to be on some sort of raised wooden platform, with a swamp below. We were surrounded by bullrushes. My brother and his friend were sitting down at the edge of the platform and my mother was further down, looking at things. I was walking around the platform and I as what looked to be some sort of dam. It was just a built up concrete wall where the water was overflowing. Looking up from this "dam" I saw another platform across the swamp. I was shaped like a Y with two parts jutting out into the swamp. I became fixed on these platforms and trying to get on these platforms. I got everyone to get up and follow me. We started heading back to the entrance. When we headed back, straight up ahead us there was an exit to a busy road. Then the dream jumped to when we were in a parking lot with my dad in the car. I sat in the trunk while everyone else sat in the seats. I could see the entrance to that Y platform from the car, but the car drove off before I could say anything. Then the dream ended.

      Here are a few dreams that I bothered to write down while at my cottage. They aren't in any order and half the time I forgot what day they were dreamt on.   It started out with my friend and I at a busy intersection, on our bikes. I got this feeling that we were at the other end of the city, but the intersection looked exactly like one in this side. So we were trying to cross the intersection to get on a bus. When we get across, a bus pulls up. We try to get on, but the driver says something like "This is a ride only bus" and we get off. Then I noticed my grandparents across the intersection. I get over there and start talking to them. I think they were looking for directions. Also, there was a bridge just after the intersection, with a highway under it. So I take them over the bridge and start pointing them the way. At the other end of the bridge, it got all wooded. My grandfather stays put while I took my grandmother into the forested area. Apparently there were two very narrow and rusted railroad tracks surround by wall, which was then covered in vines. After a short walk there was a dirt hill, which we climbed. Beside it there was a go cart track and in front was the highway. I pointed the way a bit more, then it repeated but only started at the point where we were walking down the railroad tracks.   I was at my old school and I walked to where there are a few playing fields, but in the middle it looked like there was somewhat of a bus station. Even though it was crowded, I managed to meet some of my friends. The weird part was that my "friends" were Hige, Tsume, Toboe and Kiba. So at first I met up with Toboe and we talked a bit. I forgot to mention that at this station there was a raised platform, which I was on while kneeling to talk to Toboe (who was on the lower platform). So after some talking, Toboe noticed that the guy beside him was stole some of his (Toboe's) stuff, so Toboe stole it back while the thief wasn't looking and stole a bit of the thief's stuff, including an iPod. I asked to see it and he showed it to me. It looked exactly like the normal iPod, but it was slightly bigger and had more buttons. As I looked up, I saw Hige on another bus and I waved to him and he waved back. Then our bus came, Toboe and I got on but since it was so packed we had to stand near the door. As the bus rounded the corner to get out, my old Art/History/Geography teacher, Ms. Millard came on the bus by our doors. She was pretty pissed and demanded to know who caved the at the dance (I didn't know anything since I don't go to that school anymore). We got off at what seemed to be the same place and met up with Kiba and Tsume. While walking amongst the fields, we noticed some people playing catch in a baseball field and decided to join in. Kiba, on the other hand, decided to sit out and hang out with some girls who were playing gameboy. So it was just Toboe, Tsume and I playing catch with other people. After a bit we went to sit down with Kiba and watch everyone else play catch. Then this other girl walked in and Tsume wouldn't stop whining (in the "she's so hot" sense). Then I went to my grandparents house (which in essence, was exactly the same as mine, furniture and all) to introduce me to his new dogs. It turned out that his new dogs were Toboe, Tsume, Hige and Kiba but in their wolf/dog form, yet I was the only one who could see them in their human form (out of my grandparents and parents). They were all sitting under the kitchen table (except Kiba, who was somewhere else). I mouthed asking where Kiba was (since I didn't want to grandfather and father to hear me) and Tsume mouthed back that he was upstairs in the master bedroom. So I went up there and saw him playing gameboy beside the bed. I walked over, sat down beside him and watched him play. I have to admit, he was pretty good. When he got a game over, we flopped onto the bed where Toboe decided to join us. Then I woke up.   I was at my old school again, but this time I was walking around inside with my other friend. Apparently the school was having a bit of a flooding problem (this was probably linked to the main water pipe breaking at the start of last years school year). So we were walking around in shin deep water and decided to make our way to the school's office. When we got there, it was hectic as usual but one of the secretaries lead us to the phone. Instead of it being at the front, as it usually was/is, she lead us down a hall. When I got on the phone, I called my dad and asked him to come pick us up. He said he would. So we waited around in the office for my dad to come. It only took a few minutes for him to come. Then the dream skipped ahead to where my friend and I were at a construction area at night. We wandered around, came up to a small forest, walked through it and came back to the school.   My family and I (excluding my older brother) drove down to a mall. We parked in a parking garage and went to the mall. We stayed there for most of the day, until it got dark. After dark, we went looking for our car, but we just got lost among the endless amounts of dark, empty car lots. Every once in a while we came across a lot that was filled with a whole bunch of people, where we got the impression that they were either stoned or drunk or both. In the end, I got bored of the dream, never found the car and decided to wake up.   I decided to take the day off from school and hang around the house with my mom. After a bit of watching TV my mom had to go out and run some errands and I stayed home. While my mom was out, I got a phone call from my friend, who was talking about something with airports and busses. So I got on the bus and met him near the airport, where we then transferred to a bus to get home. When we got on I noticed the transfer the driver gave to us was printed on that light pink and blue paper, like the tickets AMC theaters give you and that the ticket itself was provided by AMC. So we're riding the bus until it hits a flooded part of the road (probably relating to the flooding in Peterborough). The driver decides to drive through it, so I find myself standing through the bus's sunroof. After a few minutes of ploughing though, we get out and it continues it's course. Eventually I make myself home. When I got home, my mom asked where I was and by then I woke up.

      For some reason, we were in canoes paddling down this fast/choppy river. There were about 4 people per canoe and about 10 canoes. We were heading for some kind of music camp. Then somehow I was out of the canoe, in the water. One of the parents in a canoe was trying to help me, but then my feet hit some rocks and I lost my shoes. While the whole river went one way, at one point there was a place that went the other way, in the middle of the river, towards a hole (but it wasn't a pipe or anything. It seemed natural). Then all of the sudden we're at the airport, outside, getting ready to board a plane. It was a small one where you have to go out on the tarmac to get into. Again, it was the same group. After about five minutes of waiting out there, we boarded the plane. The interior had really bad colors and was like the interior of a train. At the front were two sets of benches (on either side of the aisle) that faced eachother. Then there were somewhat big windows with green shades/blinds. Then, as I was sitting down, I saw my grandmother on the plane, as well as other people in the band that I recognized. Then it skipped to when we were transferring to another flight or going back home. This time the airport was in Montreal. I went to get some food from the fast food place there. As I was walking back, I saw everyone checking in, so I rushed to the counter and tried to check in. They said that they couldn't find my ticket. Then the clerk took me to this shelter across the tarmac, where everyone was waiting. We talked to my music teacher, but he said he couldn't buy me another ticket. He then suggested for me to call my parents to pick me up, ever though it was a 3 hour drive (one way) to get to Montreal). Then the clerk told him about this "traveler in distress" pass, which if I were to go on standby, I could get onto a flight for free if there were any seats available. So the clerk took me back to the counter and I used a pay-phone to call my parents and I explained the situation. Then as I turned around, I saw my mother standing there, looking around for me. I ran up to her, hugged her, and I woke up.

      I was biking along my usual route, but when I got to the point where there's a big field, but instead there was a house in the middle. So I went up to the house and found out that my step-grandfather owns it (but in reality he lives in Costa Rica). I went inside and it looked like he was having a party, it was crammed with people. Eventually I made my way into a huge room, that was lowered in the middle. Around the outside of the lower part there were tables lined with food. It also seemed that most of the people there were spanish. So I wandered around the house for a bit and met up with my parents and by that time it was night. Well at some point in the night, I was sitting at a table in front of everyone and other people were sitting at the table too. I remember I was in between these guys from school, Mitchell and Jordan. By my legs were their bass guitars (since they play bass and electric in a band). After a while, Mitchell stood up and played a solo. I don't know why, but I reached down, picked up Jordan's bass and started plucking on it. The crowed was going crazy over Mitchell's solo but was "boo"ing me at the same time. After his solo, Mitchell started yelling at me, asking why I ruined his solo. I said I was just trying to help. After that little outburst, I slunk off to the bedroom, but as I got through the doorway, it turned into the deck of the people next door at our cottage. Then three ravens started swooping around me. I fell to the ground and curled up, while two were somewhat pecking at my neck. They weren't actually biting me nor pecking, but just nudging it while the third raven stood about 2 feet away, just watching.
