      This may seem the appropriate response insofar as we still carry the peculiar sensation and burden, as Du Bois put it, of "second sight," of being the "seventh son[s and daughters]" born behind the veil and thus saddled with "this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity." It is this circumstance that allows the very question of whether some public utterances or performances "embarrass the race" to arise. This burden is made more bearable by what Cornel West has called the black "tragic-comic sense," that unique stance deriving from the absurdity of our status and collective memory as those brutally oppressed in a land and among a people that declared themselves the truest realization of human freedom and democracy. -  urlLink Lawrence D.

      yesterday was apparently one of the  urlLink hottest days of the summer , and because i live in dc that means it got DIS-GUS-TING.  a1. woke up late. alarm neglected its duties. too late to take shower. still a little  urlLink drunk  while drive to work. at 7:30a.  a2. kind of dirty/sticky and in a messily put-together suit-like outfit, I walk into the office and everything is wrong. proceed to make everything right (as seems to be my job these days) and attempt to have a cup of coffee. snap at a few people. have a cigarette. apologize to those that i snapped at. have more coffee. have another cigarette.  a3. perform many tasks of administrative and manual labor.  a4. end work day. go home.  urlLink pass out  for three hours.  and this is where it gets funny.  a5. wake up from delicious sleep [mmm. sleep.mmm.] and decide that i am hungry. the only edible items in the kitchen are potatoes (of which we have a copious amount by some stroke of fate) and a can of corn. so i pop two potatoes into the microwave and snap open the can of corn, which i eat straight up. mmm. corn. mmm. 5 minutes into cooking the potatoes, the microwave, computer, telephone, and diswasher go out. apparently i've blown the fuse. who knew? but i still want my potatoes. so i retrieve my trusty extension cord and plug the microwave into another socket (we have no idea where the breakers are and the place where we suspsct them to be is locked). 2 more minutes pass and the television goes out. apparently i've blown another fuse. haha. hahah. hahahahhah. but my potatoes are done so i am happy. my housemates hate me, but my potatoes are ready to eat. mmm. potatoes. mmm.  a6. shower. dress. go to  urlLink tryst . drink more coffee. am hyped up like the tasmanian devil. and, boy, do i feel good.  a7. go to a new bar in town, which i find greatly amusing. very comfortable (if hot). car seats for booths. delicious. i go upstairs to dance (yes, i dance now) whereupon i notice a snazzy dresser prancing across the floor. kat notifies me that this is a drag queen. duh. later, i go to the bathroom and have a run-in with said drag queen. she is AWESOME. AND she compliments me on my outfit. 5 points for me!  a8. we're getting a ride home and dude in the passenger seat starts singing along to the radio. it freaks me out a little bit because it's not a rock song or a pop song or any song that anyone would know the words to, plus the lead singer has a very high pitched woman's voice. plus his eyes are bulging out like he's going to pass a kidney stone or something. i tell him to stop. he sticks his head out the window. whatever. at least i got a ride.  a9. the caffeine is still pulsing through my veins. i can't sleep. smoke a cigarette. somewhere in between 4 and 5a, my brain shuts down and the day is over. whew.

      i just finished eating this really horrid tasting bagel JUST BECAUSE IT WAS FREE.  i wasn't really hungry, but i knew i would be later and thought that this would save me from going out and buying lunch.  yeah, it's only 10a.   it happened yesterday too.  i helped a friend move and her dad offered to buy lunch.  i really didn't want anything to eat BUT IT WAS FREE.  so i had a veggie quesadilla.   and then later i go to visit my roommate at the restaurant where she was managing.  she says to me, "do you want anything to eat?  do you want a beverage?"  deep down, yet again, i know i don't, but i can't help it.  so, again, i said yes BECAUSE IT WAS FREE.   the same goes with alcohol, but on a much less desperate level.   is this a problem?  should i get something checked out?

      this girl i was talking to at work told me about the NIH  urlLink clinical trials  and how they pay  urlLink MONEY  for you to participate. i looked it up and you can sign up for any "illness" you'd like to test in. it ranges from hypertension to "women's studies" to colitis to these strange diseases that only the NIH would test on. it's kind of funny. kind of. but i guess it's also kind of interesting and useful. you know, that whole medical research thing.  but anyway, back to the money.  so apparently people who do this regularly make enough to go on multiple vacations, pay off school loans, and buy cars. hopefully they will choose me. a girl can only dream.  is  urlLink Prince  doing a show tonight? where did i hear that?  i thought i saw my 2nd grade teacher on the street the other day. she was very cool. was the first person to introduce me to the works of edward hopper [GREAT exhibit at the  urlLink Whitney  where we got to lounge around the hall and draw our own versions of his works - i chose nighthawks. perhaps a premonition, or indication of what was to become? perhaps.] so i wanted to go say hello and see what she'd been doing for the past 20 years. then i realized it was a man.  fuck, i still want a cigarette. am i actually here? i feel like i'm on massive amounts of drugs. this is silly. i am silly. fuck. [but not a silly fuck. that's something wholly different.]

      last weekend my housemate's mother was visiting. he had to run an errand and so she, my housemate's girlfriend, and i sat around and chatted for a bit. "worst week ever" stories came up and i mentioned a GREAT one from the week before.  it goes a little comething like this: drunk as a skunk, i walk out of a neighborhood bar looking to the street for the nearest cab, while simultaneously trying to avoid any and all individuals that may even remotely recognize me.  in my rush, i have no idea that some other drunken fool has decided that the bar steps would be the perfect place to regurgitate.  lovely.  i don't see this, proceed to slip on the mess, and fall (ass first) into the pool of  urlLink vomit .  i was covered in it.  and it wasn't even mine.  yeah.  they LOVED that story.  they started telling some of their own.  it was a nice bonding point. felt a little like the  urlLink joy luck club , except not as asian.

      what is going on?  if you have to ask yourself that question at least once, no twice, a day then either a) someone needs to come over and give you the answer, or b) you need to vent your frustrations.  in this case, i prefer the latter.  thus my creation of this blog.   i've always been a diary sort of gal.  i buy these nicely, neatly decorated unlined, blank books and scribble my thoughts late into the night.  now i am 23.  i've decided to switch mediums.   so let's just get right to it (i'm very no-nonsense, as you can tell).   the worst week ever (consisting of):  1. getting into fight with best friend over said friend's stupid (and i mean STUPID) chicks.  2. consistently running 20 minutes late (-r than my usual 20 minutes late).  3. falling asleep at work to be awoken by the very picky client.  mmm.   4. falling down the stairs.  in a suit.  in heels.   5. receiving a very involved call from some guy that doesn't necessitate the involvement.  at midnight.  before having to be at work at 730a.   but i smiled and laughed.  what else is there to do?  really.   tonight i think i will drink myself silly. indeed.
