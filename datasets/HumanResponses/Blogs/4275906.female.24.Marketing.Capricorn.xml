       urlLink    Moon & Mui  urlLink      Went out wif ah moon to go gai gai and watch a movie yesterday.  It has been some time since we went out together.  Ever since she got a bf, she got no time for me. Sob...sob....but hey i aint complaining or unhapi thou.  I am glad she find a nice n decent guy to pamper her so that is all that matters. ;)        The Stepford Wifes is pretty nice n farnie.  I njoyed the movie.:)  What brighten up my day even more yesterday was that i found out something so sweet abt ah mooon.  We were in the theatre chattin n eating nachos while waiting for the show to start and i suddenly asked her a qns.  Actually last time i know that ah moon reli likes to eat beef and she has that pretty often.  But then duno ever since when, she kinda stop eating beef totally.  I alwys wanna ask her but always slip my mind.  So i asked her at the theatre again.  She told me she stop eating beef totally as she made a vow before during my accident many years back.  She vowed that if i am all safe n sound from my freaking accident, she aint gonna eat beef forever.  Gees....i din noe until yesterday and she is so sweet.  I m so touched n ah moon I LOVE YOU!!!  Muack muack....:D

They wanna go eat ban mian at the scots fd court.  But when we got there, luck aint wif us.  It was so damn crowded and so we decided to go eat ramen teh instead.  Actually quite ironic, i used to hate eating japanses food.  But apparently my surrounding frds all seem to like it pretty much.  So think as time goes by, i kinda get use to jap food also.  Hur...hur...:p  Anw i ordered unagi don n it was quite good...yummy :)  After that we went mac to have ice cream n basically to chill out.  It was fun n i laughed so much.  Mavis is reli a joker and we alwys have so much laughter when hang outa wif her.        Today i beary guai.  I stayted at home the whole day.  Washed the toilet and then iron a 'mountain' of clothes while watching tv.  It was quite tiring but still do it as mami is reli alwys so worn outa work.  Wanna lessen her housechores as much as i can.  But then i aint alwys so obedient n sweet thou.  I can be pretty lazy at times n i always get a hell outa nagging from her...sob...sob... :S

       Okie....this is the first time i come into this blog and just wanna check it out the functions n to write some thoughts here i guess.. :P I aint the type who writes a diary or something actually. But as i grow older and seems to have a beta mind of my own, it recently get to me that maybe i shd write it down somewhere. Besides expressing some thoughts n view on anything or everything, i find that writing in a blog is beta to a diary. As diary i aint able to share with my buddies. But having a journal in a blog, allow me to do tons of other stuff!: ) So i was like sufing the web n found this website. Find that is seems cool n fit the bill so here i created my VONTASYLAND! LOL Nothing extraordinary happen today as i aint feeling well n so cooping up at home to have some decent rest. Besides lately i feel kinda crowed n wanna have some private space to myself to sort things out. Hope tomorrow will be a cool day for me yeh...
