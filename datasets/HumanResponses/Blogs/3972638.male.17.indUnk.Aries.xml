       Back from the place I fear most, yet not really. My hair is long and dirty and my feet are tired and worn. I've walked for miles on miles with my bag on my back, my hat tipped back on my head, my sandal's worn with every beat, and my jeans tattered.  The Bible in my pocket, though yet to big to put into a shoe box, is worn and tattered as well. Good use has become of it and of me, yet in a way I do not yet know.       So long and eat well and fly into the Southern sky.       Steve

       I have nothing to talk about. My life is boring and dull. I wish I could fly (who doesn't). All I do on here is post songs. Is that cool? Shoot me and say yes.

       Eerie whispers trapped beneath my pillow   Won't let me sleep,   your memories      I know you're in this room,   I'm sure I heard you sigh   Floating in-between where our worlds collide   It scares the hell out of me   And the end is all I can see   And it scares the hell out of me   And the end is all I can see      I know the moments near   And there's nothing we can do   Look through a faithless eye   Are you afraid to die      It scares the hell out of me   And the end is all I can see   And it scares the hell out of me   And the end is all I can see      It scares the hell out of me   And the end is all I can see   And it scares the hell out of me   And the end is all I can see     Muse-Thoughts of a dying atheist

       Right now I am 30 min. away from putting my first dog to sleep. Yes, of course I am sad, but I pity the dog and he does need to go. Just way to much un-needed stress with him...for all of us...especially my mom. Its a sad thing putting something down that you have grown up with and loved, and it always will be.    &nbsp;  Until the Stars fade and the moon falls into the ocean, I will miss you always, and I will shed tears of scarlet, and bleed drops of love until the day I pass.

       I love my dog but he is SO FREAKIN STUPID! That is why we are putting him down Friday at 10 in the morn. Its very sad because; He's my first dog; He's MY dog.   Having him has been a love/hate realationship. He keeps my mom awake at all hours of the night and is constantly barking. But, ::sigh::, it is time for him to go.     &nbsp;    Goodbye and Goodnight

       Today, I sat at my desk, reading the music of Muse. Their stuff is tuff as a coconut in prime season...But I'm getting it down. I just practiced one song...Hypermusic (off their increable album Origin of Symmetry, very highly suggested that you go out and get this). Fun stuff.     &nbsp;    Your golden lies feed my role

       Okay, I am going to try and give a funny comment at the end of every post from now on, daily as often as I am home and can spare time to update this. Later.    All those who believe in psychokinesis raise my hand.

       My parents have no idea how hard they are on me.      Why am I so scared of the hunt? It should not be that hard. Its just a simple piece of paper at a large place (or small depending on which part of the world you are in). Next week will be the week.      I am hitting the open road.       Why is it a penny for your thoughts but you always have to put your two cense in? Somebody's making a penny.

       There is a song I absolutly love, but I have no idea who does it, and I have no idea what its called. Hank, next time we talk or hang, I'll wistle it for you and I am SURE you can tell me.       Tears of Depleation         Your stuck, stuck in your room. Stuck in the place you don't want to be. You lie down and cry, and look at the memories of the Postal Service, assisting by your side, as you lie down and die.      Your ribs are cracked, and you life is wacked, while Angels cry by your side, as you lay in your bed. The puddle of your life, grows ever deeper with strife, as you wish you were dead. You'll always have a shoulder for your head.      My life is depleated with yours, as I bleed on the shores of depravity. Let me catch those falling tears of yours, for all of our years. I am here, never there, you can count on me.

        Baren Land That I Call Home       Here I am in my baren land, looking out the window again, oh yeah.      Here I am and I call this home, nothing to do but rome around, always, oh.         Read a book or walk around, climb a tree and fall asleep, all day, all day.      Going back to what I call home, nothing there and I'm all alone, alone.         Looking down upon my stars, they are black and I am blue, always, always.      Man I wish they could fly, take me up into the sky and stay, always.         So long baren land, you are gone and turned into sand, to sand.      I am up with the stars, they are gone from my arm, and I've gone along, along.         I'm never coming back, I am gone, my bags are packed, for good, so long.      I am sitting on the glass, all my time has passed, and I am gone, so long.            This is my song. Thats right, I wrote this odd compilation of words. Put it to any tune you can but I like to sing it to Parachutes (Coldplay). There is and is not a story behind this. I don't feel like explaining it, but if you talk to me at any point in time, maybe I'll explain it to you. Go ahead, and drop the bags and run.      Vermacious EP
