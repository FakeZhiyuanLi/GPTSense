      A friend of mine once told me that each photograph steals a part of your soul.  Well today I went and picked up 4 packs of developed film.  And finally a place where they say that it will be done in a hour it is actually done in an hour.  How many places can say that???  But I got the cutest photos of my nephew.  He is the cutest little thing.  So if they steal a part of your soul then mine is gone.  What about yours??

      Ok Ok I get it....I Love the 90's hey I totally loved the 80's too.  I just think it is a little early for this.  I dont think enough time has passed for us to really enjoy this.  The 80's was funny because so much time has passed and you can say....OH MY GOD I REMEMBER THAT...where right now I can remember every single thing they have on it....thats not a shocker though...honestly.  Happy Birthday Johanna

       I never ever know what to post on these things.  Honestly a friend of mine had one and I thought....why not.....THANKS TARYN.  Keeping on that subject....ever really think about the things you actually do in life???  A person suggests something and you do it.  Well maybe not right at that moment but the thought gets in your head and eventually you might end up doing it.   During my vacation this week I went to see the movie  "The Notebook" starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams (check out the website at www.thenotebookmovie.com) and I think it will be one of the Sleeper Hits of the Summer.  A few days later I was shopping and I came across the book by Nicholas Sparks.  And although the storyline from the movie has been adapted from the book...the book is so much better.  I suggest the movie and the book to everyone.

      A very smart woman named Shelley sent this to me.  I hope when you read this it gives you the same inspiration.......thanks Shell                                                             BITCHOLOGY  When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a bitch. When I stand up for those I love, they call me a bitch. When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do things my own way,they call me a bitch. Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in my heart It means I live my life MY way. It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.  When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it, I am defined as a bitch. The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being everyone's maid, or when I act a little selfish. It means I have the courage and strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone else's idea of what they think I "should" be. I am outspoken, opinionated and determined. I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that!  So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold within me. You won't succeed. And if that makes me a bitch, so be it. I embrace the title and am proud to bear it.  B = Babe I = In T = Total C = Control of H = Herself  B = Beautiful I = Intelligent T = Talented C = Charming H = Hell of a Woman  B = Beautiful I = Individual T = That C = Can H = Handle anything

       Question:  Why do people (managers) always criticize that things not getting done when they are also not doing what they are suppost to be doing??      Answer:  Because they have no life and want to prove they are doing their job reguardless of anything else.      Sorry I got an email from a manager of mine today reminding everyone that they need to do some paperwork that is not getting done.  But here is the problem...when the manager is the only one working he doesnt do it either.  So what type of example is that.  My thought is this.... if   you are not doing what you are suppost to do they how are we to do what we are suppost to do??   Now doesnt that make sence.  Always lead by example.      So last night we all went out to this local bar.  It was an enjoyable night I must say.  Sometimes its just nice to hang out with some friends and forget about the world and all the problems.      Oh just a side note.....my nephew found his foot.
