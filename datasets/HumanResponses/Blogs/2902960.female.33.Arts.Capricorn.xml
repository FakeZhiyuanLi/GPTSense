      This week has been amazing, even though I haven't spoken to Mark on a daily basis.  I have to thank some very special buyers for not only giving me a sense of pride, but unlimited encouragement just by selecting my very first pieces venturing into Oils.   urlLink Maddie's  mom, an absolute dream, as well as my wonderful clients in Germany, the UK, and South Carolina.     When I return from my trip the end of next week, I will be creating a few new pieces in all three of my favorite mediums, and as excited as I am to be able to see my husband, I am also very excited to come home and pick up those brushes!    Thanks,  urlLink Lolo  for the awesome tattoo design!!  We'll take pics of our tats and I'll post them when I get home.   urlLink Here's the design!    urlLink Taba , I'll be thinking of you this weekend and hoping you have a blast at your baby shower!     urlLink Carrie , TONS of thoughts your way too for huge card sales and a successful weekend!!  and  urlLink Joe , I hope everything is going well hanging your cool artwork and can't wait to see the results of your Cafe show!  Everything looks great, and I'm crossing my fingers for ya! :)  I hope you all have a WONDERFUl, blessed and artful week!!!  I will miss you guys!! xoxoxox

      Today's been one of preparing paintings to ship, running to Dick Blick for a few things (hangers, wire, etc.), scanning, preparing COA's, signing, and shampooing carpets.  (Had to throw that in the mix!)  I'm packed and ready to go, leaving early Saturday morning for a long day of flights (2 layovers, three planes) - This is going to be a "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" kind of day.  I leave here, go to Minneapolis, then to Memphis, then Louisiana, grab a rental car, find my way to the base (1 1/2 hr drive from the airport according to Mapquest) to pick up Mark and a couple of other guys who weren't able to get rentals, then to the hotel.  I figure we'll be settled in at about 8 p.m., after leaving here at about 7 a.m.  It will be a long day!  So now I'm going to have to run to Staples, I ran out of paper clips, bubble wrap and full sheet labels to print my COA's.  Then I will spend the evening with the girls, finish packing in the morning and run to the post office.  Exciting, eh?  Aaah the administrative life of an artist.   I haven't even painted this week, so I won't have any new originals to list until a week after next.  I may put some prints up on auction just so I'm not forgotten while I'm gone!    We lost our nephew yesterday.  :(   Reason unknown, I don't know when services will be, but I am hoping that it will be later next week so we can attend his funeral.  Only 26 years old, it's really hard to wrap your brain around it when there's no reason.  He was at home getting ready for work and his wife's mom came to watch their baby (not even a year old) and she found him on the floor.  I can't even believe it.  It seems very surreal.  So those that pray, please include Jerry, Lisa and Cade in your prayers, Lisa will be needing a lot of strength, and Cade - poor lil guy will never remember the time he had with his daddy.  My brother in law (Jerry) is a wreck too, as you can imagine.   Sorry to be a bummer about that.  It's pretty sad.   Ok, Jay is up from her nappy, best get to finishing the "to-do" list!  xoxoxo

      I know this probably isn't such a big deal to many, but it's a rare thing for me to have a pedicure!  I took the girls tonight to get our "nikkernaiws" done.  They painted eachothers nails while I had this fabulous full resurfacing of my winterly hard and cracked feet.  Don't you love my shiny raspberry nikkernaiws?  It's got an iridescent-metallic type finish.  I lurrrrrve how they turned out.  I cannot wait for Mark to see my purdy toes this weekend!  :D

       "May we indeed inculculate in the lives of others that like the rose, that like the baby breath, like every flower that blooms.  For it does its best with what has been given it by man, to glorify its Maker with all its beauty, its color, with all of its love for the appreciation of spring, of the rain, the sunshine, the shadows.  And so the man in like manner, with the worries, the troubles, heartaches, the disappointments, may draw closer and closer to God, knowing that this may be done as in the Son.  He gave Himself that man might know that appreciation, that love, and how that in meting it to others we come to learn, to know the meaning of disappointments, of little hates, little jealousies, and of how they may grow by entertaining them; but more importantly how the joys may grow also just by entertaining them, as do the beautiful flowers that God hath given, that man might see His face in them."  More later.  Just had to share this from a mail I received from my bestest buddy this morning.  Absolutely inspiring isn't it?      Here's more!  I just finished the design and shading on the bowl.  You might be able to guess by now where the baby possum is going to be sitting in the bowl.  I am very excited for these layers to dry so I can rock & roll on the little critter!  His tail is going to wrap around the side of the canvas a bit.  Still, no progress on the weight loss today.  It's frustrating!  But I am not giving up!  If I am not gaining, and not losing, then I am still on the right track.  This will be a year of constantly battling my body to do what I need it to do!  Walked over 2 miles on the treadmill yesterday, and so far today have just over a mile in.  It is getting easier to walk a mile at a quick pace and get it done in under 20 minutes, so we've been keeping it at 30 minutes and ending wherever we end.    No other news to report today, woke up, cleaned up, treadmilled, painted.  Nice relaxed life I lead, huh?  Not sure what I'm going to futz with this afternoon, maybe some website changes, maybe try to sketch out a blueprint for the changes I'd like to make to the playroom.  (Turning it back into a family room!)  Aaah decisions, decisions.   ;)  Have a great afternoon! xoxoxo

        Woah can you see the possum?  No?  Hm.. I'll have to fix that!  ;)  Seriously, This is my progress for the day.  Oils.  Gotta let 'em dry.  So today, the base coat for the bowl.  Tomorrow, the bowl design.  Thursday, the possum.  Then on to the auction block!    I spent a good portion of the day making   urlLink  very cool labels for the CD's I mixed for Mark  !  They're so cool!  Have a look!  It took me hours to put them together.  I love the one on the top left, that was taken on our (second) wedding day.  It really shows how much I love him.  Yep.  It does.  And I do.  That much.  He called today too.  In the middle of the day even!  There was a little skirmish today.  They're all ok.  Thank God.    No   Weight Loss progress  to report today!  Same same, a day later.  I guess you'll have days like that!  Foo on days like that though!  Foo I say!  I shipped out my Macaw study today, as well as a print of Possy 2 to the very wonderful owner of the reference photo.  Of course all of my reference photo providers and copyrighter-givver-uppers get a free print of the painting if I use their photo.  How fun is that!   Almost like a free portrait, eh?  It's the least I can do.  :)  I think I'll be getting back on the treadmill in a bit.  Gotsta stay motivated!  Happy Tuesday all! xoxoxo

        Looks like a table, yea?  It better!  ;)  This is the beginning of what I'm working on now.  There will be a baby possum sitting in a dish on this table.  It'll be so cute!  (it's actually 6x6 - 1 1/2" gallery wrapped canvas, hehe!)  Not much to report yet today.  The weather is gorgeous, nearly 60 degrees, bright bright sun, green green grass - I love spring & summer!  I've got to get some yardwork done, too!  My father in law has a rototiller that I need to borrow to break up some ground and get our patio blocks back in place from the studio construction upheaval.   WEIGHT LOSS PROGRESS:  still 20.5 lbs., 59 days!   already walked a mile this morning, shy of 30 minutes but my leggies were rubber from yesterday's near 3-mile walking!  3:15pm CST:  urlLink I've got 3 paintings going at once now! :D    Catch ya later, have a great day!! xoxoxo

       The picture of the day!  Jayden and Caitlin wearing Daddy's spare hats.  Awwww!!  You all have to see Carrie's website if you haven't already!  It's so cool, it even won an award!  I think it's because of the content, she says it's the design, well we're just going to have to compromise Care (even though it's your content that makes it rock!)  Have a look:   urlLink  The Painting Brush  !  Check out her Links page too, that's where the award is, and also some fabulous-o shopping and artist linkiedoos!  Yes can you tell I am a  smidge  wired?  You can call it excited, too.  Here's why!    WEIGHT LOSS PROGRESS: Down 20.5 lbs. in 58 Days!!!!!!!    I am now under goal for the week, and 9.5 lbs. from my goal for the end of April!  Go me!  In addition, I've been SO motivated, today alone I've walked over 2 3/4 miles.  Sorry, Paige - I walked more after our morning walk!  After burning 5 new CD's for Mark lastnight, I just had to test 'em out.  :)  You guys are all so great, making me feel warm and fuzzy when I check in and while I'm thinking of my next entry.  Thank you.  For reading, for chattin' back with me - I appreciate it!   {{{huggles and snuggles for all}}}  My next artistic project is a baby POSSUM!  Yep.  A possum.  Those little critters are just the cutest things!  I've started prepping the piece and will get to painting here after I rid myself of the post-workout um...yiky smell!  LOL  I hope you are all having THE BEST weekend!  And don't forget to check out Carrie's site! ;)  xoxoxoxo  p.s. woah! I hope I didn't frighten you with my flip-flop!  :D

       urlLink     Good morning everyone!  I was up late lastnight (make that early this morning) finishing up Timmy!  **THIS IS THE FINAL SCAN of  the painting!  Much nicer than the digital, eh?  Click on his image to view the auction!  :)  Mark called a little while ago.  He's doing good!  They have 2 man trailers over there that are a pretty decent size.  No kitchen/bathroom or any of that fancy stuff, but they have power and blank wall space that needs fillin' up.  I think I can take care of that problem!  Those calling card minutes are expensive!  He ran out of minutes on the first call 'cause I didn't have the right number from him to recharge it.  So we got off the phone (after getting the right info) and he got back in line while I recharged.  :D  Caitlin got to talk to him when he called back.  whooohoo!  Now I have some shopping to do, he needs powdered gatorade, they don't have it over there.  He also wants me to go "pick up" a wireless laptop.  I have no idea how I'm going to do that, do you think computer sales people take good looks and short skirts into consideration when bartering?  hehe!  Weight loss progress:  Same as yesterday, only add a day!  (Friday night.  Had to eat out.  daggone it!)  HAPPY SATURDAY!!!  I'll stop back later and update if anything exciting happens.  For now I think I'd just like to hang out with the girls a bit and find a new fuzzy animal that inspires me.   Have a great one! xoxoxoxo

      I painted late into the night lastnight, Timmy is coming along nicely!  Here's another progress photo.  I need to finish up the lettering on the side of the book and then work on his layers.  I will finish this piece today!     I'm in the process of burning several songs from CD's to my hard drive so that I can mix and burn a few more for Mark.  I'm waiting for 5 more CD's that I picked up on eBay, and need to pick up a few more at the store that I jotted down in the truck while we were out yesterday.  Do you guys keep pens/pencils and paper in the car with you?  I have it sitting right in my dash so if I'm ever stopped and think of something or just want to doodle, I have supplies right in front of me.  I need to get used to taking my camera along with me wherever I go, too.  I am ALWAYS thinking "ug I wish I brought my camera!" when we go places.  (Lolo, your photos inspire me to bring it along too!  Do you ever forget it and beat yourself up about it?!)  I would love to know what each of your top 5 all-time favorite songs are!    WEIGHT LOSS PROGRESS: DOWN 19 LBS IN 56 DAYS!!!!    :D  Back later!  Have a great day!! xoxoxo

      Happy Thursday everyone!  First I want to share with you this wonderful concoction I put together lastnight!  I've made it quite a few times, and love it.  I don't even have a name for it, so you can make one up for me.  It's really easy, very light, low cal, and yummilicious!    Things you'll need: Tri Color Rotini 1 Can of  urlLink Del Monte Italian style diced tomatoes  Grated cheese blend (the good stuff that melts a bit!) Steamed zucchini slices (get these ready before hand, I use a tupperware steamer with a smidge of water in the microwave for 10 minutes.)  Boil the pasta, drain, dump in the tomatoes, mix in the zucchini, sprinkle with desired amount of grated cheese and blend it all together.  Voila!     Hope you like my quick mom-on-the-go-painting-in-every-spare-moment recipe!  I will be heading down to test a print of my Macaw painting.  Keep your fingers crossed, I am hoping for a fabulous print!  It's tough to scan larger pieces in sections, and I found a place that has a large enough flatbed to capture all but about 1/4" of the edges on that painting.  YAY!  I painted more on the kitty yesterday, but had to wait for it to dry enough overnight to put the lettering on the cookbook.  I painted his sweet nose.  I couldn't resist.  But since there's not a lot *more* progress, I will refrain from another WIP until I at least have the lettering painted.  :)  Weight loss progress:  down 18 lbs in 55 days!  HAPPY HAPPY!  Have a good one, I'll be back later today!    5:50 PM (CST) UPDATE   Welp, folks, It's official.  I've got prints of  urlLink  Alex, the Macaw  !  I am really excited!  I put a lot of work into getting them just perfect.  Color correcting, trimming, adhering to foam core, they look great!    urlLink  Here's a shot of my very first Limited Edition (of 5), sitting right beside the painting.   You like?  Ran errands doing this today and picking up groceries.  I had a huge order arrive today from  urlLink Dick Blick  with 2- 18x24 canvas (one is for my remake of Vermeer's  urlLink  Girl with a Pearl Earring  ), 2-16x20's and 3-12x16's.  They have modified their 1-1/2" deep gallery wrap canvas and it's PERFECT!  Also picked up a few new colors in oil; Renaissance Gold, Transparent White, Winsor Yellow and Flesh Tint.  I bought those with the Vermeer piece and the new (additional) portrait of Mark I'll be doing in mind.  I haven't had time yet today to work on the kitty painting.  I would like to do that here in a little while.  I will definitely have it finished tomorrow!  Have a great evening!  xoxoxxo

         6:00 AM CST, 3:00 PM Baghdad time today, Mark called from his destination in/near Baghdad.  It's been a week since I've talked to him and was GREAT to hear his voice.  He sounds so good!  He said to tell everyone "don't believe what you see on the news, it is nothing like they make it sound".  Thank God.  I will probably add to this entry later on today, I am going to paint!  Do you like the changes I made here lastnight?  Just trying to spiff the place up a bit!  Weight loss progress:  down 17.5 lbs. in 54 days.   3:14 PM CST UPDATE  I've been painting today, and BOY does it feel good to paint.  Between hearing from Mark this morning, getting our first letters from him today, finding a place that might be able to capture a good image to make prints of Alex (the macaw), and diving into oils - It has been a most excellent day!  And to top it off, it's around 67 degrees! :D      As usual, I will share my work in progress photos of what I'm painting.  I love how this cat is coming along, and have spent quite a few hours on it already.   urlLink  View the work in progress: Catnipnap    I haven't decided on the title yet to this piece!  That one I just made up to amuse Caitlin.  She giggled.  ;)  Back later with more! Hope you're having a great day, too!

         Ssssh, Jay is sleeping.  Don't you love how she set up her bear-bears beside her on her hugs pillow (I won that from a vending machine at Denny's!), and then wrapped herself up in her bear-bear blankie for her nappie?  And see her pink nikkernaiws?  She twirls her haircut as she falls asleep.  Well, she twirls it all the time, but I think it's precious that she does it as she falls asleep, and even while she's sleeping if you watch close.    (p.s. nikkernaiws = fingernails, and haircut = ponytail)  Caitlin's nappie and bedtime habit includes pulling the tickles off of her fleece fuzzy blankie that she stole from me as a toddler.  She either makes a wish and blows them into the air, or tickles her nose with them as she falls asleep.  I remember one time she had a sinus infection, she was blowing blue tickles out of her nose.  LOL   (p.s. tickles = the fuzzy stuff on fleece blankies)  I hope you are all having a good day!  I've prepared my next painting and will start it in a little while.  One of my wonderful clients/friends has sent me at least a dozen beautiful photos of her kitties (she has 25 --last I knew!!), one of them is curled up napping on a cookbook.  It is precious, and that's what I'm working on next.  :)

It's gorgeous even though it's chilly out, the sun is so bright, the sky is a beautiful blue, my trees are budding, and the cardinals and ROBIN'S are singing!!!  YAY for SPRING!

      Here's the rundown on revisions today:  The  urlLink  Home page   has been updated with a couple of menu revisions, added direct links to the pet portrait galleries (cat, dog, other), as well as for my wildlife paintings (by medium!),  added a new transitional graphic that highlights three of my new oil paintings.  I have added an  urlLink  OIL painting gallery   that includes my new paintings, the Hummingbird, Egret, Bernese Puppy, Blue & Gold Macaw (that's still up on ebay), and Autumn Eyes II.  All of the "click to enlarge" images are up and running!  My  urlLink  India Ink Wildlife Paintings   all have click to enlarge images now.  The  urlLink  Oil Pastel Painting Gallery   has been updated with click to enlarge images as well as the addition of my last Sun Conure (Elvis!) painting.  Also, my  urlLink  Colored Pencil and other art page   has been updated, I even put some pics of me in the "click to enlarge" images of my giant frogs that I did last summer for the Frogs-A-Hoppin' Project.  Fun!  Last but certainly not least, Mackie has been added to the  urlLink  Pet portrait gallery  , my first birdie bird pet portrait!  ...I'm not counting all of the other ones I do just for the love of birds ;)  I think that about covers the updates for the day.  Tomorrow I will work on my Portraits gallery "click to enlarge" images!  p.s.  "My blog" link now says "My blog"!  I hope that's better for everyone.  Comments welcome!  (click the comment side of the two linkies below, and if that doesn't work, please e-mail me, Grazie, and Danke, "M"!)

      I worked on the site a bit lastnight, and am getting ready to dive in again today.  Each gallery thumb is clickable to a larger image that requires its own graphic, and I need to create all of those graphics.  I did change the link colors, darkened them a bit, hopefully you still know they're links, yea?    In other news, I am still plugging away on the diet, lost another pound for a total now of 16 since Jan. 29th or so, and took a couple of weeks off there for my visit with Mark and recoup time.    There was a deer in my backyard yesterday!  My yard is fenced in, suburbia you know, and I live along one of the main roads in my area.  We do have some wooded areas and we have seen deer around, but I would never have expected one to jump my fence and hang out in my yard.  LOL  It was so exciting!  I grabbed my camera and ran outside, but she was gone.  A few moments later, she and her friend went galavanting down the easement behind our house and I was able to get a (blurred) picture of them.  Better get to work!  Have a blessed Sunday! xoxoxxo

      What a day yesterday! I walked over 2 miles on the treadmill, and spent over 4 hours out in the front yard doing spring cleaning with the girls.  Can you say "exhausted"?  ;)  I would love to have the  urlLink garden of Lolo , but I have to face it.  I live in the midwest.  Sigh.  I am going to fill the front flower plantery thing we made last year with beauties though, a nice bright selection of flowers that will fill it up and make me smile all summer.  Any recommendations?  All will be considered, written down, and searched for at the nursery!  I am not sure if my daisies, stargazers, primrose or clematis are going to return.  They still appear to be there, but I have no green thumb.  In fact my thumb has blisters at the moment!   urlLink Carrie's site  is all current now, all of her shoes and new purses et al are up and purdyful!  I was up til 1:30 am after I finished up her site, all wired and ready to assist the firemen who were parked in front of my neighbors house.  I did finally fall asleep though, woke up hourly it seems, thanks to my crazy dream.  I don't know what I'd do without them!  And I have to plug  urlLink Erika's latest portrait , she is gorgeous Erika!  Well done!  I know your client loved her, am I right?  Caitlin is spending the weekend with Grandma & Grandpa and Cousin Stacie, and since this marks the 16th day in a row of "no break from the kids" it will be strangely peaceful with just me & Jay.  I'm not even sure what we're going to do yet!   I hope you all have great plans for your weekend!

      I've decided to name this sweetie Alex.  It's a gender free name (since I am not sure of the gender), and it's abbreviated for Alexandria, which is where I met him (her?).  Remember that  urlLink airplane sketch/study ?  I will probably include the study with the painting.  :)  The first WIP shot is pretty funny, looks like blue feathers and a beak just floating around, this one is more grounded.  I should have it finished tonight or tomorrow morning and will list it on eBay.  (it's 12x16 in oil)

      Well, no I'm not painting NOW, but I did paint yesterday and today, and I finished the Cockatiel portrait.  I am waiting for the final OK from my client, and then I will post her here for you to see!  I have a few more things to do, but DISHES aren't one of them thank GOD! hehe!  They're all done!   Caitlin and I both wrote letters to Mark today, and I have to run for large envelopes to send them all.  Oh now wait.  Doh.  I should send them all in separate envelopes!  Yep, that's what I'll do.  He needs LOTS of envelopes.  Not just one big one.  ;)  Silly me, I need a refresher course on how to spoil your husband overseas.    I am going to paint my Macaw tomorrow!  Yep!  I am!  Yahoo!!!  G'nite everybody!  xoxoxo

      I am so excited, my new dishwasher will be delivered and installed today!  Since Mark's initial departure in November, we lost the stove, the furnace, and the dishwasher.  I had the stove replaced before he came home for Christmas, the furnace went out shortly after he left again so we had that repaired, and then the dishwasher.  I've been handwashing for over a month.  blech.   Yesterday morning, Jayden and I went and picked out the new one, and I am excited to test it immediately with the 4 days of dishes that I have refused to do.  hehe!  I began working on my pet portrait commission yesterday, the Cockatiel.  What a beautiful bird!  I love their rosy cheeks. :)  It will be finished later today and go to my client for proof/approval.  It felt good to paint yesterday (in india ink), I have to say I am in love with all of my chosen medium.  Seems like each new thing I learn in a different medium I can apply to another, and it's really cool!   I've also decided that I am going to rework Mark's portrait in oils.  This will happen between commissions and ebay pieces, either that or I'll break for a couple of weeks to just paint him.  I really want to push myself to do awesome figurative pieces in oil, I also want to feel closer to him by painting him and remembering little things about his appearance that seem to fade with so much time apart.  It will be a good thing!  Lastnight I tried to play Dr. Doolittle, with no success.  :(  I heard a cat crying outside so I went to look for him and saw him, a sweet black cat, near my fence.  I approached slowly, and he seemed receptive, rubbing up against the bushes and yowling.  I didn't have any luck making contact though.  He wanted to stay out in the cold and snow.  fooey.    I spose I better get back to "work", though it doesn't seem like work to me!  Have a great day!! xoxoxo

      *Sniffles warning; may need kleenex*  I need to write this out, so forgive me in advance for sounding more emotional than usual.  Mark called lastnight.  He waited in line for nearly an hour at a bank of 40 phones among nearly 5000 others, several in line behind him.  Calls were limited to 10 minutes.  I have this horrible habit of thinking I will remember the things that happen when I stop and think "I need to tell him about this".  Then he calls, and my heart sinks, and I can't remember anything I wanted to tell him.  :(  I need to do better writing things down as they happen, I feel like I'm being so vague with him saying "everything here is fine, normal, same-o", and I know that's not what he needs to hear (and at this point, I don't know what he needs from me).  So during our conversation we talked about the sandstorms, how their sunglasses are "sealed" to their faces to keep sand out, and when they shower there's sand in places you never thought existed.  During a "normal" sandstorm, he said he can see 10-15 feet in front of him and that's about it.  So the sniffles were explained away as sinus problems from the wind and sand.  He gave me the address he will have in a couple of weeks so that I can start putting together mail and packages.  If any of you want his address, please e-mail me and I will give it to you.  I asked him what kinds of things he wants or needs, and all he said he really wanted are books.  The guys pass them around and it keeps their minds busy.  I thought about picking up some college course type books for them so they can learn about stuff, too.  Other than that, he said "the usual", including snack packs, brownies and the normal homey type things I sent last time he was there.  Last time, I wrote usually 2 letters a day to him.  I purchased a case of pre-stamped envelopes from the post office and bought a couple of rubber stamp kits and hand numbered all of the envelopes.  This way when he received several at a time, he could put them in order and then read them.  I sent over 300 letters to him during that tour.  Lastnight I wrote my first letter in a long time.  Our conversation ended just past 10pm my time, and I wrote until after 11.  I ended up with 7 pages written by candlelight, and my hand is sore today.  I will have to get back in the groove with using my hand for more than painting and typing.  My heart broke for him when we were saying goodbye on the phone.  I knew something was on his mind, but he didn't share.  Maybe because of the guys standing in line behind him.  But the end of the phone call made me feel so terribly helpless, I can't reach out to him, I can't call him back, and I can't get on a plane to go comfort him.  All I can do is hope that he knows how I feel, and hope he's able to call me again soon so I know he's ok.    I've known him since 1989.  15 years.  Up until a few years ago, he was the love of my life, but not until recently when we remarried (2001) was it clear to me that he's not just the love of my life, he is absolutely my soul mate.  When we're together, we don't even need to talk.  It is never uncomfortable, it is always right.  We have such a peaceful relationship that is so filled with love and devotion, more now than ever before.  I've watched him grow into such a beautiful and strong man, a loving father, a kind, compassionate soul.  When I hear his voice it's like my heart has been jumpstarted.  I miss his physical presence with us, and at the same time I feel him with me every moment of the day.  If you had asked me 15 years ago if I knew what love was, I would have said yes - but my understanding of it then is nothing compared to now.  Now, when I say or think about how much I love my husband, I feel an overwhelming sense of him in my soul, occupying every hidden space in my mind and heart.  It's nearly impossible to explain it's so huge.  Bigger than I ever knew it could be.  I thank God for Mark, for our bond, for the opportunity to experience this feeling that I will hold like the precious gift that it is, for the rest of my life.

      I am taking a break today, if you want to call it that!  I've spent most of the last few days working on Carrie's website, which is up and running (sans a couple of pieces that she just completed!), I am so excited for her, being represented by a couple of really well known folks and shown to some high-end retailers, I can't wait to see her cards take off!  Then I can say "I knew her when...."  ;)     Her site is here:  urlLink The Painting Brush   Please have a look at her work!  Handmade greeting cards are hard to come by, especially of this quality!    Lori Rase Hall also has some fabulous cards, if you haven't seen those, it's a must as well! Here's the link to view hers:   urlLink Lori's Cards   I am proud to say that I own a set of each of their cards, they are amazing.  Artwork in their own right, mine are framed and on the walls!  After some relatively thorough spring cleaning and grocery shopping, I am going to surf and play a bit online before I begin my next commission, which is a sweet white Cockatiel in india ink.  I am also snacking on a bit of Eli's Cheesecake as I browse, covered in big chunky strawberries.  Yum!  I wish I could send some over to Mark, he lurrrves cheesecake.    Speaking of my hubby, where on earth is he now?  I haven't heard from him in a few days.  I am anxiously awaiting an address so that I can bake him up some homemade fudge brownies and put them into a nice fancy care package.  I did this with every package I sent when he was in Desert Storm, fresh brownies vaccuum sealed travel very well and remain tasty through the military postal system!  :D

      Hi all!  I am still feverishly working away on  urlLink Carrie's  site, the main pages are not live yet but should be by some time tomorrow.  For now you can just visit her fancy-shmancy new blog!    Thought I'd post the final scan of my Bernese Pup painting, it's more accurate.  Hopefully I'll be able to update my site soon to include my newer pieces.  In the next few weeks I would like to get a few things accomplished: 1.  Get a new dishwasher! 2.  Complete a couple of commissions. 3.  Finish the Macaw painting 4.  Paint that Squirrel! 5.  Start working in the yard.  Yes, spring has nearly sprung, and I have so much yardwork to do without Mark around (I have allergies, and he usually does all that stuff).  I have to till the backyard and lay the patio blocks we pulled up for the Studio construction, reseed or lay sod - my grass basically consists of creeping charlie.  :(  I also have leaves everywhere (still) and need to plant new lovelies in the front planter we created last spring.  I think I may repaint that too, to match our theme of the year.  Here's the Bernie scan:    I hope you're all having a great weekend!

      I have been cramming for finals, eh Carrie?  ;)  I'm working on some website stuff, which will probably take me through the weekend.   I don't know if I'll have a chance to get back in here and say "hey", so if I don't, "hey, hey, hey!" (say it like Fat Albert.)  That ought to last through the weekend, and if it doesn't please let me know.  ::giggles::  xoxoxoxo

      I'm creating this sweet Bernese Mountain Dog puppy painting for a raffle at the  urlLink 2004 Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America National Specialty  taking place in Mesquite, Texas in just a couple of weeks.  It's 8"x8" on a canvas panel, in OILLLLLLLLSSSSS   :)  Here it is now, I finished it up and it's wet, hence the glare.  It'll be a couple of days before this one is dry enough to ship.    And the first wip shot:

      Here's the Monochromatic Blue Egret piece, I've signed it, it's done, but I won't list it on ebay until tomorrow when it dries.  (and I will be listing with my new fancy schmancy site-matching template, too!)  I hope it feels as peaceful to you as it does to me.  I really enjoyed working this.  Here was my palette:  Cerulean Blue, Cobalt, French Ultramarine (oo-lala, Lolo), White, Dioxazine Violet (just a smidge to deepen the French Ultramarine) and Alizarin Crimson to deepen even further on the beak and foot reflection (and my sig).

      What exactly should normal be, anyway?  Normal.  As in wandering around the house aimlessly while catering to my girls every need, but not having a thought in my head?  Or the other Normal, when I become so focused on my artwork that any surprises or rings of the phone could potentially cause a gigantic startling jolt making me realize that the world I escape to is exactly that.  I think the latter of the two will do.  LOL  Today was better.  It started off slow and dreary, and is ending on a more positive forward-looking note.  I have prepared two pieces to work on over the next few days, each set up on their own easel so I can move between them and work them both.  I've never worked two pieces at once before, so you can call me over-ambitious, but I think my ambition is stemmed purely in the fact that I really want to go deep into my other world for a while and kickstart my creative juices again.  One is the Macaw (the sketch is on auction  urlLink here ) and the other is a monochromatic Egret in blue.    I've also decided that by the time Mark returns, I will look like the brunette version of Faith Hill.  Dangit, she's got it all.  :Þ

      Just spoke with Mark, he's in Kuwait now.  I added a weather stamp doodie to the left, I'm not sure that time is correct though, and there are limited options to the cities which is fine, as long as it's close I guess.  :/  He's not far from the Iraq border, and I may not hear from him for a couple of weeks now as they will be preparing and traveling to their final destination.  I reeeealy need to paint.  I think I will try to start something once the girls go to bed tonight.

      I'm back.  Mark departed early AM for Kuwait, with stops along the way.  He already called from the first stop.  The trip was wonderful, I arrived to find him waiting  at the airport - we went to find our hotel and WEE that was fun!  Have you ever driven a "roundabout"?  Crazy I tell ya.  Can't you just make a left?   No, you have to go down 2 miles and then follow this big circle and come back.  LOL  Once we figured out how a roundabout worked, we were good.  ;)  Got checked in, and went to dinner at a Cajun restaurant next to the hotel.  I tried so many new things, I'm proud of myself!  That evening we started with stuffed mushrooms (yum) which were stuffed with a chopped crawfish breading.  I had Stuffed Snapper (also stuffed with crawfish and topped with a creamy seafood sauce).  Mark had Blackened snapper, and we both had seafood etoufee.  (and wine, and beer!)  He wanted to get his fill of fast food before we left as well.  So there was Taco Bell, McDonald's and Applebee's on that last evening for steaks, Long Island Iced Tea and Raspberry Kiwi Margaritas.  ;)  Things are closed on Monday's down there, so we didn't get to go to the art museums in Alexandria as we'd hoped.  I did get some neat pics that I'll scan later on.  We ended up spending Monday driving to Marksville and stopping at the Paragon Casino & Hotel Resort.  BOOOOO we didn't win anything!  We lost.  :(   It was fun though, we paired up side by side on some nickel video poker machines and lasted a good hour before we depleted the rest of our casino fun money.  When we got back we had enough time (I think it was Monday?!) to hop over to the local zoo, where I got some more very cool reference pics to paint from.    Tuesday we did it!  We got our  urlLink TATTOOS!   That's just the pic of mine.  Mark's is on his left shoulder, and I did get more pics on my regular camera that I have to have developed.  I took progress pics of JD doing mine, I hope they turn out well!  Our Tattoo artist was amazing, and funny that we ended up selecting him, because he's originally from Iowa.    I had picked up the book "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Tracy Chevalier and read it on the way down.  Well the natives were restless, so I also did  urlLink this  in gel pens in my little notebook I brought along.  I've been wanting to paint that piece for a lonnng time, and now that I've worked that little sketch I think I'm feeling brave enough!  On the way back, I had stowed some of my zoo pics in my purse to work from, and we had also stopped at Hobby Lobby and I picked up a smaller purse sized sketchpad and more india ink brush pens.  On the flight from Alexandria to Memphis, I doodled  urlLink this macaw  and then from Memphis to Minneapolis I doodled  urlLink this squirrel.   I met a really nice man in the seat across the aisle who watched as I doodled and it was neat to see his interest in art!  Ok I'm done for now, more later!!    Missed you all! xoxoxxoo

         Guess who got to chat with Daddy on the computer this morning!  How exciting!  Little missy needs a typing tutor.  It was funny to watch her plucking away at the keys.  She did a bang-up job though, even though it took a little longer than I'm used to seeing.  LOL  Yesterday was Biz-eee!  I walked for 3 miles, then dove into some more modifications on  urlLink Carrie's Site , and then worked on  urlLink Liz's Site , ran some errands, enjoyed the HEAT (it was 83 yesteray, high winds but OOOO SO Beautiful!!!), had dinner and then started putting together the pet portrait contest/giveaway page.  That will be up and running late tomorrow night, and the contest begins on Saturday!  I will post a linkie for you all to enter of course, and there will be a graphic or link of some sort on all the pages of my site here.  I worked on all of this, plus more paperwork for the re-mortgage, yadda yadda fun stuff.  I also had the pleasure of "meeting" the new owner of my  urlLink Macaw Painting , she's very sweet and very excited for the end of this auction, Good Luck and mucho thanks to you, "H"!  :D  This morning has been GREAT, woke up to a nice chat with Mark, his dad & stepmom stopped over and what a sweetie pie, his dad brought a tie-out stick thing and put it in the ground by the front door since we will be keeping their sweetie pie Maltese, Muffin this weekend.  I can't wait to snuggle that lil munchkin!  I'll get some pics of her so you can see what a dollbaby she is.  Then his dad walked around picking up the sticks in the yard that broke off from the high winds yesterday.  He has taken on the task of maintaining our yard while Mark is gone, and I am infinitely grateful 'cause it's just so difficult to get out there and mow such a big yard with a toddler meandering about and getting smacked in the face with whatever the mower kicks up.  :/  Ah then the treadmill, my friend, and the fed-ex man, my even better friend, he brought me some fancy clothes that I ordered from Old Navy.  (Thanks, Carrie!)  Sing it with me - "I feel pretty...oh so pretty...."!!!  ;)  And now here I am, and there I go!  I would like to paint NOW, so now I am on a mission to find what is going to inspire me today!  kisses & hugs!

You may want to go grab your sunglasses.  :)  It's a great day, chilly and windy - where am I, Chicago!?  Sheesh!  But it's sunny and bright and beautiful.  I've been walking and painting today.  I also ordered this very cool vacuum sealer thingie so I can send Mark more brownies and not have to use so much tape (and suck the air out of the bags myself) next time. haha!  We did get to chat this morning too, which of course is very cool.  Funny thing happened (don't you love sentences that start like that?)  we were chatting away and about 10 til 8 this morning I hollered for Caitlin to finish getting ready since she leaves at 8'ish for school.  Right then Mark says he'll let me go so I can get Caitlin off to school.  Hm.  I am far too predictable!  LOL    I am loving the new equipment - the scan of this painting went insanely fast for the resolution I used, and the colors were right on, didn't have to modify them at all.  Go Epson!!!  Ok off to play around s'more.  Have a great afternoon! xoxo

      Hi everybody!  It's Monday!  AAK!  ;)  So far so good today.  I prepared several prints for shipping this morning and got those out, walked over 2.5 miles on the treadmill (by the way I'm down 29 lbs. now and have ONE to go to meet my goal for this month!), did the banking, put paperwork together for re-mortgaging (how fun?!), and I am getting ready to paint!  YES! Paint!  I will be working on a small 6x6 Orange Poppy today in india ink.  I need to clean off my easel/table and set up my supplies, and with inks drying so fast, I may be able to finish it yet tonight and list it on eBay.  I realize that I have been working in oils so much, and those are so much more time consuming and costly for my buyers, I am depriving some of my most wonderful clients of great original art for their homes! I'm going to be working on a very cool Horse portrait too some time this week.  :)  My yard is covered in creeping charlie, ug!  My father-in-law gave me a great recipe to get rid of it before my grass is completely choked out.  Mix 10-1/2 oz. of Borax with 2 gallons of warm water, and lightly saturate the area with a watering can.  So that's on my schedule for today too!  I keep putting it off though, since our backyard is so big I will probably need to refill in the house about 40 times to cover it all.  Over 90% of our yard is creeping charlie now.  (Maybe the girls will be nagging ME for coming in and out and in and out and in and out of the house! LOL)  All is well, a lovely start to a week that looks like it might warm up pretty nicely!  Have a great one! xoxo me & charlie

      Erikie, I hope you had a wonderful birthday yesterday!  The new printer arrived yesterday and I spent a good chunk of time setting it up and preparing a few prints to ship out on Monday.  My  urlLink  Print Auctions   end tomorrow so I am waiting for those to finish to get everything printed.  Now the folks who purchase these prints will be getting not just a print, but  Giclee's  since the new printer has pigment based archival and waterproof inks, so this is the last time my prints will be offered at this price. I have to go up a smidge in price to not only cover the cost of the inks, but also because they are the best quality available and will last forever!  :)  I did get to speak to Mark this morning for a little bit.  Things are much more calm there now, which is great news.  Hopefully I will be able to talk to him more regularly soon, there were apparently some problems with his connection which bummed me out all week since I have some very cool photos to share with him.  And now I wait.  sigh.  I walked over 3 miles today!!  This week has been phenomenal as far as exercise goes.  I've walked over 2 miles every day, most days 2.5 or more, and today I really pushed it increasing speed and time.  So the drop for the week has been  5 pounds , and I'm now only 2 lbs. away from my goal for the month of April.  :D  The other cool news is that Erica Richards and I will be collaborating on a custom pet portrait contest/giveaway for the month of May.  I will host the contest here, each of us will be GIVING AWAY a  custom pet portrait (we're still figuring out what size), hers will be an acrylic painting, mine in oils, both on chunky gallery wrap canvas.  I will start preparing the contest entry pages, etc. this week and we'll kick it off on May 1, it'll run through May 31.  Her work is fabulous, you can click the leopard to visit her website.  She's only got a couple of things available on eBay now, and she'll set up an exclusive animal gallery for the entrants to see samples of her work.  But here's a sample of her wildlife artwork anyhoo!  GREAT STUFF!  Leopard (by Erica Richards)  Click the Leopard to visit Erica's Website!   urlLink       I have to add one more thing.  This is amazing, if you have a few minutes to view it please do, and you may want to have a kleenex handy.  urlLink WeSupportU    That's all the news I have at the moment.  Have a great evening! xoxo

        Hey there!  I painted yesterday, layer upon layer on this daisy to make it FUSCHIA.  I love fuschia.  It's my all time favorite color; my senior prom dress was even solid fuschia.  :)  So it's turning out pretty cool I think, I love the stem, I painted the sides lastnight and just continued that dark midnight-cobalty blue around to the sides of it (it's a 12x12 - 1 1/2" thick gallery wrap).  The only thing left to do is add the pollen!  And of course that involves waiting for the layers to dry in the center so the pollen pops when I add it.  I'm going to start this one on auction for a BUCK.  Yep a dollar.  It's spring, and I have mucho faith in my fellow fuschia and flower lovers.  It'll probably be finished up later today and I may be able to get it listed tonight.  How bout that!   I finished up  urlLink Carrie's Site  yesterday.  :D   She's offering her cards as  urlLink singles  now too so that's all up and running and looks super cool (if I do say so myself!).  I also updated the front page to incorporate the two new categories.  Ya gotta have a lookie!  Her cards are so cute!  I took these fab pics the other day for Mark, and he hasn't even been able to get online.  Fooey.  I changed my AOL IM so that when folks log on my puter says  urlLink "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" , and I cranked up the volume lastnight and slept on the couch hoping to sleep light, which I did.  (So yea Erikie, I heard ya! Stumbling back here all sleepy eyed and stuff..LOL)  I am so anxious to talk to him now, 'specially since I have stuff to show him!  C'monnnnnnnn honey, log on!  (you know, like rolling dice...hm, what can I roll....)  I also re-invested my earnings lastnight on that cool new printer I mentioned, it's an Epson Stylus CX5400 and sports a scanner, copier, AND waterproof and 70-year archival inkage!  Woowee!  That will arrive tomorrow and I will be hooked up to generate some wickedly cool and valuable prints like the Lolo and Care have going on.  :)  Walked 2.1 miles total yesterday (down .4 from Monday & Tuesday), but the coolest thing is that I got to walk with TWO of my buddies long distance!  We coordinated Mountain Time with Central and Eastern and did a three-way-call-walk-a-mile-and-a-quarter!  (only one of us is speedy gonzales and walked 2 miles.  lol)  So very cool to walk with friends.  The weight is still melting away too, but I'm not gonna say my progress just yet!  Thanks girls!!  Time for me to scoot, I hope you guys have a fabulously fuschia daisy day!  xoxo

        Got your sunglasses on?  It's going to be a beautiful day!!  Ok so I took this pic a couple of weeks ago.  But it's still cool, eh?  This is what I get to watch out of my dining room window if/when I get up before dawn.  Knocks your eyes right out of their sockets.  Yummy sunshine!  It rained all day yesterday here, and the grass - trees - plants - everybody is happy about it!   I missed green.  Winter is so depressing to me!  But yesterday, even with the rain, it was an outstanding day.  I didn't paint.  I messed around all day with friends online, and stayed up late lastnight working s'more on Carrie's site.  It's ALLLLMOST done!    Part of my sluffing off around the house included taking some new photos for my hubby.  I think that's what put me in a fabulous mood!  I knew that I'm losing weight, and that's cool and all, but you know sometimes you don't see it for yourself until you start comparing pics.  Well that's what I was doing, looking at pics I took a month ago compared to now, and woah!  How motivating!  I'm still down 25.5 lbs., wavering back & forth a pound or two, but still working away at it, and the results are totally visible to me now.  The last two days have been great treadmill days too, I've gone 2.5 miles both Monday and Tuesday.    What an exciting life I lead, huh?  I wish I could show you what I've been working on for Carrie, but it's a surprise.  I'll show ya later.  ;)  The results are in on the new printer.  I've decided to go ahead and get the Epson all-in-one, which sports some super cool waterproof and 70-year archival inks!  I'll probably pick it up within the next week.  Right now I'm refinancing the mortgage which is on a 5-year balloon coming due in June, so that's a "right now gotta do it" thing.  Then next week we'll be car shopping.  Well not so much shopping as trying to talk them down to my price, and getting the color and features I want without ending up with a lemon.  (Wish me luck, I attract lemons with every large purchase! LOL)  So there you go.  (stop your yawning!)  ;)  HAPPY WEDNESDAY!  xoxo

        It's Caitlin's turn to say good morning!  This cute little short outfit brought to you by none other than the Easter bunny.    I had mentioned starting work on Mark's second portrait.  Well here are a couple of shots of what's going on with it.  First, we have the  urlLink full painting , which is an accurate color representation, even tho you can't see him.  The piece is 24x36 on 1-1/2" deep gallery wrapped canvas, and the sides are gradiated to match.  Then there's the  urlLink close up of his face  where you can see his profile outlined.  And this is the photo I'm working from  urlLink here .  You like?  He's a handsome fella. I will work on this one soon.  Gotta finish up that Daisy, which I plan on working on today.  :)  Back later with more!  Have a great day!  xoxo -me!

         Hey!  It's a mini-me!  Just wanted to say good morning, will update more later today!  :D  I'm back!  Today was productive.   YAY!  I'm back on the treadmill, walked 1.5 mi. so far today, and I'll get back on in a little while.  I've been working on  urlLink Carrie's Site  most of the day yesterday and again some today, will have individual card sales up and running pretty soon!    Did some grocery shopping and stopped to pick up dinner for the kidlets, now we're home and I'm just going to hang out for a bit and wonder what on earth I'm going to do with our finances for the next couple of weeks while I wait for the mortgage company to do their thing, and then I've got to shop for a new car too so we can have something more reliable to tool around in this summer.  The coolest part of course is that I got to chat with Mark again this morning for a bit, it is so nice to "see" him online!  I think this is really going to help make the time pass in a much more positive way.  Since he is so motivating for me, I'll be making sure I keep my blog updated every day and "stuff" (more art!) so when he stops by (hi honey!) he can see I'm not sitting around moping like I'm known to do when he's not around.  ;)  I downloaded the COOLEST CD from Walmart.com this morning!  The group is Maroon 5.  If you like upbeat tunes, you have got to check out their music.  Jay and I bopped around the house for a while today listening to it.  I usually hear just  urlLink   one song    (that's the one that's got us boppin') and go looking for the CD to see if I like anything else they've got - and by george the whole CD is awesome!  It's great music for summer drives with the windows down, walking, whatever.  GREAT great great stuff!!  I also got a call from Aunt T. lastnight, she browsed the site for a while with my cousin and saw all of my new stuff.  I love hearing from people who browse through everything!  She reminded me that I'm not done with my own site yet, my figurative/portrait gallery still doesn't have the enlargement windows.  I gotta get that done!  As soon as Carrie's site is up to par, I will get to finishing up that section.  I know everyone wants to see Erika's pop portrait up close! ;)  xoxoxo me!

      Yay!  Mark's new laptop arrived safely along with a couple of other boxes of goodies.  I had been waiting to hear from him on the phone, but when I jumped on the computer this morning there he was!    YAHOO!  We chatted for over an hour.  He's got the great patriotic nude from Erika hanging up in his trailer now along with some prints that Trev sent along with Mark's belated Christmas present.  A nice, colorful and artful place to call "home" for the next year!   The cool CD's arrived, he's experiencing some technical difficulties with them but hopefully it's just a little too much sand in his CD player.  One of the guys wants me to make up a few more CD labels with Alex on it.  Such a pretty birdie!    In other news, I had to go to the doc Friday.  Just when I thought I was getting better, I wasn't.  So now I *think* I really am.  LOL  We shall see!  We did spend the day outdoors yesterday, Mark's dad came over and took care of the lawn God bless him.  They helped me burn down the leaves in our burn pile too - which was huuuuge!  So now the yard is purdyful.    Going to work on Carrie's site today, thankfully I'm feeling more motivated now that the line of communication with my hubby is much more open than it was.  What a relief!!!  He will be stopping by so if you want to say anything to or for him, he will be reading & replying to you some time tomorrow!  Love you!! xoxo

         Hey Lolo, when you read this can you confirm this is a Gerber?  I'm pretty sure it is, but of course I'm more knowledgeable about animals than flowers.    Well, it's not quite fuschia yet, but it will be.  I spent a couple hours yesterday trying to mix it from primaries and got close, but frustrated.  So now by george I think I've got it!  This is a reeeeealy deep pink right now, not as red as it may look to you, and my next stages will be lightening it up and adding the details.  The background color is very cool, it's not black, it's like a midnight cobalt blue.  I'm thinking about painting the sides of the canvas another color, maybe green?  Pale pink?  Not sure yet.  We shall see.  So there!  I've been painting!  Happy Happy!  Oh yes, ok, I can do a weight loss progress update too, since I've been sick and it's assisted my goals for the month.  (iew! but ok.)   Ok just counted on the calendar (man I'm behind!)     75 days, down 25.5 lbs., 4.5 lbs to go for goal for the month of April!    Mark called Tuesday night.  Once again, thank you guys for keeping him and the guys in your thoughts and prayers.  They've successfully made their way through some of the tougher times to be had over there.  He's anxious to get the care packages that are on their way, there are a few coming to him from different directions - thank you guys for that, too!  You're the best!   The weather here has been beautiful, my stomach flu is about gone (I couldn't take it anymore after lastnight and got some quick-stop medicine in my system finally), Lolo thanks for the bag! ;)    So there you have it, on the upswing once again, the pits are the pits are they not?  I can do without them!!  I hope you are all staying virus and bug-free so far this spring.  Ooh yes I will post a WIP of Mark's second portrait that I started soon too.  Now that the daisy is drying for the day/afternoon I may start working on filling him in and might have something identifiable to show you.  My in-laws LOVE it so far... but I think they're biased, you know?  Maybe?   A little?  Eh that's ok, doesn't make 'em wrong, hehe!  ::wink-wink::  Feels good to be sorta almost normal.  Phew.  Have a wonderful and beautiful day!  I'll be back! xoxoxo

      I've been sick.  :(  Spent most of the last two days curled up in a ball on the couch, Cait took care of me and Jay yesterday the little sweetie.  She was back to school today though, nice spring break, taking care of sick mom.  Haven't heard from Mark on the phone, but we have gotten a couple of letters from him dated the end of March.  He said he's going to send a camel home for Caitlin.  eek!    I got two pieces sketched on Sunday before I went out of commission, hopefully I'll be feeling "normal" tomorrow and can get back to the easel.  I don't get sick like this often, I think it's been a few years actually.  Anyone else get this yuky stomach flu?!  It's MEAN!  I hope you're all doing well and had a nice easter.  I'm headed back to the couch and Mark's blankie.    xoxoxo

        Good evening everyone.  :)  Believe it or not, this is a purple tulip growing in MY front yard!  I did a little magic in PSP with it and thought it turned out very easter-y so here you go.  A purple tulip to wish you all a blessed Easter with your families and loved ones.  Did you know purple is my favorite color?  And tulips are my favorite flower.    My husband sent me over 50 tulips for my birthday last year.  They were fresh cut, and I had to split them into 5 different vases and had them all over the house.  What a man.  Tomorrow we will celebrate with the standard morning egg hunt, the girls will follow purple bunny prints around the house to their baskets and treats.  I tried to incorporate as much of Mark as I could.  We will have dinner with his family Sunday night at Mark's favorite restaurant.  I am working on three paintings this week.  First, another portrait of my hubby in oils.  Second, a very bold and beautiful fuschia gerber daisy.  Third, I believe I will paint this lovely purple tulip, maybe take another  close-up shot of my beautiful tulips in the front yard while they're open.  I am also very excited to announce that my peonies are growing!  I have been trying to grow them for years.  FINALLY.  ::taking a bow::  I look forward to dark pink, white and light pink peonies covered in ants and smelling up my yard in the most beautiful bumble-bee kind of way.  :)  Have a wonderful, wonderful Easter everyone.    xoxoxo

      Boy I tell you what though, if the next 348 days 7 hours 45 minutes and 14 seconds are anything like the last few days, I'm not sure exactly what I'll get accomplished if anything.  Thank you all again for your prayers and continued thoughts and support for Mark and his guys.  I can't tell you how much they are truly appreciated.  Please keep them coming.  Been spending a lot of time thinking about things, being a little sullen, and still recovering from this cold which is kicking my butt.    I hope to get caught up with everyone tomorrow.    Love you guys. xoxoxo

      Mark called this morning.  Thank God.  And thank you for all of your prayers, they are indeed working.  There was an incident on Saturday that I won't go into here, I will say that he thanked us for praying that Hedge of Protection around him and that at that moment he said he felt it, and that it's some pretty strong stuff.  He asked that we keep praying for him, for his guys, to keep them safe so that if another similar situation occurs they are again able to walk away unharmed.  Every letter that Caitlin writes to him she tells him that she prays for a Head of Pertishin around him every night.  Last Tuesday when we talked he said he wasn't sure what that was, and it took him a half hour to sound it out and know what she meant.  Well, be it a Head of Pertishin or a Hedge of Protection, we're pretty certain our guy's head and hedge alike are glowing in the desert over there.  (This is the story I tell Caitlin to make her feel better about him not getting hurt.)  He's going to try to call again tonight or tomorrow.  The line was a thousand men long.  Wives and families across the country jumping to answer the phone today just like I did.  Took my lemon into the shop this morning to get a leak checked, and I decided to nurse it along for a while.  We also went to the post office and got his first 2 packages off in the mail to him (if you can add a little ditty to God about they're safe and speedy arrival too, that would be great!).  One of the packages has a beautiful  urlLink  patriotic oil painting   by  urlLink  Erika   included in it.  I can't wait for him to get that hung in his trailer.  I know it'll be the talk of the camp!  :)  That's all for now.  I haven't worked on anything except a few small wooden bird houses with Caitlin.  We went down to Dick Blick and picked up some things (including a few new tubes of oils) when I spotted the little bird house kits.  We have some beautiful Purple Finches' around who I'm hoping take to one of these little homes.  I will post pics when we get them painted.  Gotta work on a few things tonight, banner, return e-mail, etc.  I am behind, and still feeling stuffy and headachey from this cold!    Thanks again everyone for your prayers!! xoxoxo

      I just went on a ebay listing spree!   urlLink  Alex   ended, so I relisted him, and then I also put  urlLink  Beethoven   AND  urlLink  Andy's Dream   out there!  You might remember that one, I painted him last fall for the AKC/Eukanuba commemorative poster competition.  Oooh the  urlLink winning piece  for that contest is beautiful!  But I am pretty certain I made it in the finals with Andy, even though he didn't win.  ;)  I've been low on "juice" today, and this springtime sinus/cold junk is making my head cloudy so I haven't done much today.  A little treadmilling, a little lounging, a little bill paying, and then a listing spree.  And there you have it!  My whole day wrapped up into one sentence.  LOL  I hope your weekend was a great one!  On to Monday, and some warmer weather!  (Pleaaassseeeee!)  xoxoxo!

        All over.  From missing my hubby, to feeling like someone beat me with a big stick!  Spent most of the day yesterday outdoors on a sunny yet chilly spring day.  When the studio construction was completed, they were supposed to clean up the yard and put the patio back as a "courtesy", but since it wasn't "in the contract" that courtesy was not extended in any form other than a verbal "let's close the deal" pitch.  Ah well, more work for me, lesson learned.  My father in law, bless his poor achey back, brought his rototiller and helped break up the ground and concrete blobs left behind.  We got about half of the patio done before we were both too sore to continue.  Today, ow.  Walked half a mile on the treadmill, if that.  I walked and moved with extreme caution today!  I also miss my man.  I've not heard from him since Tuesday, and with all the goings-on, I really would like to hear his voice.  I know it's ok that he hasn't called, no calls are better than calls from the "other" kind of military people, so I reassure myself saying it'll either be him, or nothing.  And that's ok, but still I miss him. Today was a rough day being so sore, the first day of spring break, girls at eachother from 7 a.m. until dusk.  FUN!  The picture there is a very intricately beaded piece done by a client of mine.  Isn't it beautiful?  She had been working on it for quite some time and when I painted for her and got to know her she decided that this was meant for us.  I am such a gush, I wept when I opened it.  It is truly beautiful.  I meant to post it when I got it but kept forgetting to get a picture of it.  I finally did, because I wrote to Mark about it and included this pic in his letter so he could see it.  Anyhoo I wanted to share it because I have been thinking a lot lately about my clients who have become such wonderful friends that are so dear to me, and it means a lot to me that this sweet special bond is all created by a love for art and beautiful animals.  :)  Have a good night & great Sunday, don't forget to change your clocks!  (Spring ahead!)  xoxoxo

I'll get a flatbed scan of him when he dries.  ::giggles::  He'll be going up on the auction block in a bit!  :)    WEIGHT LOSS PROGRESS:  Down 21.5 lbs. in 61 Days!    Over 2.5 miles on the treadmill yesterday, over a mile so far today.  YAY!  Gotta get some other things done today, I'll try to get back later!    xoxoxxo

         Welcome to my mudpile.  LOL!  I spent all day yesterday cleaning gutters, and getting this huge pile of dirt broken down enough to move easily into a landscaped type mound that will follow the corner fenceline and be covered in hostas and nice partial shade plantings.  Of course we got the torrential downpour as scheduled this morning, and now I won't be able to get back to it until it dries out a bit.  So far so good though, I think it will look nice when it's finished!  Not that you can tell much from this photo, but the dirt was taller than I am, about 6 foot tall I'd say, and now I've got it down to about 4 feet.  Ok on to business!!!  For those of you who are interested in a print of Squirrely III, he's been added to my print gallery, and my print gallery has changed a bit!  It is super cool, so even if you don't plan to purchase anything right now, have a look anyway!  I spent quite a few hours figuring out the coding for this, in preparation for an overhaul on another one of my client's sites, so I tested it out on my site first!  :D   urlLink Click here to go directly to the new prints page!   I plan on beginning the backgrounds for my two cat portraits (in oils) later today.  Also, the pet portrait giveaway contest ends tomorrow!  Have you entered?  Ya gotta play if you wanna win!  ;)  Have a wonderful Sunday and Happy Memorial Day everyone!!!  xoxoxoxo

         Happy Graduation Day, Caitlin!  Yes, my little weed is growing so fast.  She'll be in 3rd grade this fall!  She received a "Positive Attitude Award" this morning, and her final report card was super, putting her 2 levels ahead of her grade in reading, and at a 5-6 grade writing level.  :D  I had to run to the doc this morning for some wierd thing I was just curious about that he ended up wanting to see me about.  So it turns out I've got an infection brewing, and my goofy thing that I was curious about is the beginning stage where your immune system is trying to fight it off.  He said if I hadn't gone in, by Monday I'd have been feeling pretty crappy.  So I guess it was a good thing that I got in there!  Now I have to go get antibiotics though.  Foo.  :P~  It's kinda nice out, the prelude to a rainy blechy weekend, I hate it when the weather teases me like this.  LOL  Now I am going to try to get outside this afternoon and start working on the landscaping, and then paint this weekend while it rains.  Happy Friday everyone!!! xoxoxo

         He's done!  Boy do I love these little critters.  In fact I just put out a bunch of popcorn for them out back!  Yesterday went by so fast, I was a little bummed I didn't get him finished.  But now he's done.  YAY!  We're leaving in a few minutes for an eye exam appointment for me, I'm going to get contacts!  :D  Not much else going on today, just catching up on housework.  I just want to know how 3 people can produce 4-5 bags of trash a week?  At least I know I'm not a packrat.  LOL  I'll be testing prints of this one later today or tomorrow, depending on how long the appointment goes.  I have some webdesign projects that need attention tonight, so we'll see!  Hey, now that I'm thinking about it, those of you who voted for "other animal", I'd love for you to reply here (even if it's anonymous!) and let me know what animal!  I know one of the 4 is a skunk...  anyone else wanna let me know?   Happy Wednesday, everyone!! xoxoxo

      How exciting!!!  I got a video file, please excuse the jiggedy-jaggedy cam holding job, I was so excited!!  I ran in and got my tripod after I got this footage, and trying to edit it enough so that he's visible on the monitor is giving me a headache!  LOL!    Boy, what a beauuuuuutiful bird, and so BIG!  I thought it was an eagle flying thru the backyard with that wingspan, then he landed and woaaaahh!  How cool is this!    Clicky to see my backyard barn owl!  It will probably play in your browser media player, best viewed at 100% and may take a few minutes to cache on a dial-up as it's a large file.  If you do enlarge the view, the quality is really poor and the poor guy becomes a blob on a telephone wire.  :/   urlLink  Barn Owl Footage here!

      You know, it really does a heart good to know that my clients can see a work in progress and already feel confident that the finished piece will be worth investing in.  {{{{{Hugs for you, P}}}}}  So Squirrely the Third is not quite finished yet (will be later today), and already has a new home.  ::sniffles::  Thank you!!  That other thunderstorm hit lastnight, and by this morning the concrete was dry, but the darn yard is mush again.  My family is supposed to be coming down this weekend, but now we're watching the forecast to see if we'll even be able to be outside for a few days in a row.  Having 4 kids trapped in a house with 4 maybe 5 adults while it's raining just doesn't sound like a lot of fun!  Even though 2 each of the kids are the same ages and they play well together, they also FIGHT well together!  LOL  So here's hoping for a change in the forecast for Memorial Day Weekend!!!  The past week or so has been amazing with being able to chat with Mark on webcam!  Sunday we spent a good 7 hours chatting, I broke to treadmill and Caitlin chatted with him, then Jay climbed up on my lap and chatted (pressed the buttons!), it was sweet, spending Sunday's together is something that Mark and I feel is really important and special.  :)  So today I finish up on the Squirrely, treadmill, have to get some bloodwork done, finish packing up another care package for Mark and getting it off in the mail, and hopefully starting the next painting.  :D  I hope you have great weather in your forecast!!! xoxoxo

         Squirrely the Third!  This is just a work in progress now, he will very realistically be begging for corn by the end of the day today!  (So if you want to snag him up before he's finished or list him on ebay, drop me an e-mail! He's 8x10 in ink!)  We've had such funky weather here the last few days, another thunderstorm is supposed to hit tonight.  All I want is SUMMER! LOL  And I want the mud in the yard to dry out so I can get this landscaping done, too! :P  I'm going to try to finish up this fella tonight, and tomorrow get that Stargazer going, and then I've gotta work on some commissions.  I'll check in with my client and if it's ok with her I'll post those WIP shots too.  Feels GOOD TO PAINT!!!!!!  xoxoxo

         Good evening!  Well, actually, it's morning in Iraq, so Good morning (honey!) I hope you all had a good day/night.  ;)  The pic is another one courtesy of Mark's unit.  Nice view, huh?  It's got to be strange for him to look at this view and think that sun is just starting to rise over here.  Today was so humid!  Pithooey!  My feet were sticking to the linoleum so of course I'm mopping, and Jay is slipping and falling on the wet floor, and then there's crying, and popcorn, and nappy time (yep, I joined her!), then there's dinner, playtime, bandaging up owie's for the day, and bedtime.  They were so good tonight it made my life peaceful for a moment.    Got some things done here, I changed out the rotating image on the front page, added 3 new oils to the oil gallery, two new inks to the india ink gallery, and trimmed the figurative & other art page - it just looked pretty cluttered up to me.  So now I'm good for the time being!  I'm putting my florals in with the wildlife now and grouping them more by medium, but they do grow wild, and they are plant life, so it's all good anyway!  ;)  Tomorrow will be busy, I need to get a USB extension cable, mail out some things, and get ready to go to the bank for the closing on the house refinance.  I'm so nervous about that!   Oh hey, did I tell you I'm down 35 lbs now?  I had a comforter bag full of clothes from ..umm.... 4 years ago?  And for giggles I got a pair of shorts out of there and tada!  They fit!  I only have a few more to go to reach my goal.  :D  ::yawn:: nitey-nite friends! xoxoxo

      These photos are phenomenal.  Mark sent them over this morning, after a day of humanitarian duty playing soccer and handing out the last of his goodies to the kids there.  Aren't they precious?!  They are so happy to have us, it is so nice to see something POSITIVE about our being there.  These will definitely lift your spirits!!  This first one, just a few of 50-60 Iraqi children Mark interacted with today.  I could just sqwish that little girl!!  He said she was adorable, has the biggest puppy dog eyes and is expert at asking for more goodies.  :)     Here's Mark (3rd one over from the left) with some children (family?) - you can see they really are enjoying the supplies we provide, and they all spent a good portion of the afternoon playing soccer.  The kids won!  I asked if I could send a bunch of flip-flops or something for him to hand out, but he said that they are used to barefooting it unless they go to school.  Asphalt - 160 degrees, bare feet!  Definitely something we all would have to be born and raised in to be accustomed to.    This is the best.  Mark with two of the kids, that little one looks to be about 6, yea?  Being goofy for the camera!  LOL  And the older one, looks about 12'ish, wearing Mark's helmet.  That is such a great keepsake for Mark, I know that he's wanted to rescue these poor folks since the first time he was there.  Very very cool pictures, so nice to see them STILL happy to hang out with our guys!       I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!!!! xoxoxo

       urlLink     This has to be the coolest composition I think I've ever caught on film.  You can click on it to see a larger view.  :)  So far today I've been productive, getting prints made of paintings and photos from our trip to see my mom for Mark and my girlfriend and her mom.  I've ordered some supplies for my commissions, treadmilled, and gotten some other correspondence taken care of.    Yesterday Mark and I hooked up via webcam, and it was the coolest thing!  To be able to see him and him see me while we chatted was the best.  Hopefully we'll be able to get audio going along with it.  We'll see how that works!  He was disconnected of course, so who knows what's going on with their connection over there. :(    I started an ab workout routine yesterday, too.  It's an 8 minute workout, and BOY does it work.  I can't wait to do it again today!  Caitlin and I are doing it together, which is fun!  It's neat that she's getting motivated by my working out and getting fit.    Left on the list of things to do today:  take my turns on Scrabble, basecoat in oils for the stargazer (have a new idea for that background so I'm going to go with it), get the other one that I sketched yesterday going later today (in inks), and go pick up my prescription.  It's gorgeous here, I hope it's gorgeous there, too!! Have a great day! xoxoxo

      I've got so much to do around the house here, I've been bad about updating!  I've been spending a lot of time out in the yard and still have much to do, and I'll be starting up a couple of commissions here shortly too.  I sketched out a new small piece to paint in inks, and am going to try to get that done tomorrow.  (We'll see about that!)  It's been rainy today, gloomy, chilly, but ANYTHING is better than snow!!  Today was indoor cleaning & laundry day!  FUN!  I hope you're having a great week!!!  (I know, short, but sweet eh?  It's just one of those days...) xoxoxo

           This is the back of my studio, which if you didn't already know was just added on to our house right before winter.  I couldn't get the patio done until spring, and my father in-law helped with some a couple of months ago (see where there's grass growing around one of them?  That was where we stopped). Today I (single-handedly) finished leveling and laying the rest of the blocks!  Whew.  I'm tired.  (ok, some of them aren't perfect, but I didn't do it by the book!)  ;P~  That was my day!  How was yours??? xoxox

      Yep, I am afraid of heights.  It all started when I was a kid, a tomboy of course, and I was climbing a giant pine in the front yard.  I was going for a birds nest, I wanted to keep the babies as pets.  I climbed halfway up the tree, had the nest in my hands, and proceeded to fall all the way down to the ground sortof like a pinball, hitting branches left and right on my way.  I was fine, the birds were fine, and they made great pets in the closet of my room until I let them go because they got so stinky! LOL  Yes, I know I was only 10 or something at the time, but I remember that day.  So, being afraid of heights, I was on a mission yesterday to clean the gutters on the studio and carport.  I set up the ladder, climbed up to the TOP STEP, knees quivering like crazy, and cleaned the gutters.  YAY ME!  I did it!!    The past few days have been very busy, there is so much to do around the house that Mark always took care of, now it's my turn.  Today we need to get to the store and pick up some river rock or something to do a little landscaping.  I have a hose box/reel thing that is sinking into the mud, so we're going to fill those areas with rock and maybe plant a couple of tall colourful flowering plants in those areas.  Even better, when I finished lastnight I felt like I had been beaten with a big stick!!!  I could hardly move, between climbing up & down the ladder, repairing the gutter on the carport, knees quivering the whole time, my legs had it.  I thought for sure when I got up this morning that I would be hobbling for a couple of days!  I was very happy when I felt GREAT!  All of this working out has done wonders for my resistance.  So, now I head off to my trusty treadmill to start the day even more energized!  I hope you are all having a great weekend! xoxoxo  P.S.  On the poll, one of the "other animals" suggested is a Skunk!!  I will paint a skunk just for you, P!  ;)  HAVE YOU VOTED?!  It's right over there! ---->

           So here's my hubby, kneeling over there by the medics bag handing his first aid supplies to him as he treated a slightly injured Iraqi after a little accident today out on patrol.  Everyone is ok!  Kinda cool to see him out workin' and stuff.  I just had to share!   urlLink Here's the AP report!    Hey!  Did you vote yet?!  And what are the other animal suggestions from those who voted?  I have a few in mind but would love to hear your suggestions!

        This is one of the beautiful irises I have growing in my front yard.  They just decided to bloom yesterday so I spent a good half hour out there setting up the tripod and getting shots of them.  I will probably be painting this one within the next week.    It was a beautiful morning, topped off with yet another fabulous chat with my hubby.  He's got an awful heat rash (prickly heat?) on his back - anyone have any ideas on how to relieve it with limited supplies?  I suggested baby powder with corn starch, but I don't think they had any over there.  My poor guy, it's like 110 over there every day, which just makes it worse having to wear the uniform and gear.   I did get to mail out my fuschia daisy painting to its new owner yesterday, sent a couple more care packages off too, and just kept busy doing this & that all day.  I feel like I'm still not caught up, or that there's more to do and I just don't know what it is?!  It's raining this afternoon so that shoots my plans to do yardwork.  My father in law was here this morning while it was still nice, and he cut the grass for us.  Now every time I go outside there's more and more I need to get taken care of!  I burned a new CD too, if you haven't been to walmart.com music downloads - it's very cool!  You pay online, pick whatever songs you want or full albums, and download them right to your puter!  So I mixed this great selection and it just rocks.  Music really is a huge motivator for me, especially when I'm painting & treadmilling.  Oh yea!  The weight loss progress!  Ok I've lost track of the days.  I started this whole thing on Jan. 31st.  As of today, I've lost 34 lbs., and I'm down 2 sizes!!  I just ordered a few new trendy things from Old Navy (dot com) in the next size down, so by the time they arrive I should be good to go!  WEE!  I crave my morning workouts now, don't feel right without them.  This is really moving along so much faster than I had anticipated, and I am so excited about it!    I think that's all the news I have for now!  I wanted to put up a poll too, so I may add that here in a bit.  :D  Update:  just added the poll over there to the right, under the giveaway linkie/icon!  Have a vote!    I hope you are all doing awesome!! Love you!! xoxox

      Ok well my sneaky "have other things to do post" was so out of the norm that I guess I nearly gave myself away!  I took the girls up to Chicago for a surprise Mother's Day weekend visit to see my mom.  My bestest buddy was also in town to surprise her mom, so we got to meet up a couple of times which was so very cool!  I haven't seen her in almost 7 years!    We left Friday morning in the midst of a horrible thunderstorm, but we drove out of it about 40 miles outside of town.  The rest of the trip was smooth sailing, the girls were fabulous, we stayed at my Aunt's house, we visited, hung out with my Mom (yea, she was surprised, but she says she knew something was going on because of my last entry!), and even got lucky enough to be there when my Aunt & Uncle arrived from Colorado!  Yahoo!  It was a beautiful weekend.  I dropped off my film (6 rolls!) today so I should have it back by the end of the week.    My tulip painting is no longer available, either.  I pulled it from auction and now it is with my Aunt.  I'm so sneaky!  ;D  Mark and I chatted for several hours today!  ::biggest grins::  That was very very cool because I missed him terribly while we were gone.  I'm spoiled, talking to him just about every day now.  He's spoiled too, since he asked me not to go out of town too often anymore.  :P~~    So here I am, and I need to get caught up on a ton of stuff, and then I need to do yardwork (the youngins' have summoned the pool...rut-row..) and then, paint!!!  I hope you are all doing well and had a great weekend, too! xoxoxo

      I've canceled the tulip listing on eBay.  It is still available (so far), but I have been a little frustrated with their new layout and how un-art-browser friendly it is so I am going to have to find an alternative method to offer my artwork to the masses.    I am also letting everyone know that I am taking a little break.   I've got some things going on that need my full attention, so I'll be on a mini "blog vacation".  ;)  Take care all, see ya soon! xoxoxo

      Tu-lips are better than none, I say.  (I know there are other sayings, you can add your own!)  Just completed & listed on eBay.... click the pic to see the detail & wall shots!!   urlLink     It really looks SO much better in person, really.  Truly.  I promise.  :D  I think scanners just freak out at the brightness and contrast of my ink paintings.  Anyone have one of my ink pieces to confirm?  I would love to hear your thoughts on this!  Hope you are all having a good week so far!  I will be back later to chit-chat! xoxo

        Meet Muffin, my in-laws baby girl.  We've been watching her this weekend.  Isn't she a sweetie pie?  :)  Oh yes!  I have to show you a couple of crazy pics I took of Jayden the other day.  Caitlin had a "Lights On" program at school, evening activites and the like, and Jayden was being a little pistol.  Here she is running:  urlLink Jay Runnin' , and here's another freaky deaky pic of my little chickiemonkey,  urlLink Jay Runnin' Freaky!   We've been doing some spring cleaning this weekend.  Friday night we went through all of the girls clothes and loaded up a ton of stuff that either doesn't fit or Caitlin doesn't like anymore, and this morning I went through my stuff!  Of course there's a ton of stuff that I have to get rid of anyway, cause it just doesn't fit anymore! :D  Now I'm debating whether I should list it on ebay, or garage sale it, or give it to Salvation Army.  Hm.  I could use the cash to get things that FIT, but maaannnn listing everything is a lotta work!    Need to get a few more things done before we can play today.  We'll be making a few batches of brownies, packing up a bunch of boxes to ship out tomorrow to Mark, and then I'm hoping to get some painting in today.    Off I go!  Have a great day! xoxo

      Phew!  This day has flown by.  Did I accomplish anything?  Umm...      I MET MY APRIL GOAL!     Yeppers, I sure did.  I actually hit the mark yesterday, but I wanted to call today the offical day since it is the 1st of May.  Now I'm down 30.5 lbs., and have 9.5 more to go for the month of May.  Think I can do it?  (I think I can, I think I can!)  I've upped the treadmilling to 3 miles a day most days, and have been jogging here and there to start getting used to it.  The last couplea days though, well, I haven't hit the mileage I wanted to, but I'm close.  So there's my exciting news for the day.  :)    We're dog-sitting for my in-laws, she's all sprawled out sleeping right next to me here otherwise I'd get a pic.  She looks silly right now, almost like one of those little talking-walking puppy toys we got the girls for Christmas.  The girls are attached, of course, and I just know Jay is going to be bawling when it's time for her to leave tomorrow.  My hubby sent me a Mother's Day card!  What a man, thinking of me and card shopping in the middle of chaos.  Dang I'm a lucky lucky girl!    Okee doke folks, that's my news for the day, I hope you all are having a great weekend and haven't forgotten to enter our pet portrait giveaway!    xoxo

      Okee doke folks, I have completed painting him and the night-time flash photos just aren't what I want them to be!  I will take pics of him in the morning after he's clearcoated.    So, there you go.  Is the suspense killin' ya?  He looks gorgeous, I am so proud of how he turned out!  He needs to fully dry (overnight), and I will clean him and clearcoat him first thing in the morning.  Then I will get those final pics!!  I'll be back!

      Ribbit, rib ribbity ribbit, rib rib ribbity rib, kwim?  :D  Ok guess what I did today.  I'm only going to give you one guess.  DING!  Yes, you're right.   urlLink The Frog!   Started out the day with some swamp additions, then sketched out a few creatures, got to painting...did some administrative type things, back to painting, then in for the evening to get the girls all bathed and ready to go to Grandma & Grandpa's for the weekend!   I will be painting ALL day tomorrow to finish this fella.  I have a few more things to do, each side of him will have his own swampy animal, and the swamp will also have some lily pads, lotus flowers, highlights and things to make it really very fun.  He is scheduled to ship on Monday, leaving here in the afternoon!  Honey's portrait arrived at her home today, yahoo Honey!  And thanks to mom for letting me paint her, she is a SWEETIE PIE!  After Swampy takes off I'll be getting Rocky, Simba and Dom ready to go home, too.  (Pouty face, I like their company...sniff...sniff...)  I also added links to Toronto on my home page, and on the wildlife artwork pages.  It was a quickie logo insert, but my client wanted to make sure that anyone he sends here could find the progress page easily.  Also, he'll be sending me photos of Toronto once he's in place at the waterpark!  I am so excited I can hardly stand it, the way he described it makes me want to change our vacation route to swing on up across the border!  It is going to be so cool!  If any of you are in or near Aurora, Ontario, stop and visit him for me until I can get there, k?  :D  Ok go look at the frog!  xoxoxo

       I received this beautiful bouquet of flowers & balloon's from my absolutely amazing hubby in Iraq.  Now how sweet is this, to get flowers from a man in a war zone 6000 miles away.  He is the best hubby EVER!!!   (Today is the 3rd Anniversary of our second marriage after a 2 year break and 7 year marriage prior to that with 2 years of dating..haha, figure that one out!)  Been painting on  urlLink  Toronto Swampy   today, I have his eyes done and I have about 10 minutes worth of daylight left - I may set up a lamp or something in a few minutes so I can get the grasses done.  Either that or I'll get up at the crack of dawn in the morning to continue painting on him.  Hm.  Dawn is sounding like a better plan.  I have more fabulous photos to share. (they're big!)  If any artists are reading this and want to paint them please do, and let me see it when you're done wouldjya?  Two of them are very dramatic photos of the Sweetheart Roses in my Anniversary Bouquet.  (Know what I got him?  A fancy schmancy print that I formatted of a section of our vows that were/are absolutely perfect for our second marriage to eachother..what else do you get a guy who only has wall space and tacks?)   On to the photos:  urlLink Dramatic Anniversary 1   urlLink Dramatic Anniversary 2   urlLink First Prize Rose Closeup   'Til tomorrow! xoxoxo

      Yep, the frog has arrived!  I started working on him at around 11:00 AM and finished around 7 after a run for more paint.  Over to your right, underneath that handsome fella I like to refer to as "my hubby", you'll see a blank frog.  If you click that link, you will go to my "Toronto Swampy" Frog Log where you can see what I've accomplished today!    EDIT:  I'll also put the Frog Log Link  urlLink   RIGHT HERE    in case that last fixer-upper of the frog pic/link didn't work again!  :D  I can't remember what else I was going to tell you.  LOL!  The new camera is SWEEEET!!  I will put some STUNNING-knock-your-eyeballs-out-of-their-sockets pics up as soon as I can!!  xoxoxo!

      Just completed Simba, Rocky's roomie and pal.    The frog arrived, got him unpacked and set up to start, I need to go hang sheeting around him under the carport so he's protected from the elements while I begin to spray the first coat of enamel (it's an adhesion promoter).  By the way, Mom helped me clean out the garage yesterday so I could park Mark's truck in there.  I think this is the first time we've ever parked a vehicle in the garage!  LOL!  Yahoo!  Thanks Mom!!! xoxo!  My new digital camera arrived too, have the battery on the charger already so as soon as that's charged I'll take pics of the blank froggie and get a page up for him so you can see his progress!  Here's Simba... also 10x10 in oils...

I sent Rocky off to Mama too so she can have a looksee (and just in case you're wondering, all of the P's said it's cool for you all to see their babies portraits!)  Also wanted to say a quick THANK YOU! to all my "new" friends and commenters!  You guys are all so sweet!  I am going to save replying & e-mail stuff for morning, it seems to be the best time for me to dig in on that before treadmilling.  ;)  So ok, here we go.  He's a 10x10 Oil Painting (caution: wet paint!)     I hope you had a wonderful weekend and enjoyed your pit-stops here to see some pretty eye-candies!  xoxoxo

      Before painting commences, I wanted to share these lovelies with you:   urlLink Double Delight Blooms   urlLink New Orange Gerber Daisy   urlLink Mama & Youngin' having breakfast   urlLink Jay with her hair down    Ah yes, the last one is not a flower.  ;)  My new digital camera is scheduled to arrive on Monday, so I'll be getting MUCH better macro shots of my flowers in just a couple of days!  Yahoo!!  Going to work on Dom now.. my Mom is enroute - believe it or not!!! She'll be here helping me out for the weekend.  I just love it when family offers a hand when you're buried up to your eyeballs.  There was a huge sigh of relief on my part, since there is SO much to do to finish up these paintings and prepare for a weeklong adventure in Enamel Froggieland.  No easy task when you have two little ones hanging around and a household to maintain.  Don't get me wrong, they are SUPER and SO understanding about my painting schedule, but the Frog will be under the carport, so they will be outside with me all week.  Next weekend the girls will be going to stay with Gramma & Grampa W. so I can put all the final touches on Toronto and get him ready to go.  Off to paint!  Have a great weekend all, don't forget to stop back & see my finished paintings! xoxoxo

      I'm such an overachiever.  ;)  I thought I could finish 4 paintings today?! What was I thinkin'?  I spent all day on this sweetiepie.  I'll be painting all weekend, and then Toronto Frog arrives Monday and I have to have him finished by next Saturday.  So, what I don't get finished this weekend has to wait until after the 28th.  There's still a possibility of some modifications on her, I will know after the weekend.  Here she is!

      Has anyone seen today?  I missed it. :(  The morning flew by with my morning 2 mile walk, some urgent Toronto Frog business, talking to Mark, getting disconnected, reconnecting, getting disconnected (getting the picture?), then ordering Toronto Frog supplies, running errands, home, lunch, more Toronto Frog business, cleaning out the pool, letting the girls enjoy it for almost 2 hours, dinner, PAINTING, bedtime, more of the Mark DNR (I'm hoping you've figured out my acronym so I don't have to retype all of that), and now here I am.  Phew!  I tried to reply to all my email today but I don't think I'm going to finish.  So for everyone waiting on me, I will reply soon!  Tomorrow I will be painting ALL DAY LONG.  Until the last brushstroke on all of these loverlies has been applied.    For now, here are Honey's sweet eyes.  :)

      I painted late lastnight and finished blocking in the colors for Rocky & Simba.  There's still a lot of refinement to do, the paint has to dry for a day or two before I can start the next layer.  :)     Now today I'll start working on Honey (sweet lil Yorkie), and if time permits I will work a little more on Dom's portrait.  Have a great Wednesday everyone!!! xoxo!

         This is Honey, she's a Yorkie.  In case you're wondering why the background isn't already painted, it's because she'll be painted in india inks and those are applied in layers all in the same session.  So I'll actually be erasing as much of this sketch as possible, leaving just a very faint line to work from.  I did also paint on Rocky & Simba's portraits today, but I want to get a little further along before I post another progress pic.  I will probably do that later tonight or tomorrow!    UPDATE:  this is my favorite part, seeing the eyes come alive on the painting!  They're not done yet, but I just love this part so I had to share. :D       Back to the easel I go! xoxoxo

            Progress on Dom: He's sketched onto the canvas now and I'll start painting him either this afternoon or tomorrow morning!  Isn't he a stud???  (Yes this is the pet portrait contest winner!)   UPDATE ON DOM 5:42PM CST:  Dom has been blocked in with base colors now, he'll dry for a day or two and then I can move on to the next layer.  :)   Cat portrait progress: still sketched, I think I'm going to go ahead and work on them in a little bit.    Toronto frog progress:  sent the downpayment for the frog fabrication today, they will probably start fabricating on Wednesday or Thursday of this week and it should arrive end of next week!  :D  I spent the morning cleaning up and doing some paperwork, sent Squirrely III off to his new home, ordered contacts, all kinds of fun stuff!  The girls have been playing and making tissue paper flowers all afternoon, I'll have to put them in a vase and get pics for you guys!  Happy Monday everyone! xoxo

      I've also started my pet portrait contest winner's portrait today!  This is a gorgeous setting for a purebred Smooth Fox Terrier.  He's mostly white, but has some beautiful rich browns on his head and a couple of other areas.  I used a transparent gold ochre for the background, layering some areas a bit heavier than others for this rich finish.  I was actually going for something else when this started yelling "Yea! Perfect!" as I was painting.  Yes, Winsor & Newton Pro Oil's do speak if you listen closely.  ;)     Had enough of me today yet?  I'll give you a few hours to catch up while we run errands.  hehe!

      Here are the two cat portraits I'm working on now.  I hope to have these finished by Monday!  The kitty on the left is Rocky, and Simba is on the right.  I've got them sketched out with an angled ground which will probably be woodgrain.     In other news, I got some better pics of the Stargazer this morning and will prepare that auction and start it tonight.  I'll put a linkie up to the auction when it's ready!  Have a great Saturday everyone! xoxoxo  oh, yea, PS! I just calculated INCHES on my weight loss.  Those commercials are misleading to me when they say "so and so lost xx inches!" ok so now I know they're adding up the total.  hehe!  So far I've lost a total of 23 inches.  5-Bust, 8-Waist, 6-Hips and 2-Each Thigh.  :D

         There's one of the two canvases that are JUST about dry enough for me to start two cat commissions!  Both canvases look the same at this point, tomorrow I will begin painting the kitties!    For today, I have had 2 canvases prepped for a couple of weeks and it's raining out, so I'm going to paint something else while I'm waiting for the other two to finish drying.  :)   I am waiting for two packages with more pics, I will be painting a Smooth Fox Terrier (pet portrait contest winner), and another commission (a Yorkie!) in inks.  Yardwork update:  the pool is up!   urlLink See?  I dug up the yard under the pool, threw down 16 bags of sand, then dug up a smidge more to add 5 more 18" square patio blocks, then 8 more bags of sand  to have a little mini "beachfront" so we don't get dirt & grass in the pool.    The roses are doing really well, all 5 plants have new growth.  I've clipped the blooms, brought them inside and have a very pretty  urlLink Bouquet  sitting on my desk now smelling all nice!  Then I have the front flower planter thing all full now and it looks LOVELY!  Here's an updated pic (I'm taking this out in the rain now..LOL), you can see I've added quite a few more things and it's really taking off and is quite colorful!  urlLink See the flowerbed here!   Ok now I should be tired from all of this, right?  No.  LOL    Lastnight I shampooed the carpets and cleaned the floors until midnight with this new cleaner.  This stuff is AMAZING!  Here's a link if you want to buy some:  urlLink Super Duper Cleaner!   Not kidding, this door to door salesman hit our house the other night.  He came in, showed me how well it worked cleaning up stains in the carpet that have been there for YEARS, and of course I was skeptical.  I always am!  I really dislike door-to-door salespeople.  Ug don't invade my home!!  Anyway I told him that if he could clean anything up in my studio that had dried oil paints on it then I'd buy a bottle.  Welp, I had splattered some on my curtains and he cleaned it right up! So I bought some.  After my painting session the other night I had splattered it all over my clothes, I was a mess.  So I used the stuff, cleaned it right out of my clothes!  Lastnight I decided to put it into my Kirby shampooer and WOW the carpet is CLEAN!!!  Very very cool stuff.  Highly recommend it!!  What else... oh yes, weight loss!  Well, I have been holding steady at a loss of 37 pounds.  Only thing is, I'm losing INCHES now and gaining muscle mass from all this outdoorsy hard manual labor stuff I've been doing!  So, as of yesterday, I've gone down 4 sizes (and I'm counting by two's since that's how our stuff is sized), and am wearing clothes from like 7 years ago!  YAHOO!  Alrightie then, I think I've rambled on enough to get you all caught up, now I need to get ready to paint!  Show ya later! ;)  xoxoxoxo

      Okie doke folks, here's the news!  The City of Toronto (Canada) has a big, beautiful waterpark (links to come).  It has been up and running for about 10 years now, and they are expanding!  Their general contractor searched for a large frog to add to the new section and found one of the frogs I did last year,  urlLink Swampy , and contacted me to create a frog similar to Swampy for their waterpark!  So this will be a BUSY summer!  The frog fabrication will take approx. 2 weeks, and once it arrives here I will be a busy bee!  I'm estimating the whole project will take about 4-6 weeks or so.  Then, next time you're in Toronto, you can stop by the waterpark and see Swampy II!  I will be creating a separate page to display the progress of this one, and of course keep you all updated!  This is going to be FUN!!!!!!  So there's my big big big announement.  Not bad, eh? :D xoxoxo!

      I really didn't want to get into politics here, but I just noticed something and wanted to share.  This weekend, after the news that Regan had passed, I was pretty upset.  I still am.  When he was President, I was just old enough to be aware of who he was.  I remember speeches, I remember seeing him on TV, I remember him being President, and I remember liking him.  I found myself comparing Regan's Presidential style and personality to Bush's and found so many similarities that I know who I will be voting for this year.  I also have a news feed from GWB.com and there was a small link in there today to read the remarks made by GWB on Regan's passing.  I went to the homepage of GWB.com, and here, you can see for yourself. (and if you don't see it today, I don't know if it will still be up, but it's a very nice full page memoriam with a link at the bottom to go to the GWB normal home page.  the very last thing on the page.)   urlLink www.georgewbush.com   I am very impressed with the honor, integrity and respect GWB has shown toward Regan.  Then, just out of pure curiousity, I went here:  urlLink www.johnkerry.com   And once again have been slightly surprised (and as usual disappointed) that Kerry's respects are second in importance.  He couldn't even give our former President a few days of top priority on his site?  And if he puts himself first on his site, what does that say about how he would behave as President?  Sigh.  I knew I knew better, but now I really know why I knew better.  /end politics (I promise!)  Have a good one...we have mosquito bites to tend to today. xoxoxo

       urlLink    This is a Mandevilla bloom, isn't it beautiful?   You can click for a larger view of it.  I love the sunburst look down in the center, it is so pretty!  I have about 15 buds on the trellis now and I am so excited!  Last year I planted clematis there that did not do well.  :(    More flowers!  I took a few photos this morning and decided that I'm going to invest in a better digital camera with macro mode.  (Thank you Erikie for pointing out that it exists!)  Then I will be able to have MUCH larger and sharper closeups of pretties for you!    Ok here are s'more for ya. (and if anyone wants to paint them, be my guest!) An  urlLink Orange Gerber Daisy ,  urlLink Peach Rose  (just opened this morning!)and this  urlLink Yellow rosebud  (will probably open in the next day or two.  That's it for now!  We're heading down to Wallyworld for some stuff, pool filter, chemicals, pistachios for Mark..yadda yadda...  Have a great Saturday!!  p.s. if you aren't grossed out easily, here are a few of my  urlLink bruises .  I told you I look like I've been in a wreck!

Bruises from my thigh all the way down to my ankle now!  But the good news is, the pool is filling as I type.  YAY for summer swim fun!

We're leaving in about 45 minutes for my follow-up appointment with the eye doctor (new contact adjustments), and then lunch, then back home, then a landscaper is going to come over and tell me how much he'd charge me for cutting the sod up so I can finish landscaping.  I just don't have the time (or energy!) for cutting away all that sod, when they can probably do it in just a couple of hours.  (please please please let them be CHEAP!)  We are finishing up Mark's Father's Day present, we started it yesterday while it was yicky chilly and rainy out.  We'll finish that up today and wrap it up and get it in the mail tomorrow.  Then tonight, I PAINT!!!!  The Pet Portrait Giveaway contest ended yesterday, I drew one winner who's e-mail bounced back to me three times!  This is such a major inconvenience, which is why I clearly stated in the rules that a valid e-mail that was checked frequently was required.  I had to sit, and wait, and try again a few times before selecting another winner.  So congrats, "N"!  Your baby is precious and I am so excited to paint him!!!    You will all get to see progress pics here of course, and I'll send out the final annoucement notification tomorrow with some surprise specials for all the entrants (with valid e-mail addy's, hehe), and I will also have a HUGE HUGE HUGE announcement tomorrow sometime, too!!!  Have a great Thursday everyone!! xoxoxo

         This is one of my new roses, called "First Prize", they are swirled pink.  We have been planting and weeding and pruning up a storm here!  I have LOT'S of pics for you today!!  Yesterday was front yard day.  First I cleaned out the gutters, which were horrendous to say the least.  Blech!  Then I weeded my mums and silver mound, then moved over to my  urlLink Front Floral thingie  and now it's all spiffed up.  First I added a  urlLink Mandevilla Trellis , which has the most beautiful blooms, they remind me of Hibiscus.  We already had a good assortment, the back row against the house you can see day lilies, stargazers right in front of the window, a couple of very tall guys that I believe are coneflowers (can't remember exactly! LOL), there are a few hostas scattered in front of those, and the big bunch in the front are Primrose that Caitlin picked out last year that have spread like crazy!  We needed more color, so yesterday we added some Begonias, and then today a couple of more... first, a couple of  urlLink Zinnia's , one is a dark pink the other is light pink.  Also planted some Peach  urlLink Geraniums  which are really pretty!  We have some Moss Rose that appear to be returning this year, which is the sortof bare looking spot in the front corner.  :)  On to the side of the house... yes I have been a busy and hopeful green thumber!  We had 5 different roses there before, but all but one stopped blooming a few years ago.  So I talked to Mark early this morning, he suggested taking those out and replanting new roses.  So here you go, honey!  Lots and lots of buds on these!!   urlLink Four new ones, and one oldie!   There was a ton to do here, weeds had overgrown all of it, it looked very very yicky.  Now, from right to left we have  urlLink First Prize Roses , which are swirled pink.  The large bloom was broken so I clipped it and now it's sitting right next to me smelling lovely!  Next, there's  urlLink Remember Me , no tag, but I looked them up and they are a peachy yellow blushing a coral color.  Really pretty!  There are about 10 buds on that one.  Then there are  urlLink Helmut Schmidt , which are yellow.  The next one is the one that has survived since before we lived here,  urlLink Dark Peach , we always get quite a few blooms on this one throughout the summer.  Last but not least (and hopefully not dying!!!),  urlLink Double Delights , these are cream blushing red.  I also picked up two more,  urlLink Pink Rhododenderon & Pink Azaelia  (I know I spelled that wrong!), those will go on the mound thing I'm shoveling around in the backyard, since it's partial shade.  :D  Ooh!  I almost forgot!  (ok I did forget, I'm back editing. LOL)  I saw Jayden out in the yard holding really still, and asked her what she was doing.  She said "there's a birdie!"  Yup, a baby Chickadee, hasn't quite learned to fly, down on the ground.  I moved him away from Chloe (our dog), and  urlLink awww he's a baby! he's so cuuuuute!    I will definitely be putting images up here as they bloom so you can enjoy them with me this year!  xoxoxoxo

This is Logan, sneaky kitty, thinks that basket is all his. ;)  This one should be dry some time tomorrow so I can scan him, for now an evening digital is just going to have to do!

      Yesterday was a pretty emotional day for me.&nbsp; The last few days have&nbsp;been a little rougher than I am used to, but yesterday was something different.&nbsp; I paced, I tried to lie down, tried to redecorate, nothing worked.   Finally, at about 6PM, I went straight out to my studio and opened up my tubes of paint.&nbsp; I felt relaxed, finally not thinking about everything on my mind, in my own zone.&nbsp; I still have to go back to my zone for a bit more to finish, but here's the result of my loose & free painting episode.&nbsp; I don't know if I will ever be able to not paint realistically, but this is probably the farthest I've gone impressionistically.&nbsp; (Erikie?&nbsp; Do you agree?)&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a good size, 12 x16, and I even painted it around to the sides.  Enjoy.

Mark helped me select the pieces that will represent my work the best, and I spent all morning putting images together and burning them to CD!&nbsp; Think happy thoughts for me will ya?&nbsp; Thanks!!!   It's a rainy day here, so we're just hanging out.&nbsp; I wanted to go to the zoo today (more reference pics!), so fooey on the rain!&nbsp; I will paint this afternoon, and finish the piece I started lastnight.  Hope you're day is sunnier than ours today!  xoxoxo  updated 7:48PM:&nbsp; I finished another one!&nbsp; Enjoy!&nbsp; The painting is still wet, the&nbsp;pic is blurry, and the color is off.&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; (I couldn't wait to show you though!)&nbsp;I'll get a better&nbsp;pic and all that jazz tomorrow&nbsp;in good daylight.

          Good morning!&nbsp; I have a few "progress photos" to share today.&nbsp; I didn't take pics of all of my band-aids, and I'll just leave it at that.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; This view above here is for all of you who have never visited the Mississippi River before, yep, it's the Mighty Mississippi.&nbsp; You know how&nbsp;folks say "it's only a hop-skip &amp; a jump away"?&nbsp; Well the MM is literally just a hop from here!&nbsp;&nbsp;Skipping and jumping is optional upon arrival.&nbsp; They have a beautiful parkway (when it isn't submerged) with a bike path, I took the girls down there this week when I had a bug fogger going off in the house.&nbsp; (iew, bugs.&nbsp; bitey bugs.)&nbsp; It was a gorgeous day, obviously a few other folks were enjoying it as well.&nbsp; :)  I finished drywalling the family room, taped most of it, need to mud it and get the cabinets in there.&nbsp; I also put a floor down in that space, and will cut the carpet back further for a few more tiles in a fun half-circle design.&nbsp; Here are a few shots of what it looked like the other day...   urlLink Drywall Completed   this is what's going on that wall...except for one piece I found space for after I drew this out!   urlLink The Entertainment Wall   The old living room carpet is gone, bye-bye old yicky carpet!&nbsp; Guess what was underneath?!&nbsp; Yes, tile, but really old tile, and the kind that needs to be treated before you go walking on it barefoot or anything.&nbsp; So I treated that on Thursday night and yesterday morning.&nbsp; Blechy fooey on uncovering more problems with every project!&nbsp; Dagnabbit!!&nbsp; (I can whine just a little bit can't I?&nbsp; I mean it's just me doing all of this, and I've been really good about not cussing like a regular construction guy would be..lol)  Now I do need to get the baseboards painted in the living room but I HAVE to take a day (or two) off from this.&nbsp; It is making my mind warp in ways that just plain hurt.&nbsp; I took it easy yesterday, believe it or not, and only painted the part of the baseboard around the entry way so I could get the new floor down in that area, well then I thought heck, I may as well paint the door too, so I did that.&nbsp; (Someone smack me!)&nbsp; Here's a teenie little preview of what I did yesterday and what it's going to look like with the new carpet:     I do believe I've caught you all up with the past few days at my house, sans the really pitiful me that sat and moped and got weepy over missing my hubby so much...not to do the work, but just for me to rest my head on after I finished.&nbsp; He knows how much I dig these projects and what a tomboy kinda gal I am, the only thing I ever say "I can't do that" about is getting up on a ladder - and now I'm doing that too.&nbsp; I miss my man.&nbsp; 9 months to go.  BTW, I haven't updated my weight loss progress in a while.&nbsp; I've lost 42 pounds now.&nbsp; I have 21 pounds to go to meet my goal, and 9 months to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hm...that's about 2.5 pounds a month, and I've been averaging 8.4.&nbsp; Not too shabby, I'm actually quite pleased with myself since I'm down 3 sizes (6 if you count by 1's, lol), fitting into things I haven't worn since 1997-98.&nbsp; Even found my favorite jeans, Levi Silver Tabs that I loved so much and have been looking for for years - in a bag of my "don't fit into these anymore" clothes - pulled them out and they fit really nice, and they're a Junior's size!&nbsp; I love it when that happens.  Ok better get moving for the day.&nbsp; I hope you all have a beautiful, calm, sunny weekend!!  xoxoxoxoxo

        Grab your coffee, come outside with me I have to show you these!!  Just your average day here, I was working away on clearing out the mess I made, getting ready to clean carpets when all of the sudden,  urlLink someone stopped by!   You can imagine my surprise, I mean it's not often a celebrity like this just pops by and waits for you, you know?  We were all so excited!! Squealing and being giddy, just your average girls here.  ;)   Yes that was our excitement for the day!    Here's a lovely I photographed yesterday morning after giving my babies a little misty drink.   urlLink See my baby refreshed!   **I'm adding these from my morning coffee break.  Enjoy!!**  urlLink Soaking up the morning sun :)   urlLink More lily blooms   urlLink Morning footsteps on my rooftops!   Oh alright, enough with the break already.  Get back to  urlLink WORK WORK WORK!   Yes, the insulation is ALL DONE.  Old stuff out, new stuff in.  Area is taped off/sealed, carpets are so clean I hate to replace them, and now all I need is someone to pick up 6 sheets of drywall for me.  Ooh yea I was going to call Lowe's and see if they deliver for free.  Yep, then I can drywall, install cabinets, a little floor, and bing-bang-boom, we're ready to go (rip the rest of the room apart!)..hehe!  Ok have a great great Wednesday!  I can actually kinda relax a little today before I move all of the furniture.   Hip hip hooray!  ;D

      Most of my  urlLink Print Auctions  are ending today if you haven't seen them yet.  I added my Purple Tulip to my available prints, it looks lovely!!  (I am partial to purple!)   Mark has been asking me to make a stencil of Wile E. Coyote for the guys over there to use on a few things.  That's not the stencil of course, this is my test spray of it with hand embellishments that Mark can hang on his wall of photos. :D  I sent it off yesterday, along with a few spare stencils they can trace onto something else.  I know how guys are, they like to rip and tear stuff up if it doesn't go how they want it to go!  Goofy guys!  Ok that'll be $150 bucks guys, for chiropractic treatment on my hand and wrist from holding that daggone x-acto so tight & pressing through many layers of cardboard!  (Just kidding!  about the bill, not the pain..lol)  Did I tell you my Stargazers outside of my front window are blooming?  OOOOOH yes they are!  Yummy!!  (I smell more paintings of them coming!)  What else...ooohhh yea...the room.  Well I think I'm going to have to take a progress picture of the mess I made yesterday.  oops.  The ceiling, well ok the FIRST ceiling (yes there are two, just like the walls), appeared to have some water damage on top of damage I made removing the closets - on top of just being old and stinky.  :P  I ripped them out.  Blown cotton insulation fell like rain - ok no more like a monsoon or something - all over everything.  Last night's trip to Lowe's brought home a 12 gallon shop vac (everyone should have one of these, and they're ON SALE!), 2 rolls of insulation to replace that other gook, and a FACE MASK.  Good gravy!  I couldn't have had enough bandana's on my head to prevent that stuff from getting up my nose.  :P~   urlLink Here's the mess!   Today I have to clean up my mess.  Then I have to get all the wood I tore down out of the house!!  There are a few pieces "in tact" from the closets - framing, thick pine paneling, etc. and I told Caitlin I would see what I could save to build them a mini-house in the backyard.  Wouldn't that be cool?  They may be getting their own little pine cabin.  Fun!! I always wanted one of those!    Ok I'm procrastinating now... I'm going to go outside with my coffee and camera and do my morning wake-up and smell nature thing!  :)  Have a Happy Tuesday & thanks for stopping by!! xoxoxo

      Hiya folks!  Hm I am absent far too much lately.   I had some chaotic days Friday and Saturday, and after the chaos continued the home improvement projects.   urlLink First, it looked like this.    urlLink A little while ago, it looked like this!    urlLink Now, it looks like this!   Back to work!  Hope you are all having a GREAT weekend!!!!! xoxoxo  p.s. Erikie dared me to post  urlLink this pic  for you to see!  Ok, I have a fetish, and it is belly buttons.  I know I know, wierd.  But they are symbolic to me, very cool and cute.  I look at my girls' buttons and think about how much I love that they were connected to me for 9 months through that cute little "scar".  So mom, this one is for you, too!  (Humming the tune "Memories" for you) So anyhoo, it's not obscene or anything, and I will probably paint it!   Just as soon as I get this daggone room done!  LOL!

      Are you all tired of hearing "Toronto Swampy!" "Toronto Swampy!"  Ok, I'll have to start referring to him as "TS" ok?  ok.  I'll try to remember that.  Why I make promises at midnight is beyond me.  LOL    So here we go, I modified the page(s) for TS, to include all of the new photos, and split the final images from the work in progress.  Please have a look, let me know if the links to the WIP page are clear and stuff aye?  (Did I use that in the correct context?)  ok ok.  Go look.  I did a whole lotta little stuff today, like installing a new doorknob on the girls door (after I had to jigsaw the hole bigger since the other knob was too small..it's always complicated!) and did some bird and squirrel watching and took photographs and stuff.  Cableman, stuff stuff stuff...It was a day filled with I don't know what, but it was filled.  LOL!  Have a wonderful middle of the night and morning!    ooh, yea, the link:   urlLink "TS's" new pages

       I have to be nuts!  First I have to show you this,  urlLink This is the closest you've probably ever thought you'd see a bug like this.   hehe, I had to do it.  Don't be scared, we think they're really cool, and I bet Mark will give it a big old "cooooool" too!  I started out the morning with the intention of painting  urlLink this , prepped the canvas and everything (12x16 in case you're wondering).  Somehow things changed though, when I returned the call to Carpetland and they said they'd be here on the 15th to tear out my old carpet in the living room.  Installation then is scheduled for the 19th.  Well I got to thinkin', umm... I have to move all the furniture out of the room, and keep it out of the room for 4 days.  Ummmmm..... ok.  I sat down with Caitlin and asked her what she thought the best plan would be for us for the day.  Me to paint in the studio all day, or both of us clearing out their playroom (wall to wall TOYS, TOYS and more TOYS!).  She opted for clearing out the room!  Eek!  Next step, call the cable company and get another cable outlet hooked up on the back wall where the TV will go.  I planned on turning the playroom back into the family room/toy storage/play area anyway, this just pushed things along, as usual!  The cable guy will be out tomorrow between 2-5.  Ummm.....ok.  He couldn't even REACH where I wanted the new cable to go, so then it was really one of those "I have no choice" programs.  Now  urlLink this wall of closet space  will become a wall of base cabinets with countertop, and the TV will sit on the counter there.  My brother-in-law is going to come out to tell me if the interior closet walls can be torn down ok (don't want that ceiling caving in on me while I stand there with a sledgehammer saying "oops"!), meanwhile we have nearly the entire contents of the playroom in the garage.  I did start the wall treatment today too, and will finish that up tomorrow.  No rush, right?  LOL!  And I have to show you this,  urlLink my beloved piano , because Erikie asked to see it.  Yes I can play!  I'm no expert pianist though!  I will have to show you my viola some day too.  So who wants to help me move my piano tomorrow?  Oh yes, a shameless self-promoting plug if there ever was one...  I am   urlLink FULLY STOCKED WITH CANVAS!  Many many assorted sizes, down to itty bitty totally cute 4x4's!!  I am going to be painting up a storm, so if you ever wanted one of my paintings, I'll have a great assortment of sizes, which means a great assortment of prices.  If there's something in particular you wanted to have please  please    please   tell me now (right here, click the little linkie that says to 'leave feedback' or 'chat with me', or you can just e-mail me), 'cause once I get going you might not see your request for a couple of months.   YAHOO!  Got all that out.  Now OFF TO WORK I GO!  Again!  I love being busy!   :D  many xoxoxoxoxoxo's to you all!   p.s. danke' Erikie for the cool "me"! :)*

      Happy Tuesday (it is Tuesday, isn't it?!)  Just finished a few site updates:  The  urlLink Home page  has a new transition including  urlLink Toronto Swampy , Honey, Rocky and my Stargazer paintings.  The  urlLink Custom Cat Portraits  gallery now includes both Rocky and Simba, original reference photos and final scanned images of the paintings.  The  urlLink Custom Dog Portraits  gallery has also been updated to include Honey and Dom's portraits, reference photos and all!  I think that's it for now... I still need to get the print gallery updated, I think I will do that in a bit, my eyes are going cross!   UPDATE!  one more thing!  I just listed a buncha prints on eBay, Four new ones including two new  LIMITED EDITION  print auctions!   urlLink Here's a linkie to my auctions!    ANOTHER UPDATE!  ok two more things!  LOL!  My client sent photos of where Toronto will be placed!  I am overwhelmed with excitement, this park looks gorgeous, absolutely the coziest spot ever for  urlLink Toronto!   Back to your regularly scheduled surfing... xoxoxo!

      Hey there!  Our fireworks were incredible.  I am in the middle of cleaning my studio right now, rearranging things so that I can work more efficiently and stuff, but wanted to pop in and drop this off for you all....   urlLink Grab a half hour, some popcorn, a sodee pop and a speedy connection!   Watch my fireworks with me & the girls!  The grand finale brought tears to my eyes.  It's the highest quality video I could muster up, great sound too!  I will be back later to share pics of what we did yesterday.  Hope you all had a wonderful 4th of July, remembering  what the day really stands for  while you ate some funnel cakes and/or hot dogs!  xoxoxo

      I'm alive!!  What a week!  After finishing Toronto Swampy, my father-in-law came over and helped me  urlLink pack the giant frog .  The rest of the day Monday was just keeping busy stripping wallpaper in my living room until the trucking company arrived.  I sent him on his way in the middle of the afternoon.... urlLink in a giant truck !  (Thanks, Roadway!!)  My niece came over Monday morning with my father-in-law, she's been staying with us all week and it's been a lot of fun!  The girls helped strip the wallpaper, and once that whole thing got going it just catapulted me into redecorating mode.  We used to have this nice nautically themed living room, but now, ooh-la-la, it is very nice!   In fact,  urlLink Here's a glimpse, Mark's portrait now hanging on the wall , and  urlLink this is a sample of our new carpet  that will be installed on the 15th of this month!  See, when I start a project, I can't stop until it's done!!  I picked up a couple of bargains, a new navy swag for the front window, a couple of new end tables that were a total steal and matched my mission style couch table thing.  Between stripping wallpaper, removing wallpaper adhesive, cleaning the walls, painting them, and keeping the girls entertained in the pool etc... it has been a crazy week!  I think I've been on my computer less this week than ..um...I ever have been!    I did finish up the two kitty portraits, I was waiting for final approval to sign them so they are still a little tacky and I'll ship them on Monday...er...Tuesday since the Post office will probably be closed Monday!  Dagnabbit, I forgot about that.  Dom will also be shipped with them, so I have some paperwork to do to get them ready.  I'm working on another website design too, which has been keeping my brain active and spinning.  I ordered a bunch of canvas to go with my 42 new tubes of oil paints, and I am going to be painting new pieces like crazy!  I am on a mission, I have a goal, so be prepared to come back often to see what I'm doing!  I am going to launch with adding a couple of prints to  urlLink what is currently available , and listing them on ebay - a couple of them will be limited edition.  To end the week, I lounged in the pool for 10 minutes!  Woohoo for sitting still!  ;D  Then I got out of the pool and took some fabulous pics I wanted to share with you!  Ready?  Here we go! I'm going to leave these full size for you, it's just not the same shrunk down to nothin'.   urlLink Full Moon   urlLink Yellow Rose   urlLink Remember Me Rose   urlLink Jayden   urlLink White gerber daisy   urlLink Bug on my truck   urlLink The girls   urlLink Empty nest   urlLink Squirrely Eating   One more addition...the girls (Caitlin & Stacie) performed for you all... this is a long movie, please keep that in mind on dial-up connections :)  urlLink Caitlin & Stacie as The Chin Twins   Aah it feels good to get all of those off my chest! I hope you enjoy them, I am having so much fun with my new camera!  I hope you all have a fun fun 4th of July fireworky type of day!  Don't forget to put your pups where they can't hurt themselves, those fireworks really make them freak out!     urlLink HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMERICA!   xoxoxo

Caitlin colored most of herself in, and I colored in Jay. Aren't they cool? :D         Hey now!  Check this out!!!   urlLink Cowpainters Custom Painted Fiberglass Animals Page !

       For all of my readers, warriors, thumpers, groups...everyone who thinks about prayer but maybe never has before.  As many of you know, things are heating back up over in Iraq.  If you would, for those of you that will, please take a moment (or two or three!) to pray for our guys over there, they are needing God's hand to guide them, protect them and give them strength and endurance through this one.  On behalf of all of our Soldiers, and all of their families, thank you for thinking of them and holding them up through prayer.  xoxoxoxoxoxo   p.s. That is a Demdaco Willow Tree Angel, the Angel of Miracles.

      I was curious today to see what I've painted so far this year all together in a group. I had NO idea it would be this large, but hey! Cool beans, folks! I've accomplished quite a bit so far this year, 40 paintings (plus one in progress that's not listed here), home improvement projects, entertaining the kids this summer...  Now the summer is coming to an end ::sniffle sniffle:: and I am reflecting on what I've gotten done this year. Here are my paintings, in order, from January 1st of this year!  What are your faves? (If you don't remember their names, you can just say Row 72, #15A..hehe no there's not quite THAT many..hehehe!!)

      Hey everybody!  I started another painting yesterday, it's a gorgeous Red Tailed Hawk that resides at our local zoo.  Quite a handsome pose!  I'll post a work in progress shot later today after I get a little further along.  We had to run some errands yesterday, sent 5 packages out to Mark, one package of live plants to Erikie (I split my irises and had mucho leftover!), and we ended up at the Humane Society Animal Shelter.  I wish we could have kitties!!  Waaa!!  I had my camera (of course) and took several photos. :)  It's been getting chilly here in the mornings and evenings, sure sign that fall is coming.  foo!  I don't wanna be cold!  Going to paint...have a good day! xoxoxox

      Four more years!  Guess who stopped over for coffee this morning before his rally? hehe...courtesy  urlLink Erikie , our resident goofy graphical engineer....      What an insanely cool day today has been!! I'll try to sum it up as briefly as I can, hold back my excitement, jitters and girlie squeals..lol  I called for tickets to the rally this morning, and got a voicemail. We hopped in the truck, drove over, and I had NO idea where to park. So I pulled into the parking lot of the place I used to work, and the attendant there was regretful in saying I couldn't park there. Well, I begged, and he looked in the back - saw the girls and waved me on thru. Right on, Mister Parking Lot Attendant!!!  We walked over to the entrance to the rally, and they asked for tickets. :(  I told the gal I had checked online, that it said tickets were still available, and asked if I could get them there. She said no. Then she went and got the bossman, and I told him I tried to get tix, and he looked at me and the girls and said "tell ya what, you're supporting the Pres. right?" I nodded feverishly, 'uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!' and he walked us through! Right on, Mister Boss Ticket Man!!!  They had this cool petting zoo, some other things for the kids to do, it was really nice how they had everything laid out. Well the rally was on the Mississippi MUDDY Riverside, we had wild raging storms here lastnight. Sqwish, sqwish went our feet through the grass! LOL  We walked around & found a nice area where GW was visible, and I went camera happy!! What a motivating and DOWN TO EARTH man he is. You knew you were surrounded by the same type of people, everyone was so considerate, all in agreement over every single topic. It was the coolest and friendliest environment I ever remember being in!! Well I got a  urlLink  TON of pics  ..and there are a few thumbs I'll show you here, too.  When I thought he was nearly finished speaking, we walked over to the barricades near GW's tent setup. I got the attention of one of GW's Medic Staff, and showed him this photo I had printed and asked if there was any way he could get a Secret Service agent so that I could get GW to sign it. He saw the photo, was very very sweet and said he would take care of it and bring someone over. HE DID! He brought this nice Secret Service Press lady, who asked me some questions, we talked a few seconds, I gave her some information, and voila! She took the photo and said "stay right here."

      Michael Fräse, someone whom I consider my Artful Guardian Angel, just listed this painting - a tribute to a Police Dog named Vasko.  Have a look at his painting, grab a tissue (or two or three), and read through the auction text.   urlLink Tribute To Vasko   God Bless Vasko and every other K9 Police & Rescue dog.  What amazing creatures they are.
