       urlLink    for kim&nbsp; urlLink     tattooed bettie  she's that tattooed bettie, dark eyed beauty, smoking her cigs and waxing philosophic over steaming cups of coffee. pondering the faltering economy and wonder woman's bust size in the same breath. she rocks, she kicks ass the ink blot in green pants and pirate's booty T. she likes to chase pigeons and dance through the aisles of CVS. who's the greatest american hero? she asks again and again. ahhh, to be young  (snicker, snicker). she was here for Lennon but not Elvis. she just missed disco but caught a flock of seagulls. her brother burned  all her new kids on the block. she shaved her head at 16. yet she was the girl on the fire escape giving haircuts to her friends.

      yesterday was fun and interesting and well worth the trip. we had a few beers, some excellent grub, and stimulating conversation. i got to see a few old friends and make some new acquaintances. all in all, a good day. kev and heather are doing well. they have a beautiful house, a cool dog, a great life. i wish them all the best. chris was there without becky; she's still ill and has been MIA for some time now. i got to talk with beth for a little while. she moved to brooklyn and is nannying in the interim, waiting for the dream job to arrive. she's got a degree so she's one step ahead of most of us. kathy was there, but i didn't get a chance to say hi. jill says she is doing well. jill is really cool. harry likes her too. she's very down to earth, in his words, and intelligent. it amazes me. she's someone i never thought i would speak to, yet we all had fun bullshitting all day. it teaches me that you have to give everyone a chance.       gabe is getting married next month, which is so cool. he seems to be doing very well. he's getting married in new hampshire and having the reception in massachusetts. then going to cancun for the honeymoon. there was also another couple, amy and steve, there who just got engaged and are getting married next year. they're going to be honeymooning in hawaii! danielle was there, too with her husband (can't seem to remember his name). it's always good to see her. it was just nice to be around all of these couples. it's something we don't get to do very often. harry and i have been venturing out a little more often as of late. we are emerging from the bat cave for the occasional pool game and bottle of suds. we seem to be finding our happy medium. we started out with closing down the bars the first few months of our relationship to becoming couch potato homebodies. now we've found a balance.

       urlLink    just mauied!&nbsp; urlLink     so i've realized that i haven't yet written about the most important event of this year for me. i wanted to come in and make myself comfortable before i really got down to business. and now that i've taken off my shoes and have graciously accepted a jack and coke, i can begin.  as you can see from the pics here, i got married this year. my husband's name is harry, and he is one terrific guy. he's loving, caring, generous, nurturing, yeah, all that good stuff, but he has something more. something i've never seen in anyone else i've ever met. i've known plenty of guys that are good with kids. guys that say they want a family. guys that say they will provide. harry  IS  a family man. there's no other way to put it. he makes me feel safe. with him, i think we can make a wonderful family - beautiful children, a lovely home, a kick ass life.   and most interesting of all, he is the most normal person i have ever met. like ani says, "i think you're the least fucked up/ person i've ever met". seriously, we've all got problems, even harry, but he doesn't let them get him down. he just keeps on truckin. he's so well adjusted. i'm actually a bit envious of it. even in our superhero group (i'll talk about that one at a later date) he's actually "normal boy." he brings sanity to the chaos that is my life.  my family loves him, my friends love him, and yeah, i love him, too. he makes me smile just by being there. cheesy, i know, but true. and i've been telling everyone that if the first year of marriage is indeed the most difficult, well bring on year two! we were falling asleep about a month ago, and we usually chat for a few minutes before we drift off. we were talking about the whole "first year of marriage" myth, and both of us whispered, "you mean, it's gets even better?" and then flew into a fit of giggles. we're too cheesy for words. we are mister and missus cheesy, thank you.  i have so much more to say about harry and me, but i've got plenty of pages left to do so. for how, i will leave you with some sarah, which always makes me think of my mister cheesy.     your love is better than ice cream better than anything else that i've tried your love is better than ice cream everyone here knows how to fly.  it's a long way down it's a long way down it's a long way down to the place where we started from  your love is better than chocolate better than anything else that i've tried your love is better than chocolate everyone here knows how to cry  and it's a long way down it's a long way down it's a long way down to the place where we started from

      "When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore.  So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too.  That's love."  Rebecca - age 8     When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different.  You just know that your name is safe in their mouth." (This ones so sweet) Billy - age 4     "Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other."

Lauren - age 4     "When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you." (What an image) Karen - age 7     "Love is when Mommy sees Daddy on the toilet and she doesn't think it's gross." Mark - age 6     "You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it.  But if you mean it, you should say it a lot.  People forget." Jessica - age 8     And the final one --     Author and lecturer Leo Buscaglia once talked about a contest he was asked to judge.  The purpose of the contest was to find the most caring child.  (Now this will melt your heart.)     The winner was a four-year-old child whose next-door neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently lost his wife.  Upon seeing the man cry, the little boy went into the old gentleman's yard, climbed onto his lap, and just sat there.       When his Mother asked him what he had said to the neighbor, the little boy said, "Nothing, I just helped him cry." innocence

      					 You’ve got me thinking about 14 and 16, and even 18, 20, 22 …  At 14, With acne in rare form And horrible hair up to there, I found my first love, So real, so heavy With emotion. A boy who could talk And listen for hours on end. My best friend,  Who decided to date Two or three of my gal pals As I pined away for his affections. And when he finally decided to tell me Those THREE LITTLE WORDS- He moved to another town, another school, Another life. And I was left here to go on. Yet here I am, 12 years fast-forward, and his voice permeates through my office. I shudder when I hear it- Not because it sounds like a ghost, But because… Well, because it’s as irritating as a falling bra strap. The only way he grew up Was vertically. Some boys are always boys, at any age.  At 16,  Yet another “BF” who liked ME Just the way I was, But liked someone else A little more. Harsh reality for that girl Who had so much heart To give out. But she didn’t give up. She just moved on.  To 18, 20 And finally a boyfriend, a husband in training. Who could have known that He was on the other side of the galaxy While sitting right next to me. He could talk, Just like the rest, But he wouldn’t listen. He only heard the first part Of the sentence And played Mad-Libs with the rest, Filling in the blanks with nonsense. When I said good-bye, The walls that held us in Came crashing down. He heard that.  At 22,  and free of those men/boys- Or so I thought. Enter the tall, dark, and handsome. The shy and quiet. The man not afraid to cry… ALL THE TIME. With artist’s hands And a poet’s heart, He won mine  With a paper flower. And they say the eyes Are the doorways Into the soul; Little did I know That those cinnamon orbs Led into a prison cell. I don’t look good in stripes.  So I traded him in For a new model, A little lighter  In color and demeanor. Strong and rugged, With plenty of room for me To stretch my legs And spread my wings. He has some miles on him, But so do i. We both just keep on truckin’ Side by side Following the same road. Who knows where we’ll end up; The fun lies in getting there. And I intend to enjoy the ride Until the very end.

      i found an old journal yesterday while searching for the two pieces jess and i had written about each other. i had completely forgotten about this journal. i had bought it specifically for keeping my best pieces in it. i don't even remember writing some of the stuff in it. but it's not that bad. given, i have journals upon journals of work, a lot of it crap, but i guess i did have a few strokes of genius way back when. i find it unbelievable at times that these thoughts, these emotions woven throughout these poems came from my mind. where in the hell was i back then? some are absolutely fantastic, while others are hauntingly eerie. the man most of the poems are about is no longer in my life. i see him at most once a year, at the annual emmaus bash at the ale house, but i do not speak to him. it takes too much effort. i don't have anything more to give him. i was completely drained by the end of that relationship. i had to have some down time to fill myself back up. i am now no longer on E, but i don't want to waste my fuel on a trip i don't think i will enjoy. he's not a bad person. i think it's just easier not to be in one another's lives. we got too close to the edge. and there ain't no comin' back.

       urlLink    soul sistas&nbsp; urlLink      Red   i'm red like her now but the only green i carry is the envy i hold. i live vicariously through my L.A. Woman, her life of foreign men, foreign cities, at least to me. walking the star-studded streets and sitting out in the sun, soaking up culture and coffee. smoking her cigarettes with a palm tree view and that famous sign holding vigil in the background. changing her hair with her shoes, (ok, i do that too) and walking the Pacific shores whenever she wants to. And now i can see her, if only for a day or two, and maybe i can find some green along the way.  -A      And Everything was Wonderful   full of caffeine and RAMbunctious clientele we fell into the realm of fame and fortune, glory and stories of gore and lore on the Hollywood scene. in the room of Green, we sat and smoked and giggled too much and spoke of boys we longed to know. our cast of characters: ones from foreign lands, boys in bands, and the one with artistic hands. the ones who drew our blood with caricature and song- prolonging the feeling of incomplete.  yet still we meet on different states of abbreviation and mind only to find everything is still wonderful.  -J

      jessica is back in my life. i am happy. simple as that. to think i spent 2 years without her on the other end of the phone line. why did i let it go on for so long? all i had to do was pick up my pen and scribble. i tried once or twice, but the anger bled through the page, and i didn't want to send that. nobody wants to open up a screaming letter from the pile of bills and new strip club flyers crammed in your mailbox. ok, not screaming, but definitely finger-pointing, temper-flairing, pulling-out-my-hair dialogue splashed across the pages. that's not who i had been to her, and that's not who i wanted to be. that was the reason i couldn't speak to her on that fateful summer day. i didn't want the anger coming out. i sat in silence, afraid of my voice. to speak all the thoughts racing through my mind would have been disasterous and cruel, and it wasn't what i really felt toward her. i'd never been angry at her before, so i had no idea how it would feel. before i overloaded, i had to get off the phone. so i told her i needed some time. and she gave it to me. but i took too much of it. i let it all linger.   now it's been two years, and we've finally managed to speak again. she thanked me for making first contact, but i don't really want to take credit for it. she was afraid, i was afraid. i went searching for a piece of her, and i found it through google. it was the second birthday i had spent without her, and i missed her. late into the night, after tossing and turning for an hour, i got up, turned the 'puter on, and googled her name. and magic happened. her blog came up. and the entry on my birthday was about yours truly. it was raw and harsh but real. she never expected me to read it. i saw myself through her eyes and realized that there were times in my past that i was really not a nice person. it was difficult to get through it all, but i did. and even more than that, i decided to comment. finally the words came. not the angry words, but the calm and rational ones. they had been hiding, cowering in fear. i set them free and they were good.   i hoped to hear something from her, but i also understood that she was very hurt and still resentful of the entire episode. i knew there was a chance for a big "fuck you", and end of chapter. but that didn't happen. instead, she read my comment, emailed me, and thanked me. when i saw her in my inbox, i nearly leapt out of my skin. as i read the first lines, a grin spread across my face, one of those idiot grins, like the sign-of-a-madman grins. i had to read the whole thing out loud in order to believe it was actually real. my husband sat by and listened, and told me i should call her. that fear returned a little so i decided an email would do well to break a little more ice.   we finally did get to speak on the phone, and it felt like home. 3 hours of chat, sipping coffee, listening to some fiona. ahhhh. loved it. cherished it. missed it. that's the good stuff. played some ketchup. talked about boys and heartache. coffee talk, ya know? that caffeine high we had been so accustomed to came right back.

      reconnecting with friends. i think about how long it's been since i've seen so and so, and i have brain flatulance. the time lapse hits me and i am speechless. how can i go so long without even speaking let alone seeing these people? i am a horrible friend. i have been too self involved. is this true? or have we all got our shit to do and an appointment on tuesday? when did work and family become priority number one and friendship a number two (pun intended)? i can remember a time when i would have jumped in front of rush hour traffic for my friends. where did that devotion go? that loyalty. that love. maybe i left it behind at my last literature final. maybe i dropped it at xando's the last time i was there. maybe i stored it with long forgotten letters and pictures.

      it's already 1pm, and so far i have only made breakfast and moved a bookcase. i am so lazy on sundays. each week, i make a list of everything that needs to get done by the end of the weekend, and every weekend, that list never gets done. does everybody do this? i seem to always set unattainable goals for myself. sundays reflect my life as a whole.  i must say that i have been in such a good mood since i started writing again. i didn't realize how much i had missed it. putting thoughts down on paper, expressing in writing what i can't seem to get out in speech. i remember a time when i couldn't go a day without setting something down on paper. it was my drug, like my morning coffee. and although i have given up most of my other crutches, like cigs and alcohol (well most of the time), i finally realized that the writing was the only one that didn't do any bodily harm. so why did i stop? the thought has crossed my mind from time to time these passed two years, and the only thing i ever came up with is this: writing was a form of therapy for me. i was so unhappy, and i would vent the angst and anger in my work. when i started a healthy relationship with my now husband, my life got better. i learned to let go of the anger and the hurt that had been my companion all those years. so when the sadness went, so did the need and desire to create my safe haven. i thought i had nothing to write about. somebody once told me, "nobody likes a happy poet," and personally, i believed the same thing.  writing never came naturally to me. i always had to work at it, which is why i loved it so much. i seem to feed off difficulty. in high school, i was told that i was a math genius and, therefore, destined to go into a field where i would use that natural talent with numbers. but i found math easy, and therefore, of no interest. now english intrigued me. i really had to work at figuring out exactly what the writer was trying to convey. i had a hard time of grasping the exact meanings of words. this made me want to learn even more. when i went to college, i decided i wanted to be an english major, and proceeded to take nearly every literature and writing class the university offered. i did this for years until the money ran out.   now my friend, jessica, she's a different story. she has natural writing talent. she is the one of the most amazing writers i have ever come across. we grew up together, taking the same classes, joining the same extra curricular activities. she had the gift. she can speak just as well as she can write. i'm not jealous of her, but i do somewhat envy her. not the sinful kind of envy, wanting to be her, but the awestruck kind of envy you feel for a soul sista. she kicks ass. and there is a lot to our story that i won't get into today. but i want to mention her because she is the reason i started this blog. she is the reason i am writing again. she has always been my inspiration, my muse, as it were. so today i thank her for getting my ass back on track.

       urlLink    are we really related?&nbsp; urlLink     so it's been almost seven years since misse and i moved into this house together. i remember way back when, the both of us thinking what luck that the two of us actually owned a home together. we could split bills and insurance and taxes, saving hundreds, hell thousands of dollars. little did i know that i would be selling my soul to the devil. it's not that i don't like misse. i don't really understand her sometimes, but she's my sister, and i love her. the biggest mistake i actually made is not pushing for the sale of the house when we first got it and splitting the cash. i realized early on that we could not share the same floor of the house. two women in the same kitchen does not work. the saying is true. so i stupidly banished myself to the basement. i had recently separated from my first husband, and she had her boyfriend and her daughter, so i let her have the main floor of the house. we built a second floor in the basement area for myself. don't get me wrong; i love my place. it's beautiful and cozy and actually quite large; it's just as big as the main floor of the house. what i didn't realize is what i would be giving up living in the bat cave. i miss waking up to the sunshine. i can't believe that i can actually say that i used to take windows for granted. and i have unfortunately found out that my sister is the heaviest walker on the face of the earth. as much as i like lionel ritchies "dancin' on the ceiling", i don't need to relive that '80's hit every damn day of my life. the night's of drunken merriment are the worst. it sounds like a herd of elephants stampeding. and to top it all off, i have become the landlord from hell. every month it is a battle to get the "rent" money from her. sharing all expenses is not what i thought it would be cracked up to be.  when she married the albanian a couple of years ago, i tried to force the sale of the house to no avail. she would not buy me out and she would not sell to me. so i am stuck. court is my next move, but do i really want to go that far? it's frustrating and it puts a strain on the relationship i have finally developed with my sister. what to do, what to do? and now, of course, the green monster has reared it's ugly head. she pulled the carpets up and low and behold, we have hard wood floors in this house. real hard wood floor! and she now has crown molding and chair rails and big beatiful furniture, and i can go on and on. these are all the things i have always wanted, but i can't have in the cave. i have school ceilings, the crazy grid of metal and cardboard, so crown moldings are out of the question. you can park a mercedes in from of a trailer, and in the end, it's still a double wide. if i pull my carpet up, what can i find? plywood. stylish 3/4 inch plywood. and below that...cement. no hardwood. i know it's small and petty of me to be jealous, but i am none the less. i feel like the people under the stairs, turning albino from lack of sunlight and eating the scraps thrown down my way as a means of sustenance. my husband and i dream of having a home of our own, but without the start up cash from this house, it's a pipe dream. am i being a prat about all this?

      so it wasn't that bad. although i must say that all children nowadays seem to be born with A.D.D. It's like they're all on speed! they talk so fast you can't understand them, and they never even finish a thought anyway, so most of the time, there's really no point in listening. they would spin in circles for hours if you let them. 30 seconds into the bus ride, they jokingly (at least i hope it was jokingly) asked if we were there yet. i just laughed it off and daydreamed out the window. i had 6 in my group, my niece, three other girls and two boys. two of the girls, unfortunately, seemed to be the class rejects. nobody wanted to pair up with them, and they didn't even want to pair up with each other. they were pushy and bossy, but not really much more than most of the kids i grew up with. i believe one of the boys was the class gigolo, and i found out he has a crush on my niece. he's a cutie, though. polite, a "gentleman" as he coined himself. the other boy was just strange. like the kid who used to talk to himself in the back of the room and shout out weird sounds from time to time. that kind of strange. he would raise his hand to either ask or answer a question, but not have anything to actually say when he was called on. do all kids do this? kinda freaked me out. the last girl was a friend of my niece's. she was a cute little girl but kinda copped an attitude with me near the end. i don't deal well with prima donnas.   but all in all, the kids had a good time, and i think i did a pretty good job. would i do it again? depends on where we're going.

      where did i put my sanity? it must be with my keys. i don't know what possessed me. i must be crazy, deranged, and all together discombobulated. i have... volunteered to chaperone my niece's field trip this morning. now why would i do that? i don't even  have  children! and now i have offered to help deal with 25 screaming 7 year olds. and to top it all off, we are going to Booth Park here in my hometown. Now if you've never heard anything about the Booth Brothers (no relation to john wilkes booth that i am aware of) who lived on this property way back when, i can tell you one thing; they were a bit eccentric. The property consists of 10 to 12 buildings, all varying from a blacksmith's shop to an observatory. they are all quite small. and a strange thing about them is that the buildings supposedly have no right angles. they specifically built them that way. have no idea why. there is one building alone with 44 different angles in it, none of which are the norm 90. were they just bad builders? where they building some kind of a doorway for cthulhu and the other elder gods to come through? did they just do it for kicks? i can't remember if there is an answer to that question, although i did take the tour as a young child myself. i suppose i will find out today and let you know, if i survive.  besides the angle thing, these buildings are all filled with various antiques: furniture, tools, housewares, etc. they have all been set on display behind little rope bars. yeah, like that's gonna stop the kids from charging like the proverbial bull in a china shop. am i supposed to stop them? am i supposed to put myself in the line of fire to protect and save the 200 year old loom? should i risk life and limb for the chair that doubles as a toilet? did they really use those? you're entertaining in your parlour and suddenly you feel the need to tinkle. instead of excusing yourself, you simply drop trough right there in front of your guests. you close the lid, sit back down, and say, "i'll empty that later" so all can relish in the lovely scent that must be emanating from your seat.  so now i must be off. wish me luck.

        Listen as the wind blows from across the great divide  voices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in time.  The night is my companion, and solitude my guide  would I spend forever here and not be satisfied?   And I would be the one to hold you down  kiss you so hard  I'll take your breath away  and after, I'd wipe away the tears  just close your eyes dear.   Through this world I've stumbled  so many times betrayed  trying to find an honest word to find  the truth enslaved.  Oh you speak to me in riddles  and you speak to me in rhymes.  My body aches to breathe your breath  your words keep me alive.   And I would be the one  to hold you down  kiss you so hard  I'll take your breath away  and after, I'd wipe away the tears  just close your eyes dear.   Into this night I wander  it's morning that I dread  another day of knowing of  the path I fear to tread.  Oh into the sea of waking dreams  I follow without pride  nothing stands between us here  and I won't be denied.   And I would be the one  to hold you down  kiss you so hard  I'll take your breath away  and after, I'd wipe away the tears  just close your eyes......      God, i wish i wrote that.

      I find it interesting when a movie and the book it was adapted from have completely different endings. i just finished nick hornby's  about a boy  yesterday. i must say they did an amazing job adapting this novel into a screen play. most of the dialogue is pretty much word for word. the casting was brilliant (yes, i've turned into a brit with all the british comedy i read). i actually saw the movie BEFORE i read the book, which is usually a big no no for me. but in this case, it was actually a pleasant experience. why? you may ask. because of the ending, or should i say endings. two completely different endings, both wonderfully executed. i loved them both. i can't figure out which one i love more. that amazes me. they both used music as the theme or catalyst for what happens, but in totally different ways. the book is set in 1993-1994, which i remember quite well. the movie is set in the 2002ish. the cd will gets for marcus in the movie is mystical. in the book, it's nirvana's  nevermind . now, if you think back to '93-'94, nirvana will actually come to mind. they were huge, that's true, but it was more than that. the big climactic scene in the book does not take place on a stage with marcus singing  killing me softly . it takes place on a train in early april 1994. the day kurt died. i don't want to tell any more because i'm hoping you will all run out and read the book now if you already haven't. but i remember that day vividly. i remember hearing kurt loder on mtv stating that kurt had killed himself. i remember listening to the tape of courtney  speaking to all the mourners the next day. that was the day the door was shut on childhood. that was the day i realized i was no longer invincible. that was the day i started to live knowing that i would one day die. i lost my immortality.

      i'm trying to finish my stephen king collection. i was missing about 8 or 9 books, so i've been ebaying and amazoning like crazy. i managed to find one at a goodwill store for $0.50 and i got another in hardback off of ebay for $4.00 including shipping. not too shabby. of course i went to another goodwill today in search of the rest and i come across the one i just won on ebay for $2.00. bummer. the 2 bucks aren't really that big a deal; it's the whole principle of the thing, ya know? and now i just got an edition with three of the other books i need all wrapped into one harback volume for $7.00 including shipping off of amazon. how lucky can you get? so the only ones i need now are:  dreamcatcher, thinner, misery  (which i swear i already had), and  the diary of elenor druse.  i don't need  danse macabre  or  on writing ; just the fiction stuff. i would eventually like to convert my entire collection to hardback. i'm about half way there already. but anyway. sorry to bore you all.  i've been going book crazy as of late. i've already read 2 books in the passed week, and am actually half way through a third. i can't get enough of it.   or wine. last night i drank a whole bottle by myself. and it was good. and the best part. no wine hangover headache in the morning. now that's the perfect bottle of vino, i tell you.   we went to go see "harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban" again yesterday. we took harry's mom to go see it. i realized that it's got to be at least 12 years since she's seen the inside of a movie theatre. as we walked in, her eyes got all bit and child-like. it was as if it were her first time. she was absolutely amazed. at the seating, at the hallways, the carpet, you name it. it was both sweet and sad at the same time. she doesn't really complain about being in the nursing home that much, but i think that's because she doesn't realize how long she's been there. she sometimes thinks that harry's still 17 years old. she has her good moments, though. of course, she bothers me to no end. she was an absolutely terrible mother to harry. she had hit him as a child, but even worse, she let her boyfriend beat harry every day that they were together. and worse. not even sure if she knows about the other stuff. i would like to think that she didn't. it all ended when the bastard actually shot her. enough said there. that's what harry had to grow up with. and now he's the most well-adjusted person i know. sometimes you wonder how a person could live through all that and still be such a good person.

        Fiona Apple's new album, Extraordinary Machine, has been shelved by Sony, according to a recent Rolling Stone interview with Jon Brion, her producer. Supposedly, Sony cannot find a single and is unsure how to promote the record. There is no word yet on how long this will take.     now the true fans don't care about a single. just put the damn album out!

      so i'm watching "reality bites" last night, drinking a coffee, and relishing in the sweet glory of it all. harry had already gone to bed (he had a rough day at work), so i thought to meself, "let's take a trip back in time." as the movie started, i felt all the worries and cares of my 27-year-old self lift off my straining shoulders, and i was indeed transported back to my 17-year-old self, craving a cigarette and a boys' affection. any boy would do. heh heh.  i watch the opening scene, listen to lelaina give her valedictorian speech, and smile to myself. i love this movie. the next scene comes on. up on the roof, having a few beers, smoking a j, singing "conjuction junction". i remember being compared to janeane garofalo after this movie came out. i'm all giddy, high on "reality bites" when a thought suddenly comes crashing down into my brain: "they're only 22! i am now older than vickie miner! how did this happen?" my 27-year-old self plummets back to earth, and is stuck here for the rest of the night, watching this wonderful movie that in a few more years she may no longer be able to relate to. sad. but i watch anyway. next scene shows troy leaving a girl's apartment, traci is her name. they only show tracy from the nose down because she's not important. but as i look at those pouty lips, i think to myself, "hey that looks like renee zellweger", and sure enough, the end credits tell me that it is. am i good or what?  i watch the rest of the movie in a daze. when it's over, i don't even remember watching most of it. i must have been thinking hard about something, yet i can't remember what it was. did i fall asleep? not possible. so what happened? where did i go? it wasn't back in time. i gotta retrace my steps. follow the breadcrumbs.

        Schoolboys   He was the first one in the room, -a boy of nineteen and i struck up a conversation. a few weeks later and he grated on my last nerve. then he disappeared. returned three weeks before the end; the fall was over and the first snow had struck the ground. told me i looked young but i held myself as someone older, more experienced, seen a lot. we parted for break on good terms, then found ourselves standing outside the same door come january. he asked if he could sit with me, i couldn't see why not. after a few conversations, -some outside, some over coffee we found that we fit somehow. confessed he'd never had a relationship and, in all honesty, couldn't really talk to girls. he would always choke, become tongue-tied and awkward. i pointed out he talked to me just fine -he just smiled. we pondered over books and music, shared family stories and histories for the next three months. the last day approached again, and this time it was difficult to leave each other behind. we wrapped our arms around each other and promised to call and then i walked away, waving over my shoulder.      Schoolboys, pt. 2   we had known of each other for years, but had never really talked, never even tried to. we always had some mutual friends and even some interests as well, but always seemed to be on opposite sides of every situation, until my last year there. we found ourselves on a stage together, playing husband and wife, actually for the second time. we found each other for lack of intelligent conversation surrounding us on those nights when only a few scenes were being rehearsed. the rest of our friends were at home, so we clung to each other for a nicotine friend and a caffeine fix. as months rolled by we had gotten a whole group together for our late-nite coffee ritual. we were all inseparable by the time the curtain went up, and he and i were joined at the hip. his girlfriend didn't like that very much, but i never really paid attention to that. i was too into him by then, cursing the fact i hadn't met him earlier. i guess we all watch opportunities stroll on by and live with passed regrets and old photos of those schoolboys long gone.    -A

      so i finally got my last tattoo for a while. it fuckin' hurt! i was sittin' in the chair for over 5 hours! and to top it all off, i'm gonna have to go back in a couple of weeks for a touch up because tammy missed a spot. there's a big ole patch of skin in the leaf of the newest one. you can probably see it in the pic. harry noticed it this morning and i must have spewed out every profanity i have learned in my 27 years on this earth. i thought i was DONE with the pain! i thought, cool, in two weeks i will have a finished product. but NOOOOOO! i guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, as bruce almighty says.  watched "50 first dates" again on friday. oh, how i adore that movie. not only is it so romantic, but it's in hawaii. how i miss that heavenly state. i want to go back. i want to move there. i want to win the powerball and spend the rest of my life on my beachfront property on maui sipping mai tai's all day, watching the sun set with my man, and going to a luau every night. wouldn't that be the life? some might get bored with that, but not me. all day just to lounge around and catch up on some reading. i could live with that.mmmmm...  also watched "big fish" last night, another great movie as well. harry and i went to go see that on valentine's day, not even realizing that it was a romantic movie. i don't normally connect tim burton flicks with terms of the heart, but this one definitely held mine captive for those two hours. what a beautiful story. we both cried. it was like living inside a dream. so if you haven't seen it yet, i strongly suggest you go to walmart and purchase it. under $20. can't beat that. forgo blockbuster video; this is one you want to own.  also picked up the 10 year anniversary version of "reality bites". may watch that this evening. 10 years! holy shit! it can't really be that long. i remember going to see that with heather allen the end of our junior year. that was the same night we decided to tool around stratford after the movie let out. of course we used to do that a lot but i remember this night because we bumped into jim decava, also tooling around with some friends, at a stop light in the green. i'm driving, smoking a cig, heather was smokin a cig too, something she only did with me. we look over while stopped at the light and there's a mini van with 5 guys in it. we spot decava and wave, even though i think he's vile and evil (hmmm...same letters), but heather says we should wave cuz rob is friends with him. all of a sudden we notice the video camera someone is holding directly behind him...video taping us. heather is so busted. caught on film smoking a cig. her boyfriend's gonna kill her. those were the things we used to worry about back then. i miss those days.

      Marilyn Manson put it like this:     The Beautiful People I don't want you and I don't need you don't bother to resist, I'll beat you It's not your fault that you're always wrong the weak ones are there to justify the strong  the beautiful people, the beautiful people it's all relative to the size of your steeple you can't see the forest for the trees you can't smell your own shit on your knees  Hey you, what do you see? something beautiful, something free? hey you, are you trying to be mean? if you live with apes man, it's hard to be clean  there's no time to discriminate, hate every motherfucker that's in your way the worms will live in every host it's hard to pick which one they eat most  the horrible people, the horrible people it's as anatomic as the size of your steeple capitalism has made it this way, old-fashioned fascism will take it away     kim asked me to put into words who the "beautiful people" are. we both use the term in the same way, but we both don't know exactly how to explain it to someone. it's not a compliment or an insult. it's somewhat of a stereotype or a clique. they can also be know as the "in crowd" or the "popular". to me, these are the people that seem to fall into shit.  "you can't smell your own shit on your knees."  they may have some bad luck, some unpleasant experiences, but even those have a happy ending. the final result is even better than the one they were hoping for. they don't necessarily have to be beautiful, but most of the time, they do have some kind of aesthetically pleasing quality the other sex simply cannot resist. they are magnets. other people want to be around them, to hang on their every word. they are the leaders, the herders with their own flock of sheep following. they have a "natural charm". all of their clouds have silver linings. they do not need to ooze intelligence; the basics are sufficient. they do not wax philosophic to make the crowds gather; they simply need to open their mouths. my point is: they don't have to try. there is no effort involved in making friends or picking someone up. it just magically happens. no reason for it really; it simply is. it's like breathing for them. it's an involuntary reaction to stimuli around them.   at times, we envy the life they lead. it seems so easy. we question why we complicate our lives with questions  LIKE  "why?" why can't we just accept things the way they are? why do we need to improve anything? why is there never enough time? why did he say that? why didn't i know that? why, why, why?   i would like to know some other opinions on the beautiful people. i know that my definition is not really sufficient enough. it is merely a beginning. see, i need to improve it. i need to make it bigger, better, stronger, faster. so help me out. comments?

       urlLink    is she a gangsta nun now?&nbsp; urlLink      lea found the police log i was talking about. here it is. the age of the woman is different, but how many amy sciuto's live in stratford?     DOMESTIC STABBING: A woman was arrested Monday morning after reportedly stabbing her boyfriend in the arm during a domestic dispute at a Stratford apartment.  Amy Sciuto, 23, of Huntington Road, Stratford, was charged with disorderly conduct, second-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, risk of injury to a minor and several drug charges.  Stratford officers were summoned to Waterbury Hospital on reports Sciuto had stabbed her 26-year-old live-in boyfriend in the arm.  When police went to interview Sciuto at her home, she initially denied the allegation, claiming he had cut himself. She later told officers she tried to hit the victim, but he struck first. They then rolled around on the kitchen floor, police said.  During a search of the apartment, officers found a bloody towel in the laundry room, reports said. Police said a small amount of marijuana was found in Sciuto's purse. Sciuto was held in lieu of $100,000 bond for an appearance in Bridgeport Superior Court.

      chris called me yesterday to tell me some interesting and unbelievable news about someone we went to school with. he called rob yesterday to wish him a happy birthday, and rob told him that his mom had been reading the police blotter and saw a familiar name in it. now, this is nothing unusual for me. i read the blotter weekly, and about once a month, i know somebody in it. there were actually two in this last month. but anyway, i digress. this person was someone that i was actually friends with when we were much younger. we had a falling out, although she never really seemed to realize. she would still talk to me from time to time. i would be polite, but not lavishly friendly. after high school, i lost all contact with her until i started hanging out with her then boyfriend. she then started calling me all the time to talk about him. when they split up, she called, and i guess i said something to the effect of "i don't really want to listen to you talk shit about him because he is a friend of mine." she never called again. a few years later she resurfaced... as a Jesus freak. literally. the next step was to become a nun. she told me she finally had to break up with the current boyfriend because she felt unclean kissing him. ok, sure. whatever. i'm thinking she's got a few screws loose. at one point at an emmaus meeting (it's a religious retreat for teenagers, for those of you that don't know) she announced to everyone that she hoped we would all one day find God as she has found God, but until then, she will pray for all of our souls. definitely a few screws loose. so i stayed away from her. she used to piss me off anyway.  so now i get to the police blotter. i did some searching last night and came up with nothing, but because it comes from a reliable source, i will divulge what i have been told. according to the report, this woman has been arrested and held for $100,000 bond for stabbing her boyfriend. that's right, the would-be nun supposedly stabbed her boyfriend. i was shocked. i was speechless. it must be some kind of mistake. they must have the wrong person. but maybe it is her. maybe she has done a complete 180 and has become a gangsta bitch. or maybe she pulled a carrie's mom and was trying to excorcise the demons. who knows? it still doesn't seem logical. and i feel sorry for her. strange. i don't even like her, but because i know her, i can't believe she would do such a thing. i feel sorry for her parents, who i know and like. what must they be going through. and of course the boyfriend. is he someone i know? is he ok? it just seems like a terrible nightmare. this kind of thing doesn't happen in my middle suburbia. sure, i know women who ARE completely insane and should be locked up (jen), but yet they roam free, reeking havoc wherever they go. what is the world coming to?

      so i'm awaiting the arrival of stephen king's 6th book in the dark tower series. i ordered it a few days ago, so it should be here sometime in the next week. i am a stephen king junkie; i'll admit it. i have read nearly all of his books. i even purchased his e-story, riding the bullet, but i never got a chance to read it because i didn't know you couldn't print it out. i can't read anything on the computer for a long period of time. my eyes get all wiggy. one day, i'll find out what it's about.  i absolutely love to read. i spend my dinner break and my two 10-minute breaks at work reading. i have three huge bookcases full of books at home, and i would own even more if i had the room for it. my house would be a library if my husband didn't put his foot down. i can't help it. i'm somewhat obsessed. same thing with cd's. and dvd's. and picture frames. and photo albums. i have more than i know what to do with. at least harry shares the dvd obsession with me.   but books are my main passion. all kinds of books. except romance novels. can't stand those. and i'm not too much into mysteries, although i will read them if someone recommends one. i just finished a collection of H.P. Lovecraft, which was very good. i got into his work while i was still in high school. before that, i read some sylvia plath ("johnny panic and the bible of dreams"). it was a collection of short stories, essays, and journal entries. good stuff. before that, a collection of shirley jackson's short stories, also excellent. and i also had the unfortunate displeasure of reading nick hornby's "how to be good". now i am a nick hornby fan. i like his work, his style, his stories. but this book blew the big one. i went on a huge rant about this book to jessica a few weeks ago. terrible book. i don't recommend it. do not read it. do not waste your money. yeah, that bad.  an author i would recommend is jane green. if you are into the bridget jones variety of reading, jane green is the way to go. her style is different from helen fieldings, but her stories are as wacky and original. i started with "bookends" which i absolutely adored. i've also read "jemima j", "mr. maybe","babyville", and "straight talking". all are excellent. she has a new one that just came out that i will have to pick up in the next month, as does helen fielding. melissa bank is also good, as is mary karr, anna maxted, megan mccafferty, and laurie halse anderson.   then there is, of course, virginia woolf (and i include "the hours" in that because "mrs. dalloway" was it's muse), aniis nin, henry miller, jack kerouac, john updike, sylvia plath and shirley jackson, as i already stated, sandra cisneros, and on and on and on.   then of course is more of my sci-fi/fantasy fixation. the harry potter series rocks. so does "the lord of the rings" and "the hobbit". peter straub is wonderful. madeleine l'engle, william shatner's star trek stuff (yes, i am a bit of a trekkie), and of course, stephen king. i also like some comic book stuff, mostly graphic novels. james o'barr's "the crow" kicks ass. i love "kingdom come", "the dark knight returns", "batman: year one", "death", and "the watchmen". i love the novels "kingdom come" and "the death and life of superman". am i beginning to bore you all? ok, i'll stop.

      kim is probably just reaching tennessee now. she and adrienne left yesterday afternoon and were driving straight through to manchester, tennessee for the annual bonnaroo camping and concert event. i so wanted to go! alas, i could not take the time off of work (and frankly, i don't know if i could sit in a car for a  straight 15 hour stretch to places unknown). but i am still so jealous. they have a great lineup this year, including ani difranco, beth orton, guster, dave matthews and friends, and the dead. not to mention steve winwood (who is taking willie nelson's place due to carpal tunnel), wilco, maroon 5, bob dylan (whom i'm not really into although he is a fantastic songwriter), and trey anastasio (blah).3 days of hippie wonder. woo hoo. 3 days of people not showering. oh. don't miss that.   i myself have been singing thank God it friday since yesterday. this week has been to damn long, and i am fed up with work. i've been bitching a lot about work lately. i used to like my job. really, i did. i really thought that i could keep doing this until harry and i had kids, and maybe even after that part time. i have an interesting job. i work at Environmental Data Resources as a historical researcher. "what exactly do you do?" is usually the question people ask me when i tell them my job position. so i will explain for the umpteeth time, just so everybody knows. my company supplies environmental information to the commercial property division of real estate and to other environmental companies throughout the united states. we are soon going to be expanding to all types of real estate, including residential. what we do is go through our data bases and give them all kinds of info.  i myself work in the Sanborn Map Dept. i research maps throughout the years, a span from 1867-1996. these maps show actual streets in many towns and cities in the u.s. they show all of the places of business on each street in each town. take manhattan for instance. we can supply about 20 maps of a two block radius anywhere in manhattan. these maps will show each residential apartment building, each store, each metal shop, each gas station, etc. it's really quite interesting to see how much an area has changed in a span of 100 years. when you look up my house on our maps, it shows that there is nothing there because the most recent maps we have of stratford are from 1968, and my house wasn't built until 1977.   so i have a pretty interesting job. it's the structure of the company i don't like. we recently moved to a new building, and since then, everything has changed. we were a very laid back company before the move. they warned us that they would be changing some things once we got into the new building, and we thought we were ready for it. we were wrong. it is an entirely different company, extremely anal and nitpicky, trying to weed out the undesirables by making the workplace uncomfortable. it's a sad downfall, in my opinion. why make all of your employees miserable just to get rid of a few idiots? they don't want to fire them because then they have to pay them unemployment. if they quit, they get shit. that's how shady my company is. every week, there are new amendments to the dress code, some being extremely ridiculous. case in point: we are not allowed to wear flip flops (or thong sandals for those of you who don't know what flip flops are) or berkenstok type sandals. ok, we won't wear them. we now got an amendment stating that we are not allowed to wear any shoe that sounds like a flip flop. what! almost all of my shoes sound like that. most of the women in the office have the same problem. so we just keep wearing them. i don't have the time or the money to go out and get a whole new wardrobe for work. we can't wear jeans, capris, carpenters, cargos, or painters monday through thursday. on friday, we can wear all of the above except painters. why? i have no idea. weird shit like that. supposedly someone got fired a few weeks ago for not following the dress code. yeah, ok. is that really cause for dismissal?   ok, i think i'm done bitching. i have the tv on in the background right now, and they are televising ronald reagan's funeral. there are tens of thousands of people there. i just saw nancy reagan go up to the casket to say goodbye, and my heart broke for her. they were married for 52 years. how sad for their last few years together to have the black cloud of alzheimer's hanging over their heads. i grew up during the reagan era. as a child i didn't know the difference between democrats and republicans and their views, etc, so i remember revering reagan. he was our president. we should be proud. living during part of the cold war, i remember reagan taking those first steps with gorbacev. i remember soon after his presidency the berlin wall coming down. i remember his speech after the challenger explosion. we were taught that he was a wonderful president and that we should believe in him because we were americans and we got to vote for our president. there were many countries who didn't get to vote. they had a dictator, who took the reigns by force. so we should be glad and rejoice that we get to pick our wonderful leaders in this country. this is what i remember about the reagan era. were the teachers trying to make themselves believe all the crap they fed us? i'm not really speaking about reagan, but about the two bush men we have had in office. should we be proud? they seem to have broken more than they have fixed. should we be grateful for all they have done? reagan managed to help end the cold war. for that, i am grateful. bush and bush have stuck us in wars we have no business fighting. but i digress. today is not about father and son bush; today is about a president i did respect, and about his wife, whom i also respected. i will pray for them and their family.

      last night before going to sleep, i had all these thoughts racing through my mind. this happens to me often and is the partial cause of the battle i have with insomnia. i also used to drink about 6 cups of coffee before trying to go to sleep, so you can imagine how easy it was to drift off. i don't drink that much coffee anymore, so it only take me about an hour to fall asleep. that is a vast improvement and i will take it.  so anyway, aside from the usual crap that litters my brain at night, like how much i have been hating my job lately, how much i love being married, the frustration of still not being able to conceive (i'm sure i'll delve into this subject a little more at a later date), i started thinking about those nights i used to drink 6 cups of coffee, and the people i used to share those pots of coffee with. my little group consisted of me and 3 or 4 other guys, depending on whether mike joined us. we probably spent as much time together in a week as we did working, me even more so because i only worked 30 hours a week. this was pre-full-time-job and more-responsible alicia. this was the alicia that would have called in sick if the guys wanted to go to the arcade that day. i was very close to all of them in very different ways.   i knew kev the longest. it's been 15 years now. he was my confidant. we had a lot of fun together, even though i used to piss him off to no end. kev was like a big brother. i remember having a very difficult time getting through that month or two that he was in the navy. he was discharged shortly after he had left us, and i remember feeling guilty when i got his letter stating that he was going to be coming home because i had been praying that there would be some kind of reason to get him out of all this and get him back home. we spent a lot of time together after that. he was at our house nearly every night after that.   i was married to chris for a short time. we started dating in high school, went off to college together, and got married a couple of years into it. we were way too young and too inexperienced in relationships to have possibly made a go of a marriage. we hadn't lived yet. we weren't adults yet. we didn't know who we were. all of a sudden, i realized that i knew absolutely nothing and that we had probably made a mistake. we had a very amicable divorce, and are still now very good friends. it didn't ruin our lives, like i thought it would, but it has made us stronger people and has taught us something as well. people are allowed to make mistakes. that's part of life. it's learning from them that is the most difficult part.  i fell for tom at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons. i became totally obsessed with him and nearly drove him mad. i did manage to drive myself mad. i still feel terrible sometimes for all that i put him through, and all that i put kevin through at that time as well, since he was the one who had to pick up some of the pieces. i was a mess, no doubt about it. there were times when i wasn't in my right mind and felt that i wasn't even controlling my life. i was drunk for a good year or two. i said things that had no right to be said aloud. i demanded things that he couldn't give me. i hurt a lot of people with my irrational actions and disgusting displays. i still get embarrassed about most of it and i usually don't talk about it.   after that, i decided to take control of my life. i started dating a little. realized i didn't really like it. i also realized that i was more interested in just having sex, not a relationship. so that's what i did. i slept around. not a lot, but enough for people to start talking. i slept with mostly friends or friends of friends. mike showed up in that category. we were out drinking one night, started talking about sexual experiences, and then started discussing whether or not we might share a night together. while sitting there in silence, finishing our drinks, "why don't we get drunk and screw" came on the juke, so we did. it didn't hurt our friendship; we actually became better friends after the fact. we decided not to tell anyone about it at the time. it was just between the two of us (well, we told a few outside friends just because we had to tell somebody). it's been years since it happened and i figured there's no harm in talking about it now. i told my husband about it when we first started dating because we had told each other that if we ran into anyone we had slept with, we would let the other know.  so the group eventually broke up. two of us are now married, two are living with girlfriends, and mike is still a player. kev, chris, and tom all moved to north haven, and they get together every so often. i started hanging around with kim, and she introduced me to harry. i still feel to blame for all of us not hanging out anymore, but like harry said in "when harry met sally"..."a man and a woman cannot be friends because the sex thing gets in the way" (or something like that - i suck at quotes). when i first saw that movie, i didn't believe that statement. i thought it was a very male chauvanistic thing to say. i was young and naive (evian spelled backwards - it's the only way i can remember how to spell it).   so that's my story...  it doesn't upset me so much anymore. i have moved on and so have they. occasionally they pop into my head, so i think about them for a bit. then i put them away until next time. it's like looking at old pictures. you can't throw them out. they are a part of you.

      i am still sick. what is the deal? on sunday, i thought i was getting better, but i seem to have relapsed. i cough, i sniffle, my eyes water. and i get to go to work!   anyway, tattoo number seven is here! i got it on saturday. next saturday, i'm getting my original faery tattoo colored, and then that will be it for awhile. i ain't got any more cash! but they are so worth it! Tammy at Sleepy Hollow Tattoo did a kick ass job. if anybody is interested in seeing some of Sleepy Hollow's stuff, there new web site is http://www.sleepyhollowtattoo.8m.com/. they are located in milford, ct and they rock!   harry survived his first sitting on saturday like a trooper. brandon couldn't finish cuz he started bleeding, so he's coming back with me to get it all done. he's not sure if he'll get another one, but he likes the one he's got. the detail is amazing. i will have to post a pic of his once it's done.   nothing has been going on so i haven't really had anything to write about. i will say that harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was amazing. very dark and sinister. did the book justice. possibly a little bit too scary for any child under the age of 10. gary oldman is the shit! he is one of the most versatile actors around nowadays. the kids are growing up. Rupert is such a little cutie. his hair's all long and wild now. i'm sure he's already a little heartbreaker. i'm wondering when the next book is coming out.  the newest installment of Stephen King's Dark Tower series is coming out...i think today. i gotta check and see so i can order.   i just reread mark waid and alex ross's kingdom come. if you have never read this graphic novel, go out and get it. the story is fantastic and i can't even begin to tell you about alex ross's artwork. it's like no other i have ever seen. you can't even begin to put it into words. people were once blown away by thomas blake's lithograph pieces. people of today are blown away by ross's work in the same manner. it's a whole new level of comic book art. there was also a novel put out by mark waid that really went into all the details of the story. i would also recommend that.   i could write about books all day, but alas i must be off to work soon. i will write more later.

      i took the day off, purchased a new computer, saw harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban, set up the new computer, and cooked dinner for my husband and mother. not too bad for this poor-old-girl living on dimetapp and dayQuil. i really was sick today so i don't feel guilty for calling in. not one bit.

      money hardly gets to make itself at home in my bank account before it is shoved off to its new destination. i wish it would want to hang out with me sometimes as opposed to the southern connecticut gas company. what does it have that i don't have? money's got plenty of space in my account to stretch its legs, have some privacy, go swimming in the coins like scrooge macduck. i would take good care of it. but alas, money does not want to go steady with me. it likes to recirculate. money is nothing but a bank whore.

      i am sick. i hate being sick. i will give my father the evil eye the next time i see him because he is the reason i am sick. damn him for not having enough chairs for me and my peeps to sit on during his crappy ass memorial day picnic. standing out in the chilly air and rain = scratchy throat for alicia. i am not happy and have therefore de-evolved with my vocabulary. can now only stutter out one and two syllable words (well, except for the words syllable and vocabulary). me go to sleep soon. no want to be grumpy no more. want to hide under covers until next tuesday.

      we're getting new furniture tomorrow, the highlight of our weekend. when did bed rails and nightstands get so exciting? maybe it's because i've had the same bedroom furniture for the passed 15 years, and my parents had it 15 years before that. of course, we couldn't just trash it. all that history! actually, it's still in really good condition, so my niece now has it. maybe it'll go for another 15 years, maybe 30. who knows. they built them to last in the 60's and 70's. not like today where you have to go out and buy new pieces every five years because they simply decide to collapse in on themselves one day. it's a sad, sad world. sometimes i wonder if we should bite the bullet and go to ethan allen and buy some $5000 monstrosity furniture. sure it's big and beautiful and should last years and years and years (probably longer than 2 or 3 sets of the one i just purchased so we'd actually be saving money in the long run), but i get so nervous about spending that much money all at one time. $2000 we can afford. $5000 is a third of what we owe on the subaru. and in all honesty, i don't know if $5000 would cover all the pieces we have purchased a la ethan allen. it would be more like $8000. definitely can't do that. that's more than 2 months net salary for both me and harry combined. we would starve. they would turn off our electricity, and then i couldn't blog anymore, so i couldn't possibly do it. heh heh.  today is cartoon planet day! actually every friday is cartoon planet day, unless my workweek ends on a thursday, and then that's cartoon planet day. i decided this the beginning of this month. on the first friday of july, i took out my cd of cartoon planet, and played it about and hour and a half before the end of my work evening. well, let me tell you, i laughed my ass off, and went home with a big fuckin' grin covering my face, the ear to ear kind. that's the good stuff. if you've never heard of cartoon planet, shame on you! here are some links. there's the  urlLink all hail brak  page,  urlLink brak's new year's resolutions , and&nbsp; urlLink ghost planet . have fun, kiddies. and if you like that, go onto  urlLink amazon.com  and you can purchase the cd's. i highly recommend them.

      so today, three years to the date, is the day that changed harry's and my life. you guessed it, the day we hooked up. i remember a couple of months later, when we were starting to get serious, sitting in a bar and harry asking me exactly what day it was that we hooked up. i had to admit i had absolutely no idea. then it dawned on me that we had hooked up in between two concerts i had seen, bnl and dave matthews band. they were only a week and a half apart, and i remembered that we hooked up on a sunday cuz we both called into work the next morning. hence, july 29th. most women seem to know shit like that; i used to be one of those women. the year of 2001 seemed to change that.   so it's only been three years! harry and i were talking about it yesterday, and he said it feels more like a decade, but not in a bad way. i concur. how have we fit all of the things we have shared and experienced together in a measly three years? it doesn't seem possible.   as i have said before, we did things differently. we hooked up first, became friends later. we would get together on the weekends at my place for our little sexual escapades, and then hang out once or twice a week at his place to do just that, hang out. no sex involved. we got to know each other drinkin' a couple of beers and sharin' a pizza. ah, true love. but it worked for us. we had two completely different relationships, and they only started to mesh into one when we decided to be exclusive.   we've learned so much about each other these passed few years, but there are times that i think that harry really doesn't know who i used to be. no matter how much i explain or describe past events, i can't seem to convey the person i used to be before i met him. it's one of those  you had to be there  things. i've told him about my "mental instabilities" as a teenager and through my early 20's, but he doesn't really   know  . mostly, it's because i'm not like that anymore, so he can't imagine me being the psycho i once was:) i also think it's because no guy wants to believe that his girl was once a major wack-job. if that were the case, they could always revert back to that behavior. whatever the case, harry is perfectly happy with the girl he's got, so there's no point in letting the past spoil that. we both agree that pasts are just that; they've already happened and there's no way to change that.  so here we are, married for almost 6 months, looking back on that first night together. fondly. a smile playing on our lips.

      i am such a sad specimen. i see other people's blogs, all trendy and such, with such cool stuff in the margins to click on, and here i sit, html illiterate. it took me a half an hour just to figure out how to get the counter on my site. so sad. even sadder, i'll have to get my niece to come over here and help me add to the blog since she is a self-proclaimed html queen. i'm getting too old to learn new things. this can't be happening. even more so, i'm afraid of screwing up my blog. i can't believe how attached i've gotten to it in just a few short months. it's like a love affair, to be honest. i don't think i can live without it anymore.   i know people get tired of writers who write about writing, but that's never stopped me before, and i actually like reading pieces on writing. how else can you express how you're feeling while the words pop into your head and land on the computer screen. people can guess how you feel, but they can never really know unless you tell them outright. then again, maybe they don't want to know; maybe they're just satisfied with the piece as it is. i am not one of those people. if i could crawl inside your brain and travel throughout, learning all your secrets and passions, i would do it.   to me, writing is an extension, an appendage, like an arm. you could live without it, as i have in the past, but it will always be there in phantom form, haunting you from time to time. occasionally, there is a pain where it once was. the pain is real, even if the writing is no longer there. tell me, if you had a chance to grow a new arm after living a few years without one, would you? of course you would. hence, my blog.   i read other people's writing, and i see what they have been through, and i wonder if i could survive some of the things they have. i've had my fair share, but they have been different hardships. and i barely made it through some of them. as they say, God gives you what you can handle. that's why your hardships are yours. sometimes i wonder if the suicidals were given the wrong hardships, due to misfiling or incorrect spelling, and that's why they didn't make it. when they get to the gates, are they let in due to syntax error?

      the family reunion was interesting. somewhat tedious and boring, to be honest. and the strangest part (also the interesting part) is that i swear my cousin was hitting on me. my niece and harry both noticed it. creeped me out big time. i faked a headache so i could leave. what is the matter with people? not only is he married with two kids, but we're blood, for christ's sake.

      i have been baking for hours! what the hell is wrong with me? it's way too fucking hot for this. nobody is worth entering the hellish inferno my kitchen has become. i'm ready to crawl into the fridge.   i've had liz phair stuck in my head all day. that's what i get for listening to  exile in guyville  first thing in the morning. i must say that i find it rather interesting that that album still seems to affect me in the same way it did years ago. i once again feel single, alone, and unloved, three of my  favorite  emotions (and yes, single is, in fact, an emotion). how can my heart still ache while listening to these songs? have i become pavlov's dog, tearing up the moment i hear  divorce song ? why do i smell corduroy as i listen to  fuck and run ? that's simply not fair. nobody should have to live years of an unhappy existence because of a 60 minute CD. is there no justice in the world?     And when I asked for a separate room    It was late at night

        the difference between     &nbsp;  we're not so different   with hearts and hands   and smiles and scents,   yet our senses conflict   -you, afflicted with a dick   but if we prick our fingers,   do we not both bleed?   still, the blood i shed   from a different wound,   a slit, a clit,   a gaping rip in my very existence,   is thick with emotion   and unwanted flesh   that i must expell   from my building each month.   we are made of the same brick,   the same stones,   yet i roam on heels   while you walk on water,   and jack off on your altar,   with pictures strewn about,   unclothed and uncensored.   and i sit sore   from your entrances,   spewing your juices at me   with no patience.   i dress in the dark,   trying to cover my ass   before you take another piece.   i&nbsp;drive home in the rain   as you sleep off your hangover,   and i scald you off   in the shower   before i go to dream.    &nbsp;  -A    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  i have no idea what happened to me on the day that i wrote this, but i must have been pretty peeved at somebody. don't even remember who.     &nbsp;  Here's another one...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Sour       &nbsp;  i don't want to be   one of your sad, sad stories   a few miles down the road.   a tale of love turned bad,   used after the expiration date.   i am not a piece of meat   you threw on your fires,   turning me over   to turn me on.   i am not a sour girl   because you didn't have   the time to love me   -it's just that you left   a bad taste in my mouth.    &nbsp;  -A    &nbsp;  that one actually cracks me up. the thing about the expiration date has me rolling.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ooohh, i like this one. gruesome and gut-wrenching.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Strong Stuff     i built a bridge   out of my flesh   to get to you   -over the ocean   of swelling emotions   we carried on our backs.   bone by bone,   i picked myself apart   and bound it all together   with the veins of my heart,   knowing it would be safe   to cross.   i am made of strong stuff,   and i can hold my own.    &nbsp;  -A

       MY 100th ENTRY! YEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    &nbsp;  these are the kinds of things i look forward to. &nbsp;like seeing the odometer hit 12,345 or the one time i got to see it hit 100,000. what a treat. it's life's little pleasures that mean so much. "the moment your laughter becomes a cackle."     &nbsp;  i started reading  ERAGON  by Christopher Paolini. so far, it is unbelievable and i&nbsp;highly recommend it. i will admit, what first attracted me to the book was the author. i read a small blurb about him, and decided i had to read the book out of mere curiosity. Paolini graduated from high school at age 15, and immediately started to write this book afterwards. his family helped him to self-publish, and by the age of 17, the book was out. now at age 19, he has sold tens of thousands of copies of this book, and the numbers keep rising. he is #3 on the New York Times best-sellers list for children's chapter books. this would put his right up there with  Harry Potter,  and this is where he belongs. the book has a  Lord of the Rings  meets  Harry Potter  kind of feel to it. The author is extremely talented, and i was happy to find out that this book will in fact be part of a trilogy, the next installment due out next year. i always root for the young writer; they usually don't get the credit they deserve. it has been rumored that this guy may actually surpass Tolkien's legacy with this trilogy. and why not; it is a new century.    &nbsp;

        back to the beach  is on cable this morning. as corny as it is, i absolutely love this movie. i've seen it at least a hundred times. it's like a car crash; you can't look away.     &nbsp;   i've sunk to a new low. i actually considered going into&nbsp;the office&nbsp;a little early today to help get some of the work done. since chris got fired last week, and so many people have been on vacation, we've fallen a little behind. then i realized that if i went in and did the work, the higher powers that be would think that we could handle all this work understaffed. can't let that happen. we've lost 3 employees in the passed 2 months, 1 fired and 2 to different departments. we've all been busting our asses to get everything out on time bacause if we don't, our paychecks get docked. it's all a bunch of bullshit. i'm sick of it.     &nbsp;   to make matters worse, the mayor of milford and the higher powers that be are going to be at the office today for an official ribbon cutting ceremony. to me, this whole thing is inane. we don't own the building; in fact we share it with numerous other companies. so what exactly are we inaugurating into the city of milford? the stupid tombstone-like sign that says "EDR" on it in front of the building? who's idea was that thing, anyway? everyday i drive into the parking lot, i feel like i should mourn our company's passing or something.     &nbsp;   so, we have been told that we are not to wear "dress t-shirts" to work today. whatever. i hate bitching about work. actually i like bitching about it, as you can tell; i just hate thinking about it. i need to win the powerball so i can open up my coffee shop/ book shop. i would call it "caffeine dreams" or "bookends", something like that. i haven't decided yet. maybe "coffee talk". i haven't thought up the fine details yet. but it will happen. one day. of course, if we did win the powerball, we probably wouldn't be opening the coffee shop here. we'd probably move to hawaii or arizona or florida, or buy homes in all three places. who knows. i'm keepin my fingers crossed.

        ah, the beginning of&nbsp;a new week. to me, it's all the same. monday through friday, i have no life. it's just work. i get about an hour and a half in the morning to do my own thing, and then the rest of my day belongs to EDR. why did i want to become an adult so badly?  &nbsp;  my family reunion is coming up this weekend. we had the first reunion about 2 years ago, and we all had a great time. it's not my entire family; just the Webb side, my mother's father's side. i never got to meet my grandfather; he passed away before i was born. but i am very close to that side of the family, as close as i can be living 300 miles away from any of them. they are a lovely group of people, especially my aunt pauline and cousin linda. i used to love going on our yearly trips to maine just so i could see them. most kids don't like going to visit family for a vacation, but i thought it was wonderful. i remember wishing they lived closer so i could see them every day.  &nbsp;  the reunion is going to be a little smaller this year; not as many people are coming. i was a little disappointed when i found out, but atleast we're still having it. there are a&nbsp;few people in my family that have taken ill as of late, two in particular, that i would like to see. one is coming, one is not. my cousin, michael, will be here with his wife and two kids. growing up, michael had some health problems. he was allergic to over 100 different things, for one. they couldn't pinpoint what were causing some of his other health problems until he was an adult. they then found a tumor on his pituitary&nbsp; gland, and it was inoperable. since then, he has been on numerous types of medication and his body has taken a beating. last time he was here, he was in a wheelchair. his hip was basically disintegrating. he was considering hip surgery, and then all of a sudden, things got better. harry and i went to visit last year on our trip to maine, and we were amazed to see michael not only walking but RUNNING around. since then, my mom has told me that his health has started to deteriorate once again.  &nbsp;  my other cousin, vincent, will not be coming to the reunion. i haven't seen him in almost 15 years. i would like to see him. he isn't doing that well right now. a few months ago, he was rushed to the hospital with abdominal pain. they immediately operated on him and removed a large part of his small intestine. seems that a portion of it had completely rotted away (gross, i know). a few days after the surgery, he got even worse. they brought a priest in to perform last rites. a few hours later, my aunt walked into the hospital wing and the nurse ran to her to tell her she needed to get to vincent's hospital room right away. she thought he was on the verge of passing. instead, she walked in to find him sitting up in bed, watching tv. he was feeling better. he then went through weeks of "healing" only to find out that the surgery was not successful and it would have to be done again. he has now gone through a second surgery and is in recovery. it's still touch and go, so we've all been praying for him. the sad part is, the doctor's are not even sure what caused it all in the first place. vincent is obese, weighing almost 400 pounds, but they say that did not cause this to happen. i think that's the scariest part; there seems to be no catalyst for the whole episode. so there's no telling if he'll get better.  &nbsp;  my family is important to me, although my immediate family drives me up the wall most of the time. i am happy that we have been able to set up these reunions from time to time. next year, we're going to have one up in maine. and about a year and a half after that one, we're going to have one down in florida. that way the same people don't always have to be travelling to get there. i'm looking forward to it.

        i have not eaten anything all day, and we just came back from the pub. after a few beers, i am definitely toasty. it feels good, like walking through a time warp. this is what it felt like nearly every day of 2000 and 2001. sad but true. and honestly, it doesn't feel all that bad. it's nice to let go of all your cares, all the stress for a little while.     &nbsp;   we have the munchkin tonight. she'll be here in a little while. i need to sober up a little before she gets here. i don't believe in mixing alcohol with babysitting. big no no in my book. she just came back from cape cod yesterday and proceeded to talk about her trip last night for over an hour. all the food she ate and all the stuff she bought. and an elton john song came on the radio and she and kate got to sing "the bitch is back" and it was ok to say bitch because it was part of the song so they were singing it and not really saying it. and did i know that there were gay people in cape cod? yes, there are. she and kate saw two boys holding hands on the trolley. how does kaylee know what gay people are? because i told her. while watching the simpson's last year, homer was staying with a gay couple, so kaylee asks what gay means. i tell her it's when a boy likes a boy and a girl likes a girl. then she hears the word bisexual and asks what that means. i tell her it's when a person likes both boys and girls. i'm telling becky this story last night, and before i can tell her what i told kaylee a bisexual was, she says, "it's being greedy," which really cracked me up.&nbsp;      &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      i was balancing my checkbook this morning and noticed that the check for one of the car payments has not gone through yet. woe is me. where did it go? i mailed it out with the other car payment and that check was cashed 5 days ago. this payment is due on the 17th. what do i do? i'll give it one more day and then give them a ring. this is only the third payment we've made on this car. there is no way i'm getting slapped with a late payment fee or a hike in the apr. damn snail mail, what have you done?  i have become an x-files fanatic once again. last year, i purchased the first 7 seasons of mulder and scully on DVD off of ebay for the wonderful price of $148. harry and i slowly started watching from the beginning over the course of this passed year. we are now on season 4, but i think we have watched about 20 episodes in the passed week. i can't get enough of it. i need my fix. every night when i get home from work, all i want to do is sit and watch the conspiracies fly. "BUCKLE UP... IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE ALIENS TO SNATCH YOU FROM YOUR CAR."

      i was reading another woman's blog yesterday, and she had been writing about what's been going on in the world, the war in iraq, bush, etc. i'm not really a political person. i don't keep up to date with what's going on. hell, i had to stop watching the 10 o'clock news because it was depressing me. but election time is coming around, so i'd better start paying attention.  she had recently seen two political documentaries,  Control Room  and  Fahrenheit 9/11 . i won't get into details of what they were about, although i'm sure most of you know what 9/11 is about. what really got my attention was what she had to say about priviledge. we as americans have certain priviledges, certain lifestyles. we, as americans, take these priviledges for granted, feel that we deserve them, are entitled to them. what we don't seem to realize is that "priviledge comes at a cost to someone else." this is a thought that has popped into my head from time to time. i always seem to be hoping for something better for myself, something more than i already have. that is the american way. i co-own a home with my sister, but i want a home of my own. we have two new cars (which yes, we work to pay for, but which i sometimes feel guilty for having). i have clothes, i have food, i have shelter. hell, i have over 500 CD's and 200 DVD's. if that's not priviledge, i don't know what is. again, we do go to work for the money we use to buy all of the frivolity, but sometimes i wonder if that really makes it all right. most of the time, i push these thoughts aside because i wish to keep my selfishness. and i think that i will go stark raving mad if i kept thinking about it. it would completely consume me. i would become like the religious fanatics (which at one time, i may have actually become...thank God for alcohol and one night stands...yes, i know i'm terrible). i would become so angry that the anger would rule my entire life. i would want to purify my life, getting rid of all the fluff. at some point, i think i would go completely insane. i would be living on the streets, mumbling to myself, screaming at the heavens to do something about this mess.   so i don't think about it for too long. i am comfortable where i am. it's times like these that i am grateful for the 9 to 5 (or in my case 12 to 8:30) lifestyle i have. i am happy for the two car payments i make each month. it makes me feel a little more entitled to the things i have.  but that doesn't mean i'm going to keep a blind eye to what's going on out there. it's time i started listening. it's time i started to understand more. i have decided that i will be voting in this coming election. i will watch the debates for the next few months. i will start watching the news again. i need more information. i need to know. i need to see if i can really make any difference.

      i've been slackin with the blog lately. it's just that nothin's going on.   i am excited about the concert tomorrow night. i haven't been to one in a while. guster and ben folds, can't beat that. i've been preppin myelf all week, listening to all of their cd's. gotta be on the top of my game, have to be able to sing along. i'm gonna go bullistic during  airport song . heh heh.  this week went by so quickly. i say we petition the national government and make each workweek a mandatory 4 day work week. it's so much more pleasant that way. i would even be willing to work 10 hours a day to still make it to 40. can you imagine having to work tuesday through friday only? what a gift that would be.  just finished jane green's new book,  to have and to hold . it was excellent, of course. it actually took place in connecticut. i know green lives outside of new york city, but it sounds like she actually lives somewhere here in the constitution state. she made up a town called highfield, somewhere near wilton. she called the area "the country". that makes me laugh. of course, there are areas of connecticut that are country, like durham, but that's in the center of the state. when i think of wilton, i definitely don't think of women with dirt under their nails and timberlands on their feet. but i suppose there might be an area out there with cute little cottages. if there is, i want to find it and move there.  jessica's birthday is tomorrow. i wish i could be out in l.a. right now. it seems like i never want to be here anymore. i dream of homes in hawaii or florida, arizona, new mexico, texas, anywhere but here. i think it has more to do with the family as opposed to new england. new england is a wonderful, beautiful area to live in. jess and i were just talking about that a couple of weeks ago. there is no where else around with these big, beautiful trees and natural growing wildflowers on the side of the road. that's why i told her that this opportunity to move to brooklyn would be great for her. close enough to visit, far enough away to not have to see the fam all the time. i wish i had that luxury.

      ok,  urlLink jen  has brought it to everybody's attention that if you type in the url to our blogs, but take the s out of "blogspot" (ie:  urlLink www.theevilfaerie.blogpot.com ), it takes you to this religious site, Aaron's something or other. she did some research and found a blog entry from someone else which this has also happened to. hers does it as well, and when i checked mine, low and behold, Jesus was staring back at me. i've got nothing against religious web pages, but i choose not to go to them, and i find it extremely "unholy" that they would steal and covet thy neighbors goods in such a fashion. what kind of religious people are these exactly? do they wear eye patches and have a peg leg, a talking parrot sitting upon their shoulder? i'm actually offended by the whole scandalous thing. i contacted blogger about it, and you can too, if you're as pissed off as i am. let them know what's going on. if enough people tell them, maybe they can do something about it. maybe there's some kind of quota they must meet before they can report it, like 100 people need to complain about it or something. so let's all join forces and rid the world of Aaron and his clan of followers. it's people like that that give Jesus freaks a bad name.

      did you know that one serving of coffeemate hazelnut non-dairy creamer (40 calories, 2g fat) is supposedly only a tablespoon? i use way more than that. i have to make up for the fact that i don't use sugar or sugar substitute. i like my coffee light. who only uses a tablespoon? that's only one mini moo. you have to use at least two, and if it's coffee made at work, you need three, otherwise the coffee tastes like ass.  anyway, onto more serious topics. harry and i were having one of our late night talks (lying in bed with the lights out just chatting - i know i'm making you sick), and we decided that for vacation next year, we will be going back to hawaii. we were originally going to be going to california and vegas for lea's wedding (sorry, lea, we really wanted to go), but i found out yesterday that my coworker, charlie, is going to cambodia for three weeks in the beginning of february, so i won't be able to take the time off then. one of us always has to be in the office, otherwise everything will go to hell. since he hasn't been back in a few years, and his wife wants to see her parents again, so i'm sure as hell not going to fight him for the time off. he deserves a big vacation with all the crap he puts up with at work, although going to cambodia isn't really a vacation. it's 90 degrees in february, and the heat is brutal. he actually hates going there, but he's doing it for his wife, and for his son, cameron, to have a few memories of his grandparents. but anyway, with my vacation plans shot to shit, my mind immediately searched for a new destination and a new time frame. i've wanted to go back to hawaii since we actually got home from our trip in february, but we don't have the vacation time or money to go back this year. i knew that harry wanted to do more travelling and see more places for our vacation time next year, so i was hesitant to bring up hawaii. little did i know that he had decided that he wanted to go back next year too. i was so excited. i already started budgeting in my head before going to sleep how we could come up with the cash for the trip. we have a friend that works for the marriott, and she told us that she can get us a room for a mere $25 a night. how can you beat that? 7 nights = $175. kickin'. our room in february cost us over $450 for just one night. i can definitely deal with the $175. then there's air fare, which is between $1300 and $1500 for the both of us. another $300 for car rental. that's about $2000 for travelling and lodging. if we put away $60 a week until the trip, we should have enough to cover it. voila, we have a wonderful trip to maui in the making. we're thinking the beginning of april. i know it's spring break time, but we'd still be able to do some whale watching and it would be around 85 degrees everyday, which i could definitely deal with, especially see as it will probably still be snowing here.  i am so excited. it sucks that i can't make it to lea's wedding, though. she'll have to bring back lots of pics and video:) and i was hoping to maybe see jess while in california. but what can i do?  on an even more serious note, harry and i have also decided to put off having a baby for now. we've been trying so hard these passed 7, 8 months, and it's just been too much pressure and disappointment. my mom keeps telling us to hold off, to spend a few years with it just the two of us. we need to spend some time alone cuz we won't have that luxury after a baby is here. we need to travel a little, see the world, and more importantly, get more financially established. and although i didn't want to have my first child in my 30's, i'm beginning to see her point, and have decided that she's right. harry and i need a little more time for us to enjoy just being in each other's company. we need to pay off our cars and get a house of our own. we've got time. and we should use it to make our relationship even stronger. i like that idea.

       urlLink    harry says that i am not short; i am merely vertically challenged. here is the video game guru himself, chilling out last night, playing star wars clone wars. over the last 10 years, i have grown to detest video games, with the exception of tetris and mario kart. it's not that i hate the games themselves, but that i loath the fact that they seem to take over the lives of every man i have met up to the age of 40. what is it about video games? i know they are addicting; hell, my mom got carpal tunnel from playing too much super mario on our original nintendo. i myself would play tetris for hours and find myself still playing in my sleep. as i drifted off, i would see those blocks all falling into place making 4 line tetrices? one right after the other. but that was years ago. i no longer get the same satisfaction from playing as i did when i was 13. so what gives?harry will be turning 30 in a few months, and he plays more video games now than when i first met him. he used to only play when i was not around, but that has changed. it's totally cool when i am sitting here at the computer, blogging, and he's playing. otherwise, i would feel guilty for not spending that time with him. but there are times when he will play diablo on the computer for hours, and then what am i to do? he's hogging the computer, and i am left with the tv, hours of mindless tube-watching. i try to find the somewhat educational stuff, food network, the learning channel, animal planet, etc, but i can only take so much trading spaces. i've seen them all anyway. but i digress. i guess the video games make him feel young, and that's ok. i can understand that. 30 is a little scary. next comes mortgages and pta. i guess a little r&amp;r with the gamecube is completely acceptable when you think of it that way. i will try to overlook video games flaws and try to love it unconditionally, as my husband does. it will take some effort, but i will do my best.

      i just can't seem to stop myself from messing around with the template for my blog now. i've become addicted to html and the hell it has put me through. i'm a competitive person by nature, and i feel i just need to win. i will master the art of blog templates. i will have hello kitty and john cusack follow me along my path of self discovery. make it so.  my mind has been racing with all the things i can now add to my blog. pictures, links, quotes, the possibilities are endless. will i ever stop? i've only begun at the side bar; there are footers as well, and things i can do to the main page. i feel like an evil scientist. i wish to rub my hands together furiously and laugh insanely... ha ha HA! excuse me, i don't know what came over me.  i finally got a little break at work. i had been doing so many extra things around the office that i finally said enough is enough. i told my manager that i had been running myself ragged and going home all stressed out because of all the crap i do all day, so he decided to give one of my more tedious duties to someone else. thank the lord and hallelujah! i no longer have to sit and stare at excel spreadsheets anymore! there is in fact a God, and He has just smiled down upon me. i was going blind, blinded by numbers! hell hath no fury like a woman typing out the sanborn index! alas, i can now close that chapter of my life. file it away under "meaningless tasks i have performed". right up there with "signing up for 2 free weeks at Bally's and not showing up" and "working at Walmart for a total of 2 1/2 hours". sometimes i have to laugh at myself.

      ok, kim told me that my pictures in my sidebar didn't show up on her computer. i was so completely bummed. i had this cool image of brak that actually moved; now i have to settle for a still portrait. but i did figure out how to put in text, which is cool. please tell me my pics are there. let me know.

      html is still managing to kick my ass, but i have won two of the battles as of late. hence, the two new choice pics on my sidebar. i'm so proud of them! i'm sure i'll be adding more now that i can figure out how. my next accomplishment will be actual text in the sidebar i put there myself, and maybe links to some cool pages. i see other people's blogs and think they must be absolute geniuses in order to get them to look like that. i'll just have to settle for what i can get.

      amongst all my old audio tapes and packages of wrapping paper i used to keep in the cubby hole of my old entertainment center, harry found a few journals of mine. most are brand spanking new, plastic wrap still intact. i came across one with some writing in it, and was pleasantly surprised that it was a journal i had started right before harry and i started dating. i was floored by some of the things in there about the two of us when we were first starting out, the funniest being that i thought i might be too prissy for harry. i want to put a few entries and excerpts in here for posterity. mostly because harry and i both came into this thing with some baggage. we admitted it to each other because we both understood how the other felt. falling out of love is a hell of a lot harder than falling in.    March 10, 2001       I've written so many things in so many other voices that sometimes i forget that i am a person, too. a person with genuine feelings and a sex drive the size of the state of texas. for so long, i've been this girl or that for whichever piece i've been working on that i've managed to overlook the fact that i'm a girl, too. that i'm not a character, not a "she", but me. living, breathing, fucking lil' ole me. "so what do you want?" you may ask. you know, it's been so long since i've been asked that that i've forgotten the answer.          July 26, 2001       So i have pointed out to myself that i'm getting no where fast. years have swept by, and i find myself standing still. well, tomorrow is going to be a better day. a more beautiful and vibrant day. a cleaning day, a cleansing day. a day to wipe away all the years of accumulated dust and find the beauty, shining beneath. and why? why? what's so special about tomorrow? why, it follows today, and "today is the day we break free," according to Poe. that's singer, not literary genius. i know i've said it before, but i'm hoping to never say it again... today is the day i say goodbye to old ghosts.          July 27, 2001       took the pictures down yesterday. took them out of the album as well. put them in a box with the paper roses. even took the drawing down off the wall. unbelievable feeling after. the tension left my shoulders, my chest. have been talking about getting rid of these things for years now, but never once even reached for them to put them away. extemely pleased with myself. spoke with jessica yesterday and admitted i was ready to leave it all behind. don't want to see or speak to him anymore, don't want to speak ABOUT him anymore, for self-preservation. taking down the pictures...THAT pleased her. said i sounded healthy. ME = HEALTHY? is that possible? i'm wondering if there is going to be pain. There was some that night, but it was so tolerable that i fell asleep. me, the insomniac, who can't sleep because she's always thinking and worrying about something, was so upset i just passed out? that doesn't fit me, as much as healthy does not suit me. but maybe things are changing again. maybe my body is starting to age and is tired of the boy/girl games and my mind has decided to follow along. one can only hope. whole hours have gone by that i haven't thought about him. joyous. not to say he doesn't invade my mind at times. obviously. he is now - i'm writing about him. i realize it may be a somewhat painful and tedious project - weeding him out of me.          July 28, 2001       just had a drink by myself at a bar for the first time (i was looking for my sister, but alas, she was not there). very uneventful. watched old couples, new couples, people hooking up and felt extremely small and meaningless. realize how much i miss having someone next to me, their arm circling my waist, whispering vulgarities into my ear. sometimes it's painful to see two people close and happy together, and i secretly wish them unwell. yes, it's selfish and a bit adolescent of me, and the phrase "misery loves company" i guess pretty much coins me. it's sad, walking through life thinking you need someone to share it with you in order to be happy. that idea doesn't appeal to me, but the fact that it's always thrown in my face leads me to believe that i NEED it.           July 31, 2001       so there were two ways this could have gone: we could have had the "pissed off, leave me alone" ending, or the "i'm so happy...i've been trying to make this happen" ending. i'm vying for the latter, but alas, it looks like plan A is in the lead. Here's the situation. Harry and I hooked up sunday night, (and monday morning, and monday aftertoon), and we had hours of glorious fun, on both parts. the problem: who wanted to tell kim. we were both worried about how she would react to this little freak occurence, so we chickened out of the direct approach and just had harry answer my phone when she called monday afternoon. he said she had no reaction, but she also decided she didn't want to speak with me. i went to go see her after i dropped him off and she was distant. i finally asked her point-blank how she felt about it all, if she was cool about me and harry. she says, "what about you and harry?" she was making it difficult; whether on purpose or not, it was painful spelling it out for her. she just shrugged it off, but she's been distant and i'd say almost cold since. i thought maybe she would think it's cool, but that's not the vibe i'm getting from here right now. i have no idea what to do at this point. (to read what kim actually was thinking at that time, go to   urlLink  kim-land-ton-ville    and read the entry called "dexter and greta" dated july 29, 2004)          August 3, 2004       finally talked to kim. everything seems fine now. chris was right; she just needed a few days. she actually sounded happy to hear from me, which is cool. we talked for a while about the concert tomorrow and upcoming concerts we may want to go to when jess comes home. maybe she'll want to come to the savin rock festival on sunday with me and harry as well.      Genius called me drunk last night, talking incoherently. said he'd call back in an hour so i could decide if he was ok to drive, so i stayed up till 1am, and, of course, he never called. sometimes i wonder why i care so much. sometimes i wonder if he calls just to make me worry. i don't think i'll ever fully understand him.      Talked to harry a couple of times yesterday. it's cool to talk to someone new, but i get the feeling that he may be too good for me. he genuinely cares about people, his friends, especially. he tried to take care of everyone. i just can't be that selfless. i feel like i'm too prissy for him. i hate being like that.           August 6, 2001       the dave concert was cool. kim and i had a pretty good time, minus her getting nauseous because of the crowd. met up with harry after; we had some fun. on sunday, we all went to the savin rock festival on west haven beach. me, harry, kim, kaylee, casey, mike, haileigh, and kalen. the kids had a great time, so did the adults. casey thinks harry and i should hook up; kim almost busted a gut laughing about that one. she seems pretty cool with everything now. she's just going through a think right now. she just wants to be happy. i don't think that's too much to ask.

      i have no idea how two people can possibly accumulate so much crap. the passed two days have been hell. because of the delivery of the new bedroom furniture, the entire house had to be cleaned out. i threw everything away i haven't touched in the passed year. no point in keeping it. some of the stuff was so random and strange, like the kit to crochet your own legwarmers. where in the hell did that come from? i think it was yet another thing harry found in the attic o' crap when he sold his house. along with that, i found a latch-hook kit of Animal from the Muppets. as much as i love Animal, that too had to go, along with some crystal picture frames that were wedding gifts from my first marriage and an alien figurine that came with my mulder and scully action figures. the list goes on and on, each find a little more bizarre than the last. and now it is finished. the house is pretty much clean. and i am pooped. i long for a cup of java and a nice, warm bath. calgon, take me away!
