      Created on 2/6/2004 7:44:00 AM  Words= 601  Shopping for Shopping Carts By: Daniel Quinn  Large Proprietary Inexpensive vs. Small Personal Reasonable  Things to consider:  Customizable Options—you want the flexibility to Add New Products, Wish Lists, Newsletters, Inventory, and Password Protection. You want the flexibility to display the products in whichever way you want. Ask, can I track customer order history? Am I limited, in the number of products or images I can store in my database or on the page?  Professional Looking—make sure you can build a shopping cart storefront that looks like your business. First impressions are lasting...the better you look, the better the customer will feel. Don’t get stuck with the “canned,” “off-the-shelf” look of some of the larger “proprietary” products.  Seamless Integration—make sure your shopping cart works with the rest of your pages. If it doesn't, the online store will NOT look professional, and customers will not want to buy. Make sure to choose an e-commerce application that allows you to easily merge the shopping cart with the look and feel of your website.  Control Features—are important if you want to maintain a specific look and feel throughout your entire website. Ask if the e-commerce product has a "Control Panel" that allows you to manage every aspect of the online storefront, from Adding Products, Changing Graphics and Creating Reports without using HTML.  Proprietary—ask if anything is proprietary. Proprietary indicates ownership and a potential for licensing fees and other restrictions. Some systems use their own system (proprietary) where you need their proprietary support and license to use it. You might not be able to transfer your products information (data) to another web company. Make sure you can take your shopping cart and database with you if I leave your web company and make sure you are not locked in to any hosting agreements.  Speed—is a very important to consider when choosing a shopping cart. Look for ASP. ASP is a very popular and very fast Microsoft programming language. ASP-written shopping carts are up to 8 times faster than some proprietary written software. You will never have a problem finding skilled programmers that can help you customize, enhance, and maintain your e-commerce store.  Shipping—make sure you can add shipping charges and notification. You want to be able to add your shipping charges as well as UPS and FEDEX. Make sure you have automated shipping status via e-mail and through a customer service area whenever the order status is updated (Pending, Processed, Shipped, Returned or Cancelled).  Percentage—do not pay a percentage of your business for your shopping cart. Some of the larger canned products lure you in by low entry fees but take percentage of your business. Your business is your business. Keep it.  So, when you are ready to choose a shopping cart system, make sure you compare apples to apples. Choose a shopping cart you can customize the way you want, it’s professional looking and you can integrate it with your existing website. You’ll want to make sure you have the control to manage all of the features and make sure nothing is proprietary. It needs to be fast and allow you to add shipping charges without giving up a percentage of your business.

      Representative Shaw:  I write today to urge you to co‑sponsor the Federal Marriage Amendment currently in both Houses of Congress.  I realize amending the Constitution should not be taken lightly, but the truth is the Constitution is going to be altered one way or the other. Either that change will come from unelected, unaccountable judges intent on creating a right of homosexual couples to marry when the Constitution grants no such right; or it will come from the American people through this amendment to preserve marriage.  The goal of anti‑marriage activists isn't the individual relationship of any two people.  It is the revision of national policy to say that gender, especially in child‑rearing, is inconsequential, even though research indicates children do best when raised by a married mother and father.  This aggressive campaign to undermine marriage as it's always been known can be defeated, but only through passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment.  I urge you to co‑sponsor this important Amendment.  If not a reply on your stance would be appreciated.

      Representative Shaw:  AS a member of Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), I am very concerned with the inability of Congress to control spending.  I applaud President Bush's threats to veto legislation that overspends, and I would respectfully ask you to support the President's efforts.  Representative Chris Cox (R‑CA) is circulating a letter to President Bush that pledges support for a Presidental veto of any spending bill that includes unnecessary spending. It's very important that President Bush knows that a large number of Representatives will support him in the budget battles ahead this year.  Please contact Rep. Cox's office for more information and to sign the letter, and please keep working for responsible spending in Congress.

      Dear Representative Shaw:  As a member of Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), I feel it's time to fix the tax code bias against health care competition.   Specifically, employer‑provided health benefits are excluded from gross income‑‑but the same health care, if paid for by an individual, receives no tax benefit unless the individual spends at least 7.5% of their annual gross income.  This is how our tax policy spawns the proliferation of third‑party payment schemes, and the unnecessarily wasteful and expensive bureaucratization of medicine.  To restore individual choice and competition that will control health care costs, individual patients’ choices must be rewarded just the same as those made by employers.  There is a very straightforward way to accomplish this objective: make every individual’s health expenses 100% tax deductible.  Legislation introduced by U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox (R‑CA), H.R. 1117, the Health Care Freedom of Choice Act, would do just that.  Making individual Americans’ medical costs tax deductible will remedy the current disincentive to go outside of one’s plan to shop for the best physician, or to take responsibility for any out‑of‑pocket medical costs.  Allowing 100% deductibility for all out‑of‑pocket medical expenses, including health insurance premiums, will re‑create a health care marketplace of millions of Americans, instead of the current market consisting only of employers. Most importantly, by lowering overall health care costs through genuine competition, not socialized medicine, we can help make quality health care affordable for those who now must go without.  I urge you to co‑sponsor Rep. Cox’s H.R. 1117, so we can take health care decision‑making away from bureaucracies and give it back to patients and their doctors.

      Our Senate Armed Services Committee  It is best said by Gen. Taguba to The Senate Armed Services Committee, “At the end of the day, a few soldiers and civilians conspired to abuse and conduct egregious acts of violence against detainees and other civilians outside the bounds of international laws and the Geneva Convention."  Let justice play out and let us not forget we are at war.  It takes trusted leaders from the top down as well as from the bottom on up; we are a fair and just nation.  So let’s get on with business and let Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command Lance L. Smith, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen A. Cambone and Army Major Gen. Antonio M. Taguba go back to work for the nation.

      Lets look at this topic, we have two types of cells to consider, Embryonic and Adult stem cells.  In recent, stem cells have achieved both fame and notoriety due to their potential and controversy.  When embryonic stem cells are removed from their programmed life as an embryo, they can become virtually any cell in the body and potential cures for many illnesses.  If injected into intact animals, they can become deadly tumors, complete with teeth and hair.  Scientists believe these cells are the potential for ground-breaking cures for Diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, heart failure and Alzheimer’s disease.  This promise alone stirs positive public opinion for research from individuals, commercial investors, philanthropists and most recently Nancy Reagan.  Education is needed in this important research.  Recent reports are polarizing this issue as a Pro Life/Choice decision.  Some people believe these cells should be left alone and others believe research is needed.  Together, we need to learn about this research and debate the issues at hand.  On one side, we have a moral dilemma, giving scientists license to make living human embryos.  On another side we have a California voter referendum to issue a $3 billion bond to support such research.  Some US states have outlawed this approach entirely while the European community, Parliament and the United Nations have failed to agree on how to handle the issues.  Adult stem cells are quickly making regenerative medicine a reality and potentially sidestepping major political debate.  Until recently, these cells were mostly ignored because they were thought to have limited regenerative value.  This position has recently changed in part because of the money issues surrounding embryo research.  All body organs contain small quantities of these regenerative cells.  These cells show potential because they won’t be rejected and won’t cause uncontrolled growth.  This progress is making it a preferred treatment for patient therapy.  In addition, the cells drawn in the bone marrow have the ability to transform into almost any tissue in the body.

      Kerry passing out favors  “Kerry also used a little of his senatorial leverage to help Johnny Lee Hill, who had no insurance for extensive damage to his house. Hill told Kerry he had called the Federal Emergency Management Agency and was told to call back on Monday. Kerry slipped him another FEMA number to call to try and get some help.”  The Associated Press  8/21/2004 2:23 AM

      More people are united and enthusiastic about this election than ever before.  Most people agree President Bush has what it takes to lead our country for another four years.  Children & Families are confident in our economy.  They understand education has improved and health care is a top priority.  We are safer at home and national security is one of our greatest achievements.  Both public and federal funding provide us the best research and development in areas of new technology and medical breakthroughs.  The economy is growing, new jobs are rising and unemployment is low.  The simple facts about taxes and our economy include: More Americans are working, unemployment rates are low and falling, our labor force has grown and real wages have risen and are rising.  We have the strongest economy in the world.  We provide one-third of the worlds output.  We lead the world in economic innovation.  We have faster growth and lower unemployment than France, Germany, and most European countries.   Our strength is our economic freedom.  The situation in Iraq is pressing and President Bush has the team to prevail.  Iran is a threat, not a long-term threat but a real and present danger.  We need to protect ourselves from terrorism.  The Bush team is better equipped to curb the offensive and manage our troops.  President Bush does not change his positions on issues for political reasons.  He shares our values and unites the country; he does not divide our people.  President Bush can manage the government better than John Kerry.  President Bush cares about people.  He is a strong and decisive leader.  He is a person to admire.  He is honest, trustworthy and holds an optimistic vision of our future.  Overall, George W. Bush is the best one for the job.

      Retail sales are up in July, and new jobless claims fell last week.  The economy is improving.  The Commerce Department reported retail sales rose 0.7% in July, fueled by strong auto sales.  This is positive news for the Bush camp.  It looks like we have moved beyond the "soft patch" as Chairman Alan Greenspan called it in his latest report.

      With less than 100 days left in the campaign, I’m looking for answers.  Some of the questions and comments I have include:  1. Sen. Kerry speaks of tax loopholes and incentives.  Can you provide me with a.        three “job-killing tax loopholes” the Kerry Administration would close, and b.        three “incentives to companies who create those jobs here”?  2. I’m also looking for answers to two other questions: a.        The Kerry definition of the “fundamental farness to the workforce” he speaks of. b.        How can Healthcare be a rite of the American people?  I see it as either a government subsidy as in a social state or earned as in democratic state.  3. In reference to Bill Cosby’s statements, a.        How is it ‘all of our responsibility’ to take care of the people that wallow in the fringes of society and steep themselves in prejudice, poverty and antisocial behavior? b.        What would you do to change this?

      As politics are on us once again, I watch John Kerry and wonder what’s the difference.  I watched the Democratic National Convention and I’ll watch the Republican convention too.  I also get boatloads of information from TV, radio, cable, online and in print newspapers and publications.  With all this information, I’m trying to figure out who, or what is better.  After awhile, it almost sounds like they are both saying the same thing.  It seems that, since Senator Kerry got nominated, he slid closer to the middle.  Bush is slow to start campaigning but things will pick up after his convention.  I see Kerry up there as a Stepford candidate.  He reminds me of Al Gore with his mechanical hand movements and it looks like someone is telling him to do too many things at once.  It seems like he is caught up in his own machine.  I’ve decided to look at character.  When all else fails and the rhetoric sounds the same, we always have instinct to fall back on; who do we trust and who do we think can do a better job.  At this point, I think the Senator should take a step back and say to himself, ‘I am JFK, but not John Fitzgerald.  In recent days, the things that need to change are his cheeky comments about turning the corner, just saying so doesn’t make it so and his Vietnam stuff.  Speak of the heart and speak to the people, not to the polls and your political pundits.  We’ll see, because there’s plenty more to come.

      I believe and argue that life begins at conception; I am Pro-Life and I believe in stem cell research.  I look at my statement and ask how.  I believe God, or some greater power gave us the ability to evolve.  Therefore, we have a fundamental responsibility to pursue these opportunities.  As in any advancement, there is pain, so shall there be in stem cell research.  I believe it’s our responsibility to advance the science of stem cell research with every means available.  It is the responsibility of the people to move this issue forward; speak now and be heard to move the issue forward.
