      I am El Bigote, Spanish for "The Moustache," and Da Boyz are:  Jamyl Saint Denis (a Bichon Frise) aka Jamie,  Santonio Sharif (a dappled Miniature Dachshund) aka Santos,  Alexie Nabil (Santo's Brudder {sort of, not litter mates} a double-dappled Miniature Dachshund with one Brown eye{Left}, and one blue eye.  {That would be the other eye}) aka Alexie Vasilivich,   Ma Femme is Kathy.  I like working on networks, UNIX, Linux, and I will work with NT/W2K in order to feed my family.  A job working on Networks would be really cool right about now.

      Okay, I guess it would help in cutting down on updates if I would read what I wrote 2 years ago.  Wow, Two years.  Anyway, a lot has changed.  Mainly, I am working, and with computers.  In December of 2002 I lost a really crappy job at a call center here in Victoria.  Should I say the name?  I won't but the name did contain the words, "Sphere," and "Ion."  You figure it out.  Anyway, I am not a very good salesman when comes to trying to con drunks and old people out of more money.  In March of 2003 I got a job at a charter school here in Victoria.  I was doing the computer technology for them.  XP SUX!  Dear God, but if anyone can schlock out a crappier OS than that miserable excuse of an Operating System, it could ONLY be the U.S. Congress.  The job was good, and the kids were fun to work with, but the school leaders have an extremely wrong-headed view of the purpose of technology.  That, and they had no permanent facility at that time.  So I wound up building a network a day, and then tearing it down each evening.  In October I was offered a position at Edna High School and jumped at it.  It was teaching much older students, very well motivated students, and 1/4 of the number of students I had been working with at the charter school.  So I drive 25 miles one way and work with 35 students each day instead of 160.  Life is good, I get paid, and have access to a T-1.  What more could a geek ask for?  Well, maybe summers off, but wait, I am now a teacher, so I get that too!  Okay, the pay could be better.

      Okay, one more update.  Alexie Vasilich is no longer a miniature dachshund.  He went over 11 pounds (Well over 11 pounds), and is now a standard.  He is still the sweetest in nature and very protective of his pack (Da Boyz).

      Well, it's been a while since I set this blog up.  So long that I forgot about it existing.  My hope is to get more involved with this over the Summer.  Since I am a school teacher, you would think I would have the time.  Since I am also a student, you know I probably don't.  One change from the earlier post.  Santos is no longer with us.  Cheer up.  He went to a no kill shelter and was adopted by a very nice family.  The newest addition is Curry.  He is a kitten who showed up at my mother's house about 2 months before she died.  My wife and I brought him home to Texas after the funeral and he has made himself at home, which is what we wanted.  His pic is on the webpage at:  http://www.cox-internet.com/myhand/boyz/abu.html    There are 10 kinds of people in the world. Those who read binary,  And those who don't

      Ah.  It is Saturday, the first day of the Summer break, and there is one good thing about two teachers being in the same house.  You pretty much have the same days off.  Here is a  urlLink   LINK   to a pic of some other inhabitants of our home.  Far left is Curry (named after the spice mixture), the white dog is Jamie, and the dark one is Alexie.  Then you see most of the back of Adnan, who is from Indonesia and is staying with us while being a foreign exchange student.  He leaves at the end of June and we will all miss him a great deal.  Especially the animals, who have become very attached to him.  I do not think they will understand his leaving.

      Well, school is out, and it was an interesting experience on the last two days.  I did not realize how much the last days would affect me emotionally.  The end snuck up on me.  It snuck up on my Cisco class as well.  There was some real shock that the end had arrived.  I am not sure about the students, but for me it was the knowledge that I will not see a lot of those kids again on a daily basis.  Many of my students were seniors.  A lot are Juniors and I will see them in the Fall and I look forward to that.  I also look forward to teaching a new subject.  C++ for beginners.

      Well, school is winding down.  Finals are Wednesday and Thursday.  I will be glad when it is over.  It has been a good year, even though a tiring one.  Now the real work begins.  Getting the certification for teaching.

      It is nice to be able to do things around the house again.  Kathy and I both need to get back into the swing of working on this place.  She travels tomorrow to get Adnan from Houston, along with his friend, Anke.  They will all go to College Station, TX to visit A&M, and then Kathy will take Anke back to Houston on Friday and the family will be back together.  I get to stay home and work.  I have done more cooking on the grill this last week than I di last year combined.  I am getting fairly good at shrimp, burgers, and brats.  I want to try fish, and I need more practice on steaks.

      I have been to see my Grandfather in Arkansas.  He is getting old and it is showing more and more.  He has now officially decided that he will not work anymore.  He is only 83.  He will be going to Fall River, Ma. to visit his younger sister this Summer.  The drive in order to visit him is hard.  It is about 10 hours, no matter how you cut it.  It is also well worth the trip.  Adnan and I will be doing some traveling this week as well.  I will be taking him to see some "desert" over north and west of Freer, Texas.  I will also be taking him to Austin to see some of the sites.  My classes have started online so I am now working on the teaching certificateand things are progressing well, so far.  Okay, I got behind while I was traveling and now I'm playing catch-up.  Satisfied?  Other than that things are looking to be laid back during Summer, once June is past.

      Adnan called today from Washington, D.C.  It was a thrill to hear his voice again.  Hi was leaving in an hour for Indonesia and he should arrive at about 4:00a.m. July 3rd, Texas time.  It will be July 4th in Indonesia.  We wish him a safe flight and a quick reunion with his family even though we miss him a great deal.  I think the dogs heard his voice over the phone because Alexie has been demanding a lot of attention since the call.  We will get back to a more normal routine, but it takes time to grieve and we need to take that time.  Adnan is an incredible young man and we are fortunate to have had him become a part of our family.

      There is a new batch of mead in the bottles and aging at this moment.  My recipe for Metheglin is below.  For 2 gallons you will need:  6 lbs. Honey 6 oranges 2 lemons 5 sticks of cinnamon 3 packets of ready to use yeast (Breadmakers yeast works just as good as anything else) 1 3 gallon carboy 1 carbonation lock 1 8-12 quart pot  Take the zest from one lemon and two oranges.  Juice the lemons and oranges.  Add the juice, zest, and cinnamon sticks into the pot and add 3 quarts of water.  Bring this mix to a simmer for about 45 minutes to an hour.  During this time a foamy scum will form on the top of the brew.  Skim this off and discard it.  After a while less and less of this foam will form.  After suitable cooking time, remove the brew from the heat and strain out what is left of the spices.  I have always used one of those little wire mesh cooking strainers.  Use what works best for you.  At this time you can transfer the brew to the fermentation tank of your choice.  I now have a 3 gallon carboy with a fermentation lock.  The first batch I did I used a suntea jug with a couple of layers of paper towel under the lid to act as a filter.  Mead seems to be very forgiving so use what you have access to.  Let the brew cool to 100-115 degrees Fahrenheit.  Add the yeast to this brew and then let it ferment for about 5-7 days in a cool dark place.  Any hotter than 115 and you will kill the yeast.  Yes, it is a living organism, so treat it with the respect it deserves and it will happily ferment your hooch for you.  The nice thing about a fermentation lock is that you can see when the process starts slowing down.  After the fermentation has taken place you need to bottle the mix and let it age for anywhere from two weeks to 6 months.  It is up to you how long to let it rest.  The last batch I made was drinkable after 2 1/2 months.  But man, right out of the fermentation jug, I swear it made the backs of my eyes hurt when I first tried it.  This makes about 8 quarts.  I got 7 full litres and one almost full, but that one has a lot of yeast dregs in the bottom.  I have found a supply of one litre flip-top bottles to use.  Groelsch Beer bottles also work well.  You don't need a capper to bottle it, and you are not as likely to have a messy accident due to the lower amount of carbonation.  You may get some surprises about the amount of alcohol by volume.  My latest batch reads out at 13-15% by volume!  This is the recipe that I developed and I offer it freely to all who care to give it a try.  I am open source by nature so try it, change it, make it better, let me know what you did.  So...Take a shot at making some mead and enjoy the drink of Vikings everywhere!

      It is the day Adnan leaves.  I am not happy.  The animals are not happy.  Kathy is not happy.  I don't think Adnan is happy to leave, although he has to be happy to be going home.  My wife has compared this to how she felt when her children left home to form their own families.  It is really one of the hardest things I have ever done to watch him leave.  I say this after burying my mother.  I know he will do well.  I look forward to any time we will see him in the future.  But it is very painful now.  The night before he left our little dachshund cried when Adnan went out to visit a friend.  This morning, when Adnan came out of his room with backpack and suitcase, the little dog started giving his warning bark.  The dog knew something bad was happening and he wanted us to stop it.  The animals got very attached to Adnan.  Adnan just fit right in to our little family group.  I miss him a great deal.

      It is now one day before Adnan leaves to return to Indonesia.  Everyone is very sad to see him go.  It is not going to be a fun time in this house this week.  I will do more on this later.  I cannot right now

      Adnan is now home in Indonesia.  He called us from his home yesterday.  We are glad he is safe and home, but he is missed greatly here by the boys, and Kathy and me.

      Okay.  We have MEAD!  I have tested the latest batch and this is something I seem to have the ability to produce.  It is smoother than the first batch I made and it seems to be a little more potent.  It also smoothed out a lot faster than the first batch I made.  This stuff is drinkable within one month of bottling.  The first bottle I opened sounded like a shotgun going off and it flipped the wire cap closer around backwards.  I think I bottled too soon.  There was a lot more carbonation than I planned on.  I mean, this puppy was LOUD when I opened it.
