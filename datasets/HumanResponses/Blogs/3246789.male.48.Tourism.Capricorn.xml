						   From as far back as I can remember alcohol has played an important role in my life. The family home was always well stocked and I was given occasional treats like a snowball at Christmas at a very early age. My parents were both social drinkers who would occasionally go over the top especially when other members of the family got together. The main culprits here were my paternal grandparents. Now they were heavy drinkers for all of the years that I knew them they would go over the top nigh on every night. My uncle (he was my fathers step-father) would hardly change, if anything he became more polite whereas my grandmother would become this seething mass of rage with language to boot. From about the age of six I can remember violent rows at every Christmas till the early/mid seventies. We would invariably spend our summer holidays where my paternal grandparents were living at that time. Places they have lived were Hove twice, Torbay and Bournemouth.  Originally they owned a grocers shop in Clapham North. I can vaguely remember it as I do the toffee apples that my Nan used to make and then sell. Smokey bacon smells coming from the direction of the large bacon slicer a bright red and stainless steel one comes to mind.It smelt like grocer shops used to smell. They moved out of London at the same time we did they moved to Feltham near  urlLink The Airman pub.  Uncle started work as a sales manager for Swell dehydrated vegetable products one of the first in the United Kingdom if I remember rightly.  They enjoyed a very nice standard of living as I think uncle had quite a bit of money via his side of the family, there was always a well stocked bar. My parents were both  urlLink Bells whiskey  drinkers where as my grandparents were  urlLink Gordon’s Gin  lovers, but they always had a bottle of Guinness at around half past ten in the morning. They would drink a bottle each as “ urlLink Guinness  was good for you” whilst doing the  urlLink Daily Telegraph  cross word and before the hiddeous programme “Mr and Mrs" started. Now if that isn’t alcoholic behavior I don’t know what is . From then on in till bedtime it would be gin and tonics all the way through the day and evening. Every night they would go out for a drink if we were staying on holiday. It never changed. Our day was beach, pub, beach, back to grandparents, pub and to finish the day hitting the booze cabinet. In all this time I saw my father paralytic just once, that was to change however after my mother passed away. Every holiday I can remember there would be a couple of horrendous rows during our stay and promises were made to never stay there again. We always returned the following year.  I have a great interest in genetics through my interest in  urlLink forensics  and  urlLink archaeology . The  urlLink Geonome project  fascinates me although I don’t pretend to understand any of it. My ears pricked up as soon as I heard the words genetics and alcoholism in the same breath and from what I have read about the subject. I have to agree with the evidence that it is “more than likely” that my alcoholism is hereditary. Now I can understand that, both my paternal grandparents both died active alcoholics and my great grandfather was an alcoholic. My father just skimmed the edge of active alcoholism and perhaps has now crossed that invisible red line that we cross when the addiction kicks in. “If you drink enough you will become an alcoholic” I can remember one specialist saying.  From my first ever taste of alcohol with hindsight I can see that I was in alcoholic mode from an early age. I didn’t care what booze tasted like I just wanted that hit, that buzz. That warm feeling emanating through every part of your body originating in the stomach area was what I was after. I could recognise that from the way Advocat used to go down. It was almost a raging certainty that I would have problems with alcohol. It would seem that my abuse didn’t cause my alcoholism but I think its safe to say that it didn’t bloody well help. Sounds fair enough to me. I had/have an acute predisposition towards the stuff. I love/loved it.  My drinking really took off after a straight relationship ended aged seventeen. I was distraught. From there on in I drank every day and sometimes first thing in the morning. I would be three parts pissed on arriving at the office. I would do what I had to do, it was mainly messenger work, odd jobs and maker of tea and coffee. I was working for a large media company’s copyright department. When this relationship finished I begged, I pleaded, I drove her and her new boyfriend nuts on the phone, threatening legal action. I took note and got blind drunk.  The job at the media company, I slept my way into that job or it got me an interview at the very least. I was at this time over sixteen. I was legal, so I thought. All though not strictly true the age of homosexual consent was dropped from twenty one to eighteen in nineteen ninety four and then down to sixteen during two thousand and one.  The company was fine it was some of the people who were downright fucking horrible. The second in command used to summon me into his office with a dog whistle. Now that was real humiliation. If I met the bastard today I would shove that whistle where the sun doesn’t shine. The head of departments secretary despised me, the feeling was mutual. The rest of the office was fine I was even lodging with one of my colleagues. He had a flat in Victoria in St Georges Drive and it was perfect for the office. I had no choice as I was homeless again.He was gay and a male model but nothing happened. His name was Chris too. In the meantime I had become involved with a publican which was fatal for me. But that was the reason I wormed my way into his affections and took him for a complete “meal ticket” that’s was my addiction working.  I would do anything for a drink and I invariably did.  The only times I have indulged in anal sex was when I was drunk. The first time I had anal sex was at the age of fourteen, I was drunk.  I was fired from the media company two weeks after my head of department had taken a phone call from my father, my mother had passed away after a long fight with terminal cancer. I got this news second hand, I couldnt believe it. I was fired a couple of weeks later for not taking some late post to the post office and with that went the flat. Eventually my father asked me If I wanted to return home? I gave it some thought and agreed to move back in. I knew it wasn’t a very good idea from the outset. My mother had died in the September, by the December on Christmas day no less my father brought home my future step-mother. With that I just flipped and my relationship with my father was shot to bits then and there.We didnt speak for nearly twenty years and the biggest mistake I ever made was restablishing contact with him. I'm afraid he will never be introduced to any of our grandchildren and never ever will they be without a safe roof over their heads, not while I'm alive. My fathers inactions have taught me to listen to what my grandchildren are actually saying. I'm a good listener. That has got to be a plus in my favour, surely?  By the time I was eighteen it was recognized generally by others, that I was indeed an alcoholic and an addict I was introduced to  urlLink Alcoholics Anonymous  at the age of seventeen by a boss of another media company I was working for.Yes I slept my way into this one via  urlLink Chris Denning . Some of my abusers actually saw/see me as barking mad or disturbed. I have no reason to disbelieve them, as I was disturbed, very much so when I was drinking as I have a very violent temper when drunk. It took me many years to accept the simple fact that I could no longer drink alcohol and that was a bitter pill to swallow. No pun intended.  Alcohol had been my friend, so I thought. It numbed me to the normal world and I have often said to people about my drinking career that I only ever got drunk once, it was just unfortunate that it lasted for just over thirty years. I have glimpses of normality during my travels around the United Kingdom but not many. I had some relationships even to the point of engagement, but they never lasted because I couldn’t stay sober long enough to conduct a sane conversation let alone a close relationship.  The year nineteen eighty two is a significant year for me as it was during nineteen eighty two that I was admitted for the first time to the  urlLink Abraham Cowley Unit  and given my first detox. The only reason I know it was eighty two was because of my second detox and the  urlLink Falklands War . I was in  urlLink St. Stephens Hospital  being detoxed at the declaration of war. It was also my second introduction to the drug Chlormethiazole edisylate more commonly known by its brand name of  urlLink Heminevrin . I had never heard of it. On taking these as an aid for alcohol with-drawl. I had discovered the secret of a happy life. These were basically booze in tablet form and I became addicted willingly to them, the feeling that they gave me was wonderful. I soon learnt to tongue them and I would save them up till night time and the drop the lot. I would then proceed to go into orbit for a few hours.I eventually learnt to chew into them to release the linctus inside doing that sent me into orbit twice as fast, I ended up loving the taste of the things. I could do anything on these or so I believed. It was pure bliss. I was also given very large vitamin B12 jabs just behind the hip. Now these smelt something terrible it resembled Marmite in smell it also made your urine turn a bright yellow that also stank of Marmite. They were bloody painful injections in novice hands.  Heminevrin is lethal as it was these that helped kill the drummer with  urlLink The Who ,  urlLink Keith Moon  back in September 1978.  I would to go on to abuse  urlLink Heminevrin  and booze mixed together for twelve years up until December nineteen ninety four. How I survived through this phase? I have no idea pure luck I think.  In all I have spent five years in and out of different psychiatric hospitals and treatment centres.  urlLink Broadway Lodge  and  urlLink Clouds House  being two treatment centres that I have attended. I forget how many hospitals I have actually been in. At one time I was banned from every hospital within the Avon area. So I moved counties.  After my first detox the next five or six years would be one long roundabout of units, hospitals, homeless hostels, skippering (sleeping rough in empty houses) and Social Security offices. I was also introduced to police cells and the court system. It was during this time that I was supporting myself and my habit by shoplifting and begging in and around London and later on Bristol. Relationships were few and far between the ones I had were ones with other dysfunctional people and as potty as myself. It strange that throughout this time I never returned to prostitution although I would return to my publican friend for a place to stay whilst I was visiting my father down in Surrey a few years later. Yeah right. Total bullshit that was. I just needed somewhere to stay for a few days with free booze even better and a cash handout to get rid of me. I was well into my thirties. I let him do as he wished. It didn’t matter to me I was away with the birdies.  However my drinking was eventually to stop, after yet another stay in a psychiatric hospital near to where I live. A lot has happened since first entering a unit during nineteen eighty two. I had got married for one thing. It was during my short spell on an acute ward that it was decided to try the new wonder drug Prozac, after my GP together with some very vocal persuading by my wife convinced the consultant psychiatrist that my alcoholism was a symptom of something deeper. I had also undergone a course of  urlLink Electro Convulsive Therapy  which the wife put a stop too immediately. The thing was they were giving me  urlLink ECT  and an anti convulsant drug, Heminevrin in fact, at the same time. So one was counteracting the other, a crazy scenario. However I didn’t actually stop drinking till I returned home via the local public house after I had first discharged myself from the hospital. Why did I discharge myself? Easily answered. I wanted a drink. However it was to be my penultimate drink, unbeknown to me at the time.  Coming off of alcohol can kill in extreme cases so it was decided to do a detox at home as I hadn’t finished the detoxing regime back at the hospital. We managed to track down a doctor that was willing to come and visit me as I had said to my wife “That’s it I’ve had it” I wanted to stop drinking. This was a first. The doctor eventually came and prescribed a Librium detox not a Heminevrin one, which the wife would control. It wasn’t an easy detox and my partner had more or less to be wide awake for at least three night’s to help me when I was having a fit as I would stop breathing, or when I was having an acute  urlLink anxiety attacks  which would usually result in me messing myself. I don’t think I have ever been so scared and I was extremely pleased to have come out the other side and life began to settle down a bit. In time I was prescribed Prozac and was on that for five years, I am now on Clomipramine Hydrochloride and will have to remain on these type of antidepressants for life as far as I know.

						   I can tie in my abuse by Denning by way of remembering my favorite songs both on  urlLink Motown . The first of these is “You’re all I need to get by” by  urlLink Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell  released in 1968. This was the first record I looked for in the two foot thick Motown section. The Second was the classic Marvin Gaye album  urlLink “What s going on”  and that was released halfway through nineteen seventy one. The first assault took place in between these two events as Denning loaned me an advance copy that he managed to get his hands on. I fell in love with the album on first hearing that’s why I remember as it is one of my all time favorite albums and I have quite a few of them with similar memories some good some not so good. I didn’t wait for Denning to get me a copy I went and bought it a couple of weeks later when I went “Up west” with some friends.   I had known Denning for about six weeks when I was asked if I “would like to pop over” as he had some new records he wanted to play me. Me the person who must be seen and not heard, somebody wanted my views on something. I was pleased as punch that he asked me and in time I forgot Denning was gay. When in his car he would immediately stop on seeing a group of boys on a street corner, reverse or do a rapid three point turn. He just wanted to ask some young people some questions about today’s’ music. Yes of course he did.  The usual greeting was “Hi I work for a record company you might recognize me as I was on  urlLink Radio One  for a few years“, “can I  ask you a few questions, only take a minute”? That usually did it. Denning would then cast a spell over everybody and he could ask anything he liked. Now I know that this was part of the grooming process. I didn’t then. Get them interested that was the thing. He would invariably give some selected target that he picked out, one of his business cards, the blue grey one, the same one he gave me. I can see now that this technique was a well practiced drill the first step in grooming, very clever, as are most paedophiles. The quick discussion was soon over and he would part with the phrase “give me a ring”. The whole thing took only minutes. And within days the target given the business card would ring. The curiosity was just too strong.  The actual events leading up to my abuse are forever burnt into my mind, If only the date had burnt itself in and the fact that it hasn’t really does piss me off. He said to “ring him” when I got to Weybridge station nothing peculiar in that as this is how I got to Weybridge every day for school. It didn’t really cost me anything as I had a season ticket. I rang Denning  and he said he would be “right there“. I waited for about ten minutes then he turned up.  I am not going to describes in detail what happened that is for another time.  After the original assault I was left stunned, confused and very, very scared.  Even so I have since learnt that disassociation (not being real) is a normal reaction to minimize the abuse that has taken place. I’ve minimized about most things in my life especially my drinking and drug addiction and even then I believed that I wasn’t an alcoholic. Its called denial. I denied my sexual abuse for many years as well. It was around this time that Denning happened to drop into the conversation that the then Master of the Rolls,  urlLink Lord Denning  was an uncle of his. I believed him. I had no reason to disbelieve him.  Bloody hell my mind was in turmoil as it is now on remembering the assaults, I carried on with being abused because I didn’t want to loose Chris as a friend although in public I would choose to ignore him, such was the stigma of being a homosexual. I liked him but eventually I hated what he was. You don’t “grass up” friends came to mind at the time and that confused me even more. Nothing was forced not like it was with the others. The memories of them makes me feel physically sick.  I had started work at the hospital supply company and immediately hated it. It was boring repetitive stuff, filing acting as messenger. The money was lousy and I hated the journey into London every morning. I was dating a girl I had met from Essex but that didn’t last long. I chucked the job in and went to work as a labourer at a light engineering firm in Walton on Thames. Things were still shit at home I was hardly ever there I slept there that was about it. Sometimes I would pop up to see Deniz Corday as there was always a chance of a drinking session and that had to be better than standing on street corners or outside the local fish and chip shop. I made some friends with fellow future survivors whilst at Corday’s. I also started going to see Chelsea play every other week with Paul and a couple of others from school plus a couple of lads from where I was working. We were all trying to make our mark and got involved with football violence. It sends a shiver through me nowadays and I got my fair share of good hidings. I carried on till I got a bottle put across my head. That put pay to my hooligan activities. One thing I do remember with up most clarity was the time we got trapped in a railway carriage by a team of lads from Woking they outnumbered us three to one. Not good odds for a bundle. We decided to jump from the train onto the rails to escape the Woking crew. It makes me go cold thinking that there could have so easily been a train on the fast track approaching at eighty plus miles per hour none of us would have stood a chance. I still shake at the thought.   It was around this time that I started going to The  urlLink Walton Hop  disco every Friday and Saturday. I started dating a girl the same age as me. I was still visiting Denning about once a week and occasionally something sexual would happen. There was always a continual loop of adolescent boys arriving at Octagon Lodge some would stay the night. So I suspected that they were having problems at home as well. I actually had to be pulled off my father by my girlfriend during a blazing row.   From there it was straight down to the phone box to ask Denning if I could “kip” at his place for the night. “No problem” came the reply he picked me up and also dropped my girlfriend off. I let Denning do what he wanted and I helped him climax with mutual masturbation. This was daft, it was only sex. I had no idea how this would affect me in future. The thing that made me feel a little better was the thought that other lads from  urlLink The Hop  were involved with  urlLink Denning ,  urlLink Randall  and  urlLink Corday . I wasn’t the only one, why that made me feel better I can only put it down to me normalizing and minimizing the abuse. All I wanted to be was normal what ever that was. I always felt out of place and if anything I isolated myself and the booze helped with that process. Whilst I was drinking I didn’t think of the abuse, it was payment for letting me stay the night another form of prostitution or as its called in the United States,  urlLink “Survival Sex”.  I have only just heard of that phrase within the last few weeks, and its an apt description. “Get me drunk and you can do anything you like” It got that bad.  As  urlLink Sham 69  lead singer  urlLink Jimmy Pursey  comments on attending The Hop it was “ urlLink Welcome to the Pleasure Dome . It was everything” and it was, the music was great, the dancing I never could really get the hang of it, I just used to stand there and vibrate and move my feet a bit. I get very self conscious and feel a prat. And the girls. I did as well as anyone else, numerous one night stands down by the Thames, illegal drinking in  urlLink The Anglers  and fights with groups of lads from Shepperton, Kingston and Addlestone.   I used to get involved on a regular basis most fights taking the form of running battles and putting car windscreens in of any of those mentioned above. This was the time to show that I wasn’t gay and would always be found somewhere near the middle on numerous “knuckles”. I just wanted to be one of the lads. Most of my friends were skinheads. I never had my head shaved not until a few years ago where I gave my coming baldness a hand. I currently sport a number two.   It was during one of these running battles that I got arrested with about fourteen others in a van en route for a punch-up in Staines.  We spent about three hours in Addlestone Police station. “Oh shit I thought”  “my old man is going to go beserk”. I had nothing to worry about he didn’t say a word but I think it was at that point my father washed his hands of me.  I was living in all sorts of places around this time. I was sleeping for a while on the sofa of a workmate, some times I was sleeping in a launderette occasionally I would sleep at home and at other times in the waiting room on the downside of Walton on Thames railway station. That had a gas heater and was left on all night. I spent about a month sleeping there. I got friendly with one of the station staff who  would open up for business around 05.30 in the morning and supply me with a cup of tea. It was during this time that I got caught out one Sunday night. Sunday meant engineering works so the waiting room was off limits because of the rail track repair team using it.

						   Now to the reason I was thrown out of school. I had a habit of not going to assembly as I was too busy talking to my then girlfriend who was in the fifth year. I happened to get caught by the art master who proceeded to grab my hair and I pushed him. It resulted in him hitting his head on a wall. I left the school to return for only a week at the least as the following day my father received a letter from the headmaster saying that “the school could offer me nothing more” and it was suggested that “I leave as of now“.   The two times I got into real trouble was the time I said that my mother was a medium and the plane that was carrying students on a school trip was doomed. Out of all the things I have done sober that was perhaps the most stupid, closely followed by going for a piss in the Lions Enclosure at  urlLink Windsor Safari Park  and that was when I was eighteen and very, very drunk. The second thing was getting caught writing a script of pornography at the back of the class, now where did I learn all that. I would have already been sexually abused by this time.   My father said not a word about school and that worried me. He told me that I was not to go and work on a building site as that was what some of my older mates had done and that’s where the money was. Why? Don’t ask me. At least I suspect I would have got myself a proper trade. I look at my friends that are builders now and they seem to be doing alright thank you very much. He did say that I would have the pick of the jobs as I was kicked out before the summer holiday and therefore I would “miss the school bulge” as he put it.   My father wanted me to go into the city. Again I have to ask why? The only thing I can come up with is that he wanted me to do better than him, which I have to admit wasn’t likely I haven’t the stickability that my father has. I get bored very quickly and have often wondered if I suffer from  urlLink Attention Deficit Disorder .   He wanted me to go and work the  urlLink “bulls and bears”  on the stock exchange floor, with my phobia for figure work! Priceless. That’s how much my father knew me. I eventually ended up working for a small hospital supplies company just outside the square mile, whereas my father worked within those boundaries. Things were so bad at home that even my department head offered to put me up. This I refused. I didn’t want to be any trouble. That’s a laugh!   Just prior to me getting kicked out of school Denning would on occasions take me up to London. I would be playing truant from school, one of the very few times I did actually played truant. I visited the  urlLink Bell  office’s on quite a few occasions he would do what he had to do and then he would take me back to Weybridge with him. He used to get all his pornography from  urlLink St Anne’s Court , Soho which is still there but not as I remember it. I would go with him to a back room somewhere. Everyone seemed to know Chris. Most of the time we went straight to Octagon Lodge. Listen to some music and the records he would have picked up that same day. He would then drive me home. Occasionally on the way home from London we would stop off in Walton on Thames and visit friends of his. The first of these friends I was introduced to was none other than the  urlLink Walton Hop  manager,  urlLink Deniz Corday .   I got the distinctive impression that I was being shown off and the words "beautiful boys" was bounded about so much I got embarrassed.  urlLink Chickens  were also mentioned! They spoke like a pair of blushing giggling schoolgirls very effeminate. There was always people at Deniz's flat and he always had his favorite boy of the moment in tow. Once again I was treated like an adult I was offered a beer or a spirit, I would always start off with a beer and then go onto gin or vodka, neat no ice, already my tolerance to booze was going up. The thing I remember most about Deniz and his flat is for someone involved in the entertainment industry he owned very few records but the one that jumps out at me was The Beatles  urlLink "Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band ". It is only just recently that I have been able to listen to this classic album as past attempts to listen were somewhat overtaken by  urlLink flashbacks , this was a classic triggering situation. I hear the opening chords to any song on this album and I'm back in Deniz Corday's tiny lounge.   Another person I met was  urlLink Rob Randall . And I thought Denning had a lot of albums but his collection was nothing to what I was looking at whilst visiting Randall’s. I have never seen that number of albums unless it was from inside a record shop. That usual record shop was the one inside Birkheads as I was to find out when I started going to The Hop.  urlLink Rob Randall  is a pig of a man. Hugely overweight with a beard and lank shoulder length hair. The first time I met him he was dressed in a dressing gown that would easily flop open revealing a mass of loose flesh. God it makes my skin creep just thinking about it. "How did I come to meet Denning" asked Randall I said "through a friend". There was a trace of public schoolboy in his high pitched effeminate voice. He had a habit of calling me "darling" which I hated from the moment I heard it. His flat was an absolute pigsty with music papers all over the place and you would not have believed his eating habits. Beside the albums that covered one wall and there was another wall completely covered in photographs of the people he had interviewed it included a photograph of  urlLink Yes  with a very young looking  urlLink Bill Bruford . Another picture I remember was the one that featured Randall in it standing next to  urlLink Ronnie Wood  (in his Faces days) and his snooker table. The other thing I noticed was the bright orange filing cabinet it was a garish orange and you couldn’t not notice it. It was opened with a set of keys that hung around Randall's neck as he proceeded to do on a couple of occasions on that visit.   Randall was liberal with the booze and I particularly remember Cutty Sark whiskey and Beefeater gin, the brand you buy from Sainsbury's. The conversation turned to me. Where did I live? How long had&nbsp;I known Denning? Had I met Deniz?&nbsp;I wasn't at all interested in what Randall had to say or ask. I was told if I was ever nearby to call in for a drink. I was fourteen for gods sake. This pervert was a true predator in every sense of the word. And I hate him with a vengeance and he was convicted in two thousand and two of sexual assault on an underage boy. He was fined £300 and placed on the sex offenders register for five years. The last thing I heard of him he was apparently working for a Circus as a press officer. I reported that to  urlLink Childline  hopefully they would have checked that out and informed the circus owners.    urlLink Myths about Male Sexual Abuse

						   Who would in time offer to help? You guessed it.   I rang Denning a few days later. I had the memory of that record collection in my head and that alone kept me awake at night thinking of what goodies I could find there already making my mind up to visit there again if I was invited. The  urlLink Motown  section was a couple of feet thick. Denning was pleased to hear from me, he asked “how I was” and “what did I think of the records he had given me“? Those records had made such an impression on me that I cant for the life of me remember what they were. More than likely  urlLink Tony Orlando and Dawn ,  urlLink David Cassidy . Music like this would not make me sit up and listen and it seems easily forgot.   One thing I have noticed since starting writing. Music has given me the opportunity to recall situations, conversations, sounds and smells with a great deal of accuracy. The pleasurable memories are just that but the memories of past abuse and that type of situation are called  urlLink flashbacks  or  urlLink intrusive memories  which can be very unnerving especially the new ones as they can take a little time to settle down.  They are also linked to  urlLink Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  Expensive aftershave reminds me of Denning as does sugar in the cooking of garden peas. Flashbacks can be triggered by the most innocent of things.  Denning said he had some more new releases “if I was interested in hearing them“. “Yes I was” came my reply. He agreed to meet me at Weybridge station at mid morning that coming Saturday. I thought about what Paul had told me Denning being gay and all that. I had never met anyone that I’m aware of who was Gay and I didn’t really know what gay meant. I understood it was blokes having "bum sex" and were therefore referred to as “turd burglars” “arse bandits” and “benders” as in “spaghetti benders“ school - boy slang for homosexuals. Being a “bender” during the seventies was nothing to be proud of. But it intrigued me and I said to myself that I would get out of any advances that maybe made. This would prove to be absolutely useless against someone with the experience of Denning. Paedophiles are masters of manipulation and are expert in isolating problems and working around them. It was so subtlety done, that I was not aware that the situation was turning to the abusers advantage and that no matter what obstacles are put in front of them paedophiles will get around them, as you have become an obsession with the abuser and that obsession will continue to grow the more you try to resist it will not be satisfied until sexual conquest is made.  I was treated to eating in luxury restaurants, hearing record requests being made directly to the  urlLink BBC Radio  One or the  urlLink Radio Luxembourg  studio, now that was impressive, free records and promotional material, taken to the West End to the pictures at Leicester Square. It was with Denning that I saw a “ urlLink Clockwork Orange  before it was withdrawn from general release. Denning had a thing about skinheads, I think he liked the aggression or the possibility of it and the uniform.   Although I may have been a music nut, I still didn’t recognize the name Chris Denning not until it was pointed out to me that he was one of the founding member of the original lineup at BBC Radio One. So much for my musical knowledge   urlLink Bell Records , an American label with an office in London would be extremely successful in employing convicted paedophiles during the early to mid seventies with hit after hit. The label itself had already got the hang of Boy Bands with the  urlLink Bay City Rollers  (and their manager  urlLink Tam Paton ) together with Teen Idol stars like  urlLink David Cassidy  with and with out the Partridge family, urlLink  Gary Glitter  and  urlLink Jonathan King  under different guises. Chris Denning was Bell’s head of promotion and one of the most influential plugger’s in the UK music industry. Dick Leahy was head of label if I remember rightly.  Besides the Bell record label what else have all these abusers got in common?   They all have connections with Denning obviously. The other thing they have in common is the  urlLink Walton Hop  disco. Most if not all showed up at  urlLink The Hop  at one time or another, some coincidence.  urlLink Denning and King  were enthusiastic visitors as was another now convicted paedophile  urlLink Rob Randall . Randall, real surname Hay -  Dangerfield was a freelance music journalist and DJ who had a residency at The Hop every Tuesday night. He was convicted of sexual abuse of an underage boy in 2002, fined £300 and placed on the Sex Offenders register for five years, he was supported at Kingston Crown Court by The Hop manager  urlLink Deniz Corday .   Mr. Corday helped the police with their enquiries with regard to The Hop and those who visited regular and it transpires that he has some very unconventional views about the age of consent to quote him “I think a paedophile should be someone who goes with someone under thirteen”. To read this comment in context go to  urlLink www.jonronson.com  or  urlLink here .  People in the music industry trusted Denning’s judgment, and his ability to know a hit when he heard one. He also did crazy things like driving his big orange Volvo on the path to miss out on bottle necks at T junctions how he never got nicked for that, I’ll never know. Above all Denning was not the dirty old man stereotype. Well educated, well traveled and successful, a role model in many ways. I was really suckered and fell for the lies and deceit one hundred percent and I was trapped such was the atmosphere at home. I couldn’t go there so I talked with others at school about Denning and I found that he knew a few of my school friends. Like them I was made to feel special and I was shown affection something my parents had a great deal of trouble doing. Denning made me laugh and I liked him. I still have problems with him today as I cant seem to hate him, God knows I’ve tried. It was getting so bad that I ended up writing to the message board at  urlLink malesurvivor.org  asking for help.  I wrote something similar to the comment below:   “I’m in a bit of a quandary at the moment as I am having a real hard time trying to hate my original abuser. I hated what he did to me. I hated his lies and deceit. I hated myself, I hated everybody and thought everyone was against me. I detest absolutely all the others in the group of paedophiles that operated out of the Walton Hop disco during the seventies.   Today I feel no hate for Chris Denning all I feel for him is pity as I feel he really cant help himself. The others? I feel nothing for them except contempt. They knew exactly what they were doing and they thought they could get away with it. I hope they have to remain forever looking over their shoulders not knowing who is behind as they go about their daily routine. May they find out what real fear is like.  And I cannot agree with Detective Inspector Marjoram of  urlLink Surrey Police  when he states there is “no evidence of a paedophile ring at The Walton Hop”. What else do you call a group of men that all attended The Hop and who are all now convicted paedophiles?  School and me were going downhill fast. I really thought I was loosing the plot. I seemed to be in trouble all the time or it appeared that way. My grandfather had passed away and I felt totally alone. I had nowhere to turn to but Denning. After the initial abuse. I couldn’t give a dam about the further assaults. I felt it couldn’t get any worse. It did.   I was placed under a child psychiatrist as my reaction to my granddads death was pretty severe. Now I was being a handful. I was given a school counselor and I had every opportunity to disclose the relationship between Chris Denning and myself. I was too frightened that it would all come out and I would be labeled “Gay” that scared the life out of me as that was the lie I had been fed by Denning and the rest of my abusers, that I was very probably gay or at the least bi-sexual. Homophobia was rife during the seventies and the stigma associated with being gay was more than I could handle.   The second thing that kept me quiet was the fact that any investigation would mean the police and at the time that frightened me more than the “Gay” label. Never ever was I to be the cause of policeman coming up the front path. I have to laugh at that now as there was more chance of my dad getting nicked for handling bits and bobs that he used to store for mates of his. I have only just found that out. But the thought of being gay is just too much even though I prostituted myself. I was told all gays act like this. Denning sees himself as gay as do the rest of my group of abusers. They do not see themselves as paedophiles. Let me get one thing straight I am not anti-gay as I have had to many male sexual partners to possibly be that. I’m fucking angry at the mob who call themselves “Gay” who are in fact paedophiles. All through my adult life I have had doubts about my sexuality and its true my feminine side always comes out when I have had a drink….I know where my doubts originated from. Funny that.   I don’t think I was all that bad as I only received the cane twice at primary school and the slipper twice at secondary school and one of those slippering’s was when the whole class copped it. I was never excluded or suspended from school until I was asked to leave or it was suggested that the teachers could offer me no more. Most of the time I was too interested in playing football during break times, as I wasn’t going to a football playing school, even so I was spotted by another lad whose father ran an under 16 side. I was also asked if I would like to transfer to a club out at Woking but I was happy where I was. I was also playing for a senior side in the Surrey Senior League. Just prior me being asked to leave school I was voted sports captain for my house and was made captain of the football team on the one occasion that we played soccer against a nearby approved school. I felt I was making progress even to the point of writing away to  urlLink Fulham FC  asking for a trial. My father showed no inclination to help saying only “your not that good” or “you don’t stand a chance”. Bastard. So in the end I didn’t bother. He was right though “I wasn’t that good”.   urlLink Ten facts about the sexual abuse of boys and its aftermath

						   I'm Dan and I'm an adult survivor of Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA).  How do I put into words my upbringing? My upbringing was like thousands possibly millions of others within a  urlLink dysfunctional family .The family I hail from could only be described as totally dysfunctional and it is only with hindsight that I now realize it. I was born in South West London during the mid fifties. I spent the first seven years of my life in  urlLink Tooting  and was surrounded by an extended family living nearby.   My father had gone through a shit time being pushed from pillar to post during evacuation, just like thousands of other kids did during  urlLink The Blitz . His father walked out on him, his sister and mother only to reappear some thirty years later in rather spooky circumstances. Whereupon I was I was accused of playing some kind of cruel hoax. But that’s my dad, quick to judge, slow to apologize. My father has a control thing but where he got his feeling of superiority from God alone knows. My mothers parents lived at  urlLink Wandsworth  in the shadow of the Pepperpot Church,  urlLink St.Anne's  and place of my christening.   My granddad was my best friend. None of our family was touchy feely although I do vaguely remember being bounced on granddad Mick’s knee usually accompanied by some ancient nursery rhyme.  Unlike my father granddad Mick was interested in me and not how well I did, although he was interested in that as well. I spent many a happy hour playing in Borrowdaile Road opposite the Iron Mill pub in  urlLink Wandsworth . Most Sundays were spent with Nanny Nell and Granddad Mick. Lunch was always supplied complete with a steamed pudding and custard.  It was tea that was the highlight of the week. Plenty of salad from the small patch out back called a garden, piles of fresh bread and butter, a pint or two of winkles that my grandfather relished armed with his special winkling pins. Cheese and corned beef and my own favorite warm sticky  urlLink Lardy cake  and tea made with condensed milk. Wonderful. Grandad Mick also happened to make the best  urlLink Bubble and Squeak  in the world.  Why was my father so concerned about giving the perfect impression? I still cant come up with an answer even today let alone then. However I do have a perfection streak running through me typical of someone born under the star sign of Capricorn apparently. I also possess a very addictive type personality. But in saying that I know perfection cannot be reached except when I was perfectly pissed, permanently and in which state I stayed for thirty odd years.  Nineteen sixty two saw us move out of London to Surrey. Nice place, some lovely memories especially long hot summers, fishing, wide open spaces, camps made out of hay bales and building foundations to play in as the village was expanding rapidly. The cause of this expansion. Commuters. Only half an hour by train to London. Most of the population worked at the former  urlLink Vickers Armstrong  factory sited on the world famous  urlLink Brooklands  race track which lay to the north of the village although technically  urlLink Brooklands  was in Weybridge.  By the mid sixties my grandparents from Wandsworth arrived in the village and settled into their two bed roomed prefab with a massive garden, much to my grandfathers delight, just around the corner from where we lived. My other grandparents owned, ran and lived above a grocers in Clapham north. They too moved out of London to Feltham, near The Airman Pub during the same period. Pubs play a big part in my life or more correctly booze played a major role in my life and I loved the stuff, any shape or form, if it could get you pissed I would go for it big time. I really started hitting the stuff hard around fifteen years of age.  I wasn’t too handy at school. And stood no chance with the eleven plus much to the dismay of my father, But I did play in goal for the primary school football team and was a house captain so I presume I wasn’t doing all that bad. I had also undergone trials with Woking schoolboys but never made it to the first team. A season or two later I changed to being a mid field player, then it was right half heavens alone knows what it is today. The school was run by the formidable one armed Mr. Robinson with heavily nicotine stained fingers and smelling of Capstan Full Strength. There was a permanent fog in his office, at that time nobody had even dreamt up the phrase "passive smoking".  In all these were happy times although I seemed to be in constant trouble with my father resulting in varying degrees of discipline from the usual grounding and being sent to my bed without any tea through to the public humiliation my father used to put me through.   I really hated that.  But the worst thing was when he would rip up my jeans, burst my football or cut my hair whilst asleep. I never did find out why he did this.  My whole relationship with my mother and father was built on lies. I can remember being told that the fair or circus would take me away if I was naughty. To stay away from dirty old men they said nothing about the smart ones! I was told that if at any time I was in trouble I was to go to an adult. Thanks. Some advice that proved to be. The thing that seemed important for a while was masturbation, but “masturbation would make me go blind“ I was told.   I put in my order for a guide dog.   The trouble with that type of comment was a couple of weeks later I was prescribed glasses, I carried on regardless. My father talking about sexual subjects would turn him the color of freshly cooked beetroot. Mum was different she told me matter of factly and that was good enough for me.   My father would reduce me to tears sometimes by giving me a whack and then he would call me names, the usual stuff in front of my small circle of friends and children being children I was teased about it, I tried to just shrug it off but it still hurt and made me angry if anything. I seemed to have bottled that anger and I have real problems managing that anger today.   He would scream at me “Your bloody useless, hopeless, I don’t know why I bother”. I never (or very, very rarely) got praised for anything and that kind of thing dents your confidence. I set out to fail, everything just so I could get some attention from my father. I was successful at that. I was never helped with homework and figure work scares me shitless even today. I failed my eleven plus, although I wasn’t expected to pass anyway, I failed my cycling and football proficiency. It drove my father to distraction. I finished primary schooling during the late sixties and transferred to a new comprehensive school at nearby Weybridge and not the one the majority of my friends were to attend.  I started secondary school and due to my size I was an easy target for the usual introductions from some of the senior pupils “Come and see the blue goldfish” ending up with you getting your head pushed down the bog and chain pulled, normal kids stuff. I got beat up on a couple occasions that was until the time came when I lost my temper totally and gave the toughest lad in the same year as me a couple of very nice shiners, I even got congratulated by the headmaster. Recognition at last. That was all I was asking for, a bit of recognition, unfortunately this new found power went to my head and I became a bully or it appears that way.   Things were not going well at school or at home. And I started to getting into fights at school and with my father as I just wasn’t going to stand there and take it anymore.  In nineteen sixty eight there was an event that took place that woke me up to the real world. My maternal grandfather passed away with a heart attack. He had been ill for sometime with his chest and had been away at convalescence. This was the last time I cried until recently. I was distraught for a long time and I miss him still to this day. I have him to thank for my love of history and everything I know about listening came from him, granddad Mick put me in good stead for being a grandfather myself. And I know I’m bloody good at it. I had a good teacher.  The swinging sixties gave way to the seventies and it was around this time (1971) that I was introduced to  urlLink Chris Denning  through a friend I was with. We were walking up to the local park for a kick about near the  urlLink Oatlands Park Hotel . You had to pass the hotel with it on your left and the aptly Octagon Lodge on your right. A voice came from behind and in the direction of Octagon Lodge. “Hello Paul”. “Walk on” Paul said out of the corner of his mouth so not to be heard by the owner of the voice. “Paul I would like to ask you and your friend for your opinion on a few new records I have” adding “There is a bottle of coke in it for you and your friend”. My mind highlighted the word record. I was a music nut but I wasn’t sure as yet as to just how much. “Is that a record as in music” I enquired. “Yes” came the reply. “I’ll make it worth your while just a couple of records that’s all”. “Come on” I pulled at Paul’s  urlLink Ben Sherman  shirt “bottle of coke”, “It is a hot one”. Paul stopped and turned around and headed towards the direction of the voice “Come on then” he said.    urlLink Chris Denning  was a normal looking bloke, short and squat with a very bad fitting toupee. I knew it was a toupee as an uncle of mine used a “syrup”. He wore a permanent smile typical of those trying to sell something, he spoke quickly and accurately like most salesman, whilst putting a record on. He then disappeared and remerged a couple of seconds later with two bottles of Coke, one for me and one for Paul.  “Ta” I said. “what do you think? Asked Chris “about what?” I asked, “this record” “its alright, nothing special” I replied. “Paul you are rude you haven’t introduced me to your friend“. “Chris meet Dan, Dan meet Chris”. “Hi” we both said. “Well Dan what do you think?” “nothing special” I repeat. “I’m more into Motown and prog rock, giving the impression I knew what I was on about as I’m not the brightest of the bunch or so I believed. I hated being embarrassed and caught for something to say so I‘d say the first thing that entered my head.   Chris appeared to be really interested in what I had to say, Nobody as yet had asked for my opinion. I was of the “children are to be seen and not heard” generation. “Keep it buttoned” with the added action of another backhander, was my fathers favorite saying. Paul asked to borrow the bog and went to do whatever. Chris turned the stereo down “Haven’t seen you around here before. You live local?” “No I live near Byfleet. I go to school in Weybridge same as Paul”. “You the same age?” he asks “no I’m the younger“. “Paul is a year older than me”. “So that makes you sixteen?” he enquired. “No. I’m fourteen, fifteen in December” Right” he says “so what you think?” “Not my type of music” “So what is your type of music? “Bands like  urlLink The Who ,  urlLink Free ,  urlLink Deep Purple  ,  urlLink Humble Pie  and  urlLink The Moody Blues “, I added “hard rock“, “Stuff like that” I said in reply. I had recently heard of a band named  urlLink Yes  and I had grown to admire the musicianship that they afforded, not that I could play anything as that would have taken patience and patience is one thing I really do lack. I was a now and immediate gratification type person. “Have you got any Who?” Denning opened a sliding louvre door, revealing the largest record collection I had ever seen. I stood there mouth agog. It had everything singles, albums, demo copies, promotional singles and tapes of him and  urlLink The Beatles  to go with the pictures on the back wall of the Fab Four talking to Denning. He also had dimmer switches which was novel for the beginning of the seventies. “The Who. They are on Track if I remember rightly” and out came urlLink  The Who Sell Out  “Any particular track?” “I can see for miles” “Loud if possible” and it was loud but you could still hear everything as clear as a bell. Paul returned from the khasi after what seemed an eternity, finished his coke handed the empty to Chris and said “right I’m off” “You coming? he said looking at me as I had a football at my feet. “Yep ok lets go“. “Hang on boys” there was a pile of singles sitting on a coffee table Chris picked up a handful gave Paul four and me four. “Ring me and let me know what you think of them“. He carried on “Paul you have my number this one is for you Dan” handing me a small blue-grey colored card with his name and telephone number on. “Seriously, ring me I value your opinion. If I’m not in leave a message“. “How?” I asked. “I have an answering machine just leave a message, I love gadgets” said Denning. At that point the phone did ring he left it and sure enough this machine started talking asking the caller to leave a message, which the caller dully did. “There you go” says Denning “I had better call them back“. Paul and I said our goodbyes, saw ourselves out and left. “Remember Dan give me a ring and let me know what you think of those records”. "Ok" I replied and out into the air we stepped.   “It was bloody hot in there” I said and quickly followed that with “what were you trying to say to me before we went into the house“. Paul and I kept walking. Paul looked behind as if someone was creeping up on us. “He’s a queer, a poof”. “Is he?” I said “How do you know?“ I asked, the reply never came Paul had kicked the ball over the rec fence and quickly followed it. The conversation was forgotten as a kick about began.  My fate, unbeknown to me was already sealed and my grooming had already begun.  Groomed and  urlLink grooming  are not new words to the English language but their original meaning is somewhat lost in this politically correct society we are part of . Today grooming still means the same as in “well turned out” but it is more understood in conjunction with paedophiles.  urlLink Grooming  is the process whereby a paedophile learns the weaknesses and the needs of the ensuing target, because that is what I was target. My abusers are driven by three things sex, obsession and power not nessecery in that order. Once those needs and weaknesses have been discovered the perpetrator will play on those needs. I was treated like an adult, which I think most fourteen year olds like to think they are. More mature beyond their years. I maybe totally wrong in which case I will refer only to my grooming.   My relationship with my parents had more or less totally broken down and I was made to feel that Denning actually cared and really wanted to help. On occasions it even got to the point where I was sleeping on a local railway station at the age of fourteen, because of the rows with my father. It was during this period that my father considered having me taken away by Social Services. Looking back at that situation it would seem I would have been “out of the frying pan into the fire” especially after glancing at  urlLink The Waterhouse Report . I recently gained some insight into my own adult dysfunctional behavior by watching the award wining drama  urlLink “Care”  written by Kieran Prendiville. The drama tells the story of Davey (actor  urlLink Steven Mackintosh ) and his attempts to block out the abuse that had happened to him whilst he was in care. It shows the pressure he is under when the trial he is part of collapses and his abuser escapes conviction. It also portrays his relationships with others, it ultimately shows his death by way of vodka, painkillers and possible drowning through the guilt of assaulting his supportive partner. Bells really did started ringing at that point. That could have so easily been about me, the story is a parallel to my own only the surroundings were different. The similarities between Davey and myself where quite unreal even down to the way he carried himself. It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.   Been Abused? Need Help?

						   It got to eleven o’clock when I was reminded of my promise I went and got “the boys” a bottle of sherry and half a dozen cans of  urlLink Special Brew . I had one more drink with them and said my goodbyes they all said what a decent  urlLink geezer  I was. What they didn’t know was that I returned to the shop where I got the sherry and lager and purchased for myself a large bottle of  urlLink Smirnoff Red Label  and said to myself “take your time with this”.  This was good advice so I booked into another B&amp;B down by the seafront. I was nicely pissed, I felt good and thought “sod it” I could meet up with Richard tomorrow. I just needed a shower and a shave. It was very nearly impossible to leave my bottle of booze in my room whilst I went out to buy some razors, soap and shampoo. I rushed to the nearest all purpose shop purchased what I had to and rushed back to my room. I forced myself to have a shave and a shower before opening the vodka because I knew that if I started it now I would forget all about the shower let alone shave. I like to start a proper  urlLink “bender”  off by feeling clean, unspoilt but give me a week or two and I can look like your average homeless drunk, which is what I was anyway. After the shower I washed my socks and underpants in the sink and hung them out on the window sill as it was reasonably sunny out. That felt better.  For what seemed an eternity I just stared at the bottle of spirit that stood on the bedside table. I go through this ritual more or less every time I open a new bottle. My mouth goes very dry, my heart and pulse begins to race, I start to sweat and I start shaking with anticipation. I crack the seal open and that seems to echo around the room. I unscrew the top whilst thinking “I wonder where I’m going to end up”? I bring the bottle to my mouth still shaking take a good mouthful and swallow.  Whammo, the booze kicks in after a split second and my whole body shakes and normal systems appear to return. If only I could limit my amount daily. I shake my head and say “shit”. Vodka has the most disgusting taste that disappears after the first swig.  I think the same “I wonder where” thought as before but I finish off by answering to myself out loud “who gives a fuck anyway”? Before taking another gulp of vodka. Oblivion usually follows. But before I reach that point of  urlLink blackout  I have often thought to myself that there was something “seriously wrong with me, why am I doing this”? I still couldn’t see my abuse. It was the last thing on my mind even though I was going to meet another abuser. I was using him! I was now into my thirties. I was in for a bit of a surprise.  Since going into a the  urlLink Abraham Cowley psychiatric unit  in nineteen eighty two my drinking had taken on a different guise. Originally my drinking was of the “topper-upper” type whereby I would keep the booze levels in my body tanked up to its optimum level giving everyone the impression that I was normal. Off course I was normal, what I was doing was normal, sometimes I would be in  urlLink blackout  and on automatic pilot sometimes not. After my first few detoxes my drinking changed to  urlLink “binge drinking”  whereby I would stop drinking of my own accord usually and go on the wagon for ex number of days, weeks or even months. Then when things got a little bit clearer, I would get scared and start drinking again and go on a  urlLink “bender”  again this bender can last days, weeks sometimes months and in my case years. Mind you I did have some help during those dry periods as I would be dropping or rather chewing up to forty  urlLink Heminevrin  capsules a day if they were available and they usually were, this was before doctors found that they had yet another horrendously addictive drug on their hands. I think most detoxes are now done with  urlLink Librium .  Today if I’m honest I crave  urlLink Heminevrin  more than I do booze, the feelings, the taste, the pain and itch on the bridge of my nose, the rush, the buzz, the oblivion. I occasionally have a kick back where I can actually taste the linctus that was within the time release capsules and I try to relish each and every second it lasts. My mouth has gone dry just thinking about them.  I awoke the following morning around six thirty and was impressed that I had only drunk half the bottle, that got the day off to a good start. I’d have good swig before making a cup of tea. I had another shower and listened to the local radio had another drink of voddie and drank my tea. I even attempted some breakfast I had fried eggs on fried bread. This was the first thing I had eaten in days and it stayed down. I settled my bill and left. It was nine thirty. I knew where Richard was working so I took a slow walk up to the pub where he was manager on the way I went and sat on the beach front. Life was pretty good so I thought to myself, I still had few quid left enough for a few more bottles of vodka if nessecery that’s all that mattered. I finished what was in my bottle and binned it.  It had now gone well past opening time so I walked into the saloon bar, ordered a pint of  urlLink Guinness  and pulled up a bar stool. It was all new bar staff again as Richard had a habit of sacking people after they had been there for a few months during high season. After half an hour he appeared and did a double take at me. “What the hell are you doing down this neck of the woods”? “Visiting” I replied “look at it as a late summer holiday” I added. I had a few more pints. I was invited upstairs on closing time. Richard opened the conversation with “I spose your homeless again”? he said in that broad Dorset accent of his. “Yep I suppose I am” “Well you aint staying here for free ………. you can stay for a couple of days and that’s it”. “Fair enough” I said sounding grateful. I was too old for him by now as at one time I could have paid my rent other ways.  Still two days were better than none. I also quietly thanked my lucky stars that I didn’t have to sleep with him again. He now had a much younger model in tow. Although it did make me realize that I was getting older and I had a limited shelf life my sell by date was way out by about sixteen years.  Sexual Abuse: The effects As An  urlLink Adult Survivor .

						   I remember as a young child the song  urlLink Little Boxes by Pete Seeger  at the time I really thought that people were actually living in little boxes made of "Ticky-Tacky" all of different colors. I wasn’t far wrong even in my infancy. Not much has changed if you replace the little boxes with labels. Now there’s an obsession for you.   I can literally break my whole being down to a pile of labels past and present as I have been given these profiles by various people from school teachers through to psychiatric staff, I also include myself in that list. I was naughty, I was a nasty person, I’m a convicted wife beater, I’m anti social,  I’m an alcoholic, a depressive, a poof, a bum-boy, I was a  urlLink chicken , I’m  damaged (Dennings words not mine), I‘m a follower, I’m selfish, I'm an addict, I'm barking mad, a liar, a thief, a hopeless drunk, I was a male whore, I’m weak, I'm a quitter, I’m manipulative. I'm sure my abusers could think of a few more.  By the looks of it I'm mad, bad and dangerous to know.  However, I’m also a Survivor.   Bloody right I am and I‘m angry with it.   “Who with”?   “Me” mainly.   I try to give the impression that I just bumble along all carefree when really I am this knot of high anxiety on the lookout for anything threatening. It’s bloody exhausting and sometimes it can get so incredibly dark and negative and the stupid thing is that feels normal. Throughout my travels to treatment centers like  urlLink Clouds House  and  urlLink Broadway Lodge  I would come face to face with all these negative thoughts and feelings and a lot more beside.  It was nineteen eighty five. I had discharged myself from yet another hospital and made my way over to a friends who happened to run a licensed  newsagents. As I walked through the door, my friend knew something was up as soon as he saw me. He said “come back after we shut” and gave me half a bottle of vodka to be getting on with. I walked down the hill and tried to get myself arrested all to no avail. I was just told to “get lost” but not as politely.  It was dark when I walked back up the hill to my mates shop. It was all locked up and dark so I knocked on the side door. I was let in. My friends wife had decided to leave us to it and had gone to stay with her mum she knew what was going to happen, we would get very, very pissed listening to people like  urlLink Jeff Beck ,  urlLink Steve Hillage  and  urlLink Breton  guitarist  urlLink Dan Ar Braz  among others with the stereo volume set on plus ten.   I was woken the following morning with a mug of tea and some toast, which made me want to heave straight away. It was early and the shop had been opened by his wife. I took my empty mug and the uneaten toast into the small kitchen where on the side were the empty night safe deposit bags together with a wad of notes. At that point my friend came in and said its time for me to go. He led me down the narrow hall to the side door when I said "I must use your  urlLink khasi  first". The toilet was at the back of the kitchen. After going for a piss I made my way back to the side door where my friend was waiting for me but on my way back through the kitchen I picked up the wad of notes and stuffed them in my pocket. I then begged some money off of him and another half bottle of vodka. This I got. He wished me luck and said he wished he could do more.  I had truly become the lowest of the low I had stolen off of my best friend and his family. Jesus did I feel guilty but that evaporated soon after the first mouthful of booze of the day and it was forgotten, however the theft was to return to haunt me much later.  I can remember sitting in the toilets on  urlLink Surbiton Station , my friend lived in urlLink  Surbiton . I sat in there drinking my bottle of booze and counting out the notes that I had stolen. I think it came to something like three hundred pound. Enough to keep me in booze for a while.   I fancied a change who could I visit next?   I had to think hard about this as my abusers in  urlLink Walton on Thames  now saw that I was completely off my trolley and "barking mad". They did not want anything to do with me. As far as they were concerned I was "disturbed" and it was very probable that I had threatened them at one time or another. I know I had a go a  urlLink Rob Randall  for kicking me out, I had to sleep on the public landing of the flats at least it was dry. I had burnt a fair few other bridges behind me as well.   Where could I go now? I’ll go to urlLink  Bournemouth . There was a bloke down there who I had slept with when visiting with  urlLink Chris Denning  and we used to visit quite a bit. I knew where he worked. I set off to Bournemouth by train. I was pissed by the time  I arrived so the best thing I could do was find a bed and breakfast and sleep it off. I managed to pull myself together and get a bed for the night. I paid in advance and I remember nothing more till the following morning when I woke very early, thankfully there was tea and coffee making facilities in the room. I had no booze left. God I felt rough and I looked at the time five thirty in the morning. I could kill for a drink.   That’s the amazing thing with  urlLink alcoholism  its an  urlLink illness  that tells you that what you are doing to yourself is ok. I just need a little drop to get me going.   The summer season had ended so it was realtively quiet where I was. I had to do something. I had drained the vodka bottle completely and I was getting restless. I went out for a walk for something to occupy my mind whilst I waited for opening time. It killed an hour or so. However luck would have it that some of “the boys” were out early with their bottles of  urlLink sherry  they were dive-bombing for cigarette ends. I would be ok here for  few hours, I had a full packet of cigarettes of which I shared and I was offered some sherry in return. You can always get a drink from other homeless drunks no matter where you go as long as you can show something in return, I promised half a dozen cans of  urlLink Carlsburg Special Brew  that got me admitted to this most elite club of hardened drinkers. I have a nose for booze I can sniff the stuff out. I had to remain reasonably sober to announce that I was here to see Richard and get him to put me up for a while.

						   BAD DAY  Ritual - Stereotyped behavior - A pattern of behavior acquired through frequent repetition.  God I’m sick of feeling the way I do, the days are endless and repetitive. I keep saying to myself “snap out of this, pull yourself together”. “You are no worse off than other men, they cope why cant you“? The answer to that is “I don’t know”.   My days start off with me waking at around 03.30 and from then on I doze and it is here that I start to get flashbacks which triggers me into thinking of my original abuser  urlLink Chris Denning . Its almost a ritual, its every day.   I get up at about 08.30, make the first of many mugs of hot sweet tea, go to my PC and check my mail, check out the  urlLink BBC News  website and then  check  urlLink The Guardian   urlLink Society/Special reports  section looking for news articles with regard Child Protection. I then go to  urlLink malesurvivor  looking for updates I do this about a dozen times throughout the day. The radio  is constantly on  urlLink BBC Radio Five Live , even throughout the night, its there mainly as background noise but my mind is unconsciously scanning the radio for trigger words such as paedophile, childhood sexual abuse, sex offender its constant on hearing those words I would wake immediately and be totally tuned in.   Why have I got this obsession?   I said in a post to  urlLink malesurvivor  recently, It feels that I get my identity through just my abuse and that’s it. It is very nigh impossible to escape all media be it broadcast or written. We have just had the  urlLink Bichard Report  with regard to the  urlLink Soham Village murders . To escape all this I would have to become a hermit, which I feel I very nearly am. I very rarely go out, I have no male friends my own age. I have no friends male of female, full stop   I have acquaintances that have also been abused and I feel that they are getting slightly pissed off with me hogging our occasional group meetings, I would like to go to the pub but cant as I’m a recovering alcoholic with a terrible relapse record. I need to get out ..... of my head every now and again and can only achieve that state of oblivion via booze. My whole life revolves around abuse issues but I look at the stories at  urlLink malesurvivor.org  and think “I wasn’t abused” when I know dam well that "I was".   I’m confused by the way I feel towards my original abuser. I don’t hate him in the “I want to blow his fucking brains out” sense. I feel that towards the others but not for  urlLink Chris Denning . I really believe that  urlLink Denning  cannot help himself don’t ask me why? The others I would like to..... Lets just say that I hope in time that the others all end up fearing their own shadows as I have done on occasions.   In the past and with hindsight, its clear to see that I have abused myself all through my life (alcohol, drugs, straight porn, sex, masturbation). I have attempted suicide on more than one occasion, I’ve hung, I’ve overdosed, I’ve cut, I’ve hit, I’ve burnt myself when things have reached that point where I feel unless I do something drastic I am going to explode.   I was diagnosed as being  emotionally deprived as a child. apparently I was starved of all those important things like encouragement, guidance, support and physical affection like cuddles but I still cant equate the lack of these things to abuse. I suppose I was and must have been a very naughty or a very dysfunctional child.  Chris Denning gave me all those things my parents didn’t, that’s why I went back to him time and time again and I liked him (that screws my head up just that thought alone). Society demands that I hate this guy.....but I cant. I may well be described as vengeful towards the others. I feel that for them but I don’t for  urlLink Denning , Denning actually sent my mother a wreath on the day of her funeral as did another abuser. The night my mother died I was sharing a bed with possibly  urlLink Denning  or one of the others as I was homeless at the time and I was “doing the rounds”.  urlLink Prostitution  in plain everyday English. I have since learnt that this is now classed as  urlLink Survival Sex , I was aged seventeen by this time still illegal. The age of consent for homosexual sex at the time was twenty one, I was originally abused and raped at the age of fourteen, I was drunk.  This is what my days are like? And sometimes I feel like giving up completely and going and getting wrecked somewhere. The stupid thing is I know what will happen. If I do take a drink one of two things or very probably both will happen. I will get arrested for being drunk or end up passing out somewhere and coming too in casualty. I want to get very, very drunk but without the other hassles…..Oh I wish. So to do this safely I usually go away somewhere and lose myself in a large town or city. I book into a reasonably priced hotel with a forty ounce bottle of  urlLink Smirnoff Blue label vodka  and head for the hotel bar. I would spend most of my time drinking Guinness with large vodkas and  urlLink Tia Maria  chasers if I felt like posing. I will then somehow get back to my room and continue drinking my already open bottle of booze, spark up a joint and watch the TV if I can still focus on the thing. Oblivion usually follows and If Im lucky Im found If not .....I either come too or I don’t. That scares me but it still doesn’t stop me taking that first drink as after that the fear evaporates and the world takes on that fuzzy edged warm feeling, false bliss. The last time I booked into a hotel I woke up in the casualty dept of the local hospital the following day, the last thing I remember from the previous night was drinking three of four very large vodkas in between sips of cold  urlLink Guinness .   Shit Im in a mess.  Give  urlLink malesurvivor  a visit

						   We were to be on  urlLink Fair Isle  for just under a month working a six day week eight thirty to five o’clock. The first few days were taken up getting to know the site and how to attach ourselves, with the help of a harness, to safety lines because of health and safety. It was a sheer drop either side. For the first few days I was working on putting some test trenches in on the western extremity of the site nothing in there. I was then transferred to a  urlLink small rampart  to the north that needed opening so it was out with the spades and cut a three meter square of  turf. The cutting back of turf revealed a number of strategically  placed large stones to act as revetments it also revealed a large amount of dark organic material almost peat like. That was bagged for environmental investigation back at Birmingham that’s how the days went until I was asked to help locate a wall buried in a nearby garden. I was to show one of the students how to lay out twenty metre grids and to use the  urlLink Geoscan RM15 . That took one morning and the immediate results on the read out suggested there were high signals of resistivity hinting that there was  something there underneath the leeside of the house. The results on interpretation confirmed that we had located our target.   It was a good half hours walk back to the  urlLink Landberg site  but it was eventful, we had to dodge the forever diving and screeching Terns and Skuas. The student I was with got a fair old crack on the back of his head trying to dodge one of these suicidal birds.   It was an interesting walk back we passed some of the islanders rounding up some sheep for shearing all done with hand clippers and gentleness, the handlers were constantly talking to their charges in hushed tones. The sheep were completely relaxed it was uncanny. We arrived back at the site just in time for lunch. I carried on cleaning back the small rampart. Throughout the time we were on Fair Isle I had a go at most things. I assisted with the recording of the structure at the  urlLink top of the site , I was also to excavate up here as well and uncovered some nice finds in the shape of a  urlLink prehistoric oil lamp , just a little bigger than an Avacado, some very  nice sherds of  urlLink Iron Age pottery  (very coarse) and a wonderful example of an  urlLink Iron Age Quernstone .  The  urlLink weather on Fair Isle  can only be described as changeable. You can actually have all four seasons in one afternoon on the island. It could be brilliant sunshine one minute and the next you would be completely lost in fog and Im pretty sure I can remember sleet falling on one particular day as well. Fog was an occupational hazard as was the fog horn on the neighboring  urlLink lighthouse , which used to remind me every two minutes all through the night and sometimes throughout the day, but you soon got used to that. The evenings were spent a number of ways, some would go out for a walk some would read or listen to their walkmans. Someone had brought a guitar so sing along with us type evenings were fun, we all had to write up our daily journal as they would be looked at on return to the  urlLink Institute . Toward the end of our stay we held an opening evening where the islanders were all invited to have look at the finds and information we had uncovered at the Landberg Promontory Fort. Food was to be supplied but I refused to do it (I told them this before we left…...I’m not cooking) although I did supervise the making of pizza dough and on amother occasion we were given a load of free fish, which I was asked to gut and take the heads off with a very blunt wood axe, I knew I should have brought my knives! I obliged suggesting it be poached in white wine with a  urlLink rustic tomato and onion con-casse (roughly chopped) , anything with wine in would go down well with the students. Im not a great lover of fish unless its wrapped in batter, although I am partial to  urlLink grilled Dover sole  as I have only ever had it once and enjoyed it immensely. I had recently gutted and portioned a  urlLink pike  that my son in law had caught. I cooked it and stank the house out, it smelt disgusting it was even worse than roasting pheasants, which makes me heave at the best of times, this stuff smelt similar so I politely passed on that one.   On my two days off I went off on my own and wandered all over the place and visited the small  urlLink Kirk  on the eastern side of the island. I had also been told that there was the air frame of a German World War Two,  urlLink Heinkel 111 H-2  aircraft together with the remains ( urlLink 1   urlLink 2   urlLink 3 ) of  its two  urlLink Junkers Jumo 211D  engine’s ( urlLink 1 ) just off the main road. It didn’t take long to locate it and it took even less to capture some photographs whilst dodging a very irate Tern family that had nested on the brow of the bank to my right. I would get to hear the story first hand from one of the Islanders that attended our open evening. I was looking forward to that. The open evening was a great success.    urlLink Heinkel crash article.   Another evening we played football by the lighthouse where I went and pulled something in my back Im not as young as I used to be and boy did I feel it after the game, the following day I couldn’t move. I spent the next four days taking it easy so I helped out with the finds process washing, drying and labeling with numerous student colleagues who got press ganged into doing it. I quite enjoyed it as I love doing things like this. I could loose myself once again.   It was because of my back I didn’t go along to a  urlLink “ceilidh”  a regular occurrence in these parts arranged by the locals. It can involve a lot of spirits being drunk and I didn’t fancy “breaking out” or going on the piss this far from home although one of the supervisors was sent back to Shetland with a suspected broken finger after playing football, other than that everything went off ok on the island.   The final night party went off as well, everybody turned up including a journalsit from  urlLink The Shetland times . A good time was had by all with "live" music supplied by Richard & The Ramparts, the evening ended with us all sitting around a large bonfire on the shore drinking (in my case hot, sweet tea).   I thoroughly enjoyed all of the excavation process, although I would be grateful for a bath and a decent shave on arriving home. I  had also missed the wife,  urlLink “Tess”  and  urlLink “Olie”.  The trip back to Shetland was undertaken with no problems except for a bank of fog that we hit ten miles north of North Haven, about four hours later we arrived at Sumburgh Head and got the bus back into Lerwick.   Our ferry back to Aberdeen would be departing at four so we had plenty of time. I went straight to the bus station as that had the aptly named Viking café on its upper level and had a  urlLink full English breakfast  (minus the  urlLink black pudding ) complete with the ever present cup of tea, quite a few of the other students decided to get stuck into some decent grub for what seemed like the first time in ages as well.  Suitably stuffed I shared a taxi up to the ferry terminal and we were one of the first to go onboard. We would be getting back to Aberdeen at around ten the following morning. I slept for a good part as the fog horn on Fair Isle decided to kick in during the early hours so I had a disturbed nights kip. The passage back to Aberdeen went without any hitches and we arrived bang on time. We hired two taxis and off to Aberdeen station we went. The next train back to Birmingham was due to depart at eleven o’clock. We all managed to get a seat on what turned out to be a very crowded train. I would be changing at Crewe to catch the train back home. That was it. I had got through it and remained sober. That was good enough for me.  Need Support?

						   Very nearly everything I have enjoyed in the past be that food, drink, relationships or sex has usually ended up being a problem for me. I am your typical addictive personality type and obsessive. As a child I was obsessed with  urlLink Quatermass II  and  urlLink Doctor Who  type monsters living under my bed, my friend Steve who lived in the tumble drier, I collected obsessively very politically incorrect war comics that were all the rage when aged about seven or eight. The Quatermass monsters lived under my bed till I was about eight or nine. I always had to have the landing light left on when going to bed. I became obsessive with  urlLink Superman comics , American Civil War cards, football,  urlLink Johnny Quest ,  urlLink Thunderbirds  and  urlLink Heinz Baked Beans  later on it would be bands and music, archaeology, child protection issues and paedophiles.&nbsp;Oh yes and I cant leave out masturbation.   Nearly every relationship I have had has been obsessive on my behalf and when those very dysfunctional relationships have ended. I would not let go of them and would have great trouble believing and accepting that that particular relationship was now over. What would I do? I would go on the piss, a good excuse that one and invariably I would end up in trouble with the police, wake up on a bus, in a bus station or phone box or towards the end of my drinking, in hospital.   My obsessions today are my abusers all of them, paedophiles and childhood sexual abuse. In the recent past I have had problems with straight porn, bathing and showering. Other less serious obsessions are the band  urlLink Yes  and their music,  urlLink The Who , the film  urlLink Quadrophenia   urlLink HobNob biscuits , hot sweet tea,  urlLink Lardy cake , gravy and mashed potato. Occasionally I will make myself sick and it has been suggested that I may be having some problems with some type of urlLink  Bulimia  or  urlLink Obsessive Compulsive Disorder &nbsp;  Must not forget the  urlLink booze .   I’m obsessive in wanting to get my side of the story told as I have yet to appear in a court of law and from what I can gather you very rarely get to tell your side of things, not the whole story. I would have liked the opportunity to give a witness or  urlLink victim impact statement  which apparently is a witnesses right. It does not look likely that I am going to achieve that goal of speaking in open court just how this past abuse has affected me.   My whole day is spent unconsciously looking for triggers, Im constantly on my guard. If I smell after shave I’m reminded of Denning. If I hear Street Fighting Man by  urlLink The Rolling Stones  I’m reminded of Denning. Beefeater Gin and Cutty Sark scotch reminds me of  urlLink Rob Randall  and Randall reminds me of  urlLink Charles Dickens   urlLink Fagin  (played by  urlLink Alec Guinness ) for some obscure reason. But I think I may have solved that    urlLink Fagin  is a figure of disgust I’m pretty sure that may have something to do with it.   The list goes on. Plumrose tinned pate, the phrase “Beautiful Boys” and  urlLink The Beatles   urlLink Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band  reminds me of Corday. I hear  urlLink Sarah Payne  and  urlLink Milly Dowler  mentioned in the news and I’m reminded of all the paedophiles that operated out of  urlLink The Hop  and addresses in and around the Walton on Thames area.   I hear of Childhood Sexual Abuse stories in the media, I am reminded of my own and I think to myself “Is this ever going to end”? I know the answer to that one. In short "no"!   I am obsessed with all my diagnosed illnesses and addictions I find them fascinating subjects they give me clues to who I actually am. This has a downside to it however and I suspect I’m a hypochondriac and I also suspect that was due to my interest in the  urlLink British National Formulary  which I used to read avidly looking for drugs that I could self prescribe when visiting different doctors throughout the country.   Talking of drugs I saw my Consultant Psychiatrist this morning and guess what? I’m back on  urlLink Prozac  as my depression has deepened by all accounts, I know my mood swings are all over the place and I’m bursting into tears at the merest thought of my old dog  urlLink “Oliver”  who I had to have put to sleep just before Christmas of last year. Its quite unnerving is the crying as it comes out of knowhere. I really do miss that dog, I knew I would but not to this extent.   Going back onto  urlLink Prozac  should prove fun as I have to gradually withdraw from the  urlLink Clomipramine  and be completely free of it before commencing on  urlLink Fluoxetine Hydrochloride . I hope I don’t have any acute mood swings while coming off and going onto the other as its because of these negative moods that I usually go on the piss.

						   The Fair Isle crew, all ten of us had to meet at the ferry terminal at  urlLink Aberdeen . I took a couple of days to get up there as I hate rushing. I stayed in the  urlLink Youth Hostel  for a night or two. I went to view  the  urlLink Maritime Museum  and visited a couple of churches. We all met up in the right place at the right time and boarded the ferry to  urlLink Shetland .   No problem there so I thought.   However within a few hours of setting off on our two hundred and eleven mile jaunt around the North Sea we ran straight into a gale and I spent the next sixteen hours being sick like I have never been sick before not without at least a bottle and a half of Vodka inside of me.  Every time I moved I threw up. I was dry wretching in the end with nothing but air coming up and that can get quite painful after a while. Then the most amazing thing happened. As the ferry entered calmer waters the sea sickness stopped just like that. It was immediate with no ill effect other than feeling that I had gone twelve rounds with  urlLink Frank Bruno . I was exhausted. We disembarked at  urlLink Lerwick  and found that due to the bad weather our transport to  urlLink Fair Isle  was still stuck in harbour on Fair Isle and would not be able to make the crossing for the next couple of days at least. We were stuck.   As luck would have it the team on Fair Isle had informed the  urlLink Youth Hostel  on Shetland that ten archaeology students were coming their way. Compared to the Youth Hostel in Aberdeen the  urlLink Youth Hostel at Lerwick  was five star luxury, it also served decent food. We did a tour into Lerwick to have a look around. The weather was now dry and sunny.   Was it me or where there a large number of people of Chinese origin on Shetland? Or was I just imagining it?   The two days passed quickly when we were told that our transport was able to make the crossing from Fair Isle to Shetland and we were to get to  urlLink Sumburgh Head   at the southern end of the island so as to pick up the small ferry  urlLink "The Good Shepherd"  to take us the twenty four miles to Fair Isle. I had my reservations about this crossing but I had nothing to worry about, the North Sea was like a mill pond and a very pleasant trip it was too. After three or four hours we arrived at North Haven opposite where we were to excavate  urlLink The Landberg Promontory Fort . We disembarked, climbed into a van and made our way to our accommodation. It was only later that we found out it was a  urlLink converted fish gutting shed  (building in middle of photograph). It was however very comfortable and it was nice to get away from the television as the power was only on for so many hours a day. That proved not to be a problem as there was always plenty of hot water on tap to have a shower after a days excavating. It was comfortable and dry after getting our sleeping instructions we dumped our kit off and off we went for a tour of the Island.   It would be a “good idea” if some of us took ranging poles along we were told. We would find out what for within the next half hour. We headed west over ancient field systems that contained some nice examples of narrow  urlLink ridge and furrow  markings.   This is where the ranging poles came in handy to keep the diving  urlLink Skuas  and  urlLink Terns  at bay, you could actually hear the swoosh of air as they passed over head, some of them came at you at knee height and just before making contact fly vertically straight up. Not surprising really as we were walking through their nesting sites. We made our way to numerous  urlLink burnt mounds  passed over the aircraft runway and through old Ministry of Defence sites scattered throughout the  island and it was as we neared the end of our tour that I spotted a complete  urlLink rabbit skull  bleached white by the sun, rain and wind. I picked it up bagged it and it sits on my desk at home. We finished our tour at the  urlLink bird observatory  where just over the road was where we were to get our first proper look at the Landberg Promontory Fort. It was immediately obvious why this place needed excavating and recording it was rapidly disappearing into the North Sea on two sides as the name suggest it was a finger of land  that projected out to sea for about eighty meters or so, it was also being destroyed by a colony of  urlLink Puffins  and a warren of rabbits.   After that it was back to our billet where we sorted some food supplies out. The one shop made a fortune out of us students especially on booze. Thankfully I was not partaking so it would cost me very little. There was one  urlLink public phone box  for the whole island that was on the  urlLink main and only road . This was weird I had never been away stone cold sober before and I did have a couple of cravings but they were no real problem. Little did I know that the  urlLink National Criminal Intelligence Service  were assisting  the police in the Czech Republic in the investigation that would eventually lead to the arrest of Chris Denning,  urlLink “for running a paedophile ring and having sex with children as young as ten” (Kate Connolly, The Guardian 04 05 1999)     Little did I know that this time the following year I would feel like I was going mad.

						   The feeling I get when  urlLink excavating  something that has lain hidden for a thousand plus years is one of acute curiosity and excitement, I cannot really put it into words except to say. “It is one hell of a buzz“! Lets put it this way, it gives me a rush of such a size that if the feeling was bottled it would be classed as “especially strong“. Excavating is the most wonderful feeling in the world. I enter a place where I am totally in control, I dictate how fast I should go and which is the best way to get this the object out of  its context, after recording for the first time in hundreds perhaps thousands of years. I can shut off and work in any condition World War III could be breaking out behind me and I would be oblivious. Even my abusers loose their grip on me  for the duration. Just me my trowl, finds tray, brush and kneeler.   Its very addictive is excavating and can be bloody hard work. My first experience was a year or so before getting to University and it was local to me I had contacted the project archaeologist and got him to take me on as a volunteer, I was willing to do anything and I was.   I can remember walking down the hill through a large paddock out into an empty field. to where the site was situated. There had been excavating going on  all summer as it was an training excavation featuring undergraduates from differing universities but mainly Birmingham. The undergraduates had managed to uncover a  urlLink bath house  complex with a  urlLink hypocaust  heating system and adjoined buildings.   My first job on an archaeological site was to cut turf and mattock down  a few cms and sieve any loose soil from that area and wheel it away to the spoil heap. It was here I made my first ever discovery. It went clink on my trowel. It was a nail, a  urlLink Romano-British  nail from about the 3rd century AD.   This was what it was all about.   The imagination kicks in, who made it and where? How did they come to be working here? Who built the villa? Where they important? The questions can sometimes swamp you.   I know it sounds daft but to me that nail was priceless. I have made a special investigation into what archaeologists remember of their first find. They could usually tell me the most exciting thing they had discovered but not their first. Strange that   I spent two days trowling back and on the third day I was asked if I could help with the  urlLink resistively survey  going on back at the main site of  urlLink Wroxeter ? “Yep that was no problem”. I was hardly going to refuse, this was the beginning of a lot of days out in the field well after the excavating at  urlLink Whitely Grange  had finished for the season. It was mainly a three man job although it can be done with two but that is a real pain in the bum. I even enjoyed learning how to use a  urlLink theodolite  and managed to put in a few grids in myself whilst being supervised. I enjoyed that. This was at the forefront of archaeological research and the site was visited by different archaeologists from all over the world testing their cutting edge technology because of  urlLink Wroxeters  known street plan. Our resistivity team was even featured in  urlLink The Wall Street Journal  technology magazine called  urlLink "Wired".  A big double page spread was given over to the technologies used at Wroxeter. Very interesting article with some good photographs. That went up on the notice board back at Birmingham Archaeology. I got quite attached to my  urlLink Geoscan   urlLink RM4  and  urlLink RM15  although I was reunited with another RM15 on  urlLink Fair Isle  for a couple of days.  I spent another two seasons working as a volunteer and as a student at  urlLink Whitely Grange  I took part in excavating a Romano-British  urlLink swimming pool . That took three days and for three days I was locked into what I was doing it was pure bliss, even excavating  urlLink painted wall plaster   that was still in situ from the base of the pool walls.   From there I went to help excavate a four and a half meter square  urlLink mosaic  that had revealed itself. Some people spend their whole lives excavating and never get to work on a  urlLink mosaic , this was my second season. The whole experience was unreal in itself even when it had to be covered up after the dig was finished it had to be done in a certain way so as protect it till the day comes when another researcher wants to dig it up again. Working on this was pure magic and it was then I thought to myself then that I would love to do this for the rest of my days.  The urlLink  mosaic  looked wonderful when fully excavated although the colors started to fade after a few days in bright direct sunlight   I still had to do my first year training dig and that was to be on  urlLink Fair Isle  a small island in the middle of the North Sea. I had put my name down for that months previous. It must have been my  urlLink Celtic  roots drawing me there.   Recovery with help  urlLink malesurvivor.org

						   I had been sober for about sixteen months and I was beginning to realize that something quite traumatic had happened to me during my adolescent years. It was only on hearing that Denning had been arrested in the  urlLink Czech Republic  for sexually abusing underage boys that my mind started to race. It was then that my mind clicked and I started to recall situations, conversations and smells. It was stupid I was remembering things like putting sugar in frozen garden peas whilst cooking that would trip my mind back to nineteen seventy one. That’s a Denning habit he may well have been assaulting you but he would be horrified if you were hungry. He fed you either at his house from a menu of  urlLink Birdseye  burgers whole new potatoes deep fried and garden peas with sugar in. There was always a couple of bottles of coke in it or he would take me to the steak house which was at Monument Green just two minutes away from Denning’s house on the outskirts of Weybridge, Surrey.   The first thing to go was my sleep pattern as I would lie awake at night listening to the radio my mind running through my memories of the early seventies it was if I was reliving everything again this was the onset of graphical urlLink  flashbacks ,  urlLink panic attacks  and  urlLink triggers . My whole system was screaming out for a drink just so I could sleep   Flashbacks and triggers were new to me, they were scary and the worst was when a tutor referred to his co-author of a book as his “bum-chum”. It didn’t matter that  I knew it was a joke the overriding feeling I got was one of absolute despair. My first thought was “what does he know about me”? As to what the tutorial was about I cannot for the life of me remember. I know I came out of his office and went and sat in the staff toilets where I sat shaking and being sick for a half hour or so. I felt exhausted and the tape in my mind was stuck on repeat it kept saying “you know you were abused but who is going to believe you”? “You an ex drunk with a police record.”  Things were going well at Uni but the more I thought of  urlLink Denning  the more concerned I got, at this time paedophillia was all over the press. It was impossible to escape it. It was also the time of the  urlLink North Wales Children’s home scandal  that was then followed by the  urlLink Waterhouse Inquiry  and the publishing of the subsequent  urlLink Waterhouse report . Nineteen ninety seven also saw the  urlLink Sex Offenders Register  come into operation. Childhood sexual abuse in the news was not far off saturation point. By two thousand a Sunday tabloid the  urlLink News of the World  decided to start a  urlLink name and shame policy  with regard to convicted paedophiles after the tragic  urlLink Sarah Payne murder . The Payne family came from Hersham I had lived there when in a very dysfunctional relationship and Hersham was the next town along from Walton on Thames. A large number of people from Hersham attended the  urlLink Walton Hop  Disco run by ex swimming pool coffee bar owner and mini pop impresario  urlLink Deniz Corday .    This naming and shaming sparked off some mini riots especially on  the  urlLink Paulsgrave estate , Portsmouth. The policy of the  urlLink News of the World’s  naming and shaming had some positive outcomes though. The Government in the shape of the Home Secretary  was quite willing to talk about sex offenders in the community but no way were we going to get a US style  urlLink Sarah’s Law  based on  urlLink Megan’s Law  because of the risk of vigilantes taking the law into their own hands. I hope in time that will change. I think as a grandparent I deserve to know who are past offenders and those who are at risk of offending again. Paedophillia was very rarely out of the news. Until you start actually researching the subject you just do not realize just how often it is mentioned on news reports or inside the daily newspapers.  I was finding it increasingly hard to concentrate on my studies. I am a news junkie which does not help matters the radio is stuck permanently on  urlLink BBC Radio Five Live . I was becoming obsessed with my abusers and they were all constantly there at the forefront of my mind. The pressure was increasing and I was getting very short tempered. It wasn’t too bad if I had an essay to do as I would get my concentration totally focused on the subject and do away with all the other crap. I could do this and I have since found out that it is known as  urlLink “numbing out”  or in my words overdosing on information or any outside seperate stimuli like music. I continued on this schedule for months until I flipped at home and started to burn myself again . I was just full of rage it was either burn myself or go on the piss, my natural reaction.   I was tired and had just got a bollocking from a very experienced archaeologist  and that just about put the top on it. It wasn’t planned, its just that circumstances presented themselves. I wished out loud saying “I wish I could have used this bit of kit”,  urlLink Ground Penetrating Radar  (GPR) no less, “on my site” that was going to feature in my dissertation. The three operators were interested in my site, a  urlLink medieval moated site  that has been continually occupied from the  urlLink Iron Age . It was on a private estate that I had permission from the owner who as luck would have it was a history nut so I was given access to the complete estate. The three GPR operatives two Japanese and one American academics wanted to see a bit of the local countryside so it was arranged to see my site that late afternoon. I had no idea what a row this would cause. I was told by one of the eminent archaeologists colleagues that he wanted to “ring my neck”. Memories of my fathers humiliation sessions returned with a new found vigor. I still had no idea the following day when I was passed the results of the small survey, nothing was said. I knew nothing about it still when I entered the archaeological unit the following Monday. I was pulled to one side by another eminent archaeologist asking “Did I get the letter”? “No what letter”? “You are being charged the going rate for using the radar”. I wasn’t worried all that much about it but my wife opens all my mail and she would be pretty concerned at how I was going to react to this demand. A carbon copy had been sent to the Head of the Archaeology and Antiquity Institute just to round things off nicely.  The archaeologist who wanted to wring my neck was used to dealing with students aged eighteen plus. I think I am slightly older than him and that I think tempered his mood and made him think twice about slinging his weight around. The thing that pissed me off the most is the suspicion that he would have done exactly the same if the opportunity had presented itself when he was a student. I have even seen him persuade the  urlLink RAF  to take some aerial photographs of the site at  urlLink Whitley Grange , now that does take some front.  I spoke with the head of department and he could see that I was pretty wound up about the bill being sent through, he talked me down. I still didn’t flip that was to happen later when I got home. My wife refused to show the letter to me as she said “you will go potty if you read it“. So I pushed it all down again till I started burning myself. I had to do something with my anger and I didn’t want to drink really, the thought was nice but that was about it. I was reminded of my last episode of withdrawl’s. No I didn’t want to go through that again even though I wanted oblivion just for some peace and quiet. The feeling of wanting oblivion was overwhelming and at times it took my mind off my abusers but the more I tried to put it them out of my mind the more they would haunt me. I was becoming a nervous wreck. My digestive system was playing up again and my self confidence was slowly ebbing away. I was mentally knackered.

						   From about the age of seven I have held an interest in  urlLink archaeology . I have long felt that  urlLink history  was so far removed from reality that it couldn’t possibly touch me.   Oh how wrong I was.   I was introduced to this most wonderful of subjects purely by accident by way of the local library which was at the back of the then village hall. It was a small square room with a librarians post behind a four sided counter. I must have been looking in a history section when I pulled out this book which had beautiful colored illustrations throughout of the  urlLink Ancient Egyptians . On taking it back home it was perused over by my father. My father then looked at me and said “if you are dreaming of becoming an archaeologist forget it that sort of thing does not happen to the likes of us”.   I don’t understand my father at all, later on he would say “you are not going to work on a building site either" that was too beneath us according to him. My headmaster at secondary school said that “I would be hard pushed to get any job, I may touch lucky and become a dustman“. Talk about confused. I thought school was there to encourage.   Even in my most muddled and drunk times I would home in on that word on hearing it on the television or radio.   The time came when I was off booze and I was staying off. I was fed up with staying at home and doing nothing. I thought I could go back to school just to fill the time. So I applied to do an  urlLink Access  course at a local college. It was the best thing I had ever done. It opened up a whole new world to me. No longer was I being told that becoming an archaeologist was impossible. I knew within a week of the course starting that I had done the right thing I couldn’t wait for home work assignments. The whole study process enthralled me.   The history part of the programme was very enjoyable and we concentrated on an unglamorous subject the  urlLink Industrial Revolution  I thoroughly enjoyed it as I did the sociology segment. That concentrated on the class system and education. That introduced me to the writers urlLink  Jack London  and  urlLink George Orwell  plus I had my own experiences of homelessness, booze, prostitution and I know what its like to be “in the gutter”. The math’s module continued to scare the living daylights out of me, but it was imperative that I do better than average. I didn’t hold out much hope though, that really bothered me.   I didn’t have to take the Information Technology module as I had produced a newsletter type document for the tutor and was told I had covered everything that he would talk about. English literature was fun as well I had never done any  urlLink Shakespeare  before, it certainly was different to anything else I had experienced. From this point I have had a great interest in education especially the education of my grandchildren. I would do it all again and would encourage anyone considering returning to education, to go for it, you will surprise yourself. I was asked at interview at the college what did I ultimately want to do with my  urlLink Access  qualification. I wanted to go to University to study archaeology. I was told to write away and get some prospectus from a selection of universities.   After a while I decided on my five preferences. Starting with the  urlLink University Of Birmingham ,  urlLink University College London , urlLink  Bradford University , urlLink  Bristol  and  urlLink York . I was granted three interviews by Birmingham, UCL and Bradford. It was no go with Bristol as expected and the same with York.   My interview at Birmingham was scheduled for May ninety six. I worked really hard at my math’s but was still getting nowhere fast. I’m not a confident person when it comes to figure work I don’t trust the information that I put into a calculator, Im hopeless at remembering formulas for mathematical problems and I can just about subtract only then with the aid of a calculator. My interviews at Birmingham, UCL and Bradford went well and I was conditionally accepted at all of them. I couldn’t believe it these learned people wanted me to come to their University it was quite unlike anything I had experienced before (or since).   The condition put on me was that I pass my math’s module.   At that time I chose to go to Bradford as they had the countries foremost expert in  urlLink Forensic Archaeology   urlLink Dr. John Hunter  now Professor at the  urlLink Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity,  University of Birmingham. This move to Bradford was a big mistake on my behalf the course was good but it was the place I hated. Everything seemed so close together it was somewhat claustrophobic. I had also found out somewhat late that John Hunter had been offered the chair at Birmingham at the end of the academic year. I transferred with help of Professor Hunter and others whom I had excavated with whilst a volunteer with the  urlLink Wroxeter Hinterland Project .   I missed only a few days of the course at Birmingham and felt more comfortable commuting to Birmingham every day and from what would happen in the November of  nineteen ninety seven, it was a bloody good thing I did transfer from Bradford as there would have been one thing that could have ruined it and that was booze, no one would know, I foolishly told myself but I chose not too, a rarity for me.  Every thing went fine  and then the news broke that  urlLink Gary Glitter  had been  arrested by the police for downloading Child Pornography onto his computer. That did it my mind went into overdrive and I thought  urlLink Bell records  closely followed by the name of  urlLink Chris Denning  (see one). I pushed it as best I could into the back of my mind. Glitter I hasten to add was sentenced to four months in prison. He served two.    urlLink malesurvivor ... Always there

						   The relationship with my father and mother was never close. I have often asked myself the question “was I a mistake”? Just in asking that question points to something not being quite right within the family. The only thing my mother and I had in common was a love of music and a love of history she also had a peculiar sense of the humor, very dry for  a woman, whereas my sense of humor is decidedly warped. This sense of fun that my mother possessed was stifled by my fathers complete lack of a sense of humor and somewhat serious outlook on life.   If anyone in our family was materialistic it was my father so much so that we very often didn’t see him during the week as he would commute back from London, get changed and go out to work at one of the cash in hand type jobs he had at one time or another. He has worked part-time as a barman, a baker, a chef, why did we need all this money? He was on a very good salary. I can remember my Mum winning at a weekly bingo session and it was then that I heard one of our neighbours say "There you go! Money goes to money".  There is/are a lot of things I don’t know about my father. It was only a couple of years ago that I found out that my old man was/is a racist and that alone was the main reason for moving from  urlLink Tooting , South London. That’s how close we were. I don’t even know his political leanings, right wing obviously.   I say "we were" in the past tense, that’s fine by me, situation normal. My relationship with my father finished again about a eighteen months ago at my doing. I have no desire at all to meet with or talk to my father ever again, he is as distant as ever and I hope it stays that way. I have tried to make my peace with him and I have done my bit. He is either being selective with his memories again or he is going senile. I have carried enough of this baggage for long enough and I dump it all but where?.   I still think I’m hopeless even though I also know I’m capable of some selective things to quite a high standard. I’m quite a good chef but I hate cooking. Cooking  takes confidence and my confidence has taken a bit of a beating over the last forty odd years. I’m a bloody good  urlLink archaeological excavator , but with my mental health record its impossible to find anyone willing to give me a go.   The times I have thought to myself “Am I doing the right thing” in disclosing what went on during the early seventies in and around  addresses in the “stockbrokers belt” of urlLink  Walton on Thames and Weybridge .  I had to take the fact onboard that I was going to upset a lot of peoples lives in the sense that I knew there are survivors living in those two towns and any investigation into an alleged paedophile ring operating out of the  urlLink Walton Hop  would have caused quite a few hearts to skip a beat, especially so when the story originally broke.   I lived like that for years and know that “oh my god what if my friends find out about my abuse” feeling very well. This one reason was very nearly the cause of me withdrawing any complaints against my abusers but thank god I didn’t listen to that little voice in the back of my mind which was forever saying “are you sure you want to go through with this”? Yes “I was” I had lived with these memories long enough. I had to go through with it for my own self preservation and suicide is not painless, I know, I’ve tried. My  natural instinct is to get completely  urlLink rat-arsed  an option no longer open to me unless I decide to go on a full blown  urlLink bender  which with my track record of sobriety was/is more than likely. I risk everything if I go on the piss separation from my wife, my step daughters and my grandchildren, but the thoughts and feelings I get with associated  urlLink triggers  and  urlLink flashbacks  just gets too much sometimes and I need time out (of my head).   Im going through a crisis at the moment I want a drink and I’m very short tempered and that is a bad sign. Im  urlLink hyper-vigilant . And I have that great big knot of  urlLink anger  is sitting where it usually does in the pit of my stomach and I just want to scream………At anything.   I want to change the way I feel. The trouble is with booze is once I start I cant stop and I will “drink till I drop down” ( urlLink The Who  -  urlLink Quadrophenia ) a la  urlLink Doctor Jimmy  and end up passed out somewhere usually an Accident & Emergency department somewhere. Buses appear to be a favorite place to “crash out” my last count was five.  Visit  urlLink malesurvivor.org

						   I have been asked to write this section of the blog from a partner’s perspective of living with an Adult Survivor of Childhood Sexual Abuse. I will try to tell you how it is as truthfully as possible. I hope other partners find this segment useful and can identify with it, you will then know you are not alone.  To begin with you are thrown headlong into a situation that is not of your making, all these terrible things happened before you knew your partner. That doesn’t take away the fact that Childhood Sexual Abuse is going to change your life too. You are on a roller coaster and you can’t get off. There is a feeling off total inadequacy, there is anger, fear, hurt and rejection to contend with as well.  There was never a time when I did not believe Dan that these terrible things had happened to him, whether this helped me to deal with everything, I really don’t know.  There is a saying in  urlLink Alcoholics Anonymous  that alcoholism is a family illness I can certainly tell you that that is true. I think it is safe to say that Childhood Sexual Abuse is also a family illness. While your partner is trying to come to terms with the things that happened in their past, they will be isolating themselves from the present. This puts considerable pressure on you to try to keep normal every day things going. I found it really hard trying to juggle Dan’s needs and other family commitments and I am sure that the rest of the family did not understand that I was under so much stress. I can only apologize to them if they feel they have not had the time they rightly deserve. I hope that if they ever read this part of the blog they will understand a little bit better.  When I first met Dan I knew that he was an alcoholic and that he was also addicted to some prescribed drugs. For the first four years of our relationship it was one long round of watching him try to kill himself with the aid of booze and pills, the feeling of total helplessness is not something I would wish on anybody. I always felt that there was more to it than just alcoholism, trying to get any of the doctors and psychiatrists to look beyond the booze and pill popping was another thing. It took me four years of constant arguments to finally get them to acknowledge that he was suffering from Clinical Depression.       For about six years after Dan stopped drinking our lives carried on in some sort of normality. We still had periods of depression when nothing I said or did was right and sometimes I felt I was walking on eggshells, but for most of the time things were going ok.  Dan told me about the abuse early on in our relationship, we talked about it maybe not in too much detail, at this point, he seemed to be coping with it. I now realize it was the booze that was masking his feelings. Over the years when Dan has stopped drinking we talked about the abuse and the possibility of doing something about it, but what? We had no idea at this point. As I have said before things were ticking over fairly well and so I think it’s fair to say that neither of us wanted to rock the boat, that is until the year of 1997 when the  urlLink Gary Glitter  and then later the  urlLink Chris Denning  cases hit the media. It was then that our lives changed and all hell broke loose.      If I thought that living with Dan drinking was hard then living with him through the affects of Childhood Sexual Abuse was going to be ten times worse. I have asked myself many times the question “if I had known then how bad it was going to be would I have stayed?” The answer is I really don’t know. I do know that it has taken it’s toll on me, it has taken all my patience, compassion, understanding and hidden strengths that I did not know I had. It has been a very steep learning curve and maybe I will become a better person for it. The way I have often described the last few years is it’s like doing a life sentence for a crime you have not committed without hope of parole. I think at some points I have really begun to doubt my own sanity.  From the time that Dan read the reports of the  urlLink Chris Denning  trial in Prague life became a nightmare, from then on I had no idea what mood he would be in from one minute to the next. For days on end he would stay in bed, I could not communicate with him at all during these periods. The feeling of helplessness at these times was almost too much to bare. When he was up from his bed, it was like living with a total stranger the mood swings were unbelievable, they could change from one minute being as high as a kite to the next being in the depth of despair. The night-time was the worst; as soon as we went to bed he would get a look of such panic, and say he was too scared to go to sleep. That was when he wanted to talk, that was when I was tired. What can you say to somebody when they are in such a state, so talk we did for hours and hours until the wee small hours of the morning. This was not just one night this was every night for months and months. When he did finally go to sleep the light and radio had to be on all night. The radio is still on all night even to this day, that I have got used to. The following day he would stay in bed till at least lunchtime, I was up at the usual time, somebody had to look after the dogs, do the shopping, washing cleaning and all the other every day to day things. After months of this you can imagine how tired I was, how I kept going I do not know, those hidden strengths maybe. The constant need for attention and reassurance is very hard, the same questions kept spinning in my head “am I doing the right thing? “ And “will I get through this?” Sometimes I felt like making a tape recording and leaving it on continuously, “everything would be fine”, I don’t even know if I believed it at that time.  As the months past I began to think that I was living with a child, or maybe an adolescent. The temper tantrums, selfishness, the argumentative attitude, the me, me, me, not to mention the constant referral to Child Abuse, it was a living hell. On the few occasions I said that I was also having a hard time trying to cope with everything, I was told or more often than not yelled at “that I had not been abused so how the hell did I know what it was like”. Maybe I had not been abused, but I certainly know what it’s like to be a partner of a Sexually Abused Child, I was living with it 24/7 and I can defiantly tell you it’s no fun. The times I’ve wanted to shout “what about me and what it’s doing to me?” Dan could not or would not accept that my life was also in turmoil, he was so wrapped up in himself. I had to be on call 24 hours a day for his needs but when it came to giving me support he was just not there, that hurt, and still hurts. Sometimes I felt that he was just wallowing in self-pity. Having read books on Childhood Sexual Abuse I now know this is quite normal behavior. Unfortunately knowing it was normal still did not take away the hurt.  The physical side of our relationship is completely none existent. The feeling of rejection was probably one of the hardest things to bare, I think that I will carry those scars for a long time to come. It got to the stage that I could not even put my arms around him for fear that he would just freeze and go into a sense of panic. If I mentioned the word sex I thought world war three was about to begin. When you have been rejected a few times a self-preservation system comes in and you are too scared to try again. Sometimes I felt that the lights were on but there was nobody at home. How I coped with this I still have no idea. I suppose I just muddled through, although there were times when I cried and cried. Never in front of Dan, that was another thing he could not handle, it was ok for him to show emotion usually by shouting but not for me. My darkest times were probably spent in the bath the only place I could let go. The mood swings, selfishness, obsessions, tantrums, fears and the lack of taking any responsibility I could handle but the physical rejection was just too much to bare.  The constant having to watch what you say is in itself very warring. Things said in all innocence can cause  urlLink triggers  and  urlLink flashbacks .  I remember the time I mentioned that I thought that satin sheets were the height of luxury the look that came over his face sent me looking for my hard hat again! The constant feeling of having to be on your guard is very hard, maybe for a day or two it’s ok but when it goes on for weeks and months it’s unbearable, it’s at these times you think maybe you are going insane. Where do you go to get any help? To say there is very little help out there for partners of Childhood Sexual Abuse Survivors is an understatement. There is not any that I have found. If you can afford to pay for therapy maybe you can get some help, if you can’t like me it’s neigh on impossible.  The constant obsession with paedophiles and any mention of Childhood Sexual Abuse was a nightmare. You do not realize how often it is mentioned on the television or in the media. I got to the stage where I wanted to throw something through the television screen and scream “for God’s sake shut up”. I knew this would send Dan into either a temper or a depression. He seemed to take it all so personally and the more I said “don’t watch it”, the more he would say “I have to”. As I have said it became an obsession. I think in some ways he was trying to take on board every other survivors pain as well as his own, for what reason I have no idea. I do know he is very worried that he has caused pain to the other survivors of the cases he started. I have tried to tell him that they were probably relieved that somebody came forward. Hopefully they feel that justice has been done.  How have I found the legal system?   To be perfectly honest I can not say that I am very impressed. The police have been brilliant, I have no complaints with them at all. The rest of the system is very one sided. Nobody takes the victims feelings into account, they are told what will happen. Like being told your accusation is now lying on file because it would not be in the public interest to proceed with the trial because the accused pleaded guilty on one of the charges. That was the  urlLink Crown Prosecution Service’s  decision in the public interest again. They do not take into account how the Survivors feel about that. As far as I can see, it all boils down to money.  How have I coped living with an  urlLink Adult Survivor of Childhood Sexual Abuse ? The answer is on a wing and a prayer. I think that I have always been a strong person and somebody with their feet firmly on the ground. The last few years have certainly taken every ounce of strength that I possess to get through. I think I am not only physically but also emotionally drained. There have been many times when I have wanted to just run away and hide. So what stopped me? I have never been a quitter, I also happen to love my husband very much indeed. For most of his life people have abandoned him even from childhood, so how could I do that to him? I am also an optimist, I always tell myself that things will get better. When you are at the bottom the only way to look is up. When at my lowest something has always come along to lift my spirits, something to make me smile or laugh, then I say to myself that maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel. To other partners out there I can only say hang in there, it will get better. Give yourselves a big hug from me and know you are not alone. I know we still have a long way to go yet, but that light at the end of the tunnel is shinning a little bit brighter now.  Indeed life does go on.            urlLink malesurvivor.org  There 24/7

						   The first time I got into trouble with the police was when I was aged thirteen or fourteen. I was arrested inside a van with a dozen others on our way to a punch up in  urlLink Staines . My father said not a word. The second time I was to deal with the police was when my father evicted me from the family home. I then moved with my then girlfriend up to  urlLink Nottingham . That relationship was over within the month, but I had got my self a job at a large hotel just outside the city centre. I was however arrested whilst I was working at the hotel. My father had reportedly seen me slash the tires on his car a few nights previous. Unfortunately for my father I had an alibi. It could not have been me I was washing up in the kitchen at the time and I had people there to back me up. The Personnel Manageress  knew I was in that day and evening as she asked me if I wanted to do an extra shift as one of the other porters was down ill. I jumped at the chance. After work it would be off to a gay  club that I went to as it had a license till two in the morning.   I eventually lost that job for being drunk on duty so the accommodation went as well. I was homeless again but I very rarely had to sleep rough. It was no problem to find somewhere to sleep I looked younger than I was. If sex was involved I would sometimes charge. I wouldn’t do anal though. Although I was raped once more whilst I was drunk I was by this time over twenty one. It was too painful for reasons I would find out some years later. I made one stupid mistake whilst visiting the gay club. I cashed a cheque, unfortunately I didn’t have enough money in my bank account to cover the thing. I disappeared down towards the South coast. I thought I would start again down that neck of the woods. I called in to see my paternal grandparents at  urlLink Hove  they let me stay for a while but the time came that I had to leave. I said “I had nowhere to go”. I also said “I didn’t want to entertain the idea of sorting things out with my dad“. I left my grandparents under a cloud of disillusion as it was always thought of by other relatives that I was the favorite grandson. I basically wrote myself out of any will as I stole some money from my uncle. It was the last time I was to see my uncle alive. Booze killed him a few years later.   I left there and headed for the Social Security office to see if I could get a travel warrant back to Nottingham. Spend money on rail tickets the money was for booze. I filled out all the necessary forms and had the usual interview. I was then told to wait in reception my name would be called when it was ready. I waited for three quarters of an hour when my name was called I was to go to booth number four. I was greeted at the booth by two policeman. They cautioned me read me my rights and put the cuffs on. I was being done for deception of twenty five fucking quid I couldn’t believe it. It had obviously been reported by the guy I bounced the cheque on. I spent two days in custody at Brighton Central nick and was transferred back to Nottingham under the charge of two detectives that came from Nottingham to escort me back. I was back where I had started.  I was questioned once more and interviewed I said it was true that I had cashed a cheque not realizing I didn’t have the funds to cover it. It wasn’t a deliberate act. If it had of been it would have been more than twenty five pounds I can assure you. They accepted my story. I was then taken to Nottingham  urlLink Old Shire Hall  and thrown into a cell. It was Friday night.It was going to be a long weekend.   The cells in the Old shire Hall was straight out of a  urlLink Charles Dickens  novel. They were dark and damp and the area outside was tiny for the exercise you were allowed once a day. I appeared in the magistrates court first thing Monday morning I was given conditional bail to a  urlLink Salvation Army  hostel down by the old fruit market I can remember the name of the hostel. It was  urlLink Sneinton House . It was a grim place where the lowest in society could find a relatively safe bed for the night. It was a monster of a building sleeping something in the region of three hundred plus men. This was straight out of  urlLink Orwell’s   urlLink “Down and out in Paris and London“.  It was nearly as bad as the Millman Street hostel just off the fashionable Kings Road in London. I would have to report to the central police station every night for a month until I was due to appear in court again for sentence. Sneinton House was as far as you could go down without actually sleeping rough as some would prefer to do so such was the violence inside one of these places, it had to be seen to be believed. The hostel also had an alcoholic unit within and I became friendly with the manager of this section. He was the one that greeted me when I went there from the court. He said I was to “have a medical“.   Guess what he assaulted me then and there for fucks sake. I used  him as much as I possibly could, and I was thankful for the safety of his room. It was dam near impossible to sleep what with the row going on all night out in the dormitory the noise that  seventy five men can make is considerable there were people snoring, coughing, farting and those with genuine night terrors.   There were deaths too I was paid five pounds for clearing up after a guy had bled to death in his cell, that is what the little steel rooms were called just big enough to take a single bed and a chair. The regular staff couldn’t face it so I did it for some reason it did not bother me.   Once you are in a place like this it is very hard to get out of it no one will employ you as you have a known address. No money, no job, no place to live. I went back on the game again.  I returned to the magistrates court at the Old Shire Hall after a month where I was fined twenty five pounds and given a two year conditional discharge. I was free of the hostel   I had got friendly with a bar manager in a Nottingham city centre pub he was gay and I strung him along. He gave me somewhere to live but that didn’t last long as I refused to sleep with him. The idea did just not appeal to me anymore. This was helped by where I landed up a couple of nights previous. I was picked up by some guy who owned a textile company in Leicester. He took me to this address which seemed to have blood all over the walls. I kept him drinking until he couldn’t take anymore. I left him in a stupor and where he was. I was out the door as soon as he fell asleep. That scared the living daylights out of me. And I swore to myself that I would never do that again. I hitched back to Nottingham and carried on down to London. I got into trouble a few times after that I was convicted of common assault as I hit the girl I was living with as she was coming at me with a bread knife at the time, I‘m still bloody ashamed of it though and I wish her well.   I was arrested for stealing a Giro cheque but the police gave me a chance as I was “dry” at the time and I was trying to get myself together. I am really grateful to the two detectives from  urlLink Walton Police Station  that gave me a break and managed to get the Social Security off my back with regards to the paying back the value of the cheque. All I had to do was make them a reasonable offer of so much per week instead of having to pay it back all at once. All the other times I have been in trouble have all been because I was dunk and disorderly, drunk and incapable or sometimes just plain drunk. If I don’t drink I don’t get into trouble it took a long time to sink in did this very simple fact. I also hit my wife one night when I was out of my skull on Special Brew and Blue label Smirnoff.  If I could put right just one thing out of everything I have put myself through it would be that. Nobody deserves to be treated like that and I despise and hate myself for it. I used to get into fights on quite a regular basis nine times out of ten I didn’t feel a thing as I was too far gone for so much of the time. I would always pick on the biggest bloke and I’m a good deal shorter than Tom Cruise.  What Defines Sexual Abuse? Click on  urlLink malesurvivor.org  to find out

						   We arrived at the medical room, all five of us were nicely lined up like very good school children. The first two in line were junkies as they were given small pots of the green clear liquid that was methadone. The  urlLink bloke  who said “no thanks” to the meeting downstairs that I had jokingly brought up was an alcoholic, the shakes gave it away as did the four  urlLink Heminevrin  capsules that Nancy gave him, I could spot them at a hundred paces. I was so envious as I knew what those four capsules were capable of if you bit into them, lets put it this way you would have no trouble sleeping. The two girls in front could be no more than eighteen and one of them had the most terrible scarring to one of her arms, they soon downed their allotted maintenance dose of  urlLink methadone  and were off to enjoy a cigarette as the effects of the drug kicked in. “You feeling ok Philip” asked Nancy, “just a bit shaky” he replied the sweat was pouring out of him and dripping off the end of his nose. “This your first detox Phillip”? I asked, “Yes….sort of” he replied whilst taking the capsules singularly, he downed the last one and said “see you downstairs”. “Will do” I acknowledged. I let Geraldine in front of me. “Your need is greater than mine” I said somewhat gallantly. “Ta” she said. The green liquid disappeared in one and then it was my turn for two  urlLink Librium , I was currently on two, three times a day.  That done I thanked Nancy and made my way back downstairs again. I made yet another cup of tea and went to find my file and writing pad. Geraldine had gone outside for a fag and was talking to the other two girls out on the veranda. Philip was sitting on his own in the corner looking terrified. I walked up and said “can I join you”? “Feel free” he replied, “you got a drink”? I asked, “sorry I will rephrase that”. “Fancy a mug of tea or coffee”? “No thank you … … … it wont stay down”. “Fair enough” I said. “You know where everything is”? “I know where the toilets are”? “That’s for sure”. “How many hemie’s you on”? I enquired “Hemies”? He looked at me. “The capsules you are taking they are Heminevrin”. “Right is that what they are”? “Yep and bloody good they are too, you shouldn’t feel a thing”. “That sounds like the voice of experience” replied Philip “Too much bloody experience with them things, that’s why they have me on a Librium detox, Im addicted to hemie’s as well as booze, but I’m slowly learning what a  urlLink nasty little drug Heminevrin  is”. “So how come you end up here Phillip”? “Work and the wife … … … a two pronged attack” He said “Nasty” I replied. “What do you do”? “I’m a  urlLink barristers  clerk for what its worth”. “You will feel at home here then, I think there are two  urlLink barristers  in residence at the moment”. Philip looked even more terrified and he had gone a funny shade of grey. “Shit I hope I don’t know them but I expect I will recognize their names”. He paused “If that’s the case I cant face them as everything I say will get back to chambers somehow. I know it gets back as a few barristers have been through here and everybody gets to hear who is in where and what’s going on….it’s the old jungle telegraph, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck it” he said. “They work out of London do you know”? He asked more in hope than anything else. “Haven’t a clue”, I replied “sorry”.  At that point Geraldine and the other two newcomers came back in from the veranda. “You want a refill Dan”? “No I’m ok at the moment “What about …. don’t know your name”. You want a coffee or tea yet Phillip” I asked “No not just yet…thanks all the same” said Philip. It went silent for a minute of two. “Its been a busy day four new admissions, I think that’s the house full now, although I am pretty sure there are two leaving tomorrow”, I said. “Leaving”? asked Philip. “Yeah they have done their eight weeks and their off into the big wide world tomorrow”. I don’t know much about Jinny and Robin. “All I know of Robin is that he was a drum technician who was on tour with  urlLink Dire Straits , as for Jinny”? “I don’t know what she is in for”. “What do you do for a living Dan”? Asked Philip “Me … … … I’m a  urlLink jack of all trades and master at none . I have passed myself off as a  urlLink bar cellar-man  and chef as I know my way around a kitchen and a bar” I laughed. “Married”? asked Philip “Good god no, nobody will put up with me” I added “especially the way my behaviour has been over the past few years I’m not bloody surprised”. “I prefer to be on my own … … … I can do less damage that way”, it was true.

						   Keith was where I left him, he was talking to a female newcomer. “I’m not breaking anything up am I”? I enquired. “Don’t be daft” said Keith “Dan this is Geraldine”. “Hello Geraldine, just arrived”? “Yeah” she said in a broad  urlLink Geordie  accent, “about an hour ago”. “you got time for a refill Keith”? “No thanks” he replied “I’ve got to go and have a quick wash”, “Its ok up there” Keith”. “Dave’s been in the bathroom but hasn’t had a dump”. “That bad”? asked Geraldine screwing up her eyes and nose, “you bet, trouble is it can hang around for days, I dread to think what his insides must be like” I said. “Enjoy your night out Keith and don’t come back pissed”. “I’ve got the night off because of being on detox, but if you do, have two or three for me”. “I wish”, said Keith, “see you two later”.   I turned to Geraldine “didn’t think  urlLink Geordies  and natives of  urlLink Middlesbrough  spoke to each other”? “Too near  urlLink Sunderland  … … or something like that, if I remember” I asked. “Usually … … It was just reassuring to hear a recognizable accent” she replied.   I asked, “you been given a number yet”? “A number”?. “Yeah … … … for your mug“. I held up my now empty, well stained mug, time for a refill I think. “One of these” I said shaking the mug from side to side. “No, not as yet”. “Right we had better go and get you one, I don’t think I could have got this far without a constant supply of hot tea, its my lifeline to the real world”. The usual introductions took place. Geraldine came from  urlLink Whitley Bay  and was aged thirty but looked younger with her makeup on. She had just been divorced by her husband, who walked out on her eighteen months previous, she had really been hitting it hard for all of that time. She sought help but couldn’t do it on her own so she was referred here by her doctor with support from her psychiatrist. She had been hospitalized twice for suicide attempts.   We soon found a mug and hook that was not occupied. “There you go, what’s your poison”? I asked. “Coffee, three sugars”, “Brilliant we can start a group for sugar anonymous… … … I shovel it in as well”. We went back to the lounge when the bell went, I very nearly jumped out of my skin. “What’s that for”? asked Geraldine. That’s for the  urlLink AA meeting , the coach is here. “You on detox”? “Yeah the usual  urlLink methadone  I hate the fucking stuff”, “but it’s better than going cold” she added.   The house soon emptied leaving five very anxious people, anxious because none of us could hide within a crowd, we had to make conversation. When faced with situations such as this I tend to shut my eyes and jump right in. “Anyone fancy a ad hoc meeting…..only joking”. I quickly added. “No thank you” came the reply from the gentlemen in the corner. “This is going to be hard work” I said to Geraldine. “We will meet them upstairs as its nearly time for “happy hour”, there is always a well ordered line, especially those on detox. Any time in the next few minutes we will get the call, your only reminded once on admission and if you don’t turn up, which is a rarity so I have heard, you’ve either passed out or walked”. “Any time now you said … … … is that right”? Asked Geraldine “Because it feels that I have a circus performing in my stomach, and I think it very probable that this coffee is going to come back up shortly”. Geraldine brought her hand to her mouth and said in a muffled voice something like “qewsme” and dived out into the reception area heading for the female loo’s. At that point Nancy walked into the reception area carrying the bell and gave it a short sharp blast, which echoed round the house and was capable of waking the dead. This was the bell for drugs round.   A couple of minutes later Geraldine returned, “medication time” I said in the style of Nurse Ratched from  urlLink “One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest”.  “Phew, that’s better”, “the first of many if past experiences are anything to go by”. “I know the feeling” I replied “but even that gives me a buzz“.   I have often described myself as suffering from  urlLink bulimia  although the type of behaviour that I indulge in does not strictly fall in with the classic  urlLink bulimia criteria .

						   Bloody hell” I said, “its turning a bit nippy out here want to go inside”? “Good idea that” said Keith. “I need a refill of tea”, “and dinners not far off, either”. We had ten minutes to kill so we found an empty sofa, lit up a fag and chatted. Keith was from  urlLink Middlesbrough , he was an alcoholic and addicted to his painkillers for  urlLink osteoarthritis  he had been drinking alcoholically for about twelve years. “how long you been here Keith”? I asked. “Arrived a week before you although I have no real recollection of events, apparently I passed out coming through the front door, next thing I knew I woke up in a room with three others, I just latched onto London Dave as he seemed to know the ropes”. “Who is your counselor”? Sally he replied “Sally? don’t think I’ve met her yet”, “No you wouldn’t have she is on a course and is back tomorrow, very nice but you cant pull the wool over her eyes, she’s been there, done that and got a whole wardrobe of t-shirts” “She has been around the block a couple of times but again you wouldn’t think it to look at her”. “That’s the thing with all these counselors they all look so fucking healthy” commented Keith. “And drive very nice cars” I added. I had seen all the staff turn up in the mornings whilst sweeping around the reception area, they appeared to all be doing very nicely, thank you. Good luck to them I say.   Bell went for dinner. We got a couple of chairs at the end table, it may have been the end table but we got served first but nobody started till thanks was given. “Thanks Henry” I said and looked at the  urlLink Cottage Pie  that was being passed down the table, fresh broccoli, carrots and sauté potatoes, Followed by a  urlLink baked rice pudding  that was out of this world. My grandmother used to make rice pudding like this with a thick skin and a large pinch of nutmeg. I wondered if Henry put a tin or two of  urlLink evaporated milk  in his recipe because it was certainly rich enough. I pigged out on pudding and went back for seconds and thirds. I was last at the table. Keith had taken my mug and had gone and got a refill. I took my empty crockery to wash up and immediately regretted eating so much pudding, this for me is typical behaviour. If I like something I always go over the top, always have done.   I joined Keith in the lounge, lit up another cigarette, took a sip of tea and let out a long satisfying sigh at that point Henry the chef walked through the lounge en-route for the office I caught his attention and said “Henry, you should not be making puddings like that in a place like this”. “Why not”? He replied “because that rice pudding is the best I’ve tasted since my grandmother was alive, that was a pudding to remember, addictive even”. “Thanks” said Henry and walked off with a trace of a smile about his face. I sat back on the sofa with tea and cigarette in hand and said “If I didn’t know better that this was a rehab, I would swear that I have died and gone to heaven … … … I could have quite easily go to sleep here”. “No chance of that tonight”. “We’ve got an  urlLink AA meeting  to go to tonight somewhere near  urlLink Salisbury , coach leaves at six thirty” said Keith. “Bollocks, my memories getting worse I had forgot all about that as well”. “What’s the time now”? I asked. “Quart to six” said Keith. “I’ll finish this and go and have a wash”.    urlLink Clouds House &nbsp;had a small collection of second hand clothes, basically stuff that had been left behind, stored down in the cellar and laundry area. I had a rummage through and came up with an old pair of jeans, a belt, a couple of t-shirts, a cardigan and some socks that fitted. This would do me for a couple of days whilst I washed the clothes that I stood up in as they were beginning to smell a bit.   I got to my room to find London Dave in the bathroom. Rod had left the program the day before. I prayed that Dave wasn’t going to the toilet as he tended to leave a stench behind that seemed to linger for days. Thankfully he wasn’t, he was finishing off having a wash as all of us had to go to this meeting. Dave emerged from the bathroom. “Hello Dan your not coming to the meeting tonight are you”? “As far as I know I am”. “I think you had better go and check that with the nursing staff old son, I was always under the impression that if you were on detox, meetings outside were a no, no”. Shit I thought. “Cheers Dave, I will go and see who is on duty”.   I made my way to the medical room. Nancy was on duty, I knocked on the door and stuck me head through the doorway. “Sorry to bother you Nancy, but am I allowed to go to the meeting tonight”? “How many days you been on detox”? She asked “Three days” I replied. “In that case Dan, no. Let me check your notes though just to be on the safe side”. She pulled out a file from the filing cabinet located my drugs chart and said “No, you have another four days to go as yet”. This time next week you will be fine”. “Ok Nancy, thanks”. I was slightly disappointed as it would have been nice just to get out. I think there were another three currently on detox so it was going to be introductions all round, at least I wouldn’t be on my own in this rather large house. I made my way back down to the lounge again, picking up my writing equipment on my way thinking that maybe tonight would be a good time to start this bloody list!   Need Support?

						   I finished my fag and felt knackered all of a sudden. So I departed up stairs for half an hours  urlLink kip . It was three quarters of an hour before group. I entered the bedroom, Vivian was there reading the  urlLink C.S. Lewis  book,  urlLink The Screwtape Letters . Keith was lying on his bed snoring his head off. “All, quiet on the western front then”? I asked in hushed tones. Vivian replied “sounds it” and carried on reading. I lay down and the next thing I knew I was being woke up by Keith. “Dan…group time”. Shit I had gone out like a light and it took me a minute to come too. “Where was this group”? I tried to remember. I couldn’t. I dived downstairs to the information board where the main timetable was forgetting completely that I had a copy of the self same timetable in my A4 folder. I was to be in the same room as before lunch.  &nbsp;  The door was shut, not a good sign. I opened the door to hear the preamble being read. “Fuck it” I thought, I did not want to draw attention to myself. In I walked Paula was nearing the end of the preamble. I sat down hoping that I was invisible, I wasn’t. Dermot was leading the group. “Thanks Paula ”, “Thank you also for attending Dan … … … I hope your not going to be late for our meeting later”? He said. “Right ladies and gentlemen, our discussion topic today is a happy little number entitled,  urlLink wet brains, damage and dementia ”.  &nbsp;  What followed was a  urlLink lecture  and slide show on what booze and drugs did to the brain not from Dermot but the medical director who I had met on my addmitance. It was a very interesting lecture but I didn’t really learn anything new except for chemical compounds and the use of blockers in chemical transmissions and reactions to the brain.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The hour zoomed past and came to an abrupt halt on the bell ringing. The  urlLink Serenity Prayer  was recited and that was that. I had half an hour before my counseling with Dermot.   At exactly twenty five minutes past three I arrived at Dermots office. I was just about to knock when a voice came from behind me “Good you’re here”. Dermot opened the door and invited me in. “You not got a cup of something”? “No” I said “Go and get yourself one if you wish”. I didn’t need asking twice. I was back in under three minutes, I didn’t want to be accused of slouching. “Come in, sit down” I sat down in a big old leather armchair of the type you would see in a gentlemen’s club. It was not as comfortable as it looked. I placed my mug of tea on the table opposite. Dermot started “How you settling in”? “ok I think, I don’t appear to have upset anyone…..yet”. “How’s the detox going”? “Pretty good” I replied “not bad at all”. “How’s your appitite”? “That’s ok as well, I never was a big eater, three meals a day seems a bit strange”. “Good” said Dermot. “right, “Ok”. “Dan, why are you here”? The question took me completely by surprise. “because of my alcoholism and drug adiction”. Dermot looked at me and shook his head and quietly said “try again”. “Why am I here”? I asked myself over and over again because “I woke up here” tripped through my mind but that sounded too flippant, so I settled for “because I want to beat this booze thing”. “You know it’s a problem then”? Enquired my counsellor. “Yes” I replied. “Why do you do it then”? “I don’t know I just do”.  &nbsp;  That’s how the conversation went. Dermot asking the questions me, supplying the answers as best I could. The clock on his desk said twenty past four. “That’s it Dan for this week” he said “but there are two things I want you to do for me in the next few days” he went on “get sharing with everyone, as much as you can and in the next week I want you to list twenty things you like about yourself”. “See you next week” we shook hands and I said “thanks“. “Was that it”? I thought. I felt quite  urlLink chuffed  with myself, that session was a  urlLink doddle .  &nbsp;  I went upstairs and made a mug of tea and took a few biscuits as well. I hung about till the bell sounded and then made my way out to the veranda. The temperature had dropped and that woke me up. I opened my A4 file. I had already started to outline my life story and I tried to start this list that Dermot wanted me to write. “What do I like about myself”? I sat there deep in thought when Keith walked over. “You made group then”? “Yes, just” I said. “Luckily it was Dermot and I was seeing him later that afternoon for my first counseling session”. “How’d it go”? “Pretty good I thought”. “Yeah” said Keith “Good counsellor is Dermot”, “You wouldn’t belive that seven years ago he very nearly died here in one of the toilets upstairs”. "Really", I asked. “Yep…only just saved him he started bringing a lot of blood up and then passed out, one of the residents found him slumped in a cubilcle they had to break the door down to get him out”, “was very touch and go for a while”. “You wouldn’t belive it looking at the man now” I said. Dermot had the most perfect skin I had ever seen on a man, don’t ask me why I noticed that but it was true. “You start fucking him about though and you will see a different side to him, very clever man is Dermot”, pointed out Keith.  &nbsp;  He continued “He give you a list of things to write down”? “Yep, what I like about myself, I was just trying to start but I cant think of a bloody thing at present", I shut the file. “Good luck” said Keith.  &nbsp;  Need Info &amp; Support?

						   There were no clocks in the room that we having our meeting in. I became very hungry all of a sudden and I guessed it could be no more than half an hour to lunch. I was counting off the seconds so much so that when I had to give my opinion on how Paul, the bloke next to me had done this past week I had to make it up. I said Paul appeared to be doing “everything he should have been, he always seemed busy when I have seen him about”. “Have you  two spoke at all since you arrived Paul”? Asked  the therapist whilst scribbling a note to herself. “No” Paul replied, she carried on scribbling. As far as Paul’s progress was concerned I wasn’t really there. I had  urlLink numbed out  without realizing it. The time was getting on and we had another three people to breakdown and rebuild in less than twenty minutes I sat there rigid so as not to fade away again into another world,  urlLink numbing out  again. I gave my opinions of the others by condensing all that the previous reviewers had said. I really should try to concentrate better.  The bell for the end of group brought me back again. Isobel was asked to close the meeting and we were soon in the dining room waiting for lunch. Paul tapped me on the shoulder and asked if anyone was sitting in the empty seat next to me. “It’s yours Paul if you like”. We shook hands and wondered what Henry the chef had rustled up for lunch. It turned out to be pork chops  urlLink Italienne  with new potatoes, sweet corn and sprouts, home made bread (that was one of the chores), fruit juice and for desert it was fresh fruit salad and ice cream. In between mouthfuls Paul and I got to know each other. He was the same age as me, tall and of medium build. He was dressed from head to foot in black with green  urlLink Doctor Martin  boots. I had as yet not met a  urlLink Goth . I had now. We finished off our puds took our plates out to the kitchen grabbed ourselves a mug of tea and went and sat on the veranda, joining a few other people out there, the next meeting was not until one thirty.   I had been told earlier in the day that I was down to see Dermot at three thirty. Every morning there was a list pinned up stating what counselors were where and who they were seeing and at what time. It was good job that someone had told me as I had not as yet seen or read the notice board. That would have to change pretty rapidally, I didn’t fancy being hauled over the coals for not taking responsibility of my own recovery, I had learnt that much.  Paul did the introductions “Dan this is Rosie, this is Marion, This is Steve and lastly and no means leastly Big Mike”. “Everyone this is Dan, an alcoholic and pill head”. I said “hello” to all and they all acknowledged me back. I was offerd a cigarette by Steve. “Thanks” I said. It was still warm and it was quiet, perfect all but for one thing. I wanted a drink. As daft as it may seem in the middle of a rehab I wanted a fucking drink, insane!   “How you doin” said Steve. I replied “to be perfectly honest I don’t know, I’m still in the middle of a detox, thank god”. “Im also still in a state of shock as well I think”. “That sounds about right” said Steve “took me a week or two to get my bearings, but I’m still here and that surprises me no end”. “What’s your poison Steve”? “Anything and everything” “How long you been here”? I enquired “nearly seven weeks” he said. “How have you found it”? “The hardest bloody thing I’ve ever attempted and I don’t think I could go through it again” he said. “That bad eh”? I suggested. “You bet, but the worst was doing my life story I cracked right up and I‘m not ashamed to admit it”.   I had heard all about the dreaded life story meeting.   From what I could make out the whole hour was given over to you and your story. You were for the first thirty to forty five minutes to read your life story and the remaining time was given over to questioning. From that your peers would go away for a day or two and write up  their replies to your story. These replies were split into two one half was a truthful assessment as far as your reviewer were concerned and they were allowed to be as blunt and as truthful as they possibly could. There were no frills or padding this was a dose of reality caught full in the face. The second part was a description of the good things about you that your peers could deduce.  Need Support?

						   Today was Tuesday and Tuesday afternoon meant review and assessment by your peers. If you were not forthcoming in group you would be given a commitment or verbal that had to be recited at the beginning of every meeting, nearly all newcomers were given this commitment in their first group. After introducing myself as “I’m Dan and I’m an alcoholic and chemically dependent”. I would have to add the verbal “They used to call me laughing boy, but baby look at me now” this was supposed to open me up, all it did was make me feel a prize  urlLink prat . I sat back down as individually and in turn each of us were pulled apart again by our peers.   This particular meeting was known as  urlLink “the inquisition”  and people didn’t mince their words. We were working around the group and it was slowly coming to my turn. The young junkie next to me finished telling us how her week had been for her since her last assessment. I could literally feel the girl shaking next to me and that was making me more nervous than anything else I had encountered as yet. The girl had come to the end of her statement when the group therapist suddenly said. “Crap, utter crap you are going to have to get to know yourself a little bit better than that Isobel, otherwise you are going to die”.   The group went around giving their first impressions of Isobels summing up. Some thought she had come a long way since last week, the older established members of the group, could see right through her and picked her up on most things like “being  urlLink aloof ”, commitment and willingness. At the end of her assesment it came to me?   What I would have done for a drink at this time was nobodies business. I was to talk solidly for the next five minutes. I started off saying that I felt I was joining in as much as I should and that everybody had been very kind. I was told to “cut the shit” and “get on with it”. I didn’t have a clue what to say. To break the silence, I hate them, I said “I don’t know what to say its all a fucking mess”. The therapist said “That’s as good as any place to start”, “whats a fucking mess Dan”? “How did your addiction start”? “Early, late or what”? “Early I think, very young in fact, as I can remember being given small tastes of different spirits especially  urlLink Advocat  on special occasions”. By the age of nine I was pilfering  urlLink Advocat  from the drinks cabinet, I loved the taste but I was also aware of that warm feeling spreading throughout my body, it felt good, even at that age. “Were your parents alcoholic Dan”? I replied that “my mother definitely wasn’t but my father is a different matter”. “He liked a drink but didn’t really go off the rails until my mother passed away and then pulled himself together”. “I know he still likes a drink but I don’t think he is alcoholic”. “I know his paternal father was a bit of a boozer as was his mum and his future step father”. “Now I do know that they were both chronic alcoholics and it killed them both in time”. My other grandparents liked to drink socially but were in no way alcoholic”. I came to a halt thinking of my grandad. God playing football in the fenced in playing area on Borrodaile Road seemed another age away.   I was abruptly brought to by the question “how do you feel Dan”? I remained silent “how do you feel Dan”? I looked up to see who was asking the question. “I really don’t know ... ... ... there are a load of things hurtling around my head but as to what they are, I have no idea”. “Come on Dan how do you feel”? “Sad, happy, alone, hurt or what”? To try and worm my way out of it I said “All of those and more” I snapped back. “You sound pretty pissed off from where Im sitting Dan” said Keith with whom I shared a bedroom. I made a mental note, bastard. “No  not really Keith more sad than anything”. “So how do you think you’ve done in your first few days”? “I’m still here”. “Thank god for that” said the therapist “something positive” she carried on “Do you think you’ll be with us this time next week”, “I hope so because I really have had enough of booze and pills”. “Good” said the therapist. I came away with the words “scared little boy” ringing in my ears as that is how most of my remaining peers saw me. I was also told to start trusting and sharing. I was to retain the verbal for another week. Thank god that was over for the week. What only took a few minutes seeemd like a bloody eternity, I just wanted to run. They moved on to the person sitting to my right. I started to breathe again.  Need Some Information? Try  urlLink malesurvivor.org

						   We just sat there in silence for the next ten minutes enjoying a cigarette and the early autum sunshine. It was nice to get out of the main house as it was crowded, musty and quickly filled with smoke. Another house member introduced himself “Hi I’m Angus” in a very effeminate voice.  “Alright Angus” said Dave. Angus was tall and thin, bloody hell he was thin. We shook hands “Im Dan”. He had incredibly boney hands it was like shaking hands with a skeleton, they were very cold, but damp as well. “Why are you here Angus”? I asked. “Coke and booze … … … pills and glue every bloody thing” “even fucking peanuts”. “I’m like that with tea … … … if its not alcohol its tea” I added. “You want a cuppa”? Asked Angus, "Yeah go on then", “Dave”? “I’ll have a coffee” “whats your number Dan”? “Thirty two and three sugars please” I answered. “You Dave”? “Twenty seven Angus, no sugar”. “Ok wont be a min” and off he went to the most popular area of the house the tea and coffee making area.   We were all allotted a numbered mug with corresponding numbered hooks. It was up to us to look after them and not to leave them scattered throughout the house or on the veranda. There would be hell to pay if your cup was found unwashed in or out of the house.  I was to witness a fellow house member break down because his realtionship with his son had been fucked up because of his constant drunkeness and violence towards his mother. This was all triggered off because his cup was found in the telly room.   It was called the telly room because we were allowed to watch films that featured people with addictive tendencies in there. Films like the classics  urlLink “Days of wine and roses”  and  urlLink “The lost weekend”   There was another starring  urlLink Denis Weaver  all to do with cocaine and psychosis  urlLink “One Mans Seduction”  was what it was called and on watching it I turned to a young cocaine addict named Becky and asked “Is it really like that”?  “Yes” she replied. “It can get a bit scary when you loose it”, it being the inword for sanity. We had to sit there watch the film and write down the similarities in our stories and behavior to those being portrayed on the screen. This was good pointer into how your were doing in recognizing the powerlessness and damage you could inflict when indulging your addiction. It was a very eye opening event so much so that I christened it the “Bog Roll Test”  because as the weeks past the list of similarities would grow longer and longer and longer. It was crazy.  Angus returned with a tray with our mugs on and a couple of biscuits each very civilized. The general chat carried on. “So how long you been here you two?” I’m in my third week” said Dave and “I’m in my fourth” answered Angus. “How you finding it all”? I asked. Dave replied “fucking hard sometimes” “likewise” said Angus” , he added “they all know the buttons to push and when to push them. It  still amazes me that fights don’t break out”, “they say It gets better” added Dave. Finishing off with “I’m still fucking waiting”.  Angus turned to Dave and asked “you got a date for your life story yet? “No not yet should know by the end of the week, Im seeing Brian on Friday”. “I’ve got mine a week today and I’m not looking forward to it, I am dreading it”. “That bad”? I asked somewhat naively. Dave asked “I take it you haven’t sat in on one yet”? “No not yet”. “It’s certainly wakes you up” said Angus “especially the replies”.  “I’ll catch you later gents I need the bog”.  My next group was not long in starting and I wanted the toilet. I took my cup with me.  The next group was to be held in the main room and that could be divided off making two separate rooms. We all grabed a chair and formed a circle. Someone volunteered to read the preamble and off we went again. The male therapist was named Norman. If you know the  urlLink Giles  Cartoon strip there is school master character by the name of  urlLink “Chalkie”,  Norman was a dead ringer for him he even had that grey palour about him. This bloke possessed the most dry sense of humor I have ever heard he was hilarious when he got going but in doing that he would get the shit out of you, very clever.   I can remember London Dave talking about his addictions. He gave us a graphic account of his endless days in the bog with constpation whilst drinking gut rot sherry. This wonderful imagery went on for half an hour. Norman just sat there leaning back on his chair looking at the ceiling. All he said was “I loved having a crap it was the only way I could drink in private”. Norman had been on the street for a number of years but had got sober fifteen years ago, that seemed a lifetime to me. What Norman said was hilarious but he then turned to Dave and said. “it’s a shit feeling isn’t it ... ... ... wanting to stop but you cant  because your too fucking frightened to give up your crutch”.   That brought us all back down to earth. This was the general format of the meetings. If the therapist thought your were trying to pull a fast one they would put you in a group where you couldn’t hide or manipulate.

						   It was true the years were passing by at speed and usually only as a blur. For two days I was drinking in comfort but the time came when Richard and I fell out over something trivial and I was asked to leave immediately. Fine by me it hadn’t cost me anything so I headed back into town getting another bottle of  urlLink Smirnoff  on the way.   Three days later I woke up at  urlLink Clouds House  treatment center in Wiltshire with thirty six pence to my name a carrier bag holding my shaving stuff and an empty bottle of  urlLink Heminevrin  capsules. I felt like  urlLink Arthur Dent  minus his towel.  For some reason I remember watching the last night of  urlLink The Proms  but where I was whilst watching that I have no idea. I know I entered  urlLink Clouds House  in the September of nineteen eighty five.  The first person I met was the house group leader her name was Rachel a woman of about twenty four, a cocaine addict, she used to work for  urlLink Steve O'Rourke  manager of  urlLink Pink Floyd . It took me two days to realize where I was and that I was sharing a bedroom with none other than the  urlLink Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band  frontman  urlLink Vivian Stanshall,  and two others, Keith and Rod. Unfortunately Vivian is no longer with us. He  urlLink died  in a fire at his home in nineteen ninety five.   I can just about remember being interviewed by an administrator who wanted my National Insurance number and stuff like that. I was then handed over to the medical staff for a complete medical and blood tests. I was given a booklet and was asked to sign something ... ... ... In my state! I was put on a  urlLink Librium  detox although I did try to get them to give me  urlLink Hemies  but they were not playing that game at all, they had me weighed up straight away. The detox wasn’t half as bad as I thought It was going to be. The first few days were a blur and I didn’t  eat for a couple of days and then I got alcoholic munchies and ate everything in sight giving myself chronic constipation. I’m afraid I’m very obsessive about my bowls as I have had problems down there for many years even before I was buggered. I would in time have to have surgery, apparently I was abnormally small down below and suffer from  urlLink hemorrhoids  because of that and believe me  urlLink "piles"  are no laughing matter.   The program at Clouds was run by a time table and a bell, you were on the go from 07.30 as you had everyday chores to do. Everybody had their own chore allotted to them, this changed every week. I was to sweep the veranda every morning also the reception area. After that was a small meeting for the  urlLink “Thought of the day”  which was based on some form of inspirational thought. Then it was breakfast. First group proper was at 09.00 and lasted an hour this would happen three times a day with small breaks in between followed by some other type of group work. I was allotted a personal counselor an Irish Guy by the name of Dermot. I would meet with him once a week for the duration of my stay which was usually about eight weeks. Occasionally he would over see a group. The house was modeled on the  urlLink Hazelden facility  in the USA and run along the lines of a very large  urlLink Alcoholics Anonymous  meeting. However the guiding light behind all group work was the  urlLink Twelve Steps  of Recovery.  One of the things you have to come to grips with was the meaning of the phrase  urlLink Powerlessness  and  urlLink Damage , P&D's for short. This is where you share your powerlessness over the booze and the damge we cause when drinking, not only towards those that we were close to but us as individuals as well and everybody and everything associated with us. It was a full time job sharing P&D's with others in the house. It was slowly dawning on me why alcoholism was also known as the  urlLink "family illness"  becuase it effects all and sundry within our own individual circle of aquantencies.  On admission you were given an A4 size writing pad, a couple of pens, a A4 file and some information sheets regarding  urlLink chemical dependency . This was for recording your thoughts about why you are an addict, who you have hurt in the past, what you have lost personally that could mean jobs, relationships, homes and in some cases freedom. It was also for you to start writing your life story. Throughout my travels through differing units and treatment centers I must have done this four or five times. In none of them did I tell of my abuse although I did admit to having physical relationships with men, I never mentioned my age so my abuse remained secret.  Within the house group were separate groups of differing types. All group work was based on the  urlLink Minnesota Model  with reading material supplied by  urlLink Hazelden Publishing . One group would be streetwise junkies and professional girls another would be homeless alkies like myself with housewives addicted to  urlLink Ativan  or  urlLink Valium , another group would be the professional, professionals occupations like barristers, consultant anesthetists, journalists, writers, musicians, even a Rabbi. The groups would not stay like this as we (the latest admissions) would get interchanged within groups so it was the streetwise junkie confronting a barrister, pointing out his negative addictive personality. A professional girl suggesting some advice to a woman’s magazine journalist. The homeless alcoholic telling the anesthetist how to get and stay sober. It was about breaking down the walls that we had built around us as coping mechanisms enabling us to survive from day to day. Relationships formed very fast in situations like these you got to know some people very well in a very short space of time and some of the stories relating to powerlessness and damage of addictions were frightening and triggering. They had to be heard to be believed. You were told to share, share, share if you didn’t you were picked up on it in group, in here there is no hiding place so loners like me were in for a rude awakening. Who wanted to listen to me? I was nobody special. Self pity was picked up too and the resulting unmasking in group could be a very humiliating experience.    On taking part in my first group I could roughly understand what was going on and the best thing I could come up with in my befuddled state was keep my head down. People were reduced to tears. This isolation from the group lasted approximately half an hour when all of a sudden I was asked by the group therapist “well Dan how did you get here”? “I have no idea, I just woke up here”. I hoped that comment would raise a smile. It had the reverse effect."You think it’s a joke all this"? I was asked by a tiny women aged about fifty with a broad Irish brogue and a shiney red face. She looked like a nun and indeed she was. I went on the defensive “whoa” I began to say when someone to my right said “you a control freak Dan”? “Hang on” I quickly interjected “I really don’t know how I got here, but I do know why I’m here”. "Why are you here then Dan"? “Booze I suppose”. “You supose”, “now your taking the piss” said this south London accent to my right. My mind was a complete whirl no way could I get out of this public indignation, some words strung themselves together in my head and came out as “my alcoholism”? More hopeful than a statement of fact. Jesus they picked up on that too. “You don’t know?” said someone with a voice laden with sarcasem. “Yes I do know, I was introduced to  urlLink Alcoholics Anonymous  some years ago” my voice betrayed a note of anger. “Why are you so angry Dan” said the therapist. I replied “I don’t fucking know, that good enough for you all“?. “We appear to be getting somewhere with our new member” said the therapist, “but that can wait till our next meeting”. Somebody grabbed my hand either side as I was just about to walk out and have a well earnt cigarette. The therapist asked “Dave can you close the meeting”? Dave did as he was told and led everybody in saying  urlLink The Serenity Prayer  adding at the end “Keep coming back” some adding “because it works, works, works”. That was my introduction to confrontational therapy and by all accounts my introduction was pretty tame. I would soon get to see what they meant as there was a constant stream of people arriving or departing. There was always new members.  By the time I got to the veranda that ran the length of this large county house, I had stopped shaking. I lit up took a deep draw and let out a long sigh, "How the hell did I end up here"? I thought to myself. If only I knew. “You ok Dan”? It was “London Dave”. “Welcome to Clouds” with a smile and outstretched hand. I shook it. "We have met but I doubt if you remember that". "Fraid not, when was this"? I asked. "Sunday" Dave replied "sorry no recollection what so ever ... ... ... what part of the smoke you from then"? I asked  urlLink “Stockwell”  said Dave. “Right just up  the road from me then” I said. “Where’s that” asked Dave.  urlLink “Tooting”  I replied “But we moved out to  urlLink Surrey  during the early sixties”. “You aint missed much” said Dave. The usual introductory banter took place “how long you been here?”, “What you thnk of the place? “What you in for Dave?”, “Smack, whiz and booze” he replied. “What about yourself?” Asked Dave. “Booze and pills” ,“What pills”? Enquired Dave,  urlLink “Heminevrin”  I said. “You don’t fuck about then” said Dave. “no I spose not” I felt my self esteem go up a few notches. “Nasty little drug that. “I’ve lost a couple of acquaintances through them... ... ... they just never woke up”. “They were prats anyway” added London Dave. I found my new self esteem plummet straight back down again.  Been Sexually Abused As A Child? Try  urlLink malesurvivor.org  for support

						   “Where you from Phil”? “ urlLink Tottenham ” he replied “born and bred, lifelong  urlLink Spurs  supporter so I expect that will make me a figure of ridicule, youre south of the river arnt you Dan”? “That obvious”? “I was born in  urlLink Balham  but lived in  urlLink Tooting ”. “Don’t they make toothbrushes in Balham”? “Bugger me” I said “someone who knows the classic  urlLink Peter Sellers ,  urlLink Goons  description of Balham - Gateway to the south”. “Yeah” said Phil “I’m a bit of a goons fanatic, love them to bits”. I was beginning to warm to this guy. My type of humour.  It was getting dark, the bats were out in force flying around the oak trees that littered the  urlLink Clouds House  estate. It was quiet except for some moorhen calling in the distance and the occasional bark of a fox. “You wanna roll up”? asked Philip. “No thanks” I replied, the thought of me rolling a cigarette brought memories back of  urlLink Sneinton House , the  urlLink Salvation Army  hostel I was bailed too in  urlLink Nottingham  as that is were I learnt to roll them, that in turn brought back memories of my parents who happened to both roll there own, I snapped myself out of the memories. We both lit up. “Fucking hell I feel tired” said Philip, “That’s the  urlLink Heminevrin , when was the last time you slept Philip”? “Call me Phil, Philip sounds so fucking pompous”. “Ok Phil it is”, Phil continued “Do you know something I cant remember the last time I went to bed, I would wake up on the sofa, on the floor under or on my desk”. “Give it half an hour and you will be falling asleep” I commented, Philip continued “I bloody well hope so as I cant be awake all night without something in a glass”. “Don’t worry you have another three tablets to go tonight, they should do the trick, you’ll get those at ten o’clock”. “What dorm you in”? I asked.. “The one next door to the medical room as I have had  urlLink fits  in the last few months, I spose that might have something to do with it”. “Touch wood I have never had an  urlLink alcohol with-drawl fit ”.  There is a saying in  urlLink Alcoholic Anonymous  and it consists of just one word and that is YET, what I really should have said was “touch wood I have never had an alcohol with-drawl fit…………YET”. I would remember this conversation in detail after suffering respiratory distress whilst undergoing with-drawl from  urlLink Heminevrin  a few years down the line, we thought they were fits.  “What’s the time Phil”? “Twenty five to ten” he replied.  “So what’s the score here then Dan”? I had to think for a minute and replied “controlled arguments, heated debate, ruthless honesty and no hiding”. “No hiding, is it that bad”? “Can be” I replied. “Any shouting or screaming”? “I hate shouting and screaming” said Phil. “No not really, you get flashes of it every now and again, but its managed by the counselor leading the group”. “You will soon get used to the atmosphere in group.  urlLink Blimey  the job you’ve got, you should be an expert at reading people and atmospheres”. “you learn quickly I can tell you that”, “you do”? asked Phil “Yeah, first meeting, I think it was the first. I made the fatal mistake of handing a woman named Annie who was sitting to my left a box of tissues, as she was howling her head off, I mean this woman was sobbing for England, Jesus I never seen anything like it. It’s a good job I was on detox”, “why what happened”? asked Phil, “I was asked what the fuck did I think I was doing”, “I innocently replied “handing Annie some tissues”. The room went deathly silent, “I was then asked did I know what I had just done”? “No”, “Don’t you care what happens to Annie”? “Yes of course I do”, all eyes were on me and the pulse in my head sounded like a mechanical hammer in a breakers yard. I was told, “do you realize that it has taken six weeks to get Annie in touch with her emotions”? “She doesn’t really need a plug she needs to get the crap out, not keep it in”. I apologized and said “point taken“, after that I kept my head down for the next few meetings and swore I wouldn’t be handing anybody anything from now on whilst in meetings. “Fucking hell” said Phil quickly followed with “I need a drink”. “You will be fine” I told him. “Once your head starts to clear you’ll feel a lot better, you fancy a coffee or tea yet? there should also be some biscuits knocking about somewhere as well, you got the munchies”? “No but I could do with a cuppa, I’m parched”.  We stubbed our fags out.  Been abused as a child?  urlLink malesurvivor.org

						   Geraldine returned with the other girls and came and sat opposite Philip and myself. “How you doin”? I asked the girls. “not too bad now that I have had some  urlLink methadone , settles the belly, I’m Alison”, said the blonde one “And I’m Jane”. Both had London accents. “I’m Dan and this is…….. Philip took his cue “Philip, just arrived”. “Philip this is Geraldine”, “Gerry” she jumped in, “I hate Geraldine reminds me of a  urlLink probation officer  that used to call me that. “Whoops”, “Sorry” I said. “No worries” said Gerry.  “So what brings you to  urlLink Clouds , Alison”? “ urlLink Heroin  and my parents”, “they drop you off” I enquired”? “As well as driving me mad they drove me down here, I was pleased to see them go, they drive me bloody nuts … … … I also suffer from  urlLink anorexia ”, she said angrily. I thought Angus was thin but Alison made him look well fed, she was painfully thin.  “And you Jane”? “ urlLink Smack  ”. It transpired that Jane had been a smack addict since the age of fifteen, working the streets of  urlLink Paddington  as a prostitute from the same age, her whole family were addicts, her mum who brought her up single handed, her dad was now in prison for dealing  urlLink heroin  and running a  urlLink disorderly house , a  urlLink brothel  in other words. Her granddad had recently died of an overdose after coming out of prison after serving seven years of a fifteen year sentence for armed robbery. “Jesus” I thought to myself, she didn’t stand a chance.  Sounds like Jane was a bit of a wild child or as the “labelers” in our society would describe her, a  urlLink Feral Child .  Alison came from  urlLink Virginia Water , a money area in Surrey but had been born in  urlLink Fulham , hence the slight  urlLink cockney  accent. The family were big in the construction business and led a privileged lifestyle compared to the likes of us. She was obviously having problems other than drugs, her  urlLink self harming  scars had disfigured her left arm and I couldn’t get over just how thin she was. A good number of her scars ran down her arm some of them pretty deep, this girl was in big trouble. I dreaded to think what her group would be like once they latched onto her self harming, I didn’t envy her position at all.  I was asked “what was I doing at  urlLink Clouds ”? “What am I doing here”? “Started drinking and never stopped for any amount of time, done a bit of this and a bit of that, was in the music industry for while working as a messenger, it was there that my drinking really took off. I then ended up homeless, got arrested and started to do geographicals all over the place.”. “Geographicals”? Asked Alison, “what are they”? “Yeah its a new one on me as well, geographicals are where the addict will literally move out of his or hers circle of acquaintances and try to start again in a new location, trying to start a new life, you tend to forget that your baggage comes with you and your old addiction is there waiting ready to go”. I was surprised how accurately it all came out, I must have been listening. My last geographical was down to the south coast to see Richard, wanting to get away from the fact that I had stolen off my best friend. Hell that memory hurt so I made an excuse to get me out of my present predicament and announced “Im off outside for a cigarette, anyone care to join me”? I headed for the door onto the veranda “Count me in” said Philip.  It was no good sitting on the chairs that were outside as they were damp with an early frost. I sat on the one of the window ledges, Philip did the same. He brought out a highly polished chrome “ urlLink baccy tin ”. “You roll your own”? I enquired, somewhat surprised. "Yep" said Philip “tailor made fags make me cough to buggery, stops the thieving bastards at work as well”.  urlLink Barristers  nicking cigarettes ran through my mind and for some reason I found the thought highly amusing.   urlLink Characteristics Observed  In Male Sexual Abuse Victims  Want To Know More?
