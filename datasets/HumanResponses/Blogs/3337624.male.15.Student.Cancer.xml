      Well this post is a little late, but since i'm moving my parents did somehting horrible. MY COMPTUER HAS BEEN PACKED UP AUGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! So i went to the party a little late. Another friend invited me to go somewhere and for some reason my dad said yes to that. SO i didnt get back until 10 where i promptly said goodnight, went to my room emptied my backpack, refilled it and left out the front door. Amazing how simple it was. Anyway the party was fun. There were 3 TVs set up with different Video games and we played magic alot. No shortage of food, drinks, or girls making out with eachother. Can't name names, but if you were there you knwo anyway, so HA. that'll teach you not to be inviited to parties. Anyway i left at 8:30 the next morning went in the GARAGE door, you know the really noisey one, went to my room and fell asleep. My parents did not even notice i had left. well that was a good time, which is why this post is labeled ROX instead of SUX, catch teh subtle change there? anyway SQUIRRELS RULE, and goodnight

      Well this is my first attempt at any type of journal. Baisically my dad's in the military and we jsut got notified that we have to move to korea at the end of my school year which is may 27 and only 2 weeks away! Then i got a few C's on my report card so he goes psycho and grounds me till we move. Hes already cutting off the first real important social life i've had. I mean i've always had friends where we were stationed(germany, minnesota, washington, texas), but this is the first time i've had a lot of friends. One of my good friends is having a party and 2 days after he tells me about is when my dad grounds me. It was going to be my last party before i move and never see my friends again. Well i've just made a decision in my life.....Screw my parents. They've cut off my social life already, i've always obeyed them, well at least on teh serious stuff, i mean i'm not mr. goodytwoshoes (how do you spell that anyway?) but i havent really disobeyed them whenever they flat out told me no either. But now i've decided they can go screw themselves. They've taken away all my friends away, so they have no leverage onme. I'm going to go to that party, and spend every moment with my friends i can. I dont care if they take everythign i own from me, friends are worth it, even if i can only spend 2 more weeks with them. I figure my dad must be stupid. He thinks i value my computer or my gamecube or any of the other crap i own over time with my friends. He obviously never had any friends worth a shit or hes too old to remember what it was like. He has no power left over me, except maybe trying to hit me, and i swear if he does that he'll regret it. Well i think i got a little longwinded there, but i've thinking about how much i hate my parents for about a week before i decided to start this BLOG, so i've had a lot of ideas screaming around in my head and i just had to vent.

      YOur life is not good if the library is the highlight of your day. Which it was the entire last week. My grandparents have no computer or internet so i had to go there for my internet needs. Now i'm at my aunt's house, who thankfully has a computer and DSL(internet). so i'm happy. My dad lost his keys and swears i took them until i find them in my sisters sweatshirt. THen all he has to say is "oh". i hate my family. Well i have to go fishing with my cousins, its really not as bad as it sounds. well toodles

      How the hell do make incompatible ram? ram is ram, thats like making a cd incompatible with a cd reader! i hate companies who would rather compete with each other than supply a good product. so  we ordered a 512 stick, and it came in a 4x2 foot reinforced plastic box. for a 2x8 INCH product. some people are insane. sorry bout not posting but kinda got to the point where i'm on the internet too much(no such thing i know) and my grandparents want  me to do some other thigns. So i started Kings of Chaos age 3, adn i got caught up in that. OUT OF 150,000 players i am now ranked 9,968 so HAHAHAHAHAHAH. it was worth it. if you want to help click my link, which i will post late. each click adds a soldier to my army. my income is based on teh numbr of soldiers i have. so yAY

      well i just upgraded my grandpa's PC. I just put in a new DVD burner and 256MB of ram in it. Did you know that windows XP doesnt tell you whether the PC uses DDR or SD ram. SO i figured DDR, so of course as teh universe hates me, my first guess is always wrong. We had to go return it. Then we install everything. Test the burner. ALL goes well. Restart the computer and......windows xp cant load the profile, we will give you this new TEMPORARY profile. 10 restarts, a virus check, and another few restarts and it still cant load it. So we start transfering all old data to this NEW TEMPORARY profile, and it messes up again. It start auto restarting, 1 hour and a half later it stops and it works perfect. THen the DSL modem has to be reistalled. FINALLY. I wanted to go online at noon. Its now 10 o'clock and i jsut got on. DAMN YOU TINYSOFT.

      well i was at a friends house last night. We were at a labrynth till 1:00 in the morning. It was a maze in a corn fieldÂ´. We had to find these 7 stations, at each was a word. We had to find all 7 words and then figure out the 8th word from letters from the first 7. We found the first 3 and figured the other 5 out easily. We then hid in the corn stalks and scared people. You should see them run. We had to take a few breaks for drinks. She tripped once when she was trying to scare someone. hehe. No one was hurt. Except me. when i laughed. I got her back by picking her up and running into the corn field. It must have looked weird seeing a 7 foot girl running through a corn field screaming. hehe. She got me a stuffed animal squirrel for my birthday, so i'm happy. Gonna see her again thursday:) We walked her dog this morning. I picked up rocks and thorugh them, and the dog tried to bring them back. I picked up this huge rock, the dog sniffed the hold the rock left when i picked it up, then looked up......right into the rock. Boy that must of hurt. Well gotta go play with squirrels
