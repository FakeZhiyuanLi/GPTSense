      Simple Friends VS. Real Friends   A simple friend has never seen you cry. A real friend has shoulders soggy from your tears.  A simple friend thinks the friendship is over when you have an argument. A real friend knows that it's not a friendship until after you've had a fight.  A simple friend hates it when you call after he has gone to bed. A real friend asks you why you took so long to call.  A simple friend, when visiting, acts like a guest. A real friend opens your refrigerator and helps himself.  A simple friend wonders about your romantic history. A real friend could blackmail you with it.  A simple friend expects you to always be there for them. A real friend expects to always be there for you!

       Is it Love or Infatuation?   Infatuation is instant desire, one set of glands calling to another.  Love is friendship that has caught fire. It takes root and grows, one day at a time.  Infatuation is marked by a feeling of insecurity. You are excited and eager but not genuinely happy. There are nagging doubts, unanswered questions, little bits and pieces about your beloved that you would just as soon not examine too closely. It might spoil the dream.  Love is the quiet understanding and mature acceptance of imperfection. It is real. It gives you strength and grows beyond you - to bolster your beloved. You are warmed by his presence, even when he is away. Miles do not separate you. You have so many wonderful little films in your head that you keep replaying. But near or far, you know he is yours and you can wait.  Infatuation says, "We must get married right away. I can't risk losing him." Love says, "Be patient. Don't panic. Plan your future with confidence."  Infatuation has an element of sexual excitement. Whenever you are together you hope it will end in intimacy. Love is not based on sex. It is the maturation of friendship which makes sex so much sweeter. You must be friends before you can be lovers.  Infatuation lacks confidence. When he's away, you wonder if he's cheating. Sometimes you check.  Love means trust. You are calm, secure and unthreatened. He feels your trust, and it makes him even more trustworthy.  Infatuation might lead you to do things you will regret, but love never steers you in the wrong direction.  Love is elevating. It lifts you up. It makes you look up. It makes you think up. It makes you a better person than you were before.   ~ Ann Landers ~

      Beauty provokes thieves sooner than gold.  William Shakespeare   Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength  while loving someone deeply gives you courage.  Lao Tzu   By her shining and her power he knew her.  "Fire from Heaven"  Mary Renault   Come, let us make love deathless, thou and I.  Herbert Trench   Don't ever frown because you never know  who's falling in love with your smile.  Unknown   Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow.  Don't walk behind me, I may not lead.  Just walk beside me and be my friend forever.  George Fox   Doubt that the stars are fire;  Doubt that the sun doth move;  Doubt truth to be a liar;  But never doubt I love.  "Hamlet"  William Shakespeare   Each moment of a happy lover's hour  is worth an age of dull and common life.  Aphra Behn   Each morning as I awaken  You're the reason I smile,  You're the reason I love.  Jerry Burton   For those who love... time is eternity...  Henry Van Dyke

      A part of you has grown in me  And so you see, it's you and me together forever  And never apart, maybe in distance,  But never in heart.  Unknown   A true man does not need to romance a different girl every night,  A true man romances the same girl for the rest of her life.  Ana Alas   Absence is to love what wind is to fire;  It extinguishes the small,  It inflames the great.  "Histoire amoureuse des Gaules"  Christopher Marlowe   Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  Unknown   Absence sharpens love, but presence strengthens it.  Fortune Cookie   All you need is love.  John Lennon   And the trouble is if you don't risk anything,  You risk even more.  Erica Jong   As selfishness and complaint pervert and cloud the mind,  So love with its joy clears and sharpens the vision.  Helen Keller   As the ocean is never full of water,  So is the heart never full of love.  Unknown   Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart.  Kahlil Gibran

       urlLink      For the month of  June , it was a unanimous decision that there is no other babe worthy of the June Babe of the Month title.....  Her name,  Angel Tan , and from her sweet babelicious smile, one cannot deny that she has the babe in her. She belongs to a loving and caring mother,  Molly Foong  and a rich, cute father,  Roland Tan  (who happens to own a restaurant named after him).  Currently, Angel is still under the care of her parents till she come of age.  One of her favourite taglines is: "Mummy-ah! Mummy-ah! Mummy-ah!"  Well Congratulations to you Angel! We hope you'd stay angelic too...    Keep update to this site to find out who will be the next babe of the month.   Regards  NoorIs inc CEO of BABE-Hall of Fame Academy

       Provided by Astrology.com    Gemini & Libra   When Gemini and Libra come together in a love affair, they enjoy a great relationship based on intellectual interests and mental agility. Dual-natured Gemini loves Libra's balance, and Libra is always entertained by the chatty, brainy Twins. Libra loves art and beauty while Gemini loves the beauty of an idea, but these loves aren't far off from one another.  Both Gemini and Libra have a great deal of mental energy. They can come up with all sorts of great ideas when they work together, and Libra has the get-up-and-go needed to put their ideas into action, a quality which Gemini tends to lack. In fact, in the birth of an idea Gemini is better at pontification than direction, but this is a valuable contribution to Libra's mental process. Both Signs share a need for intellectual freedom, which they can certainly provide for one another.  Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Gemini by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Libra and Gemini work well together; they combine the forces of love and communication. As Libra prizes harmony with their lover almost above all else, Gemini won't be able to indulge their love of a good, hearty debate too often; Libra would rather do almost anything than argue.  Both Libra and Gemini are Air Signs. Gemini loves Libra's energy and has no trouble keeping up when Libra is off and running with a new idea, art project or other pursuit. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, giving them great material for provocative discussion.  Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Libra is a Cardinal Sign. Libra likes a position of leadership in a relationship. They most often come up with the date ideas, for example, and flexible Gemini's happy to go along -- as long as it's okay to change their minds at the last minute. Libra tends to initiate things but has trouble finishing them; Gemini is so adaptable, they won't mind switching gears on a moment's notice and moving on to something else if Libra gets bored.  What's the best aspect of the Gemini-Libra relationship? Their ability to work together as an intellectual team. Together they can expose each other to new and different points of view and areas of interest, and help one another open up their worlds.

       urlLink       Name:   Muhammad Yusuf Abdul Rahman   Age:   17 years old   First Cry:   30.06.1986   About him:   He can be irritating at times, asking too many questions in too little a time.  Hardworking, at times, especially if there's a "price/prize" to it. He was verrrrrrrrry cute as a little boy, now grown up to be clever and mishievious when the occasion calls for it.   Birthday Message:  Stay cute, funny and jovial. Respect your elders. I wish all the best in your future endeavours and pray that you succeed in all you do with great faith, diligence and patience.
