       I know it's been a  looong  time since I last wrote anything.  Mea culpa.  Having Depression isn't fun. Trying to find a reason to get out of bed isn't fun. Of course, neither is breathing in a high-humidity environment. Yes, I have  asthma  . One of, at least I believe, the worst things to happen to a person with chronic panic attacks.     &nbsp;  In fact, I had to go to the hospital today, and they ended up giving me   TWO    shots of Ativan -- one in either arm (this was, of course,  after  the Albuterol treatment). These suckers didn't start really working until  after  I was home. Long after.     &nbsp;  I have a passion for things that are unusual, interesting, and/or&nbsp;weird. Take, for example, Ioan Gruffudd (pronounced Yo-an Griffith). He's an amazing Welsh actor, known better now that he's been in "King Arthur", but I had been a fan of this amazing talent since 1999, when A&E showed the miniseries, "Horatio Hornblower".   Fans are a weird lot. We write and read&nbsp;stories about our favorite movie or television characters (no matter how lame the series), collect photos of them, and all of that. "Horatioans" are no different.    &nbsp;  I also have a passion for Franklin Mint dolls. Like the Vinyl Princess Diana doll, with clothes you can change her into... I've got seven outfits, myself. But the one I'd really  love  is the Franklin Mint's Czarina Alexandra of Russia, designed by Faberge. I'll try to find a picture. This thing is stunning.    &nbsp;  Anyway, that'll be it for me right now. Talk later.    &nbsp;

      I am an internet addict. Why else would I be up at nearly four in the morning writing? I am also an eBay addict. I have no idea why, either. Maybe it's the idea of finally being able to buy all the stuff you wanted to, but at a cheaper price.  You know, I think the real reason I started this blog was to take my mind off my all-too-frequent panic attacks. I panic far too much. I worry about my health a lot. I know that makes me a hypochondriac, but does it make me selfish?  I don't know. All I know is that I'm tired of being the big fat joke that I am. I just don't know how to change myself. I don't even know if I have the  ability  to change myself. When I think about trying to change, my brain seems to hit a brick wall. It feels like I'm mentally stuck at seventeen, and emotionally stuck at two. Sometimes I just get  so  sick of being myself. It's like I'm trapped like this. I don't know what to do about it. And don't get me started on my various (and possibly emotionally-related) pains, aches, and numbness. My life is like one big out-of-body experience. Or something.  I hope I don't turn this journal into one long depressing letter to myself. But I  do  need to express myself, if not talk to somebody about it. After all, therapists and psychiatrists cost far too much when you don't have insurance. And the husband? Well, he doesn't know what to do, and half the time, doesn't want to be bothered.  But that's life. That's how things go. What should I expct otherwise? I should be used to being ignored by people... after all, I endured it all through school. Still doesn't take away the sting, though. But I  should  be used to it.  I'd like to lie and say that all of this is coming out because of lack of sleep, but sadly, I can't truthfully say that.  Question: Am I revealing too much of myself?
