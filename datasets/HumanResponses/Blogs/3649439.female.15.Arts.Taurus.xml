      I get to come home soon! T_T I miss you all! Well..most of you. *shifty glance* I'm REALLY going to miss German guys though, I mean.......wow. They are NICE!! I wish Wendy were here to share the glory with me. U_U In Scotland my friend, in Scotland. We shall admire the guys there, together. For love, FOR LOVE AND FOR PEACE!!! That boy had really nice eyes..I mean er-uhm >_ Aaanywho, I like it here muy mucho *nod nod*  not as nice as Ireland, I don't really feel at home like I was there, and the fact that none of us speak German, French, or Dutch, doesn't help any...Mom's talking about going to Spain, so my Spanish may actually be of use, since Joe is the only other one that speaks it. But we're going to Scotland first! *wink, nudge, elbows Wendy* Then Japan W00t!!! Umm..I guess that's all for now, I mean I'll end up talking to you all, you can ask your questions and whatnot then. *nods* Pies for nows.

      okokokokok this is my last quiz post thingy...for awhile. ^_^ I just got all excited when I got it:   Dragon: Dragons are very mysterious creatures who often live alone in caves with hoards of gold. You keep yourself from others and contain many armoured plates for defence. However,  you will be kind to others if they are kind to you. You are very thrifty and rarely waste any money.   I'm a mysterious creature!? Who knew? o.O;;

      Yeah..interesting I know, but I couldn't resist alright?   You are a Siren. More adventurous than all with a voice like no other you sit on warm rocks and sing to the moon and sea. Yet sometimes shipwrecks find you and raving men want you. You are a bottle of talent and power. What the unknown is you seek to find, and a lover. You have the moon and stars as freinds. There are a very few of you, what a rare find.

      AAAAGH!! I love quizzes ^_ Anywhoosy, I thought this one was right, comment! Tell me what you think!! ...or something!    You have a Calm Soul! Being calm and cool is what you do best. You collected thoughts and always positive attitude make you very bright and logical. When theres a problem, you know how to approach it, and solve it. Your friends rely on you on their problems, and your shoulder for their crying. You are peaceful, and enjoy nature and freedom. You rarely get angry and hardly scream, which makes you good with kids. You seem to be in tune with the world and if anything goes wrong, you always bounce back.

      I was hoping I'd get water, this was totally unexpected @.@ I think it hit right on the mark though, you wouldn't picture me as a sad and lonely type would you? ^_^ How little I have told you my friends...    You're Element is Night. You're a loner who is very creative but will never show your work to anyone. You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surrounds you and others can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriging and unorthidox but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like "Diamonds in the Rough"

      If this man isn't a god, I have no idea what he is. I've read a lot about him and listened to as much of his music as I can get my hands on, concluding that he truly is an incredible person. Not to mention insanely good looking >.     XD gotta love that Zorro look.

      Well hmmm lessee here...in news, which rarely happens, I'm going to Germany on the 20th should be back by the 4th of July, and if I'm not, don't worry, I will be back. n_n Here's a fun little riddle for the few of you that actually read this: I shed my second tear, into the cup of cheer, But look not in any cup, the answer's written here! My first is in blood and also in battle, My second in acorn oak, and apple, My third and forth are both the same, In the center of sorrow and twice in refrain, My fifth starts eternity ending here, My last is the first of last...Oh dear! If I told you the answer then you would know, 'Twas made in the winter of deepest snow. ~Brian Jacques

      Like mad libs, only over the internet! Crazyness, heres one of mine: Sing a Christmas Carol! Up on the housetop sheep pause, Out jumps pure sweet Santa LeGare, Down through the Saftey Pin with lots of wombats, All for the shy ones Christmas joys!  CHORUS: rot, rot, rot, Joe wouldn't stop, rot, rot, rot, Joe wouldn't stop,Up on the housetop, run, run, run, down through the Saftey Pin with mental Saint Andrea .  First comes the sock of dirty Wendy, Oh, stubborn Santa, fight it well, Give her a hippo that walks and swims, One that can open and kick their eyebrows.  CHORUS: rot, rot, rot, Joe wouldn't stop, rot, rot, rot, Joe wouldn't stop,Up on the housetop, run, run, run, down through the Saftey Pin with mental Saint Andrea .  Look in the elbow pad of insane Elliott, Oh just see the funny fill! Here is a hammer and lots of mushrooms, A drum that explodes and a lotion that dries!  CHORUS: rot, rot, rot, Joe wouldn't stop, rot, rot, rot, Joe wouldn't stop,Up on the housetop, run, run, run, down through the Saftey Pin with mental Saint Andrea.

      My dearest friends! I spent my insomnia over all of you, it's not much, hell it's not even very good, but I think it gets my point across well enough. Thank you all so much for being the best, greatest friends a person could ever ask for!!  This is dedicated to you my friends together we've faced all of life's bends, Starting with Joe, my brother I know, from before the start you were with me yelling 'HEY KATE!!' always carefree... Next comes Wendy, Andrea too like sisters to me I love both of you! Heather was gone, and now she's back won't take long for us to get on track. Michelle and Michelle, you're two of a kind both of you constantly invading my mind!! Then there's Vicky, who's oh so sweet being friends with you is the sweetest treat. No Elliott, I couldn't forget you cheering me up, no matter just how blue This is getting so long I fear I must stop! my many other friends, I never will drop Every one of you warms my heart and I sincerely hope that we never part.

      Hopeless Child: Gaia says you're not accepting PM's..or something, so pleaaaaaase don't think I'm ignoring you! >_ *Cough* In other news, I have the whole house to myself today!! Whooo. Everyones gone an its cool.. uhhhhh here:   Congrats! Your a Pure Angel! Angels, as far as most of them go, are all compatible creatures, but Pure ones simply are symbols of God. Pure Angels always appear when a child is born, when a rainbow is seen, or when someone shares their first kiss. They never grow old. People often think how young you look, yet you feel so old. Pure angels are the carriers of god, and show their love to everyone in the world.

      Not much new. Doin some homework, played FFVIII pretty much all day, that an some gaia. I've got to the 3rd dics in under 24 hours. @_@ That just screams 'you know you play too much Final Fantasy when...'Anyway, heres the vondaful result of a quiz I took, it's like, perfect. Ooo, and for those that don't already know, I belong in the Slytherin house. Damn I love these quizzes n_n;;    Your soul is DARK. You aren't too happy with your life, though you may feel you should be. You're probably solitary, pessimistic, brooding, possibly nocturnal, but mostly a general unknown. You might have a hidden liking for pain and destruction, but you're probably more masochistic that sadistic if that's true. Those that think they know you tend to place you closer to evil on a scale of good and evil, which most likely isn't true. What people see may not be who you actually are. Some people fear you and others mock you. What isn't really known, though, is that you're not pure evil. You're just a mysterious, misunderstood - and sadly, forsaken - soul.

      long lazy day today, lots of video game playing FFVIII, just finished with the FH quest on the second disc and liberated Balamb...finished my summer reading junk, Life of Pi, which remindes me i'd like some chocolate...>_ aaaaaaaanyway, no pictures today, yes, we're brushing up on our reading skills children. ^_^ I had mucho fun hangin with Wendy, even though i slept most of the time...when i got home no one was online, not even elliott.  i havent talked to him for awhile actually. he's online but he wont say hi, makes me wonder if i did something wrong? maybe he just doesn't wanna be friends anymore? whatever it is, makes me feel like ive lost something good, like a friend died. one of those things you think is going to last forever you know? one day you wake up to find its not there and you're back to being all alone. never had anyone that would listen to my sadness before. first person that let me vent all the time too hahah. i dont think i ever got a chance to tell him but, when kate broke up with him iono which one of us was sadder. i always told you eh andrea? all i ever wanted was for him to be happy, why i always tried to cheer him up! ah...im just rambling. not like anybody ever reads these anyway.. i'm tired of tasting my own tears, bout two months ago i wouldn't have to. id be too busy talking to someone that made me laugh till it hurt. just hurts in a different way this time.

      Home from a lake. I never loved the shower so much in my life. I meana, once you jump in a lake full of dead fish, and don't have the opportunity to shower for a few days, you realize the shower is a very blessed invention...
