       yesterday was a great day, had learnt a lot of good things, one of them being that my core competency (all those doing a strategic management course shall understand the importance of this term) is my optimism. I remember gautam telling me that once, even writing that in my slam book ... but somehow on the way to a more professional life i had left it on the way somewhere .... but today morning i decided to be optimistic in life again ... wanted to look upto things the way i want to see them not the way the world makes me see them, beleive me it helps. Coz today morning I heard myself saying that today is going to be one of the best days of my life ... well dont know abt that but had a great day indeed. Rest aside, I am going to switzerland .... there is a whole list of people i need to thank for the same, the first and foremost being avantika who took the pains to sit on my essay for whatever time it took her to revise the entire thing from top to bottom (and the number of hrs surely exceeds 24) atleast i could have had had never ever come up with such a fantastic piece. prob it was the essay only that made them choose me besides salil since salil has a higher cg, somewhat better cv and overall had put in more effort that me, or maybe i dont know about it so should not comment. The idea is that they were to take only 1 from each insti, from our insti they took 2 so .... and .... and nothing else .... oops continuing on the list of people i need to thank includes Manjari (of course yes!), Sameer Singhdeo, and Sameer Lal for telling me that i cant write good poetry, Ms. Neerja Pande coz had it not been her I shall have had had sent a totally rotten essay to those guys ... What else, hmm lemme think .... i dont know, i am too excited about it  Somehow i like the idea of blogging, gives u a good way to express your own self. The day is going to be hectic ahead so wanted to live this moment all by my own self. Am going to delhi to meet a very very old [FEMALE] friend Supriti .... lets see how the thing comes up to be .... what else strat man presentation tomorrow and a lot lot lot of work to do for the same.  Chalo signing of on a more optimistic note !

       Thanks Nakul for introducing me ...  i know this is quite a late since you introduced this to me, or rather i got to know abt it through u somehow .... but then its never too late, and i am lazy so both things go hand in hand  ok guys so all u guys who are reading this lemme tell you that i am poor at those writing skills (at one time i thought i was some big hot stud to write great things, now i know that most of what i wrote was what most people in this business school call globe, though i still regard this globe of high quality)  Its a tough world, and things this side are making things tougher, none the less every day is an opportunity to learn to witness something new, to understand someone more and to understand yourself more .... to improvise. Well if that is the case, today was a good day indeed. Started on a note of esteem self control [withheld from public display] and then went out with me spending a substantial time on my Strat Man project. The assignment was to prepare an industry note. All i was doing was going through several industry analysis and trying to figure out the same .... well in other words i was cutting and pasting. But somehow in the middle i realized that i know more now than what i knew during my summers (which were incidently in the same industry as the one i am working for: Telecom). Well how so ever incremental, i got to know more about things and the industry. Its not exactly fraud. Yes people are right, there is a lot of fraud around, and if you are reading this nakul i buy your argument about this. but then i still see the zeal in you to make a difference here and honestly speaking people need to keep upto their levels of zeal at all places ......   regarding knowing someone more, i had a long chat with manjari, and the best part is that i think i know her more now. no it is nothing drastic, but now i understand several of her actions over the 4 years we have been together .... i truly like the female and what she does to me when i am with her in whatever way !  I got to know myself more, and i am improvising   A good day indeed ....  anf for all those who dont know me, i am a very very very optimistic person. and ambitious too .... the next thing to do is to start writing a poem .... havent written one for quite sometime.  And if u are reading this, come back, revisit ... you shall see my writing skills come back to normal and imrprove also ... i am more determined now   Thanks Manjari
