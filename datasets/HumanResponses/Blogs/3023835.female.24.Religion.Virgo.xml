      I do.  I am in Love. Unequivocally, unrepentantly, unapologetically in Love with JAH. There's nothing like that feeling. Describing it to someone who's never felt it before would be like describing what a tickle feels like. Sometimes I just well up inside. You know how, in cartoons, when a character has to pee really bad? So bad that their eyes float in yellow liquid? That's how that feels. Like I'm going to bust open & gush everywhere. Sometimes I cry ecstatic tears. I laugh for no reason. I look at a tree or a cloud & know that JAH is all around me, like a hug that never ends. It gives me chills even now.   I am so truly blessed to have found a church where I can openly express my faith without fear of criticism or judgement. Dancing is encouraged, singing, laughing out loud... communing with Mother Nature is recommended for a healthy life. I can hug a tree, talk to plants, or kiss a cave wall & not worry that someone is going to tease me. I can run toward the ocean, skipping, spinning jubilantly... without the concern that the company I keep will wonder what has gotten into me. Mostly because IT has gotten into them, too, & they don't need to wonder. They already know.   My church is not based on fear or guilt. My church does not bash gays, it ordains them. My church does not supress questions or feelings. My church Loves the Spirit that I am & has embraced me since the very beginning. In my church, I am called "Sister", & I know it means something. In my church, members hug when they meet, & I feel complete. I can sit down next to any of them, & start a conversation, well received. I know that if I ever was in trouble, I could call on any of them, & help would arrive shortly. We take care of each other holistically. Loving each other as ourselves.  I am an Essene.

      was on the return side of a road trip through Arizona last September. A car was ablaze on the side of busy interstate 40. Unoccupied, & blazing with such ferocity that the driver & I sat silent for a long time after we passed the scene. Hoping no one had been hurt, it was a forceful reminder of the fragility of not just human life, but of those objects in which we instill our trust. We put our children in the backseat. We drive to the hospital with ailing elders strapped into the passenger side. And yet, one day, when you're driving along & everything's fine... and before you can react, something goes wrong. Bang. Up in flames.  Tonight, as I write these words, the last few flames which engulfed a local church are degenerating down into embers. Again, before you know it, something we put our faith in is suddenly gone, & you're sitting on the side of the road thinking, "I brought my children here. I came here with my grandparents." A diligent reminder of the impermanence of material things. All that is created, is eventually destroyed.   I saved a burnt piece of shingle to look at whenever I think I'm indestructible. Babylon is falling. All that is created, will be destroyed...
