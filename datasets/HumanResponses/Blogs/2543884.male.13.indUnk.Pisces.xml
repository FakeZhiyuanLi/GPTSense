      im drunker than hell. i cant see the door. my friends are all passed out flat on the floor.  my head is spinning. i can hardly walk. my ears are ringing and i cant talk.  with vodka in one hand and booze in the other, this is one of those reasons i'll never become a mother.  i wouldnt give up this feeling for the rest of my years. i love being drunk. i love drinking beer.  painful migranes for hours, and waking up late is just part of the the hangonver that everyone hates.  but me, i dont hate it. i like it quite well. a mere 9 years old i was put under this spell.  no matter what they say, you can be merry and drink. personally, i find, it helps me to think.

      being grounded sucks. its really really boring. but whats worse, is that your parents dont trust you enough so they send you to your  grandparents  house where you have to listen to AM 1490 for hours at a time while driving down the freeway at 35. you get grounded from the dance, which you wouldnt have gone to anyway other than to crash it and get kicked out because all the preps go there and nobody and i mean nobody wants to see pink jumpsuit girl again. *sigh* damn i think my computers gonna blow up its makin funny noises *scream* peace out

      the homie-os are just another retarded group of friends... not really much to it. other than the fact that we get away with almost anything. from ripping off handicapped buttons to calling a certain teacher a bitch to her face, we can get out of it. we seem to be in a tight situation at the moment, but will undoubtedly come clean. we know the culverts of la crescent like the back of our hand... we could run around down in pine creek in the middle of the night blindfolded with an apple pie balanced on our head. we havent gotten around to constructing a complete map of our attics yet, but have definate plans. ill keep you posted on the stupid things me and my friends do, not that you could give a shit...this is more or less for us.

      I'd like to say just a few things: ice is not made for shoving down poor civillians' shirts. When a wooden table says MAXIMUM: 60 LBS!, don't sit on it. Always, always add at least 3/4 cup more sugar to the kool aid. When a person is laying on the floor, don't jump on their head. If the creek looks like it's shallow, it's not. Never trust a drunk person with a pitch fork. peace out

      next time you wanna exert yourself and get involved in buffin up your body, make SURE you talk to a good friend of mine, austin wagner. he knows everything you possibly can about rock hard abs, bulging calf muscles and buns of steel. his phone number is 895-4044 and he is available 24/7 for any info on weight loss, weight lifting, hair curling, and can also set you up with a personal trainer. he is extremely talented in his line of work and is available for any appointments, me of course, being his secretary.

      SPRING BREAK BABY!!! well...lots has happened. austin and i convinced trav to let us put rollers in his hair...grin. about a week ago luke, austin and i went BAT HUNTING in austins attic. unfortunately, the bat sensed danger and flew away. brad, luke, austin, trav, and i were at travs house the other day and we decided to play a small game of throw-things-on-top-of-people-in-a-little-box. austin, luke and i jumped in the little box first and brad and trav had the honor of throwing shit on us. after our turn, brad and trav jumped in. lets just say we tossed stuff on em, grabbed a shitload of mint chocolate chip ice cream that was off limits in the freezer, ran upstairs, blocked the door and indulged. eventually the unlucky ones found out our plan and climbed out through the basement window. they barged in through the door to find me sittin on the floor eatin forbidden ice cream, luke sittin on a chair holdin the door and austin takin a piss. luke and i hightailed it outta there, no coat or shoes...brad walked in on austin relievin himself. eventually we ended up using croquet hammers to ward off the bad guys. the next day we spent our time playing retarded wheelchair-boy and rolling each other over with a round wooden table. ahhhhhhhhhh, memories......

      "Black Curtains"  I need a place where i can go where stinging scars and pain won't show. Another world, with no more tears. With no more fighting, where hurt disappears. Give me this place. Save me from Hell. The Devil has found me. My hopes just fell. Just keep me conscious. I'll stay alive. Yet I'll still continue my endless drive for a room with black curtains. But no windows to see. It probably sounds crazy, my unlikely plea. Cause everyone knows there is no such place. Just live your life, it's not a race. Don't forget me, and I won't forget you. We'll recognize each other in this little world, too.

       Whooshing Barrels   I'm stuck in a rug, I'm stuck in a rug. Oh Lord please help me; I'm stuck in a rug.  I don't know how i got here. Perhaps i could be stoned. it doesnt matter however, i dont think im alone. i do not know what's down here. but i might have a clue. i think its shannon stever cause quentin's down here too!  i'm stuck in a rug, i'm stuck in a rug. oh lord please help me; i'm stuck in a rug.  my head is spinning round and round. there's havoc in the air. i do believe i've lost my mind, yet i don't have a care. the carpet rolls, and i am trapped. there's nothign i can do. oh shit! i think the creature is emerging from the blue.  i'm stuck in a rug, i'm stuck in a rug. oh lord please help me; i'm stuck in a rug.  no it isn't shannon. and i dont think it's brad. therefore it must be cindy cause it's smelling really bad. cindy must've pooted. the bugs have gone astray. a stench is entering my nostrils. what a shitty day!  copyright - austin & cindy    WHEELCHAIR BOY   he rides through the streets. his face filled with glee. he gets too excited and his pants fill with pee. the flag whizzes behind him. the wheels are spinning round. he doesn't see the curb ahead and ends up on the ground.  wheelchair boy, wheelchair boy you say there's nothing wrong. wheelchair boy, wheelchair boy help me sing this song...  his hat falls off, his eyes fill with tears. he sees all the homie-os guzzling beers. he pulls up beside them. he wants to join in. and right at that moment brad pulls out the gin.  wheelchair boy, wheelchair boy. show me what you do. wheelchair boy, wheelchair boy. i wish to be like you.  austin pops the bottle. the cap soars through the air. wheelchair boy gets nailed. the cap is stuck in his hair. he shouts again; he needs some help. but nothing can help him now. a large stampede of raging beasts is being led by a cow.  wheelchair boy, wheelchair boy. i no longer wanna be like you. wheelchair boy, wheelchair boy, what will you do?  he plops in his wheelchair, and turns on the gas. unfortunately, he is too slow, and the beasts kick his ass. so now that wheelchair boy is gone, the homie-o's idol is dead. they'll always remember him, however, for in their attic they keep his head.  wheelchair boy, wheelchair boy you say there's nothing wrong. wheelchair boy, wheelchair boy, dont you love our song?

      hi guys; haven't writtin in here in awhile...tons has happened...we've got about 3 weeks left of school and the days are just draggin... im in track now along with luke and it sucks. it's painful and pointless. unfortunately we had to clean out the attic tonight to ensure a safe summer... it'd be risky with all the chairs missing and it'd be too hot to go up there anyways. recently we've dismantled stolen bikes, rode wheelbarrows to quillin's to get krispy kremes, made a pimped out wheelchair, ect... havent been in the culverts recently...  THE WHEELCHAIR: it all started when sam, luke and i spotted a few lonely wheelchairs sittin by the side of the group home on lancer blvd... deciding it'd be quite suspicious if 3 kids in the dark were spotted pushing a wheelchair down a busy road in the middle of the night. so the next day austin and i went over to the home and jacked a deranged wheelchair with no seat. since then we have pimped it out to an extreme, adding a seat with a plaid cushion and making it mandatory to wear an old TCI hard hat when riding. we've got a blue flag and an old liscence plate sewn onto the back... the ultimate ride.  ~~shander

      well, this is austin, and i think this is finally workin even though its really confusing. oh yeah, and i finally dressed up as a woman. and it was rather comfortably i might add. i had on the pants luke had worn, and i tried on a couple shirts, but i didnt like em so i took em off. other than that, my life is very dull, consisting of baseball, dog wathcin, and sister watching, except on wednesdays, fridays, and weekends, during which i take part in many illegal activieties, however, anyone who reads this probably already knows that. *grin*

      hey guys:-D got some more lyrics for ya...check these out adam - need input;-)  HARDBALL   verse 1  yesterday @ 12:00 my friends gave me a call. they said they're headin to the park to play themselves some ball. i grabbed my glove, said "be right there" and hopped upon my bike. but when i wheeled into the park, something wasn't right. these boys i thought to be my friends weren't really pals at all. the thing is marijuana and the game they play is hardball.    chorus  i guess the times have changed 'round here and baseball ain't the same. running from the cops is fun and kids smoke mary jane.    verse 2  next thing i knew i was on my knees sitting on the ground. i waited tense and nervously as doobies were passed round. they told me i'd like it; of course i did. and now i'm hooked for life. i carry it around with me and smoke it every night. but one late night, the cops caught us and then they beat us down. they took our stash and handcuffed us. patrol cars took us downtown.   chorus  hell ya the times have changed and nothin is the same. the cops already caught me and i smoke mary jane.    verse 3  over the years i've had my fun its time to take a rest. i guess 5 years probation has put me to the test. 2 friends are dead, the rest in jail. we rise and then we fall. but i'll never forget the day in the park and that game of baseball. i'll probably never smoke again ive tried it, now i'm done. but maybe during baseball season i'll have myself some fun...

       well, i havent written on here much, but there was an event the other day i would love to talk about. one day while searching through the dumpsters by la crescent middle school, 5 little folks came up and started&nbsp;talkin to shanda, luke, brad, and me. clayton, eli, tanner, anthony, and austin. clayton and austin were the only pimpin ones though, the others all tried to bite us, and one, eli i think, was a blackbelt. so anyway, we chased em around for a while, but then they finally left. little did we know at the time, a mere few days later, we would be seeing them once again, for the most memorable kickball game of my life. this time, however, there were two new people, collin, who i will venture to say was rather portly, and dillian, the oldest at the age of 10, being a complete arrogent asshole. it seemed collin was somewhat attracted to shanda, and therefore placed her on his team instantly. after that day, they told us to come back if ever we could. lo and behold, the very next day, we saw them over at the softball field, and decided to join them. but things went terribly horribly wrong. collin was stealing third, with a maniacal glint in his eyes,&nbsp;dillian charging him with the ball. dillian through it at his legs, and collin came crashing to the ground on his knee. which received 2 or three scrapes the size of a grain of salt. he was balling for about 20 minutes before he allowed shanda to put a band-aid on his battle wound, saying girls were good at this thing. so, all's well that ends well. i hope shandas around next time i have a miniscule drop of blood on my knee! have a lovely day, the big pablob

        i'm feeling quite creative indeed, hence i am writing in this god-forsaken thing.&nbsp; here i am talkin about god,&nbsp; when most people know i'm agnostic. what's agnostic you ask? unlike atheists (who&nbsp;aren't devil worshipers you naughty children), agnostics do not practice religion. agnostics tend to remain neutral, not agreeing or disagreeing on any religious beliefs. i don't go to church, yet was baptized as a mere infant as christian. i don't regret not believing in any specific religion. it doesn't irritate or bother me when people openly talk about their "church life", etc... but what does agitate me are the laws against some religions or beliefs. the big WWII for instance. what the hell is up with the germans? and didn't&nbsp; hitler have jewish blood in him? but since the 40's are over, and we don't normally shoot individuals for their race or religion, shouldn't we be free to believe what we want to? yes, america is "free", but we're not near as liberated as we think we are. sure, we're allowed to worship differently, but some religions are literally banned from promoting their beliefs. pity, right? why can catholics proudly display jesus and the cross in front of their churches? what if i just so happened to worship my middle finger? i guarantee you the government wouldn't allow me to have a huge statue of a middle finger in my yard. so what if it's a *gasp* bad sign? suppose i looked upon the cross as a threat. there's nothing i can do to remove it's presence in our society. i have absolutely nothing against christians, catholics, or any religion, just to inform thee. but some people do. satanic worshipers. there's nothing wrong with them. they simply choose to praise the devil. but kids can't wear a fricken tee shirt to school letting others know they worship the devil. omigosh how awful. and a lot of the school dress code has to do with the principal and big shots of the school. they don't liberate children enough to be free to wear what the want. why? because  they  don't believe in the religion either. how much you wanna bet that if the principal and staff members were all satanists, they'd allow their minions to support the religion? but...they're not. and they don't allow support of any religions foreign to their regular, every-day beliefs. and if you want to take it farther than school systems and cities, the government in D.C. also has a lot to do with this. the president supposedly permits any and all religions in the united states of america. but does the government see to it that cities, towns, and states are liberated as they should be? guess not. cause we sure aren't. i understand that some of you who read this may disagree intensely, but hell, i live in america and i'm gonna do whatever i want. this is my opinion. i've stated it. and once again, i'm not hinting that i dislike or have anything against anyone's religion. i'm simply saying that this is america dammit. give us some freedom.   i pledge allegiance  to the flag  of the united states of america  and to the republic  for which it stands  one nation  under my stubby, big-knuckled middle finger,  indivisible   for liberty and justice for all.

       hi fellers:-) yesterday luke, austin, brad, and myself got dropped off in downtown lacrosse. we screwed around for a couple hours, smelling incense by the thousand *fizzy pop rules!* and laughing at drunk people. eventually this got somewhat dull and we decided to catch the bus home. unfortunately... the appley express stops runnin at 5:30. being an ungrateful&nbsp;6:15, we walked across the big blue bridge to pettibone park and took a dip in the big wa wa. &nbsp;and as warm as the water may seem, it's a hell of a lot less warm when you remove yourself from the river. so here we were, four 13-year olds walking by themselves along the highway towards lacrescent. thinking it was only about 2 miles away, we took our time. many minutes (and about 2 miles) later, we glanced at our watches and panicked. 7:45 with still two miles to go. normally this wouldn't have mattered, except for the fact that i had to call granny and let her know when we were home from the bus. bummer. we picked up the pace and attempted to run the remaining 3200 meters. about 1/2 mile later, austin and brad fatigued. luke and shanda continued jogging, leaving the two boys in the dust. about a mile later, with only 1/2 mile to go, luke's ankle gave out and he was forced by cindy *yours truly* to stop and walk. shanda continued runnin and eventually made it to the intersection atop the hillcrest, then to BP (which i think is a very, very terrarded name for a gas station. what was wrong with amoco? BP! sheesh!) from  BP  i called granny, informing her that we were safe and sound at home. little did she know we had just ran 2 miles in soaking wet clothing to tell her a lie.

      well... some of you may already know about this. this past weekend, luke, austin, and i decided that it'd be quite pimpin to break into the levenick's household and switch balloon animal pumps with badley. also, as you may know, brad's family was out of town in potato lake for the weekend. as we finished writing a short note on a white balloon puppy, a black pick up truck *gasp* pulled into the driveway. we dashed out of brad's room and galumphed into the living room, where we attempted to escape through a sliding glass door. unfortunately, it was a terrarded glass door and had a 2 by 4 jamming the door from opening. after much panic and dissarray, luke managed to unfold the secret to opening the door while shanda and austin ran around in countless circles trying to think of an alternative route. we tore out of the house and took a rest right outside of a window. so here we were, 3 terrarded kids, sittin in front of clear glass, deciding where to go. finally we jumped up and ran around the house, attempting another escape to the safe gravel road some yards away. unfortunately, the levenick's 2 dogs chose this as a time to take a poo outside and spotted the felons. they chased us 2 blocks up a hill and into the bushes. shanda and austin dove into the weeds, hoping not to be found. maddie waddled to the two crouching in the overgrown grass and started making a rather large scene. luke decided to pick up kayla and return her to the guy in the black pick up truck. eventually the two canines were placed back in their yard and austin and shanda removed themselves from the thickets. the three homie-os now trudged up the gravel hill and proceeded to migrate back down to shanda's house. let's just say that the right fork is not always the right path to take. this trail led to a bloody escapade through the forest - luke and shanda lacking proper-length pants, austin lacking shoes. with luke in the lead, they soon came upon a 10 degree slope with obstacles such as roots, weeds, and sharp thorny objects in the way. luke proceeded to advance down the mudslide *did i mention it was raining this entire night?* while shanda and austin waited in anticipation at the top. shanda came next, barely managing to keep her footing, and austin...well...austin...he somersaulted 25 feet down a sheer mud-cliff in a barrel-roll, all because of a "STUPID PROTRUDING ROOT!" in the center of the trail. austin survived without a mere scratch, while luke's legs were ripped to shreds and shanda's head torn off. everyone being alive, they marched down to kistler park, hoping to use the showers for free to "rinse off". when they got there, they decided that the pool is only for bad terrards and skipped to shanda's house. there they dove into the pool, and after freezing for about 3 seconds, shot out and settled themselves into a steamy hot bath. with popcorn. lots of popcorn. some days later, the levenicks found out about our stunt and got quite irritated indeed. i myself was grounded for a day, even though i slaved over an apology letter to the parents. shucks.

        LOST    Description: Tan pair of Khaki shorts Last Seen: June 17th, 2004, Ditch by the school Owner: Luke Petersen Story: One fine evening while rampaging in the pouring rain, Luke, Austin, Shanda, and Amy decided it would be pimpin to go into the ditch. While they made it into the life-threatening waters, mosquitoes swarmed and pierced the flesh of any innocent happy-go-lucky children looking for a good time. Luke decided it'd be a brilliant idea to lounge in the water and layed down in a shallow area. Unfortunately for the other three teenagers, Luke's shorts were whooshed away. Much to their avail, many hours of searching did nothing for them and they haven't seen the shorts since. If you've seen or heard anything, please call 895-6109. As far as we know, they could be in the Gulf of Mexico right now. I guess the poor little Mexicans don't hafta run around nakey anymore!!
