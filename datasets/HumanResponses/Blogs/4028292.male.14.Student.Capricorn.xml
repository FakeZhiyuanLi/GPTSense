        Mayhem at the meadows was the most insane concert i have ever been too.........IT WAS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!.........The two best bands there were Soil and Slipknot those bands kicked ass........During the second song soil played i went crowd surfing for the first time in my life....it was awsome!. Then after that i ripped it up in the mosh pit , but the best part of the concert was definatly Slipknot......They played last and they played for like an hour and 15 minutes! During slipknot i must've went crowed surfing like 30 times it was insane!!!!! Those guys went crazy on stage and they said they will be back to Oregon very soon because it's there favorite spot to play.....The concert went on for 10 hours throughout the day , oh yeah and SLAYER was there , and i got home around 1 in the mourning then came home and watched some t.v. then went to bed........that was the concert , glad i didn't die!

        There have been many water fights in the summer , but they just seem like they keep on getting worse and worse!!!! THEY SUCK!!!!!!!!!!The first time was a blast , but i just had one today with emily , katie , and rissy and it sucked.......I guess just because there's alot of stress........Emily is all mad at me because apparently i'm a man whore......I make out with one girl in my life (i'm single of coarse) and i come home and tell her and she gets all pissed at me and calls me a man whore....I dont 'get this at all!!!!!!!!!!!it makes me quite upset but oh well , maybe things will change........Anyways that's all for now

      I was down at Malibu California for a week playing water polo at Terry Schorders water polo camp.......It was very fun but tiring.....I roomed with chase and that was an adventure , i couldnt' really fall asleep because he was shaking the windows with his loud snoring.......but oh well it was Malibu California! Every day we would have our daily routine , wake up , eat , water polo , lunch , water polo , dinner , water polo , dorms , and eat chinese food.........The water polo camp was exahusting , i was in the pool for about 7 hours a day swimming , passing , and playing kick ass water polo......I'll have many memories at this camp for example when chase and i snuck into nick grohders (wow that was spelled wrong) dorm and put icey hott all over his speedo.....Good times! I got back to portland at about 6 p.m.........The plane ride was fun it was a 2 hour flight , but there were alot of japanese people there and they seemed confused.....My dad drove chase ,lacey and i home , and we went to red robin..........It got very steamy in that car and that resturant , lacey and i were........spooning haha............well that was malibu and please SOMEONE COMMENT , no one does SO SOMEONE DO IT
