      This could quite possibly be one of the WORST periods ever. I've got terrible cramps and would love to go curl up in bed. *sigh*  One more work day till vacation! WooooHoooo!

      OMG since Cassidys birth I've had PMS and periods from hell!! I'm even scaring myself. Crying, screaming, bitching at Mike, it's awful. I don't know if it's just post pregnancy hormones, being back on the pill or what?   This weekend was nice. Cassidy is amazing me everyday, of course *I* think she's the smartest baby in all the land, she's so smiley & giggly and over all a really happy little girl. Yesterday I was singing "Hey, hey were the Monkees" and she was cracking up!   Saturday morning we're leaving for Florida. Aaaaaaahhhhhh 8 days laying on the beach or at the pool with my family. It doesn't get much better than that, huh?

      I was a little upset the other day to find out that when MIL babysits she's not always completely honest with me about how Cassidys day went (not telling me if she cries, has meltdowns, etc...) this is stuff that I *want* to know about. Just because I'm her mom, right now I'm her voice and I want to know. Bottom line, Mike needs to talk to his mom about this.   We bought Cassidy a Fisher Price Jumperoo, put her in it for the first time this morning and she was all smiles. I love seeing her so happy! Made for a nice start to my day.  I'm glad today is Thursday, 3 whole days with my sweet baby girl. *swoon*  Forgot to add that I'm feeling a little tired she was bright eyed and bushy tailed at 5am today. *snooze*

      So last night as I was rocking my sweet baby girl to sleep it hit me; she really is a *part* of me, I feel like my heart is outside of my body, she is so much a part of me that I actually *long* to be with her when we are apart.   I hate working, don't get me wrong, I feel fortunate that I'm able to work part time and have Fridays off but I still hate leaving her in the morning. It sucks.   Today she was sleeping when I left for work, she had woke up early (5:50am), had a bottle, played with me for awhile and then fell back to sleep right around 8:15am.   I'll call here in a bit and check on her, grandma is at our house babysitting today.

      Let me preface this by saying that yesterday (Fathers Day) was a rough day too, we spent the day at Mikes parents house with lots of other people. I think it was sensory overload for Cassidy, she was whiney and wanted her Mama all day long.   This morning I thought things would be better because she'd have some one on one (downtime) with Granny, but no, Granny just called and said that Cassidy had a meltdown and then fell asleep.  I'm wondering if her teeth are bothering her?   Poor baby, I hate being away from her when she's sad.

      I ordered one today and I'm anxious for it to get here. I think Cassidy will like me toting her around; I'm hoping it will be more comfortable than the Snugli was.   I've also been researching teaching her sign language. Fun stuff!  Tomorrow is Monday, blech. I've had such a great weekend with my family. :)

      It's official, Miss Cassidy Ann Cole has rolled over. She rolled from back to belly about 4 times while her daddy & I were eating dinner. She also rolled right to stomach when I laid her down in her crib tonight.   *Milestone*   She did something else that was really sweet tonight, we were snuggling on my bed before she went down and she just kept rubbing&nbsp;my hair until she was fast asleep. Tender moments.   I'm having a great weekend just being with her (Mike too ;P )

      We returned from FL on Sunday, good time had by all. Cassidy did surprisingly well on both flights and she really enjoyed the swimming pool.  I will say that it did get to be a bit *much* with 6 adults and 2 infants in the condo (no downtime), but overall it was a great vacation and we'll definitely do it again next year. Yahhhoooo!  I'm off again tomorrow, Grandpa Cole is having foot surgery. Another long weekend for Cassidy and I, 4 whole days together.   Oh, we're also planning a girls trip to FL, it'll be me, granny, BB and Cassidy. Leaving August 18th and returning on the 23rd. I think Daddy will enjoy having the house to himself for a long weekend, can you say BACHELOR PAD?

      I've been a little slack about writing. I'll get better.  I think Cassidy is in the midst of teething hell, she's drooling like crazy and doing this consistent whiney thing. (not attractive!) ;)  This weekend is Brendas surprise 30th b-day party and Jesses 18th birthday. Should be a busy, but fun, weekend. I always enjoy showing off Tinks. ;) *proud mama*
