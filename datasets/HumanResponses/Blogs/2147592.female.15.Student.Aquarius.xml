      Hey! Well todays been alright... I woke up bout 12, then I had to babysit Jacob (my sisters baby!). Then Karen (the mum) came back so I did nothing! lmao! I weighed myself and in a week I've lost... 1 STONE!!! I'm well proud of myself, it must be all the running around I've been doing!Later Me and Fran went down Will's and did absolutely nothing again! I think I've persuaded him to come to Jax with me... We'll have to see tomorrow! Because we're going Newquay, I think! Will has to go, he makes me laugh! Oh yeah guys. My fancy list has narrowed even more! 1. Sammy Dodds I've been thinking about it and I don't really fancy the others, I just think there fit, not really Aodh, he's just a laugh, and Russ, I prefer him as a mate! But Sammy's just like PWARRH! I've got a pic of him next to my bed so he's the first thing I wake up to and the last thing I see before I go to sleep... I mean did I say that out LOUD??? Well better be going. I'll write LOADS tomorrow, or attempt to! pmsl! Love y'all and I mean that 110% JeSsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey. I had the first lie-in I've had in ages! I woke up at 1! I'm soooooooo dropping my standards, it used to be like 5! Then I had to go to the hairdressers so Gina could sort my hair out, she came round later and cut it! Tomorrow shes dying it for me, brown! It'll be good to go back to my original colour, you don't know how long it's been! I've been like 4 different shades of orange! I also, in return, had to look after Joseph, so because I was I had to draw EVERY SINGLE character in Bob The Builder at least 5 times! I can't wait till I have kids.... After that me and Fran went to Will's again. Kev makes me laugh sooooo much! We left and came home. Then I've been waiting to come on this thing. Sammy has left me AGAIN! He's such a bist! Well I'm gonna go now, soz I'm boring. You should read the top of the page! Love y'all PlOp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey! Todays been HORRIBLE! I woke up to my sister shouting at me: BEEF JOINT! We were having my not-so-friendly hairdresser, Gina, coming over for tea today. So I had to clean all of the kitchen and if anyones been to my house you would know that my house is a tip! Well yeah I tidied the kitchen and it was painful! Gina came round with her sister, Renee, Joseph (son) and Madeline (Renee's daughter). Later Joseph and Madeline completely trashed Fran's room which was quite funny! They took stickers from her mirror and put them on the radiator, I taught them to say my name! It ws great! Then me and Fran went out and we met up with her boyfriend-to-be, Tom, and then we went down Will's. Fran and Tom left and I stayed with Will and Kev, which was soooooooooo not fun! The only fun I got from there was listening to the Darkness then watching Graham Norton (he's such a DUDE!). Fran came back, we left then went in this Owen's flat again. We then walked home with an arsonist who likes to smash up toilets, set gas filler upper things (for lighters) alight and carries knives like the ones from Lord of the Rings with him... I was scared! Well I'm gonna go now, but it's only because my day has been extremely boring and I have nothing else to say... Sammy's online FINALLY! But he still aint chatting! Take care my little punjabskis xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxMWAHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey! Well todays just been about the most happiest day of my life... NOT! I've been like crying all day! First of all I was looking forward to this lie-in, then my sister comes in my room at 8 in the morning, YES 8 IN THE MORNING! Asking me to look after baby Jacob (her son) and she blaitently knows that I don't like the idea of sleeping with him, I always think I'll end up killing him, so in the end I slept with him, but no, not for 2 hours like she said, but for 4 hours! And he cried! Dude, I'm really not looking forward to Myron Chester Brett, Justin John and Iris! After that I phoned my mate Letty, went round, not very fun! I stayed there till after Prince of Bel Air had finished then I got a lift home with her mums boyfriend (Rod). I seriously didn't feel welcome there, especially when Yvonne (Letty's mum) brought her best mate back with her (Di). They were all being so out of order to me. Then I come home to even more shit, sorry but it does my head in. I don't ask for much and yet I get treated like everything else but a person. Well I was crying from 20 to 11, till about 12, so I'm kinda all dried out now! I dunno why I cried though, I always cry but not for any reason... I probably have a problem. Well I don't think Sammy's gonna come on, yet again, so I'm going to make like a tree and leave. HA HA HA Well I find that hilarious, if anyone's seen the "Back To The Future" series, they would know why! Well sweet dreams and I hope, I dunno, lol, WORLD PEACE OCCURS JUST BECAUSE I SAID IT!!! love y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx OUR LADY PEACE ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      hey its me. I put my alarm on so I could wake up early for church but in the end I just switched the alarm off!! I woke up to my sister telling me that the 2 Gary's had called for me and because she thought I was going to church she said I was out, so after 2 hours of waiting for me, I came outside! We had soo much fun, sitting on the gates to the golf course for ages, then as we were talking Fran had come back from this imaginary place... She had turned green and was covered with spots, and when she came back... Yeah thats enough of that, yeah! I don't know what else to write because today, well not much happened! After asking every person I knew if they would come to Jax with me (a Christian hang out place) no one would come with me, so after blagging my sister to give me lift I managed to get there, on my own! It all felt so welcoming, I came in, people stared, then I sat down next to a girl I didn't even know and I couldn't understand her! Sammy then came to the rescue, but then left me - I felt soooooooooo stupid. They played this song and there was pictures and it was like of everyone in the group, apart from me and it just made me really down :( then they played my favourite Linkin Park song, which made me worse. After I was trying really hard not to cry then Cally came up to me and she just comes out with the most nicest things... I ended up crying, we prayed, now I'm gonna try to put a meaning to my life! Apart from that my nose is the nicest and most perfect in the world... After I went to Will's and him and Fran were talking about something serious. We left his and went to some guys flat called Owen. He seems cool, yet again Big Gary had me in stitches all night! I've came home, and I'm now waiting to see if Sammy comes online. But you know, I just don't think he is! Well I'm gonna splurt so I'll write more later love y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxmay the force of chickens be with youxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx the reason I put kisses is because I'm a friendly person! And if you don't like that... you know where to go!

      Hey. Well todays been quite eventful. I woke up to my foster sister, Fran, telling me that her fit ass of a brother was coming down. So I leaped out of bed and piled on the giant amount of make up on that I need to make myself look even slightly good. Yeh so I was up for ages and then I was in the kitchen and Fran came in telling me to go in the living room because Chris (her bro) was there. So I slowly walked in the room and looked on the couch, it was Stacey, Gary and this other dude. The dude immediately took the piss out of my hair (I've recently cut my hair myself, really short) but he seems a really nice guy (he's also called Gary). After showing him almost every photo I own, he said I look better with long hair and he thinks I look 17-18! I like him!!! Fran got a phone call from Chris saying that he was at the tourist information centre so she gave him the directions and we went down to the church to meet him. We then went to the beach and it started to rain so we went back. We went to Widemouth and stayed up there for a while then we came home to see that my parents had gone to Portugal! I saw russ and his crew but I kinda don't feel good vibes from them because, well I dunno, I just don't! Fran, Stacey, Gary x2 and Chris left me to go to some place called Gunners Lake so I stayed at home with my 3 sisters and we had a chinese. I phoned my bestest mate in the world, Letty, and her mums boyfriend's son came and picked me up, he seems cool! We watched The Ring again, I seriously think I'm going to get possessed by Samara, she's going to get me in my sleep or something! Just like the zombie people in 28 Days Later... Well I'm now home in the nice warmth of family... NOT! That's why I come on this thing because it gives me time to get away from it all. I have to sleep with my 17 year old sister tonight because shes scared because shes been watching scary movies... For the first time today I watched The Witches by Roald Dahl. When I was younger I'd never watch it because I was soooo scared! But now I watch it and think, why was I ever scared??? Well I'm going to go now but I don't know why because Russ has stopped talking to me and so has everyone else... I'll write more tomorrow love y'all jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx u can all have one each!xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx actually, changed mu mind. THEY'RE ALL MINE!!!

I woke up and got ready to go school and I could of left the house at quarter 2 8 but I didn't becasue I swear my mum said that she would give me a lift, I tehn waited 4 her till 20 2 9. She then told me I'm not having a lift. So I left to go to school, I have to walk over a golf corse and there was frost and I was sooooooooo cold! I even wore gloves! I started crying half way as well because my family do my head in!!! I got to school, late, went into my p.e lesson and had fun trampolining! It's soooooo fun! Plus Tabby n Clur were there n they make me laff! After that i had typing, oh no! She had a go at me - AGEN! Because my "letter was too short". She won't leave me alone! Then I had a break which was good because I really needed a fag by then. 3rd lesson was food, pretty shit like usual. Then it was English agen, I really can't believe it, how can you talk about sexy adverts 4 da 3rd week running? He seriously makes me feel sick. This time I had a friend! YEY! It was the other Jess!!! Then I had lunch, which was pretty boring. In the space of 50 minutes I managed 2 have 3 fags! (It's been a stressful day!) Last lesson was science which was kinda ok. Just water gettin squirted down my back isn't exactly why I want to be alive... Russ yet again told me he was "walking the long way to my house" so I ended up walking home by myself! (AGEN!!!) Well I might go out tonight, or I might not because it's ever so chilly! (ever so fucking freezing more like!) Well I'm gonna go now so I can talk 2 my gud frends, Nomi, Dave, Adam and Joe! Il write more 2moz! jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Oh yeh my fancy list has gone down only 5 now! 1. Sammy Dodds 2. Danny Pitcher 3. Russell Brooks 4. Aodh Breathnack ( Pronounced A Bronnock) 5. Alex Smeeth but it looks like things will change very soon though. Oh yeah the reason i'm wierd in science is because loads of people have told me that you don't like me in that way so I don't see why I shoudl be nice and flirty around you :) You brought it upon yourself -  and I can bet you know who you are.  Well I'm going to listen to a banging tune made by new husband "Time Is Running Out" (Muse) Love ya'll peeps xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx oh yeh the word of the day is: pipette (that is sooo cool!) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      um hi again! My day today has been so fun! its almost untrue! First of all lets discuss from the moment I woke up until I got on here... I woke up at half 7 by hearing my mum shouting at my sister, she was late for college. I got out of bed at about quarter 2 8. Went bathroom had a wash etc. At quarter past 8 my friend Frankie came round and then my mum dropped us off at school in her little white metro which was EXTREMELY embarrassing. We saw her go round the corner, then we sneaked down to donkey lane for a cigarette. We got into school and then I had 2 wait till 5 2 9 for my first lesson. It was of course, HISTORY! U actually do kind of enjoy it though, my teacher has dreams about giant furbys... Second lesson was maths, which I always look forward to because it's about the only time apart from p.e when I get to spend time with my friend Tabby. She's so cool. And Claire. They just make me laugh so much!!! And I also get to recieve notes that get me in a bad mood, who could they possibly be from??? SAMMY! He blaitently knows I like him so he starts touching Emma and flirting which makes me glare! I don't appreciate it!!! 3rd lesson was english, I seriously don't like that lesson because 1: My teachers a pervert and is obsessed with the word "sex" and 2: I sit with no - one next to me, in fact no one actually sits on my row and I feel really stupid cuz its all of the spanish lot and I don't get on with them. Well after that was science. It was ok apart from I don't get on with my teacher (we have bad history). Lunch was kind of amusing - we graffitied a draw! I brought it home with me aswell! Last lesson was typing, I really don't think she likes me! She always tells us to ask her if we have a problem, so I do and she shouts at me! How rude is dat??? Well I came home to see my sister, a new bag and 3 new bras!!! yey! My momma loves me!!! Then I've been waiting for 10 so I can go on this thing and so to take up my time I've taken all my photos off my wall ( if anyone's seen my room they would know that there are alot of photos!!!) and I decided to put the name of the person on the back, the place and the date. Then with the photos that I cut up, I stuck them back together. It's soo fun being a teenager isn't it??? Well I'm going now because I'll be in trouble for making so many people fall asleep at the keyboard even though I don't think anyone will ever read this. But if you are, take care, sweet dreams and remember this: NEVER CUT UP PHOTOS!!! love ya'll jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      hey. I'm really bored and I'm listening to a banging tune. Here's the lyrics... ALANIS MORISSETTE    Ironic  An old man turned ninety-eight He won the lottery and died the next day It's a black fly in your Chardonnay It's a death row pardon two minutes too late Isn't it ironic... Don't you think  CHORUS: It's like rain on your wedding day It's a free ride when you've already paid It's the good advice that you just didn't take Who would've thought... It figures  Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye He waited his whole damn life to take that flight And as the plane crashed down he thought "Well isn't this nice..." And isn't it ironic... Don't you think  REPEAT CHORUS  Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you When you think everything's okay and everything's going right And life has a funny way of helping you out when You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up In your face  A traffic jam when you're already late A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife It's meeting the man of my dreams And then meeting his beautiful wife And isn't it ironic... Don't you think A little too ironic... and yeah I really do think...  REPEAT CHORUS  Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out Helping you out  Don't worry I didn't just type that. I copied it. Well anyway... I love this thing because no one else listens to me and this thing dont have a choice. Right now I would laugh sooooooooo much if my computer crashed! Is it just me or do other people feel like when they hear a beautiful song they want to get lost in it and just fly away to a different world? Well im that kind of person... I dont see why people describe themselves as wierd. Im not wierd, Im unique (yeh I know my heads big but im proud of what I've made of myself and I dont know why people aren't happy with their appearance - everyone is beautiful. I'm really not good at expressing myself so I'm sorry if it dont make sense!!! Well no ones exactly going 2 be reading this so I could rite anything HA HA HA (evip cackle!!!) but I won;t! Its my dads birthday today, he is now officially half a century old!!! I can't wait until I have kids - I've got the names sorted out already! Myron Chester Brett is going to be the son of Chester Bennington (Lead singer in Linkin Park). Justin John is my second son, his dad is Justin hawkins (Lead singer in The Darkness). My one and only daughter will be the most special little girl in the world, shes going to be called Iris (I think ive said already why that names special to me!) Anyway... her dad will be John Rzenik (Lead singer in Goo Goo Dolls). But then I wanna settle down and just enjoy my life as a lawyer with fat legs and just marry the most beautiful man I can find... I need another band to come out first, before I decide who it is... though I am looking along the lines of the guy in Muse... not thats what I call beautiful! Well I'm going to talk to my special friend now (Russ) he is the most kindest and genuinely nice guy you could possibly find and we're going to marry if we're still single (and alive) at 198. It's really good because he's found God and he totally deserves it! Well everyone does. Well I'm going to go now because I'm getting emotional (in a good way!) well take care and god bless love u jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey I don't know y I'm doing this. But it Looks kind of fun in a shocking kind of way. Anyway, to tell you bout me I don't know where 2 start. I I'm probably deranged in the head, as I have a dent - but people keep telling me that its just the soft spot on the head... ANYWAY!!!Yeah... I love chickens. They are the most intelligent and cute of ALL animals, they will rule the world one day! Yeah, and next time you go to McDonald's, please, please, please, put on a scottish accent and say: McChoken burger please? That would jus be immaculate (just like ma teeth) he he! I also love Rainbows and the Goo Goo Dolls, which is kind of ironic because Goo Goo Dolls sing a song named Iris, and it is such a beautiful song... and I looked in the baby book and guess what iris means -  RAINBOW! It's a sign! Well ill write more tomorrow because I'm kind of pooped! thats all folks *snort snort and laugh in a piggish sort of way...* ain't n e of u guys seen that? its fabulous sweet dreams n take care love u ma little lepricorns! plop xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hi!  urlLink    I'm feeling a lot happier now! Yesterday was well good, I dunno why though, I'm just back to normal I suppose. First and second lesson I was at the "dentist" watching sky with Sammy, Alanis Morissette is quite funny, she has a little bit of gertrude in her! Then Sammy went back for second lesson while I stayed there and watched Saved By The Bell, dude I love it! I went back at break and met up with Clur, Tabby wasn't there  urlLink    . So me and Clur arranged to meet at outside the drama hall for lunch. Third lesson was Food. It was ok. Could be alot better though, they always make food when I'm at college  urlLink   . It does my head in! Fourth lesson was english with the perv. Jess was there FINALLY! I have a friend  urlLink    . We read Lord Of The Flies All Lesson.  At lunch me and Clur went Safeway, I saw Martin (I'm his stalker), he was looking.. um...Good! We saw our stalker lady person, yes that's right, we have a stalker ! YEY! We started to walk back and when Clur stepped over this little fence thing she made a dirty mark on her trousers, so me being the nice person I am, tried taking the embarrassment away from her, and that is exactly what I did! What I was supposed to do was just make a mark on my trousers, but I ended up falling on my ass  urlLink    . An Clur was like  urlLink    . We got back into school in like the earliest time ever! Well last lesson was Science with Sammy  urlLink    . It was well funny! Mr Bradbury was in a REALLY bad mood so Sammy  urlLink    was constantly ripping the piss out of him and I couldn't stop laughing, so I was moved :(. After that I actually did work! WOOHOO! I spoke to Tilzey about moving and he says I have to work for it, then I asked him if I could have a day trial when Miss Murphy  urlLink    (Sammy, I found it!) gets back, he said he'll think about it so fingers crossed... Oh yeah, back to the science lesson. I liked the end bit. Sammy  urlLink    actually let me hug him! So I though about all the time he didn't give me a hug then I rolled them all into one! Basically, I didn't let him go! Then I started hugging his leg... I went back to Letty's because my parents have gone away for the weekend WOOHOO! We didn't really do anything then later we went to Safeways and i gave Martin his christmas card, he said thanks then called me a wierdo, how rude??? Then we went back and I made them watch Magic all night just incase Goo Goo Dolls came on, which it did! THREE TIMES! Yup, definately a good day. I stayed up until 4:30 this morning waiting for one song that never came :(. Joan Osbourne, One Of Us. I love that song! I woke up about 12:30 this morning so when Letty told me she was going shopping I used this as an oppurtunity to tlak 2 you guys. Well I g2g, Letty's expecting me Love Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  urlLink   , I was born in Cyprus! yey! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

      Hi. Todays been another bad day. I dunno whats wrong with me but I'm really unhappy. All last night, all I could think about was what I would say to Tilzey, I started crying and I didn't get to sleep til about 3. I can't be myself anymore, somethings drained all the life out of me.  urlLink    First lesson today was history but because evryobe else in the year (apart from my science class, we're in an applied science group) had to do a test, so I was put with all the other students who had history first lesson. Great fun!!! NOT!  urlLink    Second lesson was maths... I WON'T HAVE A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN! So me, Kristie, Lisa and Nicola went to Mrs Ryan's room and coloured in pictures... fun! At break I met up with Tabby and Clur and stayed with them. Third lesson was english with Perve. I did absolutely nothing, but Dave and Alex did the most hilarious piece of work I've before in my life. That seriously did cheer me up!  urlLink     Fourth lesson was science. When we were lining up I saw Aodh's finger do something really dodgy so I looked at him wierdly and he started saying that he was gonna flick this guys breast, I just found that hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing! I went in, and right from the start it started off bad. First of all I said that Mr Ryan had nice eyes, he liked that! But he didn't like me calling Kristie a bitch, so I nearly got sent outside, but I didn't! After that I drew on the board and Russ nearly got the blame so I said it was me, then to top it all off I smashed a glass. As REM sing: It's been a bad day, please don't take a picture... urlLink    Lunch has been without a doubt the worst in my life. I went with Tabby, Clur and Sammy  urlLink    . But I think because of my depressesiveness I was being a twat to him. I think I've truely blown my friendship with him. I hate it when I do that. He was a really good friend too. I always have to get caught up in everything else, I don't give a shit about what happens to the people I care most about. I guess I'm just pissed off because if it wasn't for me then he wouldn't be friends with Tabby and Clur in the first place and I'm getting left out now. I've brought it all on myself, if I wasn't such a bitch. Guys I'm so sorry. I never meant for things to get this bad.  urlLink    . Before you say anything Sammy, yeah I know I'm copying you! But I like them!!! Well like I said, I'm sorry. I love you all  urlLink    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxP.S Here's some more...  urlLink    dude! I think it's Elton John!!!!  urlLink    Sammy, that ones for you and all your "foonky monkeys"  urlLink    Now that's what I call cute! It's like a lil Daniel Johns! Well Ive g2g bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      I swear, if my comp suddenly crashes I will beat the shit out of it! I am officially the world's most pissed off teenager. My day has been shit right from the start and that's how it's goona end. I'm bullied continuously about my hair, yeah I have a blokes haircut and yeah my voice is weird, but I don't ask you to critisize me. I have no friends and the only ones I do are after the guy I've fallen madly in love with. I can't handle anything and I just wanna get off this fucking earth. Why does everything seem to be bad in my life. It seems like everything is poured out on me. I really don't wanna have to go through anything else, I cried through a maths lesson. I need a fag. I need a life. I need a reason to go on and I sure as hell need a decent haircut.  Here's the lyrics to the most perfect song in the world. I think it describes me best at the moment: The Young And The Hopeless   Hard days make me Hard nights shake me I don't know this soul must save me And i know im making something out of this life they call nothing Take what i want take what i need they say it's wrong, but its right for me I wont look down Wont say im sorry I know that only god can judge me   [Chorus] And if i make it through today Will tomorrow be the same Am i just running in pace And if i stumble and i fall Should i get up and carry on Will it all just be the same Cause im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this im going nowhere fast thats what they say im troublesome im falling im angry at my father its me agaisnt this world and i dont care i dont care   And no one in this industry understands the life i lead when i sing about my past its not a gimmick, not an act These critics, and these trustfront kids trying to tell me what punk is but when i see them on the street they got nothing to say   [Chorus] And if i make it through today Will tomorrow be the same Am i just running in pace And if i stumble and i fall Should i get up and carry on Will it all just be the same Cause im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this im going nowhere fast thats what they say im troublesome and falling im angry at my father its me agaisnt this world and i dont care i dont care i dont care...and now i dont care oooooo ooooo oooooo   im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this im going nowhere fast thats what they say that im troublesome and falling im angry at my father its me agaisnt this world and i dont care i dont care. i dont care. i dont care.  And this is the most beautiful song in the world. It's without a doubt the most beautiful song I've ever heard and if anyone ever disses it I will die.   GOO GOO DOLLS     Iris  And I'd give up forever to touch you 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life 'Cause sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies And you bleed just to know you're alive And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am (break and solo) And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am    Well gotta go now. I need some sleep, I've got college tomorrow with the friend that always calls me "fat ass". Well bye

      Hey. Yesterday was pretty straight forward, even though I kept thinking it was Tuesday! I went school (obviously). First lesson was art. I sit on a table with Anna, Matt, usually this dude called Tom but today we had a new boy, Sam from Coventry. He seems cool. After Art was English. I read about carnivores, it's great! I'm reading the Lord Of The Flies book thing. I'm studying it for GCSE's because I'm smart! Even though I can hardly spell on this thing! After that was break, naturally I spent it woth Sammy, I think! Wait a sec...Yeh I did! I was with him and Daniel...Third lesson was science with Sammy! YEY! After that lesson we did the usual thing, bunked. We went down Letty's. We arrived and she wasn't there so after an agreement, we decided that I would crawl in her kitchen window and unlock the door, so I went in and after about 30 seconds, Letty came. How rude??? So we watched a bit of tv then the power cut... Well I took Sammy upstairs and raped him.. Nah only kidding. I showed him the beds, I actually did! Then we were going down the stairs and I attacked him so we ended up going down the stairs in a different way.. This is sounding soooo dirty but it's purely innocent! TRUST! Well we went back to school and we went went our separate ways... I wen to Safeways with Tabby, Clur and this dudette, Abi, and Sammy went with his "holies". So we went and we were in fits of laughter. We came back after deciding that tomorrow we would take loads of photos of Pugwash and the "angle". Well last lesosn was maths, Tabby was moved, tut tut. We now have to sit in a seating plan, how pathetic? She just doesn't like our singing voices. I think we're quite good! We're called "Under The Influence". I went back to Lettys and the electric was still not there, so we wen to Spar then came back and sat nervously without lights. Then her mum came back and showed us where the torch was... Oops! Well I stayed the night again, and how all good nights must end, we watched a disney film, Mulan: Down Bessie! Yeah, I know this is REALLY sad. But I didn't go to bed till 3 because I was thinking of Sammy! Today has been sooooooooo cool! It started off with not seeing Sammy so I broke down into tears... joke! But I didn't see him... Well first lesson was r.e with Alex, it was great we were talking about loadsa stuff, I actually really do appreciate his friendship! Well second lesson was art, I really enjoy it now. At break I hung with everyone! You see I love everyone so i hang round with loadsa different people. Like I used to hang round with this certain group, but now I hang round with Claire and Tabby and the others are getting upset and missing me :(. So first I was with Anna and Corrin. Then I saw Sammy. Then I saw Tabby and Clur, then I went back to Sammy. 3rd lesson was business and communications, I seriously wish I'd never chose it. 4th lesson was with.. wait 4 it.. SAMMY! It was not funny becasue he's fallen out with sincere loving Russ, who I love to pieces, and it's hard because Sammy was moody and so on and so forth.. Then for lunch Me, Tabby, Clur and Sammy went up Safeways and it was pretty cool. Laughter again, photos, of me and Sammy in a bush, I was pushed ok, then they wouldn't let me out because they "wanted a photo" so I made a big thing out of it and whilst crawling out, I accidently forced myself on top of him, woopsie daisie! 5th lesson was something...HISTORY! Me and Clur had a laugh with the very fit teacher, My Tyrell can mark my books anytime! Well came home and it's been pretty shit. I gotta go, this had taken far 2 long! Take care and remember life is the art of drawing without an eraser, you can nevr rub out things in life, just imprve them :) love u guys, and I mean that! PlOp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays has been such a fun Sunday! NOT! I went to church and I was ignored, I love it! NOT! This guy knew what kind of socks I was wearing because of my scraf... FREAKY! Well then I came home, got a phone call from Letty so I went roind hers. I watched Eastenders, then when it was the one I hadn't seen ( Kat and Alfie fing) my mum phoned me up and I had to walk home all by myself :(. I bumped into my really good mare, Craig, though. He was looking good ;). I came home. Ate tea, listened to top 40, danced to a few... I love Outkasts new song, Hey Ya! I'm listening to it now, this is what I call a banging tune! Well yeah, after that I had a bath, then came on ere. I'm missing Graham Norton! He's such a dude, if it was up to me I'd watch him 24/7. Well I haven't really done anything else. So I'm gonna go. and remember... SHAKE IT LIKE A POLAROID PICTURE! Love y'all PlOp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey guys! I ain't written for a while, I'm apolagising to the guys that are going to make a film out of my life, I'll fill you in... THURSDAY: Really bad day. Went to school. Saw Sammy on the crutches, quite amusing I must say! Nothing really happened within school which is worth writing about, I got in trouble in maths, so did Clur and Sammy. Me, Tabby, Clur and Sammy went off to Safeways for lunch like we do and I was completely ignored. Sammy would constantly talk to Claire and Tabby but when it came to me I felt like I shouldn't be there. I'm starting to feel like I need to find somewhere I belong. It's like the Linkin Park song. I need to find Somewhere I Belong. I just don't fit in anywhere and I really did think that this time I might of got it right. Obviously not. Went home and did nothing. Went over Letty's later and stayed over. We went to bed later then her family so we couldn't flush the toilet because it would wake them up. So Letty did a piss then we were drifting off to sleep when we heard something come up the stairs, I asked Letty what it was and she said that it was her dog, Gypsy. Then we just heard the toilet being drank from and we both just laughed so much! Yvonne (her mum) and Rod (the boyfriend) think that me and Letty are sleeping with eachpther! How rude is that??? Well yeah that was it for that day... FRIDAY: Went to school. Sammy was there as soon as I arrived! It's such a good sight to wake up to! First lesson was p.e which was great because I had volleyball with Tabby and we were throwing it around everywhere. We're in the fat group you see, Clur used to be with us, but she's been promoted! BITCH! Second lesson was with the bitch, Miss Welham. Well she probably isn't a bitch, shes just like it to me. I then went into the canteen at lunch and "hung" with Sammy. Later on we saw Tabby and Claire and that was that... 3rd lesson was food. That was pretty cool. I'm making Lemon Curd on Thursday, remind me! 4th lesson was English. I hate him soo much! I wasn't made for top group. He makes me feel so small. He does my head in! Then it was lunch. Our usual crew went up Safeways. I wasn't quite as ignored as yesterday. I'm so happy that Tabby's there to keep me to frip with my sanity (what i have left). Well on the way back it was hilariously funny. Sammy did MR-BUSASTOW/SIMON COWELL STYLIE with the trousers and  it was hilarious! You had to of been there! Well last lesson was science with Sammy WOOHOO! I sat next to him at first but was moved by the furry nosed/eared man. I sat at thr front which led me having a conversation with Alex and Russell about Sammy. They said I shouldn't bother with him and all this crap. But the crap made sense! So I told him and he got pissed of with me (I think) so I told him to fuck himself. It made me feel real wierd! I was soo angry at him. Later on we made up though! After school I went to Lettys and we then went to the bowling alley. It was supposed to be with the Jax crew but Letty kinda made me play pool wiht her the whole time. Sammy seemed to like Letty. It does my head in. Why are all my mates so much better then me? He blaitently likes (as in fancy, I just don't want to admit to it) Clur, Tabby and Letty. Maybe Russ and Alex were right after all, I am just wasting my time. I'm fighting for something that will never happen. I need to get my head ou tof the clouds. My life's shit, It was made to go this way and it will continue to. SATURDAY: Went to Plymouth, Letty got her tounge pierced. It looks great, just like everything else about her. She bought clothes. I was always left standing there looking like a complete moron like I usually do. Some things will never change. It's always been Letty over me and when I'm next to he I find it hard to breathe. She's choking the life out of me and i can't do anything to stop it. She's just made like that, she'll always be the pretty one who gets everyone while I'm the depressed freak in the corner who follows her around. I want my individual life and I just can't have it. Why is everyone against me? I was put on here for a reason, and I don't know why! Help me please, I can't handle it. I KNOW THAT ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME IT'S ME AGAINST THIS WORLD AND I DON'T CARE Life moves on, but for me it won't, EVER bye

      Hey! Dude, ain't my life fun! College wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either! Because of those evil college people I miss out on a day with Sammy, it sounded like it was a good day because he had his leg amputated! I have to miss everything! Oh, and for the next 2 years I get to study Sammy's health, how fun? My tutor, pauline, is concerned about him, but I can't say why because it's 100% confidential... Well yeah, I came home, waited till 6 then spoke to Sammy. I asked him to sing a song and he sang a completely different one, me being me found this incredibly hilarious, but it obviously isn't... Then I had a bath, then I've been on here for ages looking for something to do, Sammy isn't on here, how rude? Well nothing else to report (lmao!) I've missed Graham Norton. My parents want me to go on here earlier so I get sleep, it's healthy you know! Well 've printed out a colour version of Sammy so I will now leave Love Y'all, I'll try rite more at school because I hate home! bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey I'm home now, after watching my daily dosage of Graham Norton I'm doing real good! Last night I cried myself to sleep lastnight because Sammy said he liked Tabby, then Letty (it was a joke, I think) but it just made me think about everything, and all the people I've liked always likes my mates and it does my head in, suppose I'm just not good enough! I'll get over it sooner or later, i always manage to eventually! Well Ive made a new cd and its all the depressing songs that I love, I've probably written about it already, but you'll get over it!  Well I'm gonna go love y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoh yeh, thanks Tabbyabbyabbyabbatha, Clur and SaMmY, you make people in this world happy, and I appreciate it! See you guys thursday xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Aloe chico, I'm in a science lesson. The reason i didn't improve this thing yesterday was because my sister is a bitch! But she has a nice, ginger baby... Yesterday was pretty bad, I gone without smoking for 23 and a half hours! WOOHOO! But then I went to Lettys and had one! It was her birthday yesterday and I bought her a tounge bar. It's pink with white stripes. I'm getting photos developed today from ages ago so that'll be pretty amusing. At lunch yesterday I went up safeways and ate shit. I've put on half a stone. Well that's enough about me. We've just discovered Daniel has a fettish with dildos. He likes gay porn. He's my boyfriend... kidding!Well I'm going now, I'll write more later. Love y'all ME! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxgeronimoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxnimdobxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxweexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxhehxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey, today hasn't really been a good day. I woke up and went to church, I felt isolated again. There was no cheery happy smiley Sammy face to make me smile, I've gotta stop with the whole Sammy thing don't I? It's getting quite embarrassing now! Well I had a little chat with Matt. He's so cool! He was in his Scout's uniform, I can tell he's cool because he went shopping one time with my mum! When I came home I kept singing and then thought to myslef, I need to make myself a depressing cd! So I browsed through my sisters cds and got loadsa cool ones. So most of today has been spent on this computer! I finally copied it, went downstairs, listened to the top ten, fatman scoop has a fat head! I love Outkast's new song, Hey Ya! It's soooo cool! At the mo I'm listening to the drugs don't work by the verve, I love it! Then me and Mum remembered there was this bonfire thing going on so we left to go to that. We had missed the fireworks! But I came prepared, I brought sparklers! Well came hoem and went on this thing. Right I'll be going now. I love Elton John!!! Bye guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I just wrote soooooooo much then, and my computers just deleted it all! aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Dude! I'm sooooo annoyed right now its untrue! Wednesday: went to college, Corrine and Chrissy left me by myself so I was forced to work with Stacey, EUGH! Came home on the bus, got attacked by Corrine, she thought it was funny tickling my adam's apple, then tying me by my scarf to the seat infront of me. I got Dave's number, WOOHOO! Came home, did nothing else, Graham Norton was hilarious! Thursday: Really bad day, didn't eat or drink anything, I desperately need to lose weight! In science I broke down, had to leave the room, the toilets are my only friends! Came back, Bradbury has to stand right in front of me, just where I can get a clear view of his nostril fluff, it's really disturbing! Went back to Letty's, had lots of fags ( I was pissed off) then Dave came round, we went down mine to get my ingredients for school tomorrow, but forgto the pastry... Friday: Got up, had a fag, I like Letty's make up! Went into school. Had a little chat with Sammy outside the form then Frankie came... BITCH! All she does it go on and on and on and on about guys saying she got a nice ass, and big tits, and all you hear is Farrar this, Farrar that, Ant this, Ant that, Richard Philips fancys me! Like I care Frankie??? I know she's supposed to be my mate but it really annoys me! Had science first, Sammy did a kind of IT picture, scary shit! R.e second, we got to watch house invaders, yey, just the reason why I come to school! 3rd lesson we had maths, Tabby was annoyed, only 2 words to say about that... oh dear. 4th lesson was food tech, but my mum didn't bring the pastry did she? So in the end I had to help Nicola, if anyone notices, she isn't particularly my favourite person. If you read this Nicola it's because of these reasons...RUSSELL, ALEX, SAMMY AND DANNY!  5th lesson was history, I got pushed aside becasue miss wasn't there so i sat next to Jenny Moore, she's really paranoid and orange with foundation... Before I started walking home I went back to the food rooms to get my ingredients and just to make my day even better, i opened the fridge and got a friendly hello from the cream, infact it also said hello to the floor, my tousers and my scarf... I walked home, cooked the strudle at home. Had tea, phoned up Letty and went round there. I met Mark, he seemed alright at first. Empthasis on teh "AT FIRST" bit. Everyone was drinking apart from me so I maden them keep magic and kerrang on. I was waiting for Goo Goo Dolls to come on. It did! Then we switched it to kerrang every now and again to see if Muse was on, i love that tune! It came on twice I think. The rest of the night we were showing eachother our ringtones. Dave's were the best. We listened to the darkness sooo many times! Alana ended up going to bed at half ten, Letty ended up getting with Mark, which pissed off Dave. Dave took her upstairs, they talked, then I went up and stayed with them, after i got the hint that Sammy wasn't gonna text me back, BITCH! Mark kept wanting to get with Letty, and at this time Letty was now going out with Dave, so he gopt the hint, aftre a VERY long night! What was supposed to happen was me and Letty would be in the double bed and Mark in the single, Alana and Rich in their mums bed then Dave in Letty's room. But in the end I slept with Rich and Alana (Rich ended up hugging me in the middle of the night, scary shit!), Letty slept with Dave, and everyone had deserted Mark! Saturday:Stayed in bed till half 2! Then just lazed around, doing theory tests in the computer, I got changed and went home, i managed to finally et out of bed at about 5! I was waiting for my mum to come and pick me up, we were watching magic at the time. The previous song had just finished and I go: I'll just stay another minute to see ig Goo Goo Dolls came on. And to my amazement it did! I ran out to see my mum there, in her sexy little metro! I came home and cathed up with my holy stuff, tidied my room and had a bath! My hair feels sooo soft! Now I've caught up on here I'll be going. Take care my little cherubs. xxxxxxxxxSammy: you have false teeth??? xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey, soz bout yesterday. I was upset! Well nothing much happened yesterday, so I'll just write about today... I got up at 5 3 8! oops! What can I say, i love my bed! Even though I wasn't even in my bed last night, my 27 year old sister, Helen was! I had to sllep with Karen (19 year old sister) and Baby Jacob. ALL night long I heard him breastfeeding, and I wasn't even allowed to text, how rude is that??? So yeah, Frankie came round, we walked to school and that was about it. School was just school. It turns out that yesterday when Russ was having a go at me about a text it was a different Jess, so I got an apology, WOOHOO! I've read over my blog and I seriously sound obsessed with Sammy don't I? Oh well, I got 3 jax things today with his pic on so try to figure out what's gonna be stuck on my wall... I came home, AFTER WALKING BY MYSELF! I've never been so embarrased in all my life! I went into co op to get some munch and when i was queuing up to pay I just couldn't stop smiling. there was these 2 boys sitting down and full on staring at me, then there was a girl who did the same, I got freaked out so I ended up laughing to myself, I've gotta stop doing that! And to make things worse, my shoes and homocidal and they are trying to kill me, so I tripped up infront of the boys who were looking at me:( Came home, put on false nails, then later realised I actually couldn't do anything with them on so after lots of agony I managed to take them all off. I then had a bath, watched wifeswap, then Graham Norton (Dude, that guy is SERIOUSLY funny!) Well gota go, Sammy's actually talking 2 me! WOOHOO Love Y'all PlOp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been quite unusual... After watching the not-so-scary film, IT, I went to bed at 3:00am!!! (That's quite late for me!) There's 2 boys on it, I know there only 12 but they were soooo cute! One was called Eddy, he was ADORABLE! The other one was called Bill, he looked like a younger version of my 1st husband, John Rzeznik! (I got da name right, woohoo!) Yeah, and tehn they grew up... After getting 7 hours sleep I woke up to a tiny little beep on my phone telling me to wake up, so me being me switched it off, and went to sleep for another 40 minutes. At 20 to 10 I thougth I had better get up, Me and Mum went to church and was listening to Goo Goo Dolls! WOOHOO! JOHN RZEZNIK, IM MISSING YOU BABY! Yeah anyway, I need to take hold of myself... Yeah I went to church, I had fun, spending time with, wait for it... MYSELF! I came home listening to Goo Goo Dolls and I cried :(. Me and Mum went shopping and bought full on munch! Came home, and I full on munched! lol I had a roast and my sister wouldn't stop complaining because it was chicken gravy and not beef... After tea we (all my sisters apart rom Monica, she's deserted us :( ) had a good old sing song, and my mum thinks I sing a better version of Iris then the Goo Goo Dolls do! You know, I am a very talented person... I went upstairs after that and Cried, then cried a bot more. I dunno why though, probably because I think I'm in love and it's breaking my heart because I can't be with him, I seriously wish I was a bloke, you don't have to shave your legs, armpits, bikini line, ass crack, face... Well they do but they'll gte over it! They don't get as emotional, they don't get periods and they don't have children. It sounds like heaven! Well anyway... Me, Fran and Lisa went down to Will's but he wasn't in, so we walked down to the phone box and Lisa, being the wierdo she is, started talking to no one, so me being the bitch that I am got the numba and phoned up, she got really freaked out! It was hilarious. Then when we came home and we had a message on the answering machine so we listened, and it was the noise you get when you recieve a call from the phone box, and I didn't do it and no-one else had credit, scary eh? Well then I came on her and I will now leave, YEH MAN! I got science EVERYDAY this week adn the wekk after and the week after that. That means SAMMY SAMMY SAMMY! Come to mama! Sorry got carried away! Gotta go love y'all PlOp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey guys. Yesterday was well cool. I went to this thing in Newquay with the Jax crew. After much persuasion I managed to bring with me Fran and my 17 year old sister, Lisa. There wasn't enough room on the bus so Me, Fran, Ian and Dan went in John's car which was pretty cool. We listened to Red Hot Chillis and we were full on head banging, it was great! We got there and I stayed outside with Ian and Fran for a fag and this guy came up to me and asked me what I was supposed to be, I felt really stupid after that because I thought I dressed alright! I didn't even dress up lol! Yeah well, we went in and it was cool. Lights were like EVERYWHERE! People I didn't really know started talking to me which seemed pretty cool, like Cara and Kerry. They seem really nice people! It's not like I didn't think that before, it's just i'd never really talked to them... We had to do all these activities like make stuff out of pumpkins, tied balloons to our legs and then had to stomp out others, then we kinda sellotaped loadsa newspaper to Russell to make him look like a scarecrow and he kinda fell over, whoops! That made me cringe! His head just bounced... After that we went outside again and Ian got egged and kinda flipped! He wanted to go fight them! But he didn't! We then went back in and it was coming to the end. So we all left and we left the way we came. Me and Fran got dropped off before Lisa did and we had a phone call from mum and dad to say they were coming back, and they said we could stay out will 2:30 so we waited for Lisa to come back and when she did I saw Sammy, ROW! He HAS to be mine! Then we started to walk down Will's then decided not to! We came home, watched a couple of movies then I went bed bout 2:30, i was knackered. I remember waking up in the middel of the night hearing my dad shout: Why is my house a guano pile? Guano is bats poop if any of you didn't know! Well today, nothings really happened! I woke up bout 12 - 1, went downstairs and got loadsa pressies from my parents, after that I just kinda dressed up and danced and sang alot! I love gelling my hair, it just feels so good!  Then me and Fran was going to go down Will's but his landlady was back and she's kinda barred Fran so we were to scared to go in. So we walked back and met up with the 2 Gary's. Then we went into town, rented out 2 movies, IT (clown thing) and something else, it was really quite boring! NEWS JUST IN Lisa has a boyfriend, Big Gary!!! Ha ha! We were also phoning up loads of housephones asking them stuff, like we talked to Sheila and Dave... I've never noticed how much fun you could have witha a telephone! That sounds really dirty, I apolagise! Well I'm going to watch IT now  So I hope your all nice and warm and I hope you can eat sweeteners, they taste really nice after 2 hours! Oh yeah I forgot to say, the other day it was raining and I saw a rainbow, it's a sign, another Iris was born! Oh yeah, and after 3 months I've only just realised that I've been spelling my husbands name wrong! Its 's John Rzeznik, not John Rzenik! I'm really sorry darling! Well bye guys, love y'all PlOp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Wow... this one looks interesting... what colour am I? Bare in mind I love rainbows... wait a second and let me do it!!! Wow, I'm now waiting for the results...        you are darkviolet  #9400D3         Your dominant hues are blue and magenta. You're the one who goes to all the parties but doesn't quite fit in at every one... you know what you want, but are afraid of what the world might think of it. You're a little different and that's okay with them, and if you're smart it's okay with you too.  Your saturation level is very high - you are all about getting things done. The world may think you work too hard but you have a lot to show for it, and it keeps you going. You shouldn't be afraid to lead people, because if you're doing it, it'll be done right.  Your outlook on life is brighter than most people's. You like the idea of influencing things for the better and find hope in situations where others might give up. You're not exactly a bouncy sunshine but things in your world generally look up.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

      Hey, well yesterday was horrible  urlLink   , I'm back to the usual smileys now... Me and Ian had fun waiting for the party to come, we played volleyball with a balloon  urlLink   . After that we recorded ourselves dancing to Michael Jackson, it was so funny, it included: Billy Jean, Earth Song, Smooth Criminal, Thriller and the other one that I really like... what is it???  urlLink   ... GOT IT! Don't Stop Till You Get Enough... something like that anyway!!!  urlLink   . After that we went to the party. I filmed us making our way through... then I filmed Ian having a fag, I found it extremely boring!!!  urlLink    hehehe! Well yeah, we went in, we sat down with Russell. He wasn't singing Iris though, he sang Nickleback, How You Remind Me. Which is totally rude  urlLink   . Well yeah, the first game was this balloon popping thing, Ian went in it so I was left alone  urlLink   . When we had dinner (earlier on, before the party) he said that if I sat in the room with him he would never leave me. Well he  urlLink    Ian played the game so I sat with Stacey. After that was another game, you had to "mingle" on the floor and when Cally (the leader lady) shouted out a number you had to get into groups of that number, so in the first round I did it, got dragged into one group then deserted because there wasn't enough people, whilst doing this after being punched in the head by the pastor  urlLink   . So I was out on the first go. After that we were in this game and you had to go with a boy, so I went with Ian. We had to do something like when they shouted "cavalry" Ian had to lift me up, when they shouted "horseback" I had to jump on his back and when they shouted "knight" I had to sit on his lap. Ian is like anorexic, and I'm quite big so it was so funny seeing him lift me up! We came third!!! After him trying to lift me up resulted in him putting his hand up my skirt  urlLink   . After that they got into groups and had to do this wheelbarrow thing, had to eat something then come back. Luckily for me I had to judge them to see if they went over the line, I really appreciated this job, Gary spat this yellow THING at me! It was gross...  urlLink   . After that they got into REALLY big groups adn they had to find something then rush it into the centre. One of the things were to find someone with their belly pierced and carry them into the middle. No One else had their belly pierced! I should of said something, I was the only one with it done!!!  urlLink   ... um not quite!!! Well yeah, after that was munchimoos. I managed yesterday to eat only my advent calendar and 6 ferroro roches! I'm so proud of myself. I'm 8 and a half stone, remember that! Then next week I'll weigh myself again, and see waht I am. I know its a only a day of "dieting" but you can already see the difference!  urlLink    hopefully I'll be like Ian soon! I wish you could put photos an this thing, you probably can but I can't because I'm stupid. When everyone else was eating I was talking to Russ. He said that if I wrote the lyrics for Iris then they would do it. After I had done it, Russ and Ian laughed at me adn said that they wouldn't. So I gave Tanzina they lyrics. After that was the cavalray or something liek that. It had people singing and stuff. I recorded that aswell! Claire, Carri Anne, Collette and Heather sang, all was good but Heather was REALLY good, she sounded exactly like Britney Spears.  urlLink   .  Oh how embarrassing! My sister is singing to the Buffy Musical...  urlLink   . Yeah well... back to last night, then Dan did this magic trick thing, great fun!!! Then Ian, Russ, some dude called Sam, Sammy, Danny, Joe (I think thats it!) I can't remember the dude on the drums... did Nickelback. It was good, Ian just looked really pathetic because the main singer, Sam, was really good and he like didn't let Ian join in, it looked so funny! After that we went home. Letty phoned me, she was drunk and she had pulled some lad from London and she sang. I woke up to Letty ringing me!!!  urlLink   . She told me about her spewing over Alana, Rich, and the wall! I'm soooooooooooooooooooo proud of her!!! I will tell you why new years, it would of been a year since then... I went on here last night, then I went to bed. I've had a shower and I'm feeling fresh. Well I better be going, Letty is coming round soon. Bye guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx urlLink

A song that I loved came on, so I gto up and sang, then Ian started to love it, it was great! We had caramel shortcake then came home.  urlLink   . We went to safeways and my mum is officially a criminal!! She bought Ian cigarettes  urlLink   , when she went in, me and Ian put up the base in mums metro and we were full on "boogying" it was great fun... wait a sec, I got to find that dude...  urlLink   , Ian looks exactly like him!

      Hey. Last night was pretty cool. My bestest mate in the hole wide world  urlLink     urlLink   , well yeah... Ian rang me and we talked about Sunday, he's going to come round mine after church and then were going to dress up really proper  urlLink   , I can't wait! On the phone I told him to go online so I could talk to him for longer. As we were talking I noticed that he wasn't writing back to me very fast, so I asked him who else he was talking to and he said Bowie, I told him to add him to the conversation, so at the end of the night I was reunited with the love of my life from 5 years ago! And I had made 4 friends! Me and Russ were talking until 3. It was well cool. He's helped me to become a "holy", he prayed for me, so now I'm working on it, and I'm trying at it really hard aswell. I've seen the others, they are all seem so happy, I want to be like that. I want the relationship.  urlLink   , hehe! That means God is great, which he is! Well nothing happened today, but my Mommi bought me the Muse album  urlLink    Oh I love her!!! Well better be going xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Tabby, thank you for the answers, but is it toffee fingers or toffee pennies you like? And the best way to die on the sims is make them swim then take away the steps... or put them in a room and take away the door... all great fun!!!  urlLink   . I might go up Safeways later to get my photos developed, don't know yet. Take care hunnies xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey guys! I know it sounds stupid, and I know that it's only a computer... but I've missed you!!!   urlLink   . Last night Letty came round so I went home with her. We watched City Of Angels, my parents bought it for me, and Legally Blond 2, which is Letty's. City Of Angels is such a beautiful film! And to top it off Iris is the theme song to it, the video is shown at the end  urlLink   . I fell asleep half way through Legally Blond. We woke up really late, then we came back to mine to get my money and my photos developed because I've got loads to get through! But Safeways wasn't open so I'll have to get them done tomorrow  urlLink   . Me and Letty did facepacks this morning, it was well cool! Aaron, her brother, took photos of us so when they are developed it'll be pretty funny. Well after that we cleaned the house, I watched some of the Grinch, but it was too scary and I came home.  urlLink   . My sister Monica and her boyfriend Mark are down! They bought me 2 presents  urlLink   . One was huge! And the other was kind of tiny...  Well I opened the small one, and to my delight it was my 150th pair of piglet socks! But these were different... These come above my knees!  urlLink   , hehe, mine aren't that thin though! The huge one was a suitcase full of make up! It's great! I just can't wait for tomorrow to experiment...  urlLink    hehe... Well nothing else has really happened. I'll write more tomorrow. Love you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  urlLink    hehe! Oh yeah, me and Letty played monopoly, and I kicked her ass! Everyone who's my friend who writes a blog I want you to do this: Fav quality street: strawberry creme Fav monopoly piece: iron Fav monopoly street: The pink Ones!! He he, I'm sad... love u xx

      Hey again. I'm just writing to say sorry and thank you. This morning, I didn't appreciate anything that was put infront of me, but I've just read my friend's (well I think he is, Leon) blog and I've realised how important family actually are. I don't know the case with other people, but I know thatm if I ever fall back my parents will always be there to catch me. I mean come on, this year they gave me a pair of pointy blue shoes  urlLink    and a video camera for fuck sake! They know I love recording and they have only done what I have reflected off myself. Well I'm sorry to all the people who I make them feel bad (that do't make sense, but you know what I mean!) and I want to thank all the people who has made me feel bad, it's like Christina Aguilera's song, fighter. Well I've found this amazing song, so, as usual, I must share!!!   GOO GOO DOLLS    "Here Is Gone"   You and I got somethin But it's all and then it's nuthin to me, yeah And I got my defenses When it comes through your intentions for me, yeah  And we wake up in the breakdown With the things we never thought we could be, yeah  I'm not the one who broke you I'm not the one you should fear We got to move you darlin I thought I lost you somewhere But you were never really ever there at all  And I want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling And I wanted to be All you need Somehow here is gone  I am no solution To the sound of this pollution in me, yeah And I was not the answer So forget you ever thought it was me, yeah  I'm not the one who broke you I'm not the one you should fear We got to move you darlin I thought I lost you somewhere But you were never really ever there at all  And I want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling And I wanted to be All you need Somehow here is gone  And I dont need the fallout Of all the past that's in between us And I'm not holding on And all your lies weren't enough to keep me here  And I want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling And I wanted to be All you need Somehow here is gone  And I want to get free Talk to me I can feel you falling  I know it's out there I know it's out there And I can feel you falling  I know it's out there I know it's out there Somehow here is gone, yeah  I know it's out there I know it's out there Somehow here is gone, yeah  hehe! It's on the album Tabby gave to me. Also I love this song...  GOO GOO DOLLS    It's Over  And I didn't think about All the ways I hurt you and myself And I hide Wouldn't say a thing to you I keep it to myself and my mind I can't stand without you And I won't find the answers when you're gone  But it's over to you And I can't find the answers when you're gone And it's over to you And you can't find the answer where you are  And you know (And you know) I need you now This ain't easy to admit And no one needs to know What goes on behind the door in my room I'm peeking through the walls in my mind And I can't stand without you I won't find the answers when you're gone  But it's over to you And I can't find the answers when you're gone And it's over to you And you can't find the answers where you are  I will tear you down I will tear you down To get into the world you wanted I'm kicking through the wall No one can believe in things that never change  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  And it's over to you And I can't find the answers when you're gone And I can't find the answers when you're gone And I can't find the answers when you're gone  WOW!!! On the site I get it from you can get the music! I'm so gonna get it then play it on what ever instrument!!!

GOO GOO DOLLS    Big Machine  Ecstacy is all you need Living in the big machine now Oh, you're so vain Now your world is way too fast Nothin's real and nothing lasts And I'm aware  I'm in love but you don't care Turn your anger into lust I'm still here, but you don't trust at all And I'll be waiting  Love and sex and loneliness  Take what's yours and leave the rest So I'll survive God, it's good to be alive  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com:: And I'm torn in pieces  I'm lyin there waiting for My heart is reeling I'm blind and waiting for you  Silly love with all your sins Wait and stop and I begin And I'll - I'll be waitin' Livin' like a house on fire What you fear is your desire It's hard to deal I still love the way you feel  Now this angry little girl Drownin in this petty world And I'm who you run to Swallow all your bitter pills That's what makes you beautiful You're all a lie I won't leave what you ain't got  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  I'm blind and waiting for you I'm blind and waiting for you  And I can't believe it's coming true God, it's good to be alive I'm still here and waitin' for you And I can't believe it's coming true I'm blind and waiting for you  You really need to hear his voice though to really admire the song. Well I'll be back soon Love Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  urlLink     urlLink    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx It's ok...

      Hey guys!!! Merry Christmas! Well last night I ended up going to Letty's and then we walked to the church to do midnight mass. She made me laugh. I came home and still didn't feel Christmassy! Well I stayed up really late just thinking about all the things that get stuck on my mind. I had a really wierd dream, Dave, you told me to tell you my dreams, but I don't think you'll really want to hear this one...  I was in school and all that. It was like all backwards, I was in a special group kind of thing and I walked to school with Greg Giles... When I got to school I had a p.e lesson and I had to phone someone for trainers, then someone phoned my friend, Gina, phone and asked for shoesize I was, it freaked me out, then I had a science lesson and for some reason Mr Tilzey was in it, he asked me to help carry this box into the room, so after I had done that I lost my other group of people, so it ended me walking down a corridor looking really paranoid. It was freaky! Why am I dreaming of teachers? And school for that matter...  urlLink   , I woke up to hearing my Dad ring the doorbell saying: Ho Ho Ho, Santas been! How embarrassing... I went downstairs, opened my presents and I'm now back up here, I know it's sad on Christmas Day to come online to talk to people I hardly know, but I so much more prefer it up here then back in normal life... Well I got loads of rainbow stuff, The piglet and tigger movie, 2 goo goo dolls cds, one from Tabby. Umm... a chicken picture, clothes, well a rainbow jacket! Last night someone called me who hasn't for ages, it was nice to see his name come up on my phone, I just didn't get to answer it in time... Well I'm gonna munch just about as much as I can then spew it all up and lose weight! Chat to you laters hunnys Love Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been both great and stressful  urlLink   . I woke up about 12  urlLink   . I had to help do the Christmas decorations. Me and Dad did them, I found the Gertrude things (I can't remember what they are called!), they move like snakes...... great fun! And Dad kept asking me for a drawing pin, but they were clearly labelled on the box as thumb tacks  urlLink   . Well we had dinner, my evil family had duck  urlLink   , but I refused and just had the tiddies. After that we continued to do the decorations whilst we listened to the Darkness  urlLink   ! Dude I love that band... Well after that we did the tree while watching the Road to Elda Rado... Dude that was funny... Then I tried decorating the staircase with the cards but my sister was doing my head in so I just gave up, I was about to ahve a nervous breakdown!!! Well I'm on here now, the rest of my plans are to go to Lettys for my presants  urlLink    (just imagine Little Moe's pathetic noise she does when she smiles...) and then I have to go to Midnight Mass. Well I want to wish you all a   urlLink   , take care and have a good one Love you all Podgy Horney Balls xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      You know what, I've just taken a hard look at my life, and I hate it! I'm not appreciated or respected, I don't even respect myself. I really don't like what I see when I look at myself, I just hate being Jess Sturt. No one else had to suffer through this, I just don't wanna be me, it's like that song that Pink sang. Well I really like this song, so if you can, download it, I can't because my computers funny.  Train - Drops Of Jupiter (Yes Clur, it's teh one written on your pencil case!!!) Now that she's back in the atmosphere With drops of Jupiter in her hair eah eah eah She acts like summer and walks like rain Reminds me that there's time to change eah eah eah Since the return from her  stay on the moon She listens like spring and she talks like June eah eah eah  But Tell me did you sail across the sun Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights faded And that heaven is overrated   Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there   Now that she's back from that soul vacation Tracing her way through the constellation eah eah yeah ooo She checks out  Mozart while she does tae-bo Reminds me that there's room to grow eah eah eah Now that she's back in the  atmosphere I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And head back to the Milky Way And tell me, did Venus blow your mind Was it everything you wanted to find And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there   Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone  conversation The best soy latte that you ever had and me   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And head back toward the Milky Way   Tell me did you sail across the sun Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated   Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there  And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And did you fall for a shooting star Fall for a shooting star And are you lonely by yourself out there  They're such nice lyrics aren't they??? They are kind of like the Goo Goo Dolls. I know this must be extremely boring but this is my life, so I'll publish it anyway I want. Here's another great song:  LIMP BIZKIT    Behind Blue Eyes  No one knows what it's like  To be the bad man  To be the sad man  Behind blue eyes   No one knows what it's like  To be hated  To be fated  To telling only lies   But my dreams  They aren't as empty  As my conscience seems to be   I have hours, only lonely  My love is vengeance  That's never free   No one knows what it's like  To feel these feelings  Like I do  And I blame you   No one bites back as hard  On their anger  None of my pain and woe  Can show through   But my dreams  They aren't as empty  As my conscience seems to be   I have hours, only lonely  My love is vengeance  That's never free   Discover... L-I-M-P  I....   No one knows what it's like  To be mistreated  To be defeated  behind blue eyes   and no one knows how to say that theyre sorry  and dont worry  i'm not telling lies   but my dreams  they arent as empty  as my conscience seems to be   I have hours, only lonely  my love is vengence  that's never free   No one knows what it's like  To be the bad man  To be the sad man  Behind blue eyes  You've probably heard that one. But you gotta listen to these two aswell... This one is quite special to me, I can listen to it for hours and still not get sick of it. It's such a beautiful song aswell, guessed what it is yet?  PUDDLE OF MUDD    "Blurry"  Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake and everybody's so empty and everything is so messed up pre-occupied without you I cannot live at all My whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl  You could be my someone you could be my sea you know that i'll protect you from all of the obscene I wonder what your doing imagine where you are there's oceans in between us but that's not very far  Can you take it all away can you take it all away when ya shoved it in my face explain again to me  Can you take it all away can you take it all away when ya shoved it my face  Everyone is changing there's noone left that's real to make up your ending and let me know just how you feel cause I am lost without you I cannot live at all my whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl  You could be my someone you could be my sea you know that i will save you from all of the unclean I wonder what your doing I wonder where you are There's oceans in between us but that's not very far  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  Nobody told me what you thought nobody told me what to say everyone showed you where to turn told you where to runaway nobody told you where to hide nobody told you what to say everyone showed you where to turn showed you where to runaway  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  Explain again to me  you take it all you take it all away... explain again to me you take it all away explain again to me take it all away explain again  And maybe just a couple more.... This is very special to me. If anyone disses it, I can only say one thing, I'll kill you (she says in dodgy accent)...  Bette Midler - Wind Beneath My Wings  Oh, oh, oh, oh - It must have been cold there in my shadow, to never have sunlight on your face. You were content to let me shine, that's your way. You always walked a step behind.  So I was the one with all the glory, while you were the one with all the strain. A beautiful face without a name for so long. A beautiful smile to hide the pain.  Did you ever know that you're my hero, and everything I would like to be? I can fly higher than an eagle, for you are the wind beneath my wings.  It might have appeared to go unnoticed, but I've got it all here in my heart. I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it. I would be nothing without you.  Did you ever know that you're my hero? You're everything I wish I could be. I could fly higher than an eagle, for you are the wind beneath my wings.  Did I ever tell you you're my hero? You're everything, everything I wish I could be. Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle, for you are the wind beneath my wings, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.  Oh, the wind beneath my wings. You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high. Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings. Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.  Fly, fly, fly high against the sky, so high I almost touch the sky. Thank you, thank you, thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings.  And now, no guys, i haven't finished QUITE YET. Here's two that will cheer me up...  OUTKAST    "Hey Ya"  [Intro] One two three go!

I dunno whats up, but it'll probably go soon. Well when I went round there, to my delight Alana was highlighting her hair... so me being me (I've said that so many times!) joined in and I have a couple of highlighty bits in my hair, it went ginger!!! Well after watching lots of sky we went to bed. I had to sleep with Letty. In the morning I woke up to hearing this :" Someone's left a little poo in my room"  urlLink   , Letty had said it, she said it in a wierd voice adn I found it hilarious. Then later we went downstairs and we were making pasta stuff. As Letty made hers, I poured the milk in the pan and added the butter, she sprinkled the pasta in and said "And they all came together, In the circle of life..." I found it hilarious!!!  urlLink   !!! LMAO!!! I keep finding the really wierd smileys don't I!!! Well that was near enough my day, I came home and I'm now on this. A big hug goes to David from Glouster, thanks for being there hun, I really appreciate it.  urlLink   !!! Love you, well better be going. Love you xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well I'm back. I'm getting shit from everyone because when Sammy stayed over he shouted at his grandparents and didn't go home the next morning and stuff and because I got him "drunk", but I didn't, I wasn't telling him too, he picked up the alcohol, which I DIDN'T PAY FOR, and put it in his own mouth, no one forced him. I hate people like that, I didn't even get drunk. Well the rest of it was shit, we walked home with twats and I hate everything. Bye

      Well last night was, GREAT!!! I hate being sarcastic...  urlLink   . I'm really sleepy and I can't be bothered to do anything. My grandmas coming down today and she's stealing my room so I'll have to sleep with my sister. I want a bath but there's no hot water  urlLink    ARG!!! This is the part of Christmas I hate. I can't feel my toes! Well I'll write about the Christmas party. After getting off the net I went to my room and fell asleep, I woke up to Fran telling me that Sammy's mum was on the phone, he still had not been in contact for over 24 hours, I didn't know what to say, I just said that the last time I saw him was at Church when he went to Danny's and that's actually the truth!   urlLink   . Well after that we got ready for the party and we saw Sammy on the way, I was just trying not to swear at him!!! We got there and when he came I told him and his mum said she doesn't want him to associate with me, how rude??? I'm not the one that got him drunk  urlLink   . Well now I think everyone at Jax hates me. Wait a sec, Russ is having a go at me. I'll write more later.

      Hey guys! I haven't wrote in ages!!! Well I'll run through the weekend.  urlLink   . Friday: I went into town with Fran and full on bought loads of stuff. I got the Darkness single, a rainbow sweat band  urlLink    and loads of shag bracelets. We came home and Letty decided not to come to Barnstaple with me to go shopping so Fran did instead. On the way there we was listening to our new cds. When we got there me, Fran, Ian, Johnny and Matt went as a group. It was well funny! Me and Ian went into a toy hovercraft thing, it was a pound! Great fun though, it was like Captain Pugwash!!!  urlLink   . Well as the night continued we went to Pizza Hut, it was the place where we had to meet everyone else, when we got there we had to wait for ages, but when we finally did get in it was great! The pizzaz were HUAGE!  urlLink      . Well that was about it for that night, on the way back Sammy put my sock on his foot and then put it out of the window  urlLink   . Me and Fran like sang every song we could think of! Then Fran had a go at all the other people, it was great!!! When I got home I rang Sammy we were talking for ages again. We arranged for the next day to get drunk and then he can stay round Lettys. Saturday: It was ok, I woke up really early because of the excitement of Sammy, but he didn't come round till about 3, as soon as he came we went into town to get Fran's phone, then he left us. He came back when Fran's phone was being registered but he was with Tanzina, so after that me and Fran just went home. She gace me her old phone, but it's like new!!!  urlLink   . We sorted out all the things like numbers and we took loads of pictues and stuff. Then we heard a ring on the bell, it was Sammy!!! So we had tea, HOW EMBARRASSING!!! I HATE MY PARENTS!!! Well, Neil came round so we went up 2 Somerfield so he could get the alcohol and we had a photo taken, You can't see me but hey!!! We got the drink and went to the golf course. Then we went upto Lettys, but we couldn't stay there  urlLink   . So we went to Gina's, where Fran was babysitting. We kinda stayed round there for the rest of the night, Sammy's nan phoned up and she went looking for him, there still looking for him now! At about 2 or 3 Gina came back so we left, we started walking back to my house, Sammy decided to stay round Ozzys. As we were walking home we thought, Oh! Why don't we go see Will? So I followed the directions that he had told me, we were outside this house place for ages, then finally, when a light came on, it ws an old man threatening to phone the police!!! Oh dear...  urlLink   . We walked to Ozzys, he wasn't expecting us!!! As Sammy did something we heard dogs barking, Sammy came back out saying that he was finding out if it was ok for him to stay and that we had to wait for him. Then when he came out the second time he said that he couldn't.  urlLink   . So we had to think of something fast, OUR HOUSE!!! My dad is really over protective and he known Sammy was staying, I would die!!! So we got into the house, Fran slept on the floor "on guard"  urlLink    and me and Sammy slept in the bed. NOTHING HAPPENED!!! Sunday: I woke up really early in the morning, under panic I think! I went to the toilet and put my make up on, Mum came back from dog walking, I was shitting myself!  urlLink   .  I came back and Sammy had woken up and panicked aswell, he had made the bed and everything!!! When mum came in she looked at Sammy wierdly, I told her that he had came when she was out, I'm sooooooo good!!! She believed it  urlLink   . Well we went to church, and he almsot certainly ignored me. I came home and I'm now on this thing, NO SHIT!!! Well there's a Christmas party later on. I'll write more tomorrow, I'm really sorry for not writing before, I'm just a busy girl!!! Love you huns xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been pretty wierd. I had to walk to school by myself because Frankie didn't come for me, it was really embarrassing though! I was walking past 2 really small kids and I tripped up and nearly fell on top of them! I was so embarrassed  urlLink   .  I went into school and saw Tabby, she told me about her whole "experiance" with the pervert. If I ever find out who he is I'll kick his ass, he made her act really different today.  urlLink   . Well first before we actually sat down for the register, me, Frankie, Tabby and Lucy went down Donkey Lane for a fag. Tabby needed it! When we went back in I went straight to my form room, it was our last day today so Sir told us how our day would be planned. We went to first lesson, it was maths. It was really funny! We had to do this game with matches(talk about safety precautions, they didn't even have the bit that made them light, sorry arsonists!) urlLink   , I didn't understand it really so I can't really explain it to you, but we did this whole semi - final thing, Tabby had to play bitch, as you can tell by the name, the bitch won. I made up a slogan for the game: Who will win the match!!! It was great seasonal humour...  urlLink   ... see, they think it's funny! Well after that was break, me and Tabby lost Clur, then Tabby had to see the police so I hung with Clur and Sammy. After that we had an hour and 20 minutes with our form so we watched a film called: BASEket ball. It was sooooooooo funny, I hadn't laughed so much in ages! There was this little guy and they all called him Squeak or Little Bitch, I just found it really funny!  urlLink    Dude, look at those eyes!!! Well after that was another break, Tabby wasn't with me for most of it because she went speaking to Jade. After that we had to go to our froms again then we would go to the christmas concert.  urlLink   . I sat with Tabby and Clur. It was sooooooo cool! The first act was Clur's brother, they were doing the Darkness, I believe in a thing called love, It was great. Everyone like, knows that its my tune, because I just go crazy over it, I had a grin from ear to ear  urlLink   . I looked forward and my friends like Corrine and that lot were all staring at me, then I had Sammy poking me, and I was like, I KNOW ITS ON, IM WATCHING IT ASWELL, ITS QUITE HARD TO MISS!!! It was great...  Another couple of acts went past, Mr Cellars looked ever so sexy in his angel suit, Sammy had to guard his eyes though, he found it very disturbing. Russell's band was on, they were fanbloodytastic. There was this little girl too, she was really good, but her voice sounded as if she was being attacked by a sheep urlLink   .  I just told Rik I love him!!! HEHE! He's spppppppppppp cute! Well we went to lunch, me, Tabby, Clur and Sammy. It was ok at first, but Sammy became an insensitive twat and put sugar over Tabbys chips, thinking she would find it funny, but she didn't. Well we got back to school then Tabby had to go see the police. I walked home with Frankie, Twas great! I g2g now, love y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Dude! Todays' been well funny! I went to college today, finally! Last night I went to bed at 9!!! I was feeling really ill, I have all the symptoms of meningitus! Scary shit eh? The only I haven't got is rashes... Well I woke up and was feeling not tired at all! I got the bus and me and Corrine listened to Dido. When we got there all of them had missed me and I got loads of Christmas cards. Danielle has had extensions in her hair and she looks well cool! We had to start off the day by resusitation. They had manikin things, it was well cool. There was 2 child ones and 3 baby ones. One of the child ones (the one with legs) I named Sammy, the babies were called Abigail (the black one) Polly, and Hayley (the naked one). It was really funny. We had lunch from 11:30 till 1:00!!! It was ages!!! I've given up on the whole giving up smoking thing, I'm going to do it for a new years resolution  urlLink   .  Well me and Corrine stayed in the room most of the time. We made the manikins have a gang bang! It was well funny. We has Sammy at the bottom, with Hayley on top of him with a wierd veiny thing that came out of her hand was put into his nose, then we had Polly licking her out then Abigail doing Polly up the ass, then the one with no arms or legs kissing Hayley, I never knew I was such an artist!  urlLink   . Well after that we had Sean again. I dressed Sammy in my clothes! He had my hoody on, my scarf and my shoes on! He looked grest! I kept on dancing with him and grabbing his arse! Such a shame he isn't the real thing... I'm kidding!  urlLink   .  Last lesson we were making posters, I wasn't doing anything so Sean (the tutor) kept telling me to do something, like do some morw arrows, they look great Jess! Kepp using the rainbow idea and your sure to win!!! All through those 2 hours all he would talk about was my arrows for fucks sake!!! Then we found Saturday Night on Stacey's cd so we played it and me and Loose danced, it was well cool!  urlLink   . LMAO!! Dudem thats a pic!!! Well at the end, he got someone else to come in and judge the posters, Staceys group won the chocolate!!! I couldn't stop laughing. In my group it was me, Corrine and this raven child called Amanda, at the bottom of the poster I put in really big letters, BY CORRINE, JESS AND amanda in like really small letters! It was well funny! Then at the end everyone was talking about the arrows and Corrine was well pissed off because she spent ages doing the writing, I'd done the most pathetic of all the work and they was applauding me for it!  urlLink   At the end Corrine shouted : We should of just done a big rainbow arrow and then we would of won, no one even noticed teh work!!! It was sooooooo funny! On the way back we were pissing ourselves about Scary Movie 2, take my strong hand! Well I went round letty's then came home, boring as shit! Better go, take care hunssss, Tabby I missed you too hun! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey!  urlLink   . Well todays been ok. I woke up and Frankie came round. We walked to school, it was quite funny, I said to her that I'd mention something about her in my blog, but I can't remember what it was! Well at least her names in it...  urlLink    for the people that didn't know, that little pic means reminder... First lesson was r.e. We had a test, I found it hard at first, I didn't know what Stewardship meant... so I copied Alex  urlLink   . We had out work ripped up! And then we had to do it again, in this time I discovered that: A nobleman is a powerful lord, such as a baron. A baron is a powerful nobleman. And also this, I never knew it before!!! A president is the head of a country with no monarch!  urlLink   Second lesson was art. Sam was there roday so I had a friend! We did quite alot of work on the sculpture thing, I just need to finish making my little man!!!  urlLink   . At break I met up with Tabby and Clur, in which this time we were trying to guess what Clur's brother's email address is, I know tis much: PRE***** LLAMA. If anyone has any ideas, please email me.  urlLink   . Remember, I'm chickengal192@hotmail.com. Well third lesson was business. I had a laugh with Deesray and Amy, they are well cool! We got to make out own Christmas cards, If it allowed me to show pictures on this thing I would, but I can't  urlLink   . Fourth lesson was Science, once again extremely boring! Whilst Sammy hasn't been here I'm attempting to give up smoking, I haven't had a fag since last night at about 12:10 a.m. Wish me luck guys xxx  urlLink     urlLink   , how rude? That rainbows name is Gay Pride...  Does rainbow mean lesbian aswell as Iris, O, so that's why everyone thinks I'm different... At lunch we went up Safeways, twas cool! We had a laugh like we usually do, my ears have been painful today so we weren't really singing. Last lesson was hist. We watched War Of The Worlds. Right near the end Clur had me in stitches, she said, oh my fingers bend! It was soooooo funny! You should see the alien on the film... Then she like made a hole in her hand and told me to poke it,  urlLink      . I'll probably write from there. Take care bubs, love u xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Oh yeah, and remember  urlLink    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey guys I havent wrote in ages... I won't have any pictures on this one, my computer is on strike... Well I'll review the weekend: Saturday: I stayed in all day. My sister Helen came down for my not-so-friendly hairdresser's birthday, it was a surprise. I went to Barnstaple with Fran and her brother, I don't like him no more! But he did buy me an ice cream... Well I came home and was like on the phone to Sammy all night! We've officially "watched" our first two films together, we was actually on the phone to eachother during the whole 2 films but you know what I mean! They were Road Trip and Ginger Snaps. It was well funny! He also spoke to my sister Karen, he thinks she's cute! And Helen, well actually he completely ignored me and spoke to her for about 1 hour! She did this relaxation thing on him... Sunday: Woke up, went to church. Saw Sammy's hair, I was actually dreading it but it's great! I sat with Ian the whole time, he's sooooo funny! I can't put the reasons why because it's rude, Tabby I'll tell you tomorrow! Well after me and Sammy had a chat and I invited myself round so he was gonna prank me when I could because he was getting his hair hilighted. Well I waited for his call, and he finally did! Then at quarter to ten I went round! He's got my sisters number!!! I think he likes her... Well I had to sneak in because of his nan, it was scary! I had to go upstairs, he's got so many pictures of Buffy! His mum is well good at drawing and everything! Lots of Tina Sparkle! Well we went downstairs and watched sky, I spoke to his friend Ruby, she's well cool! Then I had to go, but he wouldn't let me and he trapped my leg and he had me on the floor where his dog had spewed. Then Fran came... he invited my mum in for a cup of tea! At half 11 we went home! He's going to London for 3 days and I'm sooooooo missing him already! Monday: First lesson was art, it was boring, Anna and Sam weren't there. Second lesson was English, perv hates me and Jess B, he won't involve us in anything, THE PRICK!!! At break Tabby gave me my Christmas presants, which include an album of the GOO GOO DOLLS! Tabby I love you!!! xxxxxxx and a hauge chocolate bar, how great!!! The cd's sooo good! Third lesson was science, I was completely deserted because Sammy wasn't there, how rude???  Fourth lesson was p.e, it was great fun! Volley ball, hmmmmm... At lunch we went up Safeways, was funny as usual. Last lesson was maths, great fun!. Came home, went into town with Hel, her phones rekt! hehe. Beta b goin Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxLOVE U N TAKE CARE MY LIL GELODAS!XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Second lesson was business... we had to spellcheck this thing... it was well hard!!! But I did, and I quote "very good, I'm very proud of you..." YEY!!! After that I went up to Tabby's room. It was break after that. Tabby told me about the night before, sowwie babs!!! Then we sang... we went into the hall thing and Sammy gave me my christmas card, I was extremely pissed off, everyobe else got "lurv" and I got "luv" and Clur got "lurv you loads"... urlLink   , even Letty got one!!! Well I thought I was going to break down into tears so I wanted to go home but I didn't because I had food next and Miss was doing a demonstration for a Chocolate Log  urlLink   , oh Forrest Gump is great!!! Well I went to it and it was great, I had Alex with me and he was being friendly! I've got more for my Alex file...  urlLink   . I had the chocolate butter icing at the end!!! Fourth lesson was English with perv  urlLink   . And because none of us had out Christmas stories we had to write this huge thing on Lord of the Flies...  urlLink    and then we have to stay in for ages...When I finally got let out, Tabby and Clur weren't where I usually met them, so I got a hug off Kayleigh, the one Tabby kissed, she's well cool!

      Greetings fellow Nimdobs... urlLink   . Todays been, well lonely... Clur and Tabby went on a poetry trip thing. I tried to catch them just as they got on the bus, but they didn't turn around... Well first lesson was History, I think my second without Clur, we watched War Of The Worlds, Miss Davey seriously doesn't want any of us to do any work!!!  urlLink   . Second lesson was maths, at first I sat next to Sammy, but for purposes he was moved. So I was left sitting next to Ben Pointer. He's actually quite a dude and he would make a well good teacher! Well he's my friend now...  urlLink   ! At break I kinda wandered round looking like a loner, then I found Michaela... I followed her!!! In english we have to make up definitions to wierd words, we're playing "Call My Bluff" on Monday... Me and Jess made some funny ones...  urlLink   . Fourth lesson was science. Russ and Sammy are doing my head in, Brett or Russ or Sammy, if you read this... PLEASE GIVE ME BRETTS NEW EMAIL ADDRESS! I'M BEGGING!!!  urlLink   I mean... well... Science was cool, we had Mr Tyrell, PWARHHH!!! He's a dude... At lunch me and Sammy went up Safeway, at first it was kind of boring, no offence hun  urlLink   , lol Sammy! My mum!!! Well yeah, we got the usual, cookies and all that crap, then we sat downa nd saw Russ's brother by himself, Sammy I was joking about fancying him!!! Well as we walked out I saw my mum  urlLink   , lol!!! For anyone who doesn't know her, she looks like her!!! Well she's gone to Plymouth so I had to leave last lesson early, which was business and communications, great??? Anyway, lunch... me and Sammy were on our way back and he dragged me to go the muddy way, he kept trying to make me slip over in the mud, but it just didn't happen! He actually slipped over, then thought it would be funny to wipe the mud on my back...  urlLink   , lmao! I typed in mud and look what it gave me... well as we got back into school I'd concluded that my shoes are homosidal and Sammy's just like mud!!! Well I left lesson and babysat, Jacob was great, he fell asleep!  urlLink   , lol sorry! Well thats just about it so I'll be leaving now.

      Todays been, well tiring! Another day which I can rate 10 out of 10! When me and Frankie went to school today her mum picked us up, she has road rage, it's funny!  urlLink   . Well, we got to school and first lesson was p.e, so obviously me and Sammy were gonna bunk down Lettys. Clur was gonna come aswell. But as we were on the way we saw Mr Tilzey...  urlLink   lmao!!! I keep finding really funny pictures, sorry! Come on, look at the poor little things face... one eyes bigger then the other! Well he saw us so we went back to the lesson. I had hockey, it was ever so chilly  urlLink   . Well just to conclude what I always have thought... I AM THE BEST!!! I was the only one who scored a goal for my team  urlLink     urlLink   . I screamed, but I couldn't of done it without my team... you got that right! I could of got more than 1 if I hadn't been put with those lowlifes... I mean.. HI! Second lesson was art  urlLink   . Anna decided to completely destruct our little dude, he now has no arms  urlLink   , so I took him home with me, where he can keep his head! It was ok in that lesson, not as fun as last time though! At break I was waiting for Clur and Tabby for ages, then I finally found them in the hall. So I hung with them. Third lesson was science, Sammy thought it was really funny to tye my arms up, usually when he does this to me I can get out of it, but he did it really tight. I had to ask Mr bradbury to get me out!  urlLink    he he.. I mean... yeh... Well fourth lesson was food. It was ok. I was on the computers emailing Michaela, Frankie and Tabby. There all great people! At lunch we went to Safeways, I had a nervous breakdown half way across the playground when I noticed that my scraf wasn't round my neck  urlLink   . So I checked my bag and it wasn't there, so I screamed  urlLink   , then as we walked back into school I remembered I had had it confiscated  urlLink   . So we continued on our way to Safeway, Tabby didn't like the fact her parents were there... ok??? We got our stuff then Sammy came, he pissed Tabby off so we all followed her and we went back to school, on the way though we had fags and Sammy burnt flies...  urlLink   . We got back into school, after I had been thrown at every angle there possibly is, Sammy finds it amusing that I clap when I trip up, IT MAKES ME BALANCE OK??? Well last lesson was english, me and Jess had loadsa laughs because we had to make up limerics, mine didn't make sense but hers were hilarious. Well I've written too much! Oh yeah, last night I was on the phone to Sammy for hours, and I'm not exagerrating either! We were talking form 7:00pm till 2:00a.m! His phone got blocked, very funny! And we talked about every subject there is to cover! Incuding gay porn and tellytubbies... I even spoke to his dog!!! She's great... MABLE!!! Well yeah, after school I went to Letty's because she made me promise, so I got to hers and no one was there so I rang her and she was in Plymouth. So I decided to walk home, and Sammy had an afterschool so I hung round for a bit, yeah I'm wierd, but I'm also lonely! Well he came out and we wen to see his nan, then he deserted me!! I walke dhome all by myself! Well I've got a chinese... urlLink    so I better be going, love you all Jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well... todays been pretty cool. I gave Sammy his crimbo pressie, everyone thinks it's cute... not the presant, the fact I got him one...   urlLink   . Well we started off on good ground and that continued through the day. First lesson was p.e, and to my delight we were doing cross country...  urlLink   . It was hilarious! Me and Tabby were running together and we were singing Grease, you know, the usual  urlLink   ... LMAO! Sorry, I had to put it somewhere, HMMM...I got an idea... Well yeah. We were singing Grease an dthen the girl in front of us tripped over a metal pole and like skidded across the floor, it was sooooo funny! She was bleeding and everything...  urlLink   ... you had to of been there! Second leddon was science, Sammy  urlLink    was there finally! We just like chatted for the whole lesson, it's good he's back to his usual self. At break I went with him to the hall, then his friend Kerry came so I "hung" with Daniel, his friend  urlLink   . After a while I got sick of him and I went to find Tabby and Clur, but they didn't come for ages so I went to see some of my old friends, on eof them is called Michaela, she's like perfect in everyway and it does my head in! Then after a while I found Tabby and Clur, we went and found Sammy. Then we arranged all to bunk. Sammy, obviously, with Clur and Me and Tabby would go down Lettys. My excuse was the doctors, I'm pregnant again! Well we went down Letty's and watched music channels and had a couple of fags. We cathched up with my advent calendar, Tabby had my brown chocolate ones. We went back to school and Tabby went to her R.e room, she had a test  urlLink   . I went to the toilet  urlLink    he he! Then went to my english lesson, we had to write a christmas story, so I based it on The Darkness' new song. It's great! At lunch we went up Safeways, it was pretty funny, I'm just finding it difficult to adjust  to Sammy and Clur going out  urlLink   . But what i think you should do is...  urlLink    and Sammy, all I can say is  urlLink   ,  urlLink    and we should...  urlLink   , but that's only if you two don't work out, no offence! Well last lesson was maths, Clur got moved and we wrote on boards, and that's just it! Well Nothing else happened, probably college tomorrow. Take care chuckilings momi xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well. To start off with I want to apolagise to Clur for all the things I've said. I've just been really upset and angry the last couple of days. You really are a great girl and I love you! You and Sammy were meant to be, as everyone says everything happens for a reason (soz Tabby, you've already heard this!!!) but the first day me and Sammy had lunch together we went up to Safeway, you're not allowed to take your bag in because of shoplifting, and I forgot to take my money in, so we had to go back out, then we saw Tabby and Clur. So it happened because God wants something to happen. So I hope everything works out for you both!  urlLink   . First lesson was art. I loved it! Anna wasn't there and we continued doing our project things. Sam (the new guy) helped me do mine. He's actually alright! And quite funny, but not as funnyas Matt, DON'T BE RUDEY!  urlLink   ! Dude, I seriously can't stop laughing when I hear that! WOW! I put my Goo Goo Dolls album in and Iris is playing...  urlLink   ... I know thats got nothing to do with it but It looked funny ok???  urlLink   !!! WOW!!! That is seriously cool... IRIS MEANS RAINBOW!!! Wow, I'm really happy today! Where was I... Yes, second lesson was history, I was a bit worried because I was Clur, but we're great again! I'm glad because she's an angel to me..  urlLink   . At break I went to get Letty and we hung out near the science room because she's in my group!!! YEY!! Sammy didn't go... urlLink   . Oh well, I had fun blowing bubbles... Fourth lesson was English, we got to watch the rugby, how fun??? NOT! Clur and Tabby waited for me though, there great!  At lunch we went to Safeways, I spoke to Russ's brother, it was great!!! Rahim, if you ever read this, we'll have to do it again sometime...  urlLink   LMAO!!! Last lesson was I.t, it wsa funny sir loves me!!! I'm always in such a hype when I'm in that lesson, remind me, I need to give Alex 2 bjs. Right I got to go now, I'm in such a good  mood! Love You ALL Jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well I officially wish I was 6ft under right now. My so-called friend is going out with Sammy, the two faced bitch. I told her I didn't like it on Friday, 2 days and I'm not exactly gonna change my mind over it am I? I've been thinking of Sammy 24/7 and I truly think I've fallen for him. My heart actually feels like it's been broken in two.  I am the most mixed up kid in the world. I'm a selfish bitch who doesn't want anyone else to find happiness, but I can't help it, it's me! Today I went to church and Ian was there! We had a laugh, I actually stood up and sang this time! Brett sat next to me, I hugged him 3 times I think! I can't believe he's going. I only just started speaking to him, he's soooo nice aswell! I mean personality wise! I came home with Ian and we had a laugh. My wierdo of a next door neighbour was chucking bread on my garage roof and in my garden... Yeah I know it's for the birds but 1.if you don't soak the bread in water first then it explodes in the birds stomachs and makes them die and 2. Why couldn't he do it in his own garden??? Tomorrow we'll proably have a graveyard for the birds... urlLink   ! Wow that has just cheered me up, I never saw it before!!! Well Ian stayed until 7 then went home. I had a bath, cut myself shaving then came on here to hear the goodnews. It was only Russ who had the decensy to tell me. How fucking rude is that! Russ kept warning me about stuff like this and I kept ignoring him. Now I know to always listen to what he says, everythign that comes out of his mouth is good. I was just too blind to see it.. I love you Russ! I'm sorry about touching you all the time too! I'm just a flirtaciuos teenager! Well hopefully 'll get murdered in the middle of the night, or might accidently "sleepwalk" to the medicine cabinet and take an over dose, either I want you all to live good lives. I haven't found God so I'll be going straight to hell, though I doubt it could be worse then this...

Me and Letty got picked up from Dave (Jade's boyfriend) and we went cruising round town. i saw Craig, he's like my best mate, well he used to be! we don't talk very much now! Well he called me a wierdo then apolagised and touched my leg! how cute? I seriously wouldn't mind pulling him! Well anyway, Letty got drink and we pulled up near the boyracers. I was completely excluded so I decide to walk home, I got here at 10 2 12. Well my life's boring so take care Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey guys, I can't remember how to edit the top bits so here's my address if I don't know you and you like the sound of my life... (If your really that sad!!!) Only joking   urlLink   ! chickengal192@hotmail.com. Well todays been really horrible, first lesson was science. Sammy wasn't there at first  urlLink    then when he did come he completely ignored me and was being well ignorant so I tried to get on with the day, but it just wasn't happening!  urlLink   . Second lesson was r.e. Jess and Alex weren't there so I had to do the revision notes all by myself whilst everyone else was in groups, don't you just hate it when your the one left looking like a twat? I've had it all my life so it seems a natural process, actually I've suffered from most things in my life. That's probably why I'm such a depressed sad cow. Break was, well break! It was poo, Sammy ignored me, no surprises there! Third lesson was maths, Sammy bunked it and I did loads of work, me and Tabby are slowly melting the old punjabski by singing, he actually smiled today!  urlLink   . Fourth lesson was food and I made a swiss roll, me being me put pink food colouring in it. It turned out great and I got a b+ for it! WOOHOO! At lunch I met up with  urlLink    and  urlLink    (he he) and we went up safeways, saw Sammy of course, he was with his Dudhi friend Kerry. We went and on the way out Clur got chud, cheers bud! That was just for Tabby! lvoe you lots like jelly tots!  urlLink   , yeah anyway! I saw the cd that they were "currently playing" and outkast was on, so we requested it, we then spent the next 3 mins or so "browsing" the maltesers.. We got out and Clur seemed to be walking awfully slow, we then  figured out it was because Sammy was behind.. nice! We got back into school and I was so pissed off I wanted to cry, I could actually feel my eyes filling up  urlLink   . But I managed not to! Last lesson was with Clur. I can't handle all this. Sammy has just come online. He can't be bothered to tlak to me, his so called mate, but he can to Clur. Dude I hate everyone. Apart from Tabby of course. Everyone is two faced only cares about themselves, thats including me! I know I'm a bitch and I can face up to it. I really can't handle this. Yesterday when I said I get upset what I meant to say is that everyday I'm getting more jealous, more bitchy and that's what's making me ugly, I don't care aout my physical appearance, if people  say I'm ugly i can live up to that, I can't change the way I look, I can't change my personality. So I don't know where this is leading but I hate him, and  I love him, it's like that Stacey Orrico song, I hAtE yOu BuT i LoVe YoU, cAnT sToP tHiNkInG oF yOu, ItS tRuE iM sTuCk On YoU, Tabby just sent it to me! Well I 'm gona go die now, Tabby see you Monday hunny! lol. Dying would be great right now but living is the game so I got to play it, I guess I've just landed on mayfair with a hotel...  Bye guys and take care Jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey guys. I'm home! Today's been wierd... I woke up, wen to school and was talking to Frankie, I actually really miss her! She's such a good friend to me and I feel like I treat her like poo, so Russia, you sexy assed woman! I LOVE YOU!!!  urlLink   ...mmm me and Russia! OR NOT!!! First lesson was maths, it feels so good to be back!!! Second lesson was history and we had to do the presentation! It was great, because I was the only one that did the work I got 9 chocolates! I love miss Davey!!! At break we got Clur's mask and put it on the display. 3rd lesson was food, that was pretty fun, all the guys wrote in my folder, I'm a minger man with bad hair, I love my life! Fourth lesson was business and communications, I just had to type out loads of stuff. Lunch was really spun out... Me, Sammy, Tabby and Clur went up safeways, Sammy actually noticed that I'm alive  urlLink   ! We got the usual, cookies and chips. We coudln't stop laughing because we kept saying, just imagine if baody parts were in different places... Ear on the head... NICE MY SON!!! Soz, got carried away! Well yeah, Clur got a coke with 4 straws so we all downed the coke, then Tabby put her blue raspberry drink in it and me and Sammy tried to do the same dat we did with the coke, when we got to the end there was little brown pieces of food that we had ate, Sammy goes, look there's my cookie and it made me laugh, and I choked and the blur stuff sprayed out of my nose and mouth and I couldn't breathe and I couldn't speak and it was well bad! Tabby, the only nice one there, came with me to the toilets, after we went back to school. At form time our form tutor swore at us! The prick! Last lesson was Science, Sammy seriously don't even like me as a friend I don't think. I gave him back the ticket to the pantomime, why the fuck would I wanna go to a pathetic place like that??? Me and Russia had fun on the way home, when she left me Sammy rang asking me to go panto, I said no then when I got home I rung him and said I was going. I'm such a bitch! Clurs been talking to me just now and she really likes Sammy, she's gonna say yes no matter what happens.  urlLink   . It just ain't fair! I wish I never cut my hair off! When I looked in the mirror before I didn't mind what I saw. Now I just see this ugly bitch who doesn't wish happiness upon her friends. I'm just some kind of physco. I don't know how I can live with myself. My personality used to be nice, but now I'm just sour with jealousy. Well here's my new special thing, rainbow:  urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink   ... yeha I'm sad, it's the story of my life. Bye guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well guys, what I had predicted has come true! Sammy likes Clur, Clur likes Sammy, if Sammy asks her out, she's gonna say yes. Great innit??? Well I'll write what's happened over the last couple of days... Tuesday: On Monday night Sammy asked me if Clur likes him, so me being me fell out with him. Later on I text him saying that I was sorry. He said it was alright. Later on that night he text me agin saying that he does like Clur and that he's sorry if it hurts me, what else is it going to do??? I'm not as pissed off as I was before, then Tuesday came... First lesson was R.e with Alex, it was kinda fun. We had to watch this really lame video about some people who lived in the rainforest, it said on the video that by the time it's 2003, most of the rainforest would of disappeared because of them, *cough* well it's nearly 2004 sweetie's, so they're probably dead, sorry to say it  urlLink   . Second lesson was art, it's got really cool now! We're making 3d statues with toilet rolls... the fun!!! At break I dunno what I did! Oh yeah, I stood outside the next lesson I had, then I told Clur to meet me for lunch... Third lesson was Business and Communications. It's getting a lot better now! Fourth lesson was Science, YEY SAMMY!  urlLink   ... or so I thought... He didn't turn up so I rang him and he was in the sick room with Clur, so me being the interfearing bitch that I am tolf them I was on my way. When I got there they was all giggly giggly and oh, lets put dead locks in Clur's hair kinda thing. So I went. I got back to the lesson and because I was so pissed off I sat my friend, Liza, down and told her the situation, little did I know Sammy was behind... oops! She gave me a big hug though, I love her!  urlLink   . So when Sammy came back in I tried to ignore him, but I blaitently didn't! He's just too much of a sweet person! I said to him that I hated him so he kinda did this wierd hugging thing, and he said, if you hate me then why aren't you letting go of my hand, I laughed and he walked off, I still held his hand though! He went off for lunch and I went too.  urlLink    I met up with Clur, Letty, Jade adn Roxanne and we all went up Safeways, but we kinda all did our separate things. I told Clur that Sammy likes her, and to much of my disappointment, she soundded interested. Great, she said she well, I've already written it! But Roxay, being the darling that she is said that I suit him more!  urlLink    Yey! Someone's on my side!!!! Well we got back to school and I saw Sammy, so I did what I had to do and I told him about Clur. It just really hurt me to see him so happy about it, yeah I must be one fucked up bitch, not being happy for one of my best mates, but it felt like my heart was choking. I said that I didn't wanna be friends with him anymore and he tried hugging me but I pushed him away. You know what hurt the most though? He said he can't force himself to like me. I wasn't asking him to do that though, I just don't want to see him with my so called mate when all I can think about is, that's what I wanted, that's what I've been working so hard to get.  Last lesson was history, with Clur. But I sat with Chris and she sat by Luke. I had to go out half way through the lesson though, we had already done the work so we got to make a presentation on Edward Jenner, but we never got round to do it... My cow was amazing, many people said it looked like a pig!  urlLink    I picked Letty up from Miss Hughes office and we walked home. We got home and Alana had a craving for colourings books and pens. So we went into Bude for her, I saw Sammy's colouring pens and it made me really down  urlLink   .  We got back to hers and we just chilled out. Later I had a bath.. it was great! Wednesday: Today's been soooooooo good! I woke up thinking I was going to college with Alana. So when my alarm went off I went into her room and woke her up, she said to come back in 2 minutes so I got changed and before I put my make up on I went back in. I said; Alana, you ain't gonna go are you? She said no so I thought about it.. I wasn't gonna go either! So I went back into bed, unable to sleep, adn then Chrissy phoned me at half 7. I cancelled her though! I do wierd things when I'm half asleep... Later my alarm went off at 8. This was the first time I'd gone into school on a wednesday! And it felt great. Stright from the start I felt good vibes. I thought I'd get a bollocking from Tilzey for not going, but he was completely angelic  urlLink   .  First lesson was my first ever s.e lesson. We learned about sexually transmitted diseases... GREAT!  Second lesson was food. They were making bread so I helped my worst enemy, Nicola, and I made a chicken in her bread... At break I hung with Tabby, She's back at school! YEY! You don't know how much I've missed her! We went to my form because maths was next and that's where Miss Murphy's room is. Mr Register came in and told me to see Mr Tilzey, so I walked to his office and he took me inside... He said that because things were changing round I'm going to be able to go back to my old maths group, you don't know how happy I was!!!! It was great. But Sammy went home cuz he was ill, which sucked because I had maths with him, then the lesson after that was science... it turned out poo cuz he wasn't there! At lunch I went up Safeway's with Tabby, we bought an advent calendar and we saw Martin! We came back and not much else happened really. Well I've written way too much. So until next time... Take care folks, and I love Y'all, yes that is including the perve who wanks over thinking about me everynight, it ain't never gonna happen sweetie! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Oh yeah, SAMMY I LOVE YOU, what's Clur got that I ent? Apart from a personality, good looks and tits?

      Hey. Todays been cool. Frankie got me in the morning, we walked to school, it was um... fun! First lesson was science in the i.t rooms, I was getting incredibly stressed because my email system went skitzipoos... Second lesson was r.e, Alex is so incredibly scared of me! But it was fun, scaring him I mean... At break I went with Letty for a fag, we were with Deesray and stuff. Miss Armstrong came up to us and was just like watching us, WEIRDO? Third lesson was maths, pretty poopy, Clur nicked a poster DuDhI thing, tithe, we were  having such amazing conversations with Mr Thorpe, he kicks ass! Anyway...  Fourth lesson was food, we were in the i.t rooms, I managed to sort out my email thing, Sammy has also just told me that he's changed all the names of my folders, how delightful??? Or not... At lunch we went up Safeways and got in poopy because we always leave the table in a mess. So we did a decent thing and cleared our table, it was great, I also told the lady person it, she was good. Last lesson was history, I now have a detention at lunch, having to look after the year 8s. The test was called: "I'm scared of year 8s so I actually did my history homework" test... I have to do it, mangaging only to get 3 questions of the 10 right, Clur is with me though, she only got 5 :D.  We came home, cooked some  unsatisfying   (as in burnt and pink inside) turkey burger things, and chips that tasted like fish... We then recorded ourselves dancing to muse, Clur doing this weird stair thing in my kitchen, also the elevator, canoe, superman, super-superfast superman and escalators... We went to Jax, they were doing all this skitzipoos stuff, Clur wrote it in her blog. Clur:  READ IT . Me and Nippsipoos had this conversation about how both our lives didn't have anything to do with anything! Complicated... That's about it. Clur's staying tonight and I think she's starting to get ever so bored watching me write this, so bye  Clur: 2 rite, i wanna go home!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway... Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been well funny, Frankie came and got me fro school, we got a lift, then we went out with Letty and Scott for a fag, I don't know why Scott came, he just followed... First lesson was Maths, I did the test.. I was getting so stressed out! I just wanted to run home and cry! It was so hard, I don't know why I even bothered trying to do it, I'm gonna fail on it so badly it's untrue! I used to be so good at like, all subjects! And I've slipped so badly. Well after that extremely irritating lesson I went back to the lesson, Clur and Sammy were attempting to talk to me, but I ignored them. Second lesson was History, I shouted to Clur after maths, but surprise surprise, she ran after Sammy. And I was ignored...until we got into the lesson of course. It was cool, with the pencils and the whole wink thing, you'd have to be there to see how hilarious it is!  At break we just bought munchimoos. Third lesson was third, all lesson, I mean ALL lesson I did no work and was just emailing everyone! Letty was just sending me pics of Lads from Hot Or Not, may I clarify that the majority of them are "Not".  Fourth lesson was Business, Miss is still obsessed with George! At lunch Me and Letty went up Safeways, tris was doing "Finding Nemo" impressions, it was well funny! When we got back to school, Jess Bate pulled me over and said can I tell you something? So I thought it was gonna be something Hardcoe, but instead she came out with, guys this is well funny!  There was this girl who was going to a fancy dress party, but she didn't have anythign to wear, so she pulled her flaps over her head and went as a sugar puff  LMAO!!! I couldn't stop laughing about it! I told almost everyone in the school. Last lesson was science, it was well funny. Sir goes to Sammy, listen or you'll get a log sheet, Sammy goes Oh No! Not the log sheet! It was so funny! I went to Letty's after school, we watched Tv!  I wrote these on my phones.... Actually, a couple of these have been on here for a while...  Dude! He's playing with my ass!   Why can't I liz phair...  Umm... I don't have a clue when I wrote this, i seriously am a fuck up!  I wonder why I'm a stranger in my own life ... Some lyircs...  puppenwagen modell hulia  Some Winnie The Pooh thing in German...  Beach Retreat Cafe... Beetroot Family... Nips knows what I'm on about  A bit of popcorn makes a mango bananas ... it was on Ready Steady Cook  Anne Robinson said "How Cute?" My words!!!   Anne: How do you describe your looks? Andrew: Unfortunate Anne: So do I  Oh I love her!! Also, if anyone here watched the weakest link today, there was SUCH a fit guy on it! He was called Denis.........mmm, I so gotta find a picture of him! Also the guy who talked to Anne (the conversations above) won and he lives in Cornwall! He works at the Eden Project! How cool? Well that's enough of that... Byexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well, todays been pretty funny. I woke up today with coffee....mmm... and then, I brushed my teeth and to my horror my MoMmI came up the stairs with snack-a-jacks and some fruit stuff, but I couldn't eat them... I walked to school BY MYSELF because Frankie didn't turn up, ARG! First lesson was r.e, Alex totally wants me, we had a police guy come in, he said, we won't spend alot of time talking about drugs, 40 minutes later....  CANNIBIS IS TURNING LEGAL ON THURSDAY  but you have to smoke it in your own house, for your own use. If you let your friend smoke some it will be classed as "supplying".  Second lesson was Art, we yet again painted our figure in white, I've dirtied my jumper! Nicked an art book, Anna took hairspray... At break me and Tabby bought munchimoos, two burgers for me, YET AGAIN! Third lesson was business, we had to make a poster about safety precautions, it was great! Miss kept finding mine hilarious because George was on it, it is now on her wall :) Fourth lesson was science, really boring At lunch me, Tabby and Nippsipoos wen up to Safeways, we'll be singing "Mad World" at the next special Jax thing.... Later, me and Tabby bumped into Russ who had forgot his schoolbag, he'd left it at Safeway, so we walked up with him, whilst he was wearing Tabby's coat, he continued to wear it for the rest of the day.  Last lesson was History, Clur wasn't up to her usual self because Sammy dumped her. None the less, we still ahd fun with pencils! Miss was fascinated... also Miss said this, which I find highly amusing...   It sounds french, it is french   Well that's about it, I'm round Tabby's house at the moment, all jolly good show. College tomorow zzzz... Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well today was alright, not exactly a day I would like to replay! Frankie called on me in the morning and we got a lift from my MoMmI. My mum's favourite saying is :  Flip Reverse  and her favourite songs are:  Blow My Whistle and Resurrection (PPK)   how embarrassing! Well anyway...yeah. I found that to my utter horror, Tabby wasn't at school. How rude? So I asked Clur to wait for me at break at the drama hall. So I thought the day was sorted... First lesson was art, it was pretty cool. We were painting the floor tiles for our sculptures, mine ofcourse, was rainbow coloured. Second lesson was English, Jess and Letty weren't there, so I was on my lonesome, I was really trying to concentrate because I want my grades to get good, and fast! But no matter what I wrote, it was always wrong. At break I walked out my English room and saw Clur, I called her but she ignored me. Then She didn't wait for me at the drama table so I went into the hall, and I was alone. I went over to Chrissy, but she soon left me, then I went to Michaela (Yes, I do feel like a user! But that's what friends are for...) she said, Oh why's Letty hanging round with those guys. So I ran over to Letty, then we went out for a fag.  Third lesson was science, me and Letty did lots of work, not surprising when you have Mr Proudfoot... Fourth lesson was p.e it was sooooooooo funny! I never want to bunk it again! We were doing aerobics, and we were doing things like: *cough cough* the moulin rouge dance, macarena then me and Clur went skitzipoos, great fun!  At lunch I met Letty and we went up Safeways, had a cigarette. Walked back to school. Then we were chatting to Russ and Alex. Last lesson was maths, I actually did work! Ben is such a great teacher! Anyway... yus. I walked home with Corrin and Frankie, had another fag. I don't know what I'll be doing tonight because Tabby's ill, and I'm ever so chilly. Well I'll write more tomorrow bye xxxxxxxxxx

      Well yesterday was well cool. After eating, we came back online and was talking to Leon on Audio, I told his mum I loved her! (due to misunderstanding... oh the embarrassment!) It was weird... then after about 4 hours on the internet! (Monica, don't tell Dad!) We went downstairs and continued with our "Rik and Leon" project, don't ask! At about 11 we sneaked out for a fag break, but we heard the gate close so we panicked and ran into the cellar, it was sooooo funny! We were full on pissing ourselves then Dad opens the door and says, What are you doing? He must think I'm a right weirdo... Then we went in because it would just look extrememly odd ( go me, that's a weird way of putting things, like knives forks, and the whole cadoodle.)mmmmmmmm MoMmI just brought me munchimoos, oh the joy you can over a cheese toastie! I've just dropped cheese on my leg...OW!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'll wait till it dries, then I'll pick it off, there goes another ARG!!! Anyway, I'll save the rest till after I've done this. Well anyway... where was I? Yeah, when Dad had gone into the living room, we went out, we were soooo paranoid! Tabby caused fireworks, but then the cherry fell off so she burnt herself. Then we went in, and started taking photos of ourselves, it was about half 12 by this time, we were re applying make up, it was so funny! We took lots of pictures, I'll probably put them on my website, so be sure to visit it...  urlLink http://chickengal192.mysite.freeserve.com , please feel free to live something in my guestbook, it's on the LiNx page. Well we stayed up till about 3 just talking about loads of stuff. Then at 9:30, we woke up, and got ready for church. We waited for Nippsipoos to come, then we went off for a fag, then came back, and Clur was there... We went in to sing, but they weren't very "jolly" so we came back out and sat with her and Danny. Danny kept being so fesicious, I know he doesn't like me, but he doesn't have to make it so obvious! Then as soon as Sammy and Russell came, Clur completely ignored us, until later, when we had to get into partners, yeah! That's when she notices I'm alive... Then had to go in groups, and I was with Sammy and his "crew" and Sammy goes "can't you two swap with Jess," I looked at him and gave the biggest glare. Earlier on he had made a comment saying to Russell not to talk to us, and that he shouldn't lower himself to our level. Sometimes he's nice, but then he's really horrible. It does my head in, I know I think I know him, but the Sammy I fell in love with wasn't anything like this... Well Me, Tabby, Ian and probably Letty will be going to the union later, so I'll see what happens there, I'm taking the video camera and my mum's digital one. I'll probably write more later then... Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been well good. I woke up this morning and Frankie came and we walked to school. First lesson was p.e, me and Sammy bunked, we went down Letty's, it was pretty boring, we write stuff down in Alana's book. It was so scary getting out of school, as we walked off we heard people shouting at Sammy, we were like, SHUT UP! We went back for second lesson, which was business. It was ok, half way through someone had rung Miss, all I heard her say was : Yes she's here... Then I saw Sammy. He asked me if I had been taken out of my lesson, we had been caught! Mr Tilzey phoned his mum and everything! Oh dear... I ate 2 burgers again, it was great! Third lesson was food, we were on the computers, I was emailing Tabby, Frankie, Michaela, Lucy and Letty like all lesson! It was cool... Fourth lesson was english, Letty stormed out. Weird... I had to leave at one, I had monitering day thing. It turned up to be really shit! At lunch me, Tabby and Clur met up, yes that's right, Clur! We had fun, it's a shame she ain't with us all the time. We bought the usual munchimoos...Clur got poppadoms, lmao! I just write poopadoms, oh the fun I can have when I'm all alone...  Clur got a camera, only I didn't know it was buy one get one free, so I tried telling this to the lady and she almost ended up having a nervous breakdown! Again, it was funny! So in the end, Tabby had a camera. On the way back I didn't notice this curb, so I tripped on my hands on knees, it hurt but was yet so funny! And then we found 80p buried in the Long Jump pit, then we walked back into school, Clur was obsessed with sliding about in the mud. Last lesson was science, it was so funny! We had to "dissesemble" a plug, Sammy found it hilarious to wrap it round my neck, tehn threaten to put it in the water, I just found it scary. Then we were fighting. I told him I had missed him. It was exactly like old times. Apart from now he was just so much more caring! Like we were playing "slapsies" and I kept slapping him really hard, then I said, I can't wait until we split up, I'm just gonna slap you so hard! He said but Jess, we're never gonna go out, you're just gross. Then he looked at me adn said, not your appearance, just your attitude towards me. I can see what he means though, because I can see it too. And like, he was pushing my stool away and it nearly tips up, he always does this, then I nearly feel back, and I said that to him and he said, I wouldn't of let you fall. Then later on we were walking through the corridor and he always turns around fast (he's huge so when he turns around his bag nearly knocks me out because I'm so short! He does this on purpose...) well I flew into the wall and all you could hear was this huge smack, and he turned around and said I'm so sorry! He thought it was my head, but it was only my hand! Then I hugged him. Then I got a lift home with Frankie's mum. My parents don't know about me bunking yet, hope they don't ever! And Monica and M,ark, don't even think about it! This is my diary, you knew what was coming! And It's not your place to say anything, besides, it's p.e! Well I'm going xxxxxxxxxxxand I'm so not falling for Sammy... again! xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well tonight's been such a "cheer up" I met up with Ian and Pig, then we calle don Tabby, then we went back to Ian's. We saw the photos we took the other day, they are well funny! Tabby seems to find the one with me wearing skiing goggles hilarious... We watched this really disturbing french thing, Muzzy. Ian seems to love, Pig too, I just found it incredibly scary! Especially the singing dude on the bike, and the guy with the big green nose, and of course Muzzy! Then Letty came over. Then we had to walk Tabby home, so we went the scary way! Dropped her home, Pig went home. Then Letty walked me back. I need to add this, tabby had another blond moment, it was hilarious! On the "Muzzy" thing all these little people started climbing out of the helicopter, Tabby came out with :  "Like they could really all fit in that envelope.."  helicopter Tabby, helicopter... O I love her!!! xxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been...shit. I got a lift to school. I made friends with Tabby, may I add, THANK GOD! Leon sent me this email last night and it made me think, and I love her soooooooo much! First lesson was history, I've finally caught up with Clur! I no longer enjoy the lesson... Luke still sayd Shibby! I think that's the only thing that's kept me from showing everyone how upset I am. Second lesson was maths, which was good, me and Tabby talked. i tole her about the email, so at break we went into one of the clusters and read it, I had to hold back my tears, when I read it last night my face was burning with the tears! It was just so perfect! Then we went to the hall and we bought munchimoos. I had to eat 2 burgers in 5 minutes! Not recommended... Third lesson was english. We carried on reading the novel, but me and Jess were concentrating more on teh "Boogie Pimps - Somebody To Love" video, it's drawn on our english folder.. I htink that Lady is disturbed to enjoy minibabies crawling on her, but as they say, whatever turns you on! Science was the next lesson, Sammy seemed ok towards me at first, then him and Daniel were talking about how the place bets with people about me, this really upset so I sat on the row infront, between Russ and Alex, but they didn't want me either, I'm just one big joke to everyone. I asked to go to the toilets, i wanted to cry and cry and cry, but someone was in there. So I just walke dback. I then took my stuff to the back of the classroom and I sat with Kristie, but then I went back next to Sammy, didn't speak though. Lunch, oh the joy! Tabby had to do this drama thing at quarter to 2, so I would have half an hour of lunch by myself, so we didn't bother going up Safeways because we wouldn't have enough time, so we bought munch then we went down to the music hall, so we could see Clur, Russ, Sammy and Danny practise their song (Linkin Park - In The End, they're performing it Sunday) but I was pushed out the door, and told to "bugger off" so me and Tabby went round the corner, I know it sounds pathetic, but I forced my tears back, I didn't want Tabby to see me like this. After that we just went to Tabby's form room. Last lesson was business, great! It was boring. I wlaked home with Frankie, had a fag. So to the person I promised to last night, I'm so sorry, just try being me for a day. Well yeah, that was about it. Now I'm on here doing nothing really. Just drowning my screams out with songs...

      Well hi, yes thats right, I'm the bad guy, ONCE AGAIN! I completely give up on anything. At college today we were talking about dreams, I didn't realise as soon as I got home that almost everyone that I ever cared about would slap me in the face. Screw the lawyer dream, I want to be appreciated, and be in a life where people noticed me. I sit here, friendless, emotionless and officially lifeless. It's something inpredictable, but in the end is right. I hope you had the time of your life.

      Does it blaitently say on my forehead, "Hi! This has been such a incredibly bad day for me, so please... feel free to have a go at me, fall out with me, and talk to me like I'm nothing but shit :). College was good, then I went babysitting with Corrine, that was good too! Then I got dropped off at Letty's, to see Tabby there, after being completely ignored, having a fight with Letty, and deforming the curtain rail thing, I got a lift from my Mum. Yesterday Sammy declared his undying hate for me. I've tried not to let it get to me, but I've reached breaking point. Everyone thinks I'm just this attention seeking freak. I just don't know what I can do. I might aswell hang round with my old (but so great) friends, at least they notice I'm alive and actually involve me in things, and don't treat me like I have no feelings. Oh I hate everything so much!

      Well I'm at college, earlier on I had my first experiance with a "Mac", it was seriously scary! The mouse was round! I'm at college at the mo, having my lunch breaK, I need to write something that is so ironic! Earlier on me and Corrin were singing loadsa songs, like bLurry by Puddel of Mudd and Shut Up by Black Eyed Peas, and I turned the radio on, and guess what was playing? Yes that's right! Blurry by Puddle of Mudd followed by Shut Up by Black Eyed Peas, well yeah... Nothing else has happened really, probably on the bus back will be a story to tell, then i'm going to go babysitting with Corrin, get picked up by Adrian John, see Corrin's puppies then he'll drop me off at Letty's so I won't be updating much more today I don't think. Well take care hunnies, Love you xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been well funny. I walked to school with Frankie, it was fun, just like old times again! We got there pretty late though! First lesson was p.e It was really funny! We had this pathetic Tag Rugby game thing, I couldn't stop laughing as Tabby chased me across the astro! Later we had to chuck the ball to eachother, it was great! Second lesson was science with Mr Ryan. It was pretty funny, Dave was bullying me again so I got kept behind after the lesson because I was swearing. GET THEM TO LEAVE ME ALONE. At break I met Tabby and we went to the hall and bought munchimoos. Then I went to Business, where I wrote the following message (the entry before this one!!!). Miss asked me to help her! She totally wants me, but not as much as she wants Deesray! Fourth lesson was English, Jess was there this time to save me. She had to go to the front and pretend to be Jack from Lord Of The Flies, the guy she had to hook up with totally wanted her! They had a real connection, you could see the chemistry! At lunch I met a very pissed off Tabby, we went to Safeways and I tried to cheer her up, so I got a fag! We bought the usual munchimoos and I got credit. Later on we saw Clur and Russ so we stopped and chatted to them, after giving Owen my cigarette, we walked back to school. Form time was fun... NOT! But I didn't get sent out this time!  Last lesson was maths. Tabby deserted me half way. How rude? Then after school I went back to hers and she started having a spasm as she poured the peach juice, it was sooooo funny! Then we watched "Scary Movie" DOOFY IS THE DUDHI! Then a bit of "Grease". I had to eat tea at the table with her mum, I was sooooo scared! I dunno why though, I'm just shy! Then we went online. Talked to Rik (hubba hubba ding ding fwala fwala) and Leon, alsom Sammy officially hates me! Oh well, his loss. Then we met up with Letty, Pig, Da and then Alana was coming to beat up Kirsty, BiAtCh. Then Da went, Alana did and we dropped Tabby home. Then me, Letty and Pig walked. We dropped Pig home, then Letty dropped me home! YEY! Well I'm going now. Overall a FaNbLoOdYtAsTiC day! bye guys, I'll wirte at college xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been cool, I woke up again to my mum ringing me.  urlLink http://www.candystand.com/games/cs_shock_cscd.htm  , just to annoy Mark! Anyway... Mum offered me coffee again, so I got a lift. Then I got to school and spoke to Tabby, she seemed a bit upset, I think it's about her mum waking her up, or not waking her up, she'll write about it in her blog, it'll make more sense! First lesson was art. Luke kept making this really weird noise,  Shebby...   I ofund it hilarious! We got to paint our sculptures in white paint, next lesson we're gonna paint the base of it black and white checkered, the points into a rainbow and the people, I dunno, but it will be fun :)  Second lesson was history, another very funny lesson! I've nearly catched up on the pages with Clur, just one and a half more to do!!! I can't actually remember it... wierd. I just love writing! And Clur panicked so much....again.  At break me, Clur and Tabby went into the hall. Tabby seemed offish, Sammy won't let me sing in the Linkin Park thing, it's rude! He kept making jokes that I didn't get!   Third lesson was science with Mr Bradbury. Again ver funny, I think it's all teh hair sprouting out of his ears that makes him not hear Sammy's evil comments. Even when he was talking to Sammy he didn't hear tehm.. weird! Me and Sammy told him we hated him as we walked out...  Fourth lesson was english, on the way there I tried persuading Sammy to bunk with me, but he refused, then later when I gto int he classroom, Sir wasn't there, how rude??? SoI had to write this huge essay thing, it sucks! Frankie text me half way through the lesson, she's finally back from holiday! She said she was going to pick em up from school.. how cool? My life is complete, both Frankie and Ian are back!!!   At lunch me and Tabby went up to Safeways, Clur and Sammy went with eachother, I think it's pathetic walking like 2 foot away from us, we're all good mates, but yet we never associate with eachother. Me and Tabby bought fullon munchimoos, it was great! Then we tried to sit with Sammy and Clur but they pushed us away saying that they wanted to talk. So we sat with Kayley and her crew. WOW! Hey Ya's playing...   We had extended form time, Isobel Mill walked into my hand with her crotch, it was disturbing! Then Michaela did this really weird thing with her hand, it was sooooooo funny! All the way through form I couldn't stop laughing! so Sir sent me out the room for 20 minutes, how rude!!! Sammy walked past and apolagised, then he went somewhere :S.  Last lesson was I.T, Sir totally wants me!!! I was being pretty loud and irritating! I always am in that lesson... I've gotta stop doing that!   Well at the end of school Frankie met me and me, her and Clur (Edwards) walked to Spar, picked up  Frankies wages, then Frankie got fags and we walked home. Now I'm on here, I love Rik!!!  Love y'all Jessxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well, this ones going to be quite long! Yesterday was soooooooooo funny! First lesson was Science, we were in the I.T rooms. It was just another lesson of no work, just Goo Goo Dolls. I got Iris stuck in Mr Ryan's head. Great fun!!! I've finally been able to seen the video to Our Lady Peace, Innocent. It's really good, I think I have another celebrity husband on the way...  Second lesson was R.E, another lesson of completely freaking Alex out. He drew a smiley Face on my hand :)  Break was normal, met up with the usual crew. Just realised a new Fanta is out, it's green! Buy it, if they make a blue one I'l be able to make a rainbow out of the bottles :)  Third lesson was Food. Another lesson of Ben Craig giving me crap. I seriously hate him.  Fourth lesson was Business. It wasn't really fun today. But hey! Live life to the full init...  Met up with Tabby and Clur. We went up to Safeways, I've actualyl really missed Clur's company! I should spend more time with her, which I figured out from last lesson.  History, me and Clur was in stitches the whole time! It was all mainly about Luke headbutting my crotch (he's really small and fat!) then she said that I was scaring her, I asked her why, she sayd I dunno, but I have the urge to runaway. I asked again why, she answered with I dunno, but Luke's fat. That really set me off, I couldn't stop laughing! Then we would stroke eachother everytime we spoke, then we watched Countdown and she put on this really fake laugh and it was so funny! then we had to go home...  I walked back with Tabby to Lettys. When I got there we did nothing. Later I called on Tabby and we went to Safeways. We bought this smoothie, yoghurt drinks and rusks. Letty said really loudly in Safeways, I'm not buying them if I have to cook them.. one word for that... cringe.  Then we got this guy called Oko to get us fags, then we wents to John's, I dunno who he is, but I went in his house. He called me Fosh, and Tabby Squorrel, tehn he put photos of us on his phone, oh the shame!   Then for some reason we walked into Bude, got chips, then walked back towards Tabby's. Im my much earlier blogs, try October 2003, I wrote about this guy calle dWill who I was constantly with. Well I saw him with his mate Tony. Will kept hugging me, Tony was at first all voer Letty, then me. Then Tabby pulled him. It was really funny. None of knew him, apart from Will, and he kept going really close. Everytime I turned around he would be there. Then when we had to go, he hugged me adn asked me for a kiss, I said no (again) and so Tabby did again so we could just go! So we walked Tabby home.   Then me and Letty went back to hers, then at 11 went back out to meet Pig. When we did meet him we just walked round, I don't think he was too impressed! It would be better if Letty wasn't ill. SHE SO SHOULD OF PULLED HIM! BUt she didn't... BiAtCh  We got home, then slept.   Todays been full of sleeping, having cold baths and then walking home by myself extremely pissed off  But you know how it gets  Till next time.. Love Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxx  Oh yeah...   Tabby's Requests:    Brainstorm    In algebra we've got a rule, Bidmas? Noo! It's Bodmas all the way!     Whipping with a ruler    "All the teachers are horrible to me" Said Jess "Why's that Jess? Said Mr Register "Well Mr Bradbury said I have no friends and yesterday Miss Duncalf called me a boy." "I don't understand that, your such a lovely, friendly and nice girl"    WRITE IT DOWN    I'm a mole...  What ever turns you on Tabby!   Lets Be ... I'm worried about her!   Jess: "Sir, feel how tense my leg is, just prod it"   And these are the ones that wasn't asked to be shown...   I ripped up my other requests due to boringness    I told you not to disturb me when I'm cleaning my room!  DUDE! Doofy kicks ass!   If you read this you are gay    Tabby: There's plenty more apples on the tree, sailors on the boat...  Jess: There's plenty more peaches on the ground...  DON'T ASK!  Miss has a big head -She said

      Well todays been so good! First lesson was maths, Mr Register totally wants me! He gave me an Alan Shearer poster :). He made my life complete, do you know how long I've been wanting that? I used to just support Newcastle because of him, then I discovered Michael Owen... Me and Tabby had fun doing the request things again. It was funny, but we didn't manage to swap at the end of the day, so I'll make the list even longer, then give it to her tomorrow. Second lesson was history, it was sooooooooo funny! I need to read what's written on my arm...   Oh look, bubbles...  Miss Davey   Chris has a flexi thumb  Me, you should see it, it's freaky!   Wiz Oz  Clur, I have to mention the Wizard Of Oz to her bro...   We saw a burning dog  Me and Clur, my hostory teacher likes pain   My pictures backwards!!!  Me, my picture was backwards!  At break we just hang it in the hall. I showed Clur Lets Get Retarded, she likes it :).  Third lesson was food, Miss wasn't there so for the majority of the time, well three quarters of an hour of it, we didn't have a teacher, then we had Miss Mudge. Sge's a BiAtCh, she kept telling me to shut up, so I pretended that I had a disorder and tried to bite my ear...  Fourth lesson was business, me and Amy talked all the way through it, it was well funny. Miss kept telling us to shut up, but guess what? I'm Jess, and when people tell me to shut up, I don't :)   At lunch, after waiting for Clur for ages, then she decided not to go woth us, me and Tabby went up to Safeways. It was well funny, we were doing "Scary Movie" impressions, I couldn't stop laughing!  Last lesson was science, Sammy put this disturbing pic on my folder. It was exactly how things were before, us laughing our heads off, then I got moved.   I went to Letty's after school, got picked up and now I'm on this thing playing a delightful game of Tic-Tac-Toe (aka noughts and crosses)with Pig, I'm gonna go play it now. Take care folks Jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well I knew from the moment I woke up that today would be a good day! I woke up from having another really realistic dream (one that I could actually feel) it was really wierd... it was Bo hugging me, all the way through the night. Wierd heh? I don't even know him... I woke up, MoMmI made me my coffee and when I had got ready I set off to school, all by myself, I actually love walking! I know if anybody who reads this who knows me will think, is this Jess Sturt we're talking about? I lvoe it best when I'm crossing the golf course by myself listening to The Darkness, it just makes me feel really good! Music is my life. There's a song for every occasion and emotion, and I change very easily. I'm 9 stone! Anyway, on with the day... First lesson was r.e with Alex. It was sooooooooooo funny, I write things down on my arm that I found hilarious, he was disturbed by this, but he had a rubber made by the amazing...   SUNBABY! . Yes that's right, Sunbaby, he thought it was incredibly weird that I found this fact hilarious, it just ain't right! I also looked at my old report sheet things, and I had made an incredibly stupid spelling mistake, I had written  neeb  instead if need, Alex was also scared at me finding that hilarious. They're predicting a B for my G.C.S.E in R.e, how cool? Alex is a C, I kicked his ass! Alex said Wicked, in a very wierd way, hilarious! And Miss said to one of the people who-don't-notice-I'm-alive: " little writing", I found it fOoNy... My conversation with Alex: Alex: Your such an idiot... Me: Make me! He didn't like my reaction,but none-the-less, he stopped throwing insults at me. Also he came out with a stupid comment:  mines really small... Also I found this out:   A republic is a country with no monarch  A president is the head of a republic   Alex found me writing that on my arm really scary... onto the next lesson!  Art, it was cool, doing more of the plaster stuff, it was fun! Sam laugh is funny. Also, I got Matt to say:  Don't be rudey!  larve it!!!  At break I hung out with Tabby, walked Letty half way home (we crossed the road with her!) and then we walked back to school. Third lesson was business and comm. Is it wrong for me to enjoy this lesson? Because I sure as hell do! Fourth lesson was science. We were in the i.t rooms, that's when I wrote that really pathetic comment. Sammy deleted my Dewey pic *glare*, at lunch me and Tabby went up lunch. Twas fun. We went back 5 minutes early in order to try and make contact with Air and his crew, but they weren't outside! So we were just laughing at random people, it was so funny! At form time I went in with Tabby for a while. Then I went back into mine and handed out my sweets  AGAIN , I've gotta stop being so nice! Last lesson was with Clur in history, it was funny, we swopped commendations, it's a sign or friendship ok! I scratched her leg for her... don't ask! I got the wrong leg, wrong spot... I went back to Letty's, but to my utter dissappointment, she wasn't there. So I walked home. My MoMmI has just showed me something she's found, it's my pasport to Budehaven, when I was 10, it's soooo embarrassing! Well nothing else to write, college tomorrow, tonight I've got to do my task 3, that'll take a while, have a bath and then sleep lots! lol.  Well I'll be going, but first I need to tell you the times when I scared my mum shitless...  When she asked me to come out of the toilet, I said sorry mum, I'll never be out! She said, Oh! I had that problem this morning, I said no mum, I've taken an oberdose...  When she asked myself if I had cut myself with a razor on my leg. Jess, you shouldn't shave at your age... No mum! I'm doing it on purpose...  When I phoned up pretending to of been in a carcrash... she believed I wa the ambulance dude, she nearly had a heart attack!  Well this is time to go... next time I'm gonna say that I've been arrested on carrying cannabis, can't wait! I'll to you then  Jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Oh, just to make my wonderful day depressing, yesterday I went scitz and completely covered my wardrobe with lyrics that hurt me/make me wanna cry/I love. And I just want to conclude;  Everything's so blurry   Everyone's so fake   Everybody's empty   Everything is so messed up   But I still wake up looking forward to life... I guess I am scitzophrenic... I'll write tomorrow xxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been as normal as any other Monday... First lesson was art. I sure have missed that lesson! It was pretty fun being back with them guys again. We got to cover our toilet roll figures in that wierd plaster stuff... Anna said somethings that I found quite funny...  I don't like giving head, the man's penis is so ugly!  I don't see why men like tits, all they are is blobs of fat...  Second lesson was English... Before I actually went into the lesson I saw Air, he said "Alrite Fish"...he's sooooooo nice. In the lesson I nearly fell asleep! It was soooo boring! And for homework, we have to draw what we think the island looks like... how fun? At break me and Clur hung out, we had laughs, then we walked to science, then went into science! Sammy was doing the whole going cross eyed thing, I yet again couldn't stop laughing! I asked him if he was going to p.e next, but obviously he wasn't, so at the end of that lesson, we went down Letty's. On the way down we panicked, we were trying to cross the road real quickly because we didn't wanna get caught bunking... but cars kept on coming! Then, as we finally managed to cross, we walked through the park, and the pigs drove past, so in utter panic we ripped our clothes off and pretended we were 6th formers. It worked quite well... when we got to Letty's we listened to his cd, I deeply recommend number 7, by whoever it is! It's well nice... Sammy did these weird trick things bout your arm rising and falling through the floor... overall, pretty freaky! We walked back to school found Clur (in the end) and then we went up safeways, was pretty boring! I had to wear white trousers because my others had had a "mishap", or so my mum says... well, there's mud all over them, thanks to the rain and Sammy. There's even mud going up the front of them. Well I gaev Sir most of my sweets when I gto back into form, he called me a star... I must of looked good today... he wasn't the only teacher flirting with me...  Last lesson was maths. As Tabby wasn't there I was completely deserted because Sammy and Clur decided to completely ignore me... I was talking to Ben, I gave Rich my email addy, so hopefully he'll add me :) Me and Ben talked about music, he said I can sing Blurry by Puddle Of Mudd, but I sound like I'm getting strangled when I sing Away In A Manger...  Sir said that if anyone was naughty then they would have to be punished and have to sit at the front, next to me. I gave him the most evil, but yet sexy glare!lmao! Then when he had finished talking to the class I said to him that I resented the comment he had just said, he apolagised, then I said I should hit him, so I got Ben's long ruler, then Sir goes yes you should, so I said bend over!!! OMGOSH!!! I can't believe I said that! I wa flirting with my maths teacher, you should of seen the smiles we were giving each other... I went home to Letty's, and we watched Loser. He's got Air's hat!!! And I yet again, wrote down notes that I liked...   You don't need flea medication do you? I dunno... he has slept with alot of dogs...    Your my asshole buddy!    Well that's about all form me  Bye guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well... later on in the day and I'm really bored! I've covered my room in lyrics of songs that break my heart. I've sang songs that have broke my heart, and I've had a bath with some rubber ducks. I must say, I haven't had so much fun in a long time! They have holes in their asses and I couls make water squirt out of them and it hit the ceiling! Very stimulating... I tidied a bit of my room, I should actually be doing Task 3 for college, but it won't take long to do, I get to look at the positive aspects of Sammy's health... I get to look at Sammy's health for the next two years! How fun...well I dunno what else to write, I hate being bored with no friends, I'm getting ready to sleep and it's 7! I'm a sad, sad little girl. Well I'll write about school tomorrow, please go Tabby! I need you!!! I mean... Take care hunnys PlOp xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well last night was both wierd and scary. We Letty and Tabby got drunk, I was slightly tipsy, read Tabby's blog. I wrote down some funny stuff... Tabby said most of it...  Kayley, I love you, because your sarcastic and babyish  I'm drinking lemonade, how gay?  I don't wanna die when I'm drober  Letty's a tranny  Flies Undone, I prefer it this way  This will be my last one, after this...  And I found this article in a magazine. Justin Hawkins said it from the Darkenss (this is Jess now!!!)  I think we're an improvement on sliced bread  Well after Tabby was dragged home we went out and it was really boring. When we went home Letty's mum's boyfriend fullon shouted at her and Letty started crying because she wanted her Dad back, he died 2 years ago. It was really horrible to see her so upset. he called her "a selfish, manipulative cow." I really felt like smacking him! I went to church, boring. I'll write more tomorrow Love Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well last night was well funny. I met up with Letty and Tabby, we went into Safeways then we went home so those two could have their tea. After, we called on Tabby and went Jax, I never knew John was Tabby's uncle! Everyone there calls him "Uncle John" now... I feel her embarrassment! It was ok there...we saw Scott do a very...um..."soulful" version of it's in his kiss bur Cher...soulful, but yet...incredibly disturbing!I'm copying Nick with all the dots... I gotta stop doing that! After that we walked Tabby home then me and Letty met Pig at the Bude light. At first it was just him, because he told us their was girls where all the others were, Letty doesn't mix very well with girls so we didn't go up there. Later Air came down, he sat next to me :). It was really quiet, then Air came out with:If I had power I would make a chicken with a monkeys head and a rat with a giraffe's head...the people with power don't do anything interesting, their just boring..  I found it soooo funny! Later on Mon and his bird and some other dude and his bird came down but went straight away. Then Air said that if he ruled the world he would get rid of certain people, like Christians, so I said what about me? And he said that I would have to stop being one. Then he said:"Do you believe you're goung to heaven when you die?" I said yeah and he said:"Look, we're a bunch of cells, if we go to heaven it means allthe others do, can you imagine amoeba floating on a cloud? No, I didn't think so..." I laughed my ass off! He said it so seriously! I think he was being serious... I suppose he has a point though, it's weird that we're all made of cells. Later the rest of the crew came down, there was me, Pig, Letty, Air, Mon (hair), Da and Bo. I found out that the whole time when Harry said he had given me his number that it was actually Bo's... how rude! The Mon dude was quite scary... I odn't know him yet he knew my name. He said I have a disgusting nose (I said mine was perfect :P) and that I look like a lesbian, he even did a Sammy and took my clip out! Then later he did this weird dance... I found it hilarious...then Bo found my laugh hilarious and we were all laughing! I was mostly talking to just Air! All the others was talking to Letty, apart from Bo, who was semi-concious, or so it seemed... Then they asked me what my bishop rating was... I said one, I won't say what it means because it's embarrassing... Everyone else was like, 51, Letty was 7...At about twenty to twelve they went to Kjs and we went home. We stayed yp till 3 just watching tv. In the morning they woke me up at 11! Yes that's right...11! So I walked home and it still won't let me on msn! It's doing my head in now! And now... I get to make my mum a Line Dance cd... the joys of having a mother that dances.... but I sure do like the red hot salsa... Your a red hot... A red hot salsa... When you swing your hips... And you do the salsa... You move forward and back... And do it again... I mean... I don't go out with my MoMmI! Well nothing else to say. My parents are worried about how much I eat, how pathetic? Love Y'allxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Today has been pretty funny! I woke up saying:  Get me a coffee , I was extremely tierd! I stayed up til 12 waiting to send one of my free texts, but when it finally got to 12, I realised I didn't have any credit! So I should be getting some tonight... I got a lift to school, I spoke to all my friends who I used to hang out with, I miss them! It's always good to move on though... First lesson was p.e, we're doing this fitness thing, it's great! We did aerobics today to S Club 8, Hear'say and so on... second lesson was business, everyone kept doing all the work wrong, it was funny. At break I met Clur and Tabby and we went to the hall, did nothing but eat crisps! Third lesson was food, but I thought it was English so I walked through the english corridor and Air and all that lot were there, I was scared! I got to food, I got Luc's number and Michaela's. We had a right laugh with Miss Menlove-Platt. Great fun talking about her ex boyfriend who was seriously fine! And he had a firm butt... Fourth lesson was English... Jess made me laugh so much! She's so funny, but yet, kinda a blond personality (she didn't know what murder or dyke meant...I rest my case...) We were having this conversation in English and I said:"Oh, I love little people!" and she replied back to me:"I hate people who train bears to dance, then they go mad..." LMAO! She's a DuDhI though! The Perv moved me away from her again :(. It was so funny! He asked a question about the book we're reading, he said: "How did they get there?" she answered: "They grew legs..." I couldn't stop laughing. Another thing, he was trying to do an example of irony... he said "just imagine if Mr Barton (the head teacher) came in and had a go at all of us, when his flies were undone. We would see the seriousness in his face, then as we would work the way down..."  YEAH! CUZ I ALWAYS LOOK AT MY TEACHERS CROTCH... , why is he so obsessed with sex? Maybe because he isn't getting any! After that was lunch... we walked to Safeways, was cool. We sat, and ate. All great, I don't think we laughed at much...We went back and last lesson was science... it was ok. I walked home with Frankie, Kristie, Aurstin and Ant. It was pretty poopy. Got left out like I always do. Well I'm gonna go now, I'm going up Letty's soon, then Jax, then we should be going out, dunno who were going to meet yet... well I'll write more tomorrow...  IT STILL WON'T LET ME ON MSN!!! , looks like I won't be chatting for a while then...  Take Care, I'm thinking of you all, and Tabby... I'll see you later xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well I ended up going out! Ian range me so I had to! It will be the last night of bush jumping with him for 2 weeks :(. Well I got a lift to Letty's, then we called on Tabby. Then we walked to Safeways and we just went to the toilet! Then Ian rang so we met him at the steps. We saw some "amateurs" at bush bouncing, It was Pat Smith, he's such a wannabe! Well after we met him we went back into Safeways for a while then it started to rain so we walked to Ian's... singing as loud as we could! Ian kind of disowned us half way there, it was funny! When we got there we just chilled out, we graffitied all over his school books, it was well funny, things like, hey big boy, pay me later, your thongs are still in my car and so on...  He has a poster of blond jokes, so heres one:   Why did the blond keep an empty milk carton in the fridge? incase someone wanted black coffee...   And Ian had a little blond moment: Oh! I have an r.e book! lmao all been very funny. It won't let me on msn :S  I'll write more later Love Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey! Well todays been pretty good! I'm actually starting to enjoy life again... scary! I got a life to school from my mum. In the "banging" metro, still cool though! Until she stalled outside the school...so embarrasing! As I went it I saw Letty and Tabby. First lesson was History, we were doing germ theory, there's this guy called Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, he's my idol! And I also poked Clur's hand, all great fun! Second lesson was Maths, Me and Tabby have this thing going on that throughout the day we'll write requests for the over person to write in our blogs, I'll put hers at the end... I can't really say what happened in Maths because it was highly hilarious so Tabby put most of it in the requests! At break we just went in the hall, Letty had gone home with Clur (Edwards) so she wouldn't be back for the rest of the day. English was boring, Perv moved me away from Jess, and kept doing this wierd lip thing at me... I was on a roll! I wrote loads! Science was the next lesson, I'd been looking forward to it all day! My chance to finally speak to Sammy. I just like sat next to him and hoped for the best. Speaking to Daniel ended up me and Sammy in stitches talking about playing badminton with Babies dressed up as a shufflecock. Then he did this cross-eyed thing, he looked sooooooooooooooo funny! After that we dropped our bags off then met Tabby, Clur and Dave. We all went up Safeways, Sammy kept splashing me! Safeways was pretty funny... finally I've had a cookie! They are still obsessed with my tomato ketchup phobia, they keep attacking me with it. We all had a laugh and at when we were just aboutt o leave he got handfuls and handfuls of mustard and vinegar! So Tabby picked someof them up and put them back, then we left, we're gonna get in poo! We walked back and it started hailing! And Sammy still found it funny to splash me... last lesson was business, boring boring boring. I walked home in the rain by myself, it looks like a night in again, with my only and lonely self.   Tabby's Requests   "Mama - ooohooohooo - didn't mean to make you cry, if im not back this time tomorrow carry on because nothing really matters..."  There was a biased question in maths, it said which subject does so-and-so do the best in, then it gave fractions, surprise surprise, the answer was maths... I bet if they had that question in english the answer would be english...  When you give people your number do you say o, zero or nought? I say o (as in the letter) as a number...  Team B is better!  Dooby Dooby Dooby  Sir put my number on the board, he put 3-5-6-7-9, so I told him, Tabby found this hilarious...  I can't put a smiley here, sorry hun, but my Smiley Central has gone somewhere...  Are you gay or something?  Right this is a very cruel and sick joke, but Tabby loves it and so I must write it... A dad and daughter were watching tv, on a film the people were having sex, the daughter says to the dad, whats that daddy? He goes, I'll show you when your mums gone to bingo...  Rain  A friend of mine is huage! So he has to sew a blanket onto his other blanket to keep his feet warm when he goes to bed, Tabby, yet again, found it hilarious.  Tabby forgot she had a boyfriend, and so did I! So I asked her to pull an ugly munter friend (which may I point out is none of the above apart from a friend)  Peel a guy  LMAO! I asked sir if the ring on his finger was his wedding one, he said that is was, so I said whos the lucky lady? He answered with my wife... I couldn't stop laughing!  LMAO! The bitch of maths was playing a game on the board, everyone was yelling advice to her, Tabby suggested one, she said: but then I'll lose! and Tabby goes... EXACTLY! lmao all funny I g2g now Toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Oh no! Jacob's been rushed to hospital because he was dropped on the head. I dunno if anythings gonna be ok or what. Guys, please pray for him, I'm so worried. Oh, today was going so well aswell. Oh, it's ok, Monica just rang mum and apparantly because he's so young he has a thick head... Oh thank you!   Well I'll write about today now that I don't have to worry! Oh that scared me so much!  I had coffee in the morning so I wouldn't fall asleep on the bus! It worked. Me, Corrine and Chrissy just chatted about almost everything! I've missed those guys! There was this guy infront of us, he was listening to like  ALL  of our conversations. And he picked his nose, it was so funny! When we got to college no one else was in our room! I'm unhappy to hear that Loose didn't recored that song for me... it's really good, but I forgot the band name yet again! Dani, Me and Corrin were talking about relationships and Dani's sounds sooooooooo funny! Her boyfriend hits her! When a yellow car drives past he punches her leg, the same with a mini, and he "Caviliar kicks" her when a cavalier drives past... and then Corrin was saying how Ad (her boyfriend) always becomes suspiscious when she goes out with her mates, Dani says I'm the same with mine, he always gets all these girls numbers and stores them... I found that so funny! I gave almost all of them my number!!! The rest of the day flew past... Ad phoned Corrine and she asked if he could pick us up, he said yeah, then when he said which Jess? Jess B or Jess P (my nicknames Plop). She said Plop and he said Yey! I've missed him... At the end we went out to meet him, but the dumbass had took the wrong turning! So he was going to be late. So Danielle came over, before she did she found it funny to shout GERTRUDE! Across the road, I hid in shame... then she screamed.. LOOK JESS! A YELLOW CAR! I just laughed my butt off! Then we crossed the road and we was just chatting to her. Then Ad came!!! Yey! I haven't seen him in ages! Then we got McDonalds :):):) I had a cheese burger n chips, and Corrin's chips and most of the coke, some smarties and some of the straw. It was great! Then we picked up Will then I went home. Then I met up with Ian after walking across the golfcourse for a little while with Ben Russell and Joe Harris. I met up with Ian then we met up with Tabby and her new straight hair! It certainly does look great! Then we met Letty. Ian starting bush bouncing on this hedge, it was sooo funny! The guy came out.. and no one else noticed so I just walked off, then they noticed him and we all pegged it! Then someone had a bright idea to buy eggs, so we egged houses! Then as we were running down this lane thing and I tripped over and skidded down this lane, I have a hole in my stripey trousers and a graze, and an ever so sore hand! But Harry has somehow, over the internet, kissed it better. Letty started walking me home then I saw Ad and Corrine again, and they gave me a lift home the little Cherubs. They're the ones that told me about Jaocb, it's nice to know my family care about telling me these things ain't it? My nephew could of died and I was clueless... Well these are Tabby's requests :  Spank my ass and call me a monkey Toodlepip :):) hehe... I love that word!  You know I said I save things on my phone that I find hilarious and I want toput on here... this is what I found today...  When I was waiting for the bus, there were two women walking at the same pace, moving there legs the same way and evertything...  and.. now this ones a cracker!!!  Chrissy, what did you do New Years Eve?Got hit on the head by a firewrok! lmao well I gota go Toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well, back to school, but first...   HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEON   I've had a really bad (at first) day. I walked to school with Frankie. We talked about our holidays. I've missed her! We got to school then I had to go with Jade to Miss Hughes office. Then we went to meet Letty but I ended up talking to Jess B. We haven't talked for ages so it was good talking to her. We didn't have first lesson, we ended up having an assembly. Our Nearly-Head Teacher dude gave us a lecture about everything, and Safeway had complained because of me and ma dudhis! We make too much noise and mess... Anyway... He said we should, and I quote (this is real sad guys, grab a hankie) "Open doors for people..." What is he on about???  After that we went back to form and me and Craig are becoming better friends again... I hugged him about 5 times!!! After that was science, I was looking forward to this, because this was my chance to speak to Sammy, but he ignored me. Letty asked him why he wasn't talking to me, he said it was none of her business. I showed everyone my new "trendy" chicken run watch! At break we just hung around in the hall, Letty showed me the Jewish Punch... very weird! Third lesson was business. I think Miss is starting to like me! Spoke to Terri and Desra. Fourth lesson was English. Letty's in my group now. We read Lord of the Flies again. But Clur (Edwards) has mine so I just sat there thinking about Sammy, I'm sad I know! I was just thinking how could a friendship just stop there, it shows me how I should apprecate my friends, you never know how much you really miss something until it's gone! And why has it gone??? I DON'T KNOW! At lunch we met Tabby and Clur at the usual spot. Sammy was there. We walked up to Safeways, and things seemed pretty normal, he was actually talking to me! I sang my "shit" song and everything was great! I hugged Captain Pugwash, but I couldn't rush to grab the last cookie because there was none :( . I got my mustard. We sat round the table eating chips. I asked Sammy why he wasn't talking to me, he said what do you think I'm doing now, I said that I meant over the last two weeks, he said it was because he was pissed off, I asked why and he said that it's a private conversation. Letty thinks its because he probably thinks I got with him that night. But I didn't. I clearly said no because of Clur, and I wouldn't of even if he was with her because I don't get with people when they are drunk. If it is beacause of that I'll have a nervous breakdown! Well we went back and Harry and his dudhis were like calling me over, I was panicking! Last lesson was maths. Was pretty funny, I missed Jack! Clur and Sammy completely ignored me though. After school me and Tabby walked home, I went to Letty's then we met up with Tabby and she showed me her new coat, and it had pockets and she tried putting her phone in the pocket and she said: "It's like trying to put a cock up a virgin" I found it hilarious...We went into town and bought chips and ate them on a building site. Tabby bought red bull and she got high! Then we went into the arcade. After that Letty went home and I went to Tabbys to drop her bag off. I saw her room, PURPLE! Then we went back down to Lettys. I text Ian saying that we were on our way, so we started walking up then Benett pulled over and we got a lift. We got to Ian's and he wasn't in! Then we walked back and went to Safeways. Bought M&Ms. On the way out we started dancing to Hey Ya. When we requested it ages ago, the lady who we asked fell in love with it so she puts it repeat now! We left and sat on the bench for ages. We had a right laugh! Then we went down to the school and they were playing hockey. We said hi to Alastair. We had an even more laugh. Then we went back and bush jumped. We walked Tabby home then Letty walked me back.  I need to add these: You see, I add notes onto my outbox on my phone to remind me what to put on my blog, but I always forget to! So here's allt he ones I found... Today: I put water in my lemonade before drinking it :S Today: Ferrari F355 Challenge, it was the car in the arcade I was sitting in, it has great tunes! Monday morning: I was tormented at 1:00p.m (just woke up) by listening to "One Fine Day" by S Club 8, I HATE ALANA! Sunday afternoon: When Letty was younger she called Valentines Day, wait for it...  VALLOWEEN  how cute! When I heard that I just couldn't stop laughing! Oh yeah, I saw this really disturbing advert when a woman brushes her teeth in the shower... thats all I need to say about that...  Abd that's it! I'll write more tomorrow at college. Love Y'all  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well I have LOTS to write, so prepare yourself for mixed emotions... wait I have to tell you what I mean when I say that...  It's like seeing your mother-in-law driving off a cliff... in your new beamer...  Well first off, I need to write how funny it was yesterday. Me and Iand left to see Tabby, I can now officially say that the Metro has not died!!! No, it was mended by nothing other than... BLACK TAPE!!!Oh the joys of having a pathetic but yet cute car... We went to Letty's and then she came out with us for a while, so we called on Tabby then just ended up walking to Safeways... twas brilliant fun, we were gonna go choir singing and jump through the carwash... that is so my dream... We walked back and Ian was trying to hijack, but no one took notice of him! When we got back to Letty's estate she had to go in because she had this big family meal kind of thing. We just stayed outside, we rang Leon, I panicked, we saw Kev, he was going to shoot someone because they smoked two of his fags. Then we went to the park and Dave and his crew came, when I saw crew I mean Benett (cough cough, TWAT! We never get on...) Dave and Shaun Cholwill (my friends cousin). They went off looking for gnomes and stuff and never came back...  After that Ian and Tabby started smashing the beer bottles... I started panicking because it was in a park so I said : "Think of the children!"... then Tabby had a blonde moment and said "Yeah, it might wake them up", LMAO! She's so cute! Then we heard the ice cream van. so Ian bought 5 drumstick lollies, in which he shared. We then stayed in the phone box, then Ian discovered the bush...  He kept bouncing into it, me and Tabby started to join in, then we ended up having a Charlie's Angel bounce and everything... Tabby seemed to find it hilarious that I said... Lets find some more bush to bounce!!!...  Letty came out then we went Knock-A-Door-Running round the estate... I found it extremely scary! I only did one...  Tabby had to go in then Ian went then me and Letty went in. We watched this hilarious thing, Tom Green in Japan. Dude! I was in stitches, he's my idol!!! After watching that Muse - Time Is Running Out kept coming on! So the good day ended in a good way... hehe that rhymes!!! We went ti bed about 1-2.  As we all laid down, Alana said how she missed Rich, he has to go to a college in Nottingham and he left yesterday. So me and Letty joined in. She said how much she missed Steve-O ( a pick of an ex boyfriend who she loves) and I said how much I missed Sammy. I know we never had a relationship, but I sure did love him, I think I still do. Well I need to write some really important stuff now.   Tabby   I know that life may upset you, but because your such a good friend it hurts me to see you upset, I know it's hard but please cheer up, and stop arguing with your parents!   Leon   I hardly know you, but yet I feel I've known you for years, your that kind of guy. Remember you only live once, just go for that girl, because you sure as hell have got that potential! If she doesn't go with you, she must be crazy! Cheer up aswell, you guys make me worry!   Sammy   Oh, where do I start!  I miss the way we wrote little notes to eachother in maths I miss the way no matter what mood I was in previously, you always had a way that made me smile I miss the way I used to glare at you out of jealousy because of the girls that surrounded you I miss the way that when it was a p.e lesson, we always met up and went down Letty's, and ate her food whether she was their or not Concluding from the previous point, I miss the sandwiches you made! I miss the way that when we walked back to school you would continuously trip me up and find it funny I miss the way we do absolutely nothing in Mr Ryan's lesson, just laugh all the way through it, and copy Daniel in the process I miss you telling me to touch Daniel's crotch I miss the way you would always back chat Mr Bradbury, and sometimes we'd break up into laughter because we actually thought he had heard it I miss being moved! I miss walking up to Safeways singing: "I'm walking in shit again, woah woah woah..." I miss excitedly running up to Pugwash hugging him... I miss rushing to the cookies to grab the final one I miss queueing up for chips whilst laughing myself to tears I miss getting my mustard :( I miss, oh wait a sec, I must appreciate this moment, Iris is playing........... "I'd give up forever to touch you..." O, lets carry on... I miss the way I was obsessed with your Lilo and Stitch impression I miss the adrenaline rush in a lesson, because I know that I'll be with you next I miss the fact that when I knew I wouldn't see you for a while, I'd run up to you, and wrap my legs round you whilst hugging I miss the feeling of never wanting to let go I miss rushing home in order to phone you I miss the way I'd change my previous plans to be with you, like when I went to the panto I miss the 5 hour long conversations we had I miss singing along to your keyboard playing I miss "watching" the films together, when we were actually talking on the phone I miss discussing the funny moments in music videos, like the fat lady dancing on Busted, and the drugged up boy that smiles in The Idols's video I miss my dad making me hang up when it came to 2 in the morning and I was still on the phone I miss the fact that one time it came to an hour, so we hung up, I didn't ring you back straightaway because I needed the toilet, within 10 seconds of hanging up, you'd rang my house phone wondering what I was doing. 10 seconds. But most of all I miss what all the above build up to, our friendship   Sammy, I love you

      Hey I'm back. I didn't do anything yesterday. Today wasn't much different either. I got credit, texted just about everyone! Tidied a bit of my room... my Uncle and his Girlfriend came down today, I've turned ever so shy!  I know I must sound the most pathetic person in the world but I really want to go back to school! I miss everyone! I miss meeting Clur and Tabby for break, I miss my scarf being confiscated, I miss being told to shut up constantly in every maths lesson, I miss being completely ignored by my English teacher, I miss saying "Hi Harry" every time I walked past him... I miss looking for the basket with the sachets of mustard in. But overall, I miss my friendships. I haven't seen any of my special mates this holiday and I just have this aching pain. I love you guys so much! I may not show it, but you guys are my life, you're the ones that got me here today, your the people who make me who I am, I appreciate it so much. Take care guys I love you Jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well... My first blog of the year... Last night I learnt that I will be dying Saturday April 21, 2068, so just another 64 of new years to go... Well, I'm proud to say that I didn't drink last night, which meant I didn't have a headache this morning, which means I didn't have to rush to the toilet this morning. Basically, I had fun without alcohol! I'll run you through the day...   urlLink     I woke up really late. My whole family were going out. I asked dad if Tabby could stay pver, he said yes, then we got onto the issue of alcohol, he started shouting at me about all the issues and stuff, so he left to work on a bad note. I had a bath with the door open, I had to if I wanted to listen to the Goo Goo Dolls, it felt so good! I hadn't done it since I was like 5!!! urlLink    Well after that I went on the internet, and Tabby said she was going round Jade's. So I was left thinking, ok, I'll spend New Year by myself...  At about 6 I came back on after being disconnected. Leon was on, his name said "Happy New Year, Y'all Better Be Out Getting Drunk" or something like that, I broke down into tears. After talking to him I felt alot better though.  Letty rang me, she had said that she couldn't go clubbing with her family so she asked if I wanted to meet up, I said after I had done my site. Please check it out, not completely finished yet though! http://chickengal192.mysite.freeserve.com Well yeah, I finished the page I was on then I got a phonecall from Ian, he was asking me to ring him. So I got off the net and called him. He was inviting me out  urlLink    so I rang Letty back up, we had to, somehow, all meet up. Letty wanted me to meet her half way, but it was raining really hard!  urlLink    So, in the end, we said that Ian would be dropped off at mine at 10, then we would meet Letty half way. Well 10 came, then Ian did, then we walked int he miserable weather. We were walking just down to the church and someone walked past us, saying "happy new year girls..." Ian went skitz, but because of the cold he didn't manage to react as quick as he wanted to... so in other words, he didn't do anything but complain about it to me  urlLink   . Well as we walked into town, we started to smoke form the pack of twenty, they needed to be gone within 2 hours!!! He seemed to find it hilarious singing in the rain, I tried to pretend that I didn't know him...  urlLink   . We met her, after Ian had shaked some random persons hand and named him Jim...  urlLink   , yes, overall, he is embarrassing! Then we met Letty by Kazbar. We walked to Bristol and West. On the way I got a phonecall, it was this guy asking me to give him head. Why does everyone treat me as a sex toy??? I don't give head ok...  urlLink   ... anyway... Letty hung up on them because they called her a slag  urlLink    Then we phoned Mon and asked where they were because we wanted to meet up with them, they said they were down the skatepark  urlLink   , so off we went, may I add... IN THE POURING RAIN. The whole way there Letty wouldn't stop complaining about her shoes, well they are actually Alana's brand new Â£60 "wear them in the rain you'll ruin them" suede shoes. Well we finally got there and they wasn't there  urlLink   , so we phoned them again and they said they were at the lifeboat hut, so we walked to the lifeboat hut, it was extremely funny, there were HUGE puddles everywhere and Letty kind of had a nervous breakdown because she kept walking in them! urlLink    um... not quite! Well yeah, we arrived at the lifeboat hut and, once again, they wasn't there  urlLink   . So we phoned them again and they said they were at the triangle and they would wait for us for 10 minutes, I knew that they wouldn't be there, but none-the-less, we still went, we might aswell of had Gullable written on our foreheads  urlLink   , So we went back into Bude, this was about 11:10p.m. This Pig  urlLink    drove past and stopped and started chatting up Letty, he said that if she went home he would arresst her, policemans humour is so embarrassing... I cringe for them! So after that Ian phoned them again. Air had the cheek to ask me to go down to the party, laugh in my ear then he passed the phone to Mon who said... well have a guess... where's my blow job??? Do I look like a walking Blow Job Machine??? Guys... give me a break!  urlLink   . Well yeah, after that we had to walk Letty home. So we waled her to the Bencoolen. We said to her that she would be alright to walk by herself now as we had passed all the pubs. But... as we said this, 2 drunk men walked past and said: "You might wanna get off the road love, we don't want you to get run over now would we?" Then the other one said: "Unless you're getting picked up..." then we started laughing as he stared at her ass. She glared at me, then we had to walk her home. Ian's dad thought there was a party at mine, so we had to be back at mine for half twelve, but we were gonna stay at Letty's then his Dad could pick him up from there... but his Dad wasn't in...so at midnight, we had to walk back to mine. We had our last cigarette, and he snapped the other two  urlLink    . So as we made our way home... it was still wet. We got home, overall the party had been great, Me, Ian, my dad in his underwear, and cheap biscuits, his Dad came, I went on here. I've missed loads of stuff out about last night so I'll try to add it in eventually!  urlLink    At about 2 I had a phone call from Pig asking me to go outside and go see them lot. I said no though, when I actually changed my mind they rung me! But I pressed the wrong button and I cancelled them... they didn't ring after that :(. Well nothings happened today, I'm just probably gonna watch films with my family. Jacob is huge now!!!  Better go  Take care Love you jess xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well well well...this weekend has been fanbloodytastic, I really wish I was able to record it, but I wasn't so...   FRIDAY  Can't remember what happened at school, so fuck it! But I made pink flapjack... Well I went to Tabby Baby's after school, then we went back to mine for munchimoos, then we just did some random things (I can't remember so yeah...!) Then we met Nippsipuff at Spar, went into Bude, Mikey bought me fags, then we met up with Jess B and Frankie, then we went down Bude Light. We were just full on laughing and talking about everything, when Nips popped his head round the corner...with Jamie, when we were singing Hakuna Matata, I decided to do something which I can't remember so I just won't write it lol! Then we got a text from Pig to go to the fire, so we did, it was pretty cool, Nips went to go pepe and when he came back he ha a wet stain down his jumper, it was of course the obvious, but anyone who can work out how he did this, please email me ;) Well the police came, so we ahd to put the fire out. Well then all the poopy "hardcore" people came so we decided to go to Bude, it was me Tabby Baby, Nippsipuff, Pig, Bo, Da, Fran Mon, Mon, Matt, Jamie, Sam, Mervin, Mikey, Blokish Girl.... We were all "hanging" round the busstop, eating egg fried rice, then we all departed our different ways, and Nippsipuff decided to spewipoos down an alley just before his Dad came to the rescue...errr...nice!  decided to splurt because Steve Gomm came, and started to bully Mervin, but then Da came to the rescue, and jabbed Da. Then we all ran up this random ally, where it was snowing, actually I'm lying, it started snowing when we were in Bude, but tou don't know that so nenenenene(mocking tone) well yeah, we reached this alley, and we found Da (after spendidn the entire night looking for him) well thats a lie...but again nenenenene(mocking tone)...Then we actually not me, everyone else had a snowball fight... After that we all decided to go to Stratton, don't ask :| But we didn't actually make it...so Da went home, and Pig and Bo walked us home... when we got to the end, we played the ever so delightful game of a-b-c-d... then we went in... when I discovered a  HUAGE  blister.  Me and Tabby Baby, got into bed, it was warm... then we went online, BECAUSE WE CAN!  After a while, we went offline, breathed then walked down the stairs, opened the door... and so on and so forth...  SATURDAY  I woke up to Nippsipuff ringing me, :| He manages to wake me up every weekend without fail...it had also come to my attention that my Kimiko had grown long hair! Then we went to Tabby Baby's house, to be greeted by Nippsipuff asking us to go online, so we did, Tabby finished with him, he thinks it's because she got with Bo, which she didn't, so now no one actually believes the truth, and this little lying rat, aka, Jason Mountain. My rat died today, Mitzi. Mum was upset, but she'll get over it... We're over Pigs now, do you realise how long it's taken me to write this entry? I was too occupied witht he webcam...hehe :D   Toodle guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well today has been pretty cool. Frankie came for me in the morning, then I bullied my mum to give me a lift...MWAHAHAHAHAHA! We got there really early, I managed to talk to all my oldies, thats when I heard the good news that CorrinPoo was moving into our form, we were also trying to get Jade in.  First lesson was History, she read out the register thing with Jade Morganator, LMAO! She thought it was immature...That lesson was boring, Claire decided she was ill, so I was alone, with Nichols asking me if I wanted a tissue...inside joke.  Second lesson was maths, pretty poopy, with loads more homework,  HOPPY CHOCK .  At break me, Tabby Baby and Letty went down donkey again, had a fag or two. Then we gave Bo his cds.  Third lesson was English, I think it's the first I've actually enjoyed! To top it off, Jess said Alex: You should know, your Mr Brain, It was hilarious! Then we got to watch a version of Lord Of The Flies, it was great! Jess had Jack, Letty had Ralph and I had Simon, they were all so adorable! Jack looked like Alex, Ralph looked like a rabbit and Simon looked like me when I was younger.  Fourth lesson was Science, I think its the only Science lesson I've worked hard in! Go me!  At lunch we went down Letty's, where I discovered a song that me and my long lost love used to listen to, it was upsetting...  THEN IT SNOWED! YES IT SNOWED IN BUDE!   Last lesson was business, again pretty poopy.  I walked home with Terri, because Tabby Baby was supposed to meet me, but she went to the wrong green gates :|.  Me and Terri had a laugh, it was funny! Now I'm at home, Tabby Baby has joined me. Walking in the hail... it took her half an hour and that's all I got to say about that! Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The days still been pretty boring, coming towards the end of it now though, arg! Lol, nothing to say. I've ate so much it's untrue, I've seen some of my my sisters mates, but I don't think they recognise me, I'm getting dropped off at Nippsipuff's later, so I'll write more when I go home Bye (again!) xxxxxxxxx

      Hey, todays been pretty cool. Frankie didn't come for me in the morning, arg! And my MoMmI wouldn't give me a lift either, so I walked...because I'm hardcore!   First lesson was p.e, but we had extended form time, it's all changed and is extremely wierd! or is it weird? Well yeah... I found out about Letty, she got with Anna Snell, Kristie Parsonage, Sheps, Fordy, Chrissy (he's male! lol) and Alex Smeeth...ARG! I was ripping the piss out of her all day! I mean ANNA SNELL N KRISTIE???? I also got a Valentines card from Tabby through the register :D Well as form only lasts 20 minutes, we went to the remaing of the lesson, which was then that I found out we were playing RUGBY :D, so next time, Me, Clur and Tabby are gonna rugby tackle maths bitch...mwahahahahaha  Second lesson was science, we had a test and me and Letty was just writing any random answer it was well funny! I kept reminding her about Sutcombe...  At break me, Tabby Baby and Letty went down donkey, this random guy came up to us and asked us for some of a fag to roll a joint...nice!   We returned to school, my third lesson was business, just the usual really, I found out about Sexual, Racial and something else...DISCRIMINATION! Yeah...it was so educational, I've forgotten it!  Fourth lesson was English, pile of poopy, as usual! But Letty went to it this time, I'm really proud of her! This is the first time she's done a full day, her second English lesson of the year...  At lunch Me, Tabby Baby, Nippsipuff and Pig went down spar, had a fag down Donkey on the way, then I bought 3 eggs,a  pizza and a monster white chocolate muff. We then went back to donkey to have another fag, then we left.   As we walkked through the English corridor, this random DuDhI, just came up to us and started talking about one of Nippsipuff's previous babysitters, you could see he was trying to hide something, he kind of ran away from this dude, then he came out with; "Oh yeah, she told us you used to shit yourself", I was in hysterics for ages, it was just so funny! I'm in hysterics now! He's like, really hardman in school, then you find out he used to shit himself! LMAO!  After that it was registration, where me Craig and Michaela did the usual, and groped eachother, then Craig attempted to pimp Michaela, with 3p!  Then us 3 went into the girls toilets, as we walked out Craig yells, thanks Michaela! And thanks Jess for holding it! Anyway...  Last lesson was maths, pretty poopy, I've established Sammy's hate for me...again.  After school I got a lift home with Frankie, then returned home to a working virtual toy and loadsa munch! I ate loads, then Nippsipuff rang me, so we waited for Tabby Baby and Pig at the school. Then we went to Harlequinnes, the car game went weird on me! It was horrible...  We played on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and The Weakest Link, ended up speding £20 on the machines... and £2 of that was mine!   We went out, went to Safeways, then we were joined by Gary and Jimmy, they provided us with cigarettes! Then we were just doint nothing lol.   We all left, Tab, Pig and Nips went one way, Me, Gary and Jimmy went another.   As I walked throught the estate, we walked past Tod, and as I left Gary, all I heard was: Gary: You gonna hit me? Jimmy: Tod! Get off him!  I turned arounf, there was Gary, being strangled by Tod, I just think it's really rude, no one gives Gary a chance, they just label him from what they heard.   I walked past the amazing smelling bricks again, it is the bricks! NOT the disposable toilet disinfectant...  Thats about all, I'm actualyl looking forward to college tomorrow!  Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well pretty boring day, the sun is shining, but yet no heat is coming from it, no school, and it's ever so boring. I had a bath, while listening to the goo goo dolls again, now just surfing the net, I hope something will happen tonight, if it does I'll write it on here C yaz xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Well I'm back, when I wrote before, I was a very pissed off Jess, who decided to hate everyone I like...anyway... After I left the net, I called on Tabby, on the way there I had a fag to try to relieve my stress, if looks could kill, I'd be a mass murderer! I had a face like thunder, then I tripped up...IT WAS HILARIOUS! And just to make things better, someone drove past. I must of looked so stupid!  Well I got Tabby, then we started to walk into Bude so she could buy fags, half way there, Nippsipuff rang, saying that him, Pig and Bo were at the park playing football if we wanted to go, so we said we'd come later. We started walking by Nanny's Moor Bridge, then we discovered it had been closed, so after talking about walking across the canal, we decided that we would have "wet ankles" so we walked in a circle! Then we discovered a "Seat Leon", which Tabby got very excited about.  We saw Letty in town, we managed to dispose of her farely quickly, we went up to Magsies, and would you believe it??? They wouldn't serve her! So we smoked our fags and met the crew at the park, Da was there aswell...  This dudhi with an afro came, then Big Dick Danny came, after the ball smacking against my face several times, we decided to splurt...  After blackmailing Ian, we managed to go into Bude for chips, which we then later saw Pig, Bo and Da. So we all got our munch and sat outside the Tasty Plaice, after having a very educational chat to Da about Battered Eagles...he left.  So we were left there, so we decided to play our ever so delightful game again...  Geezer busted and bought... Arab Butt Cucumber Dick Erected Elf Fat Bitch (this was mildy amusing as a woman would pass by every time we said it) Guff A rat (Bo can't say h's??) Indian Jug (Tabby's wonderful thinking...) Kipper (I'm so great!) Lemming Mofo  Nappy (Ian found this hilarious...) Orphan Punjab (I had to repeatedly point at my forhead, everyone kept forgetting!) Quantam Rectum Shatty arse (I prefer ass, but you know!) Tumour Unusually large bike Veloceraptor Whip Xylaphone (Oh! Ian's skill...) Yanky doodle dandy.... Zimbabwe chocken  Well after that Bo went, saw Letty again, and again...and again!   We stayed at this bench thing, Tabby stripped to her bra/top thing... GREAT STUFF! It was 1degree!   Well that's all...oh yeah! i forgot to mention... I dreamt I was best mates with Lee Bickle last night, werid! Bye xxxxxxxxxxxx

      Morning:  Dude! I seriously couldn't sleep without my phone last night, it was horrible, I missed that poor baby, but I soon reunited with her. I went to church, saw Tabby Baby and Nippsipuff there, came home, ate a unusually bad roast dinner, came on the internet, Nippsipuff came round, and he's getting annoyed with me because I won't go out with Pig, arg, what do I do? Oh faithful blog? This is really pathetic... I'll write more later Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxx  Night:  Well, me and Nippsipuff met up with Pig, then I called on Tabby Baby, we al went up Stratton, then all of us but Pig went to Nippsipuff's house, we watched some more wrestling, it was fanbloodytastic! Later we met Pig at Safeways, after hearing lots of "banging tunes" from inside of Safeways, we decided to go to Harlequinnes, where we played on the car machines, great stuff! And of course, here are teh things, I saved on my phone...   Pwab ...LMAO! A word I made up the day before...   Nippsipuff: Keep your eyes on the road! Tabby Baby: I try but if I do I crash   G2g bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey, I just woke up, no actualy point of this post apart from my increidbly weird dream, I dreamt everything had moved back a year, so like everyone like in my year, was in year 9, but the only thing was, I hadn't changed at all.   As soon as we sat in the room, I looked over, and Danny was there, counting his fags, he's now a really strong Christian, it was so wierd to see this! Then I saw Sammy, he seemed normal although his voice sounded different, I tried talking to him, like we usually did , but he just seemed so  different , it was actually really horrible, like when we were walking off he was holding onto my tit, it just really didn't seem like him! Which I've already established...  Anyway, I tried explaining to everyone that they'd been moved backa year, but they didn't pay attention to me, but everyone seemed to be as normal, just  put a year back, like Lara was talking to Kris, Joel and Lara talked to me...it was just I dunno, then I started planning that I wouldn't ask Sammy to come round mine to get drunk, so we never would of lost that friendship that we once had, arg! Hard to explain, I just wanted it off my chest...  Bye x   It's now half ten at night...   Well the day was cool, I finally let Nippsipuff, he had been at the door for 20 minutes! Bless him! I couldn't hear him! Then we went to call on Tabby Baby, Pig refused to come out with us, because he now "hates us", sweet? We went into Stratton and then went to Nippsipuff's, where we watched loads of wrestling, it was great! I  HATE  Triple H, he beat the Rock, I also saw Kane today...scary!  We went to Safeways, bought munch, then saw Jade and her crew there, so we waited round for ages to see if her blike was cheating on her, or whatever! I don't really know the story! But when Jade left, that's when he came! But she didn't come back because she didn't believe us, I forced Nippsipuff and Tabby Baby to come into the Safeway toilets because I was desperately needing a poopy! So I did it! I also got to wear Nippsipuff's tasteful Cornwall Rugby Top, which is black with yellow stripes, so I was wearing my stripey trousers, Nippsipuff's top and my rainbow scarf...GREAT STUFF!  I walked home, watched "It'll Be Alright On The Night", even more great stuff! And now I'm on here, see you later xxxxxxxxxx This is my first night without my phone :(, I left it round Nippsipuffs xxxxxxxxxx

I know that sounds erm...self explanatory! But hell! Since I cut my hair I've NEVER looked this good! My hair went perfect, YES, MY HAIR!!! My eye make up, I kept trying to take photos, but they never looked at I wanted them too, so I video recorded my self, BECAUSE I CAN!  I went round Nippsipuffs, it was ok, played lots of wrestling.  Went to jax, it was ok, I got a text from Fran saying this, I find this HILARIOUS!!!    Just thought I'd let you know your friendship means alot to me, if we were on a sinking ship and there was only one life jacket... I'd really fucking miss you!   I'm talking to Marky, and I said to him that my computer is a penis, he said this: "just going up to play on the computer mum"... Jessy runs upstairs  LMAO! And he just made an anagram of my name, he seems to find it hilarious, but I don't! Lol  "ITS CUTE ASS JNR"  And he also made tow for Pig, ain't he the lucky one!  "carroty locks BS" and "carroty socks lb" ...  he's now trying one for Tabby Baby, Letty and Nippsipuff, no luck as yet! Lol, he says that Tabby's is hard, still no luck! And he can't do them! How rude??? Gotta go bed now, bye xxxxxxxxxxxxx    Nothing else to say really, missing you Tabby Baby! Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well last night was pretty cool, we called on Nips, he got us fags, then we went to Bude, we phoned Pig and he met us at Budelight, I had the feeling he was getting pissed off with us...  We went to the sand dunes and we played a game  It started off as Granny went to the shop, but ended up as Annie went to the market...  And bought a  Apple Banana Carrot Duck Elephant Fish Gertrude House Insect Jess Kiss Lemon Monkey Stripper Notorious Elf Orang Utan Pogo Stick Queer leprechaun Rancid Waffle Sex Toy Tampon Umbrella (at first he said Rupert the bear...LMAO!) Violin Willy X Files Yellow Boat Zimbabwe Man  Great fun!!! Well we started to walk back, when we attacked by Dean Cowling, I thought I was going to be hit, seeing as the girls were shouting: Get off my boyfriend you little slags  Then Dean was holding me, and wouldn't let go of me, until the girls came round the corner, but it ended up as a friendly chat...which was good!  Went to my room, all my sisters followed and we stayed up telling jokes...  Dunno the plan for today... Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   It is now half eleven at night   Well the afternoon was pretty cool, Nips came over, then we decided to dream, so we went down St Petroc's and was just full on dreamt, it was hilarious, I've made up a completely new game called "19 Seconds", if I oculd remember what the rules were, I'd tell you, but I don't so you know!  My MoMmI was being ever so rude towards Tabby Baby, about a lift going home,but I think everyone is forgiven now! Not much else to say, I had a bath, cuz I'm hardcore :P Well better be going Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

I haven't really got anything to say, I had to go home early because shes going to "Dairyland" with her little cousin, so I walked home, had a bath, and now I'm on here listening to my ever-so-great Alex Parks cd, I didn't actually think it would be good, but I'm larvin it...

      Well today has been successful...yus.... I woke up pretty late, yet again Ian woke me up, I also checked my messages and I seemed to have some ones from Pig that I didn't remeber recieiving, it turned out to be that I had sent messages in my sleep, again, I gotta stop doing that! It's really embarrassing telling someone you love them and that you don't wanna lose them...  Well I went on the internet for a while, pretty boring. Nips came round, then we were on a rush to Tabby's because he couldn't come out tonight, so we did and we were playing about in the park, Tabby had a fascination with a gravitational forcefield, I don't think it existed, but I went along with it to make her happy. Then Nips went home, me and Tabby just had a not-so-satifying meal of worms and grasshoppers, so she's going to make us something...NOW  I'm staying over Tabby's tonight, so see y'all later Love you all like balls xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxhow pathetic was that?

      Well as obvious it is from the title, I'm back!    Friday  I was pretty scared, because I had to sleep in with the girls (obviously) and I don't really get on with any of them, but on the way Tanz and Kerry talked to me which made me feel a lot better. When we got there, I knida panicked! But the girls weren't being nasty to me, so it was cool. I met up with Nippsipuff, obviously! And we went to the concert thing, which I got talking to this guy called Nick, he was from a group that joined ours from St Ives, he seemed cool, but yet weird, he had only talked to me for about 5 minutes when he asked me whether I had a boyfriend, um yeh!!!  The concert was well cool, they played my favourite song, Open the eyes of my heart Lord, open the eyes if my heart, I want to see you...  Yeah I love it! lol  On the way back we decided to get chips because we were all so hungry, but that Nick guy and his mates kept talking to me, so i panicked and kept trying to "fit in" with Sammy, well actually I followed him, well what else was I supposed to do???  We came back, I was just like standing at the door of the boy's bedroom, begging Nips to come out, he didn't so I gingerly retreated to my room, I got changed and slept...   Saturday  Woke up by all the girls laughing, I had slept surprisingly well considering I had slept on the floor, and used my bag as a pillow...  I managed to put my mascara and eyeliner on upstairs, and sneak downstairs and find Ian, I have to thank God that he was there, I don't know how I would of survived without him, and I wasn't using God's name in vain then, I was actually thanking him! lol  I played this cricket thing with some boys, there was one called Si, who was REALLY loud, something you seriously didn't need in the morning! He was really fit though! LOL! I took a ball everywhere with me, until we had to go to the concert thing, I left it on the bus...  We went to the same place where we did the night before, and we sung my favourite song, again! I tried to join in but my stomach was aching so much it's untrue! It felt as though there was a huage bruise going across it, so I had to sit down all the way through the preaching, and I didn't get to dance to this such amazing band called 29th Chapter, they did hip hop, it was soooo great! When it was our dinner break, me and Nips left earlier than usual because I thought I was going to be sick, constantly, it was horrible! So we went into this room and 29th Chapter was there! Nips got signatures and I had a full on conversation with the lead singer! It was great! He asked me if I was married because I wear a ring on that finger, so I explained to him and stuff, and then we were just chatting, and they're gonna send me an email, because we're planning on having a hot fling, joke! It was just this piece of paper I signed...  For lunch we had these ham baguettes, a packet of crisps, a fizzy drink and a chocolate bar, I felt even worse, but I ate it anyway just incase it did make me feel better.  Then we had another service, it was really emotional! Everyone was gettin filled with teh holy spirit, people were falling to the floor, there was Kerry screaming and Sammy and Tanz crying, and people question about the Lord being fictional, if you were there, you would clearly be able to say that God is so amazing, and he is completely true. I, yet again couldn't dance or anything, but I tried! In this session my life had became famous...what I actually mean is... The bloke at the front shouted, WHAT'S ALL YOUR NAMES? There was about 2000 of us, and we were all screaming...I just full on screamed "GERTRUDE!" And when everyone had gone quiet he goes:"Wel I've got to say hi to Gertrude! And me and Ian went Skitzipoos and raised our hands and screamed... Then whe started saying how hardcore everything was, come on! If anyone knows me at all they know that I sure do love that word! Well everything ended great, and everyone was happy, everything was great.  We got back tot he thing, and Nips told me about something, so he talked with Kerry and Dan whilst I talked to Sammy, and he nicked my coat, may I add it was extremely cold!!! Then he came, and we talked for a while, but he wanted Tabby! lol, I can see when I'm not wanted...  I went to bed, fell asleep near enough as soon as the lights went out.   Sunday  We had to wake up early in the morning, because we were sleeping in a church there was going to be a service, so we had to get out of there early. I got changed, packed my stuff, and went downstairs...  I met Nips, and we went to get breakfast, Nips wouldn't make mine so I went up, I had to open a new packet of cereal, so when I opened them, I ripped the bag in the wrong place, then I went to pour it into the bowl, but I got it everywhere! It was sooooooooo embarrassing! There was this guy there (who thought I was gullable) and that Nick guy, who was just there laughing at me! Then I pured the milk in, I thought nothing else would go wrong, but as I put the bottle down, I somehow managed to put it in a bowl full of milk, which tipped over, I was embarrassed! But yet I managed to walk away without looking guilty, apart from the whole bit about my face going red and me laughing my head off, but you know...  We packed our things onto the bus, and left to Birmingham, we went to Maccy D's, where I noticed this ever so delicious guy with a cap on, we made eye contact :D  We then went to meet in like the town centre kind of thing, there was a stage and The Band With No Name came on! And you know what? The fit lad in Maccy D was infact the rapper dude, boy did I feel lucky! I didn't dance or anything to their stuff because I still felt really unwell.  We left and got Maccy D's again, it was great, me and Ian had 3 apple pies each. After that we left to go home, which I must admit I was looking forward to, I felt so ill, and I hadn't gone for a "number 2" since Thursday. I can't take "bishops" in public places, it's just incredibly sick and uncomfortable!  The journey was pretty cool, we were all singing away to the radio. I fell asleep on several occasions, I was seriously pooped!   Then the bus started to loose power and stuff, so Mum picked me and Kerry up and we went home, after hugging Nick of course! I'm so glad to say I had a bath, I feel so great, and may I add, when I came home I went straight to the toilet, went poopy and now I just have really bad windipoos, so basically the tummy pains were actually infact, for not winding...  Well I wrote alot on here, so I'm gonna go now bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Wow!!!! I forgot to say this yesterday! Yesterday when we were walking into Stratton, Nips, Tabby and Pig were all linking arms and skipping down the road, then Nips started singing: "We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of oz!" It was so funny! Then Nick Mills and Steve Mansell  started walking up and they shouted: Alrite Nips!" It was hilarious as he ran down the hill in embarrassment. Well i'm in science, and I'm going now...Love you xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well today's been so great, I'm actually starting to enjoy life! Frankie got me this morning, we walked to school, was pretty cool.  After finding out Wardy had seen my video which me, Tabby and Nips had made, I was prett pooed, but then I found out he only saw the beginning...  First lesson was maths, was pretty cool. Me and Tabby had a msn convo, without the computer! Lol...yus...  Second lesson was History, it was hilarious! Miss wasn't there so we had a subby, he was Egyptian, his name was Mr Abdelrahman. He was well cool, he came from London, he had a well cool accent. He even said "O Dear!" In the voice I imitate in, GREAT STUFF! If we were good we got to have our Names written in Egyptian, which of course, I was, so I got it, it was err...great! Then I got a sticker saying "well done", GO ME! LOL, Sammy...Also Luke said some funny things, such as:   I bring home the bacon, or sausages, which ever you prefer...   It's wet!...and gone!  Then Anna told me about the book she had been reading about hair...  Hairdy Dad's, hairy Mum's, hairy toes...and hairy bums   At break I ate 2 burgers, then I was talking to Joe Justice, and realised how much things have changed since playschool!  Third lesson was food, it was cool. She was asking what kind of things you could decorate the biscuits with, everyone was saying things like  ICING! SWEETS!  Then Ben came out with... Curry ...Miss moved me, but I got to tell her about my love for Randy Orton, which was good!   Fourth lesson was Business, it was soooo funny! Desra kept getting weird emails, I found out it was Anthony Mitchell and Michael Salt, I couldn't stop laughing! We sit behind him, so we could see what he was doing on the screen, he was saving everyone's emails addresses, it was well freaky! Then Miss went out of the room, and this guy goes to Amy, AMY, I'VE GOT A BONER OVER HERE FOR YOU, that was it, I was laughing so much! Then when Miss came back in me and Amy reseted our computers, once again my computer didn't turn back on! O dear... Then me and Desra were like: O shoot, whoopsie daisy kinda thing, it was hilarious  At lunch I went up Safeways with Tabby Baby and Nippsipuff. It was cool I suppose, just a normal lunch time.  Last lesson was science, But Sammy wasn't there and we had to sit in a seating plan, how rude? Robert Medland refused to sit next to me...arg! This boy came in, and Aodh said: Oh look who it is! It's a little bitch... , and again, I found it hilarious!  I walked home with Frankie, then I got my money, then got a life to Tabby Baby's.  We went into Bude, I bought Goo Goo Dolls "A Boy Named Goo" and the Proclaimers "Finest", it has the song I would walk 500 miles...a great song! Then we bought Chippiwoos, then went arcade and played a shooting game.  We went back to Tabby Baby's and just chilled out, then we met Nippsipuff and Pig at Safeways. It was ok, but I had to go to mine straight away because I had to pack my things for the Gathering, I'm going to Birmingham this weekend, with the Jax crew. So I won't be able to write for ages :(.  We then went to Stratton Park and this weirdo came upto the fence asking us for our names, it was Olly! As in the f**k up! Sporry to be mean...but he is! The whole time he was just standing there, staring, I couldn't stop laughing!  After that we went Scott and Cally's. Dropped my stuff then I went home... I'm now on here, saying a farewell to you all, I hope you all will miss me because I'm travelling on Friday the 13th, which ain't good! Great Valetine's day with Kelly Wonnacott...  See you all later...  Love you xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well I'm at college, after having a huage argument with my parents, they finally got me on the bus, which pissed me off because Corrin's seeing her Dad in Nottingham, and Chrissy decided not to come, it's my firt day at college by myself, and I'm hating it! My bishop rating is about 90, and because I'm at college I'll have to hold it in till I get home because I can't take "bishops" in public places, should be doing the same as last night, but tonight... I htink Tabby's still grounded so I might go out with Letty again... Argipoos! There's a girl here called Sam who thinks she's hardcore, I feel so embarrased for her! She walkes around as if she owns the place, but she doesn't. She thinks she's gorgeous and she keeps bragging about her boyfriend and how she smokes, big fucking deal? She's not the only girl in the world that ain't single, and she ain't the only girl that smokes. Sad fuck!  Well I'm gonna go now, there's loads of people coming in bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      I know I've already wrote today's blog, but tonght's been sooooo funny! And it's my blog, so why am I even writing this bit... Well I met up with Nippsipuff, where we met his DuDhI friend who gave me 20 fags for £2.50. After that Pig came, I got credit and then we went down Letty's, where she gave me her "ever-so-tasteful" present, a penguin comdom... she got it for me to make me laugh...which it did! Well I kinda let off a nervous laugh... We went to the park, it was sooooooo funny! There was these two little year 9s, who heard about my "tampon" so they decided to just stare at us, then Nips said to them , your talkative, they turned around as if they were going to say something, but they didn't it was sooooooooooooooooooooo funny! Then a guy walked past, who talks to himself, and as he walked past us he said: Look at those retards, they should of been sterilised at birth, you can tell they're the original  testube babies. Well after lots of fights on whos going on the swing next, after being called any random animal, we decided to go to Harlequinns, which was hilarious! I'll add the quotes which I saved on my phone, because I'm sad like that...  "Oh, I didn't think they were real, nothing on this game is, look at the trees..."  Nippsipuff  "Look at the tulips!"   Nippsipuff  "There's real boulders?"  Nippsipuff  "What? The volcanoes ain't real?"  Pig  "Are you under the sea?"  (Letty)  "No shit! It's called Atlantis..."  (Nips)  "Oh yeah! I can see the bubbles..."  (Letty)  "O???"  Nips, he wanted to save his name as "Nips", but he couldn't get to the "N", so he run out of time, and got the end result...  "Yo yo yo what you up o, how about a cheerio? Or no? or are you too much of a ho?"  Letty's err....song?!?!?!  "And once again I've been delighted with the smell of the deliteful bricks..."  Me on the way home, mental note to self..., honestly! Those bricks smell good! x x x

      Well another day which I can say confidently, FaNbLoOdYtAsTiC... Frankie got me in the morning, after threatening to nick my freebie tampons, we left for school. We got there late. First lesson was R.e, me and Jess did nothing all lesson! It was well funny. All lesson I was getting Jess to sing Sophie Ellis Bextor, cuz she looks just like her and she sounds like her! At the end of the lesson Miss asked Jess what she'd done, so Jess showed her work from like a week ago, then Miss treid to read it and Jess snatched it back off her, it was sooooo funny! Second lesson was art, me and Anna just talked mostly through it, I had to draw this weird Heiroglyphics thing...  At break I bought two burgers again! I now notice that no one is at all surprised/shocked                 Third lesson was Business, pretty boring. Emailed a couple of people. Science was fourth, it was sooooo funny! Sammy tried to lock Kayleigh in a cupboard, and he was leaning against the door on his chair, then as Kayleigh pushed, it pushed the chair, it was hilarious, but you had to of been there!  At lunch Me, Nippsipuff and Sammy went up Safeways, as Tabby Baby wanted to stay with Jess Brown and her crew. We went up, saw Cellars, I bought a fag off Nippsipuff for 30p, he was desperate, and so was I! We bought the usual munchimoos, Sammy seemed to be quite obsessed with the "Finger" box, rubbing it... He said he doesn't hate me! He just dislikes me! It's getting better! Then he asked what lesson he had next (Nippsipuff told me to write this!) I said I had History, then he goes I got Art, I love you Jess!!! Yey! Lol...or not!    At form time, me and Craig were constantly grabbing Michaela's ass! It was so funny! Then we all held eachother as me and Craig wished for a threesome...He said I had a nice ass! Oh I love him...  Last lesson was History, Miss wasn't there so I sat next to Anna, I have loads of notes! LMAO, she thought I was weird...constantly writing on my arm... Because Miss wasn't there we had to do the whole: "Write the names down, then pass the paper around and some random immaturists...which happened to be me and Anna, apart from one...which took me ages to get, I'll write them all down, then I'll write what we added in bold... Jade Morgan ator  LMAO I love that one... Josh Diamond io  Anna did that one... Sarah Greenwood y  Again, Anna did that one... and the one I didn't get, but later I did... Josh Farrar and his "crew" write it...  Drew Peacock ...  Droopy Cock   And they were going red with laughter so Anna called them...  Rhubarb Heads   Then Chris did this really "DuDhI" writing...so I asked him how he did it, he said he "wrote it" and then he said, I would raise an eyebrow, But I can't... LMAO OH I LOVE HIM!!!  Then we were talking about Takeshi's castle, and she called the people from China, Chiny. LMAO  Well after school I went into town with Frankie, Michaela and Jade, then walked home, might be going out tonight, might not. Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been pretty cool. I really didn't want to get out of bed this morning! Frankie didn't come get me, so I walked to school listening to Blurry. First lesson was art, I'm sooooooooooooooooo behind! I have to do a whole project, but I'm doing good on the new one so yey!  Second lesson was english, I was completely ignored, I hate that teacher, if I get really bad results I'm gonna blame him, I had to ask 3 times for a piece of paper, and at the end of it, I had to get it myself, because he still didn't listen! At break we just bought mumnchimoos, Corrin's gone to Nottingham, so I won't be meeting her at breaks! lol Third lesson was science, it turns out that Sammy doesn't hate me, just "dislikes me intensly" so I guess it ain't all that bad... Fourth lesson was p.e, we had the "talk" YEY free tampons!!!! At lunch me, Tabby Baby and Nippsipuff went up to Safeways, it was ok, not exactly "the best" but it wasn't bad either... Fifth lesson was maths, all through the lesson me and Tabby Baby were begging Russ to give us back the video we had made, in the end Mr tilzey had to force it out of him, he was extremely annoyed!  Well I came home, ate a little, went online and Nips kept asking Pig out for me! It was really embarrassing... Nothing else has happened really Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well Tabby Baby came round mine last night. It was funny...I was kept up all night by the sound of her tapping her leg, an inside joke! Then we kept eachother up all night with Tabby Baby in hysterics by saying "Alrite Ginge?" and not forgetting the whole, lets imagine what Rik and Sy's voices are like...yeah we're weird, but at least we're good at it!  The next morning, WOOHOO! I'm 15...not that much of a difference, apart from the whole fact of people coming up to you with presents and stuff... I got £72, a cd rack :D, a winnie the pooh towel, piglet sockx, a photo album, rainbow pen and book... I went to church, met up with Ian. He gave me my pressie, a pack of 10 fags, him and Pig bought it for me as a joint pressie. How cute? All weekend I've been saying how cute I think Pig is, and now Ian thinks I love him, and he's my new obsession! Anway... I was then greeted at church by my sister Lisa, who gave me £22! Which is pretty good for a sister like she is!  We went home, and we just videoed ourselves, it was well funny, until my Dad caught me smoking, oh the embarrassment!  The rest of the day is pretty blurry, we had tea, Ian was in hysterics because my Mum said that she used to go to Coffee mornings to drink orange juice... After that I went Tabby's, we were on teh internet, I made her friends with her friends, and I now have two more contacts! The darling also got me two Puddle Of Mudd albums and a Sophie Ellis Bextor album :D Oh I lvoe her. Got to go now bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Seeing as it's my birthday tomorrow, things are going quite well! I've fallen out with basically, alot of my mates! It's nice though, that the closest ones have stuck by me. Yesterday, when we went to the play, it was cool. Apart from the time when Nippsipuff threw me into a hedge with stinging nettles... I sat on them and it hurt my bottom!  The play was good, Tabby Baby was FaNbLoOdYtAsTiC! Charlotte said a line, it made me alugh so much! My laugh is both really loud and embarrassing! It was hard having to reduce my laugh... After the interval we went outside for a fag. Then we decided to go to Jax because Tabby Baby was no longer in any plays. The walk there was scary, we went by Pathfields. We arrived and they were playing the "Tramp's Breakfast" game.... Not much to say at that place, apart from Sam was very exited to see Gertrude... The lift back was great, or not! Came on the internet, then I went to sleep. It was good, it lasted 14 hours! I haven't slept that long for so long! Now I'm just on here, Sammy's called me a cow, surprise surprise. Oh well I'm sure I'll get over it, because I have a positive influence with life, and if their just gonna be pathetic like that, oh look she's online! Lets say some verbal abuse, then block her!!!  yep cuz your hardcore  Well yeah, Tabby Baby should be staying tonight because it's my last night as a 14 year old virgin, tomorrow it'll be my first night as a 15 year old virgin, well yeah... I have these ever so delightful sayings, which my sister told me, so here they are:   It's like a home from home, apart from the fact it hasn't got a pth....a garden....a fence.... or a toilet    I've been on these hormone tablets for 6 months now, and my nipples are like bullets    These children that you spit on, as they try to change their world's, are immune to your consultations; they are quite aware of what they're going through  I really do love that one!!!  and last, but by far not least, the one she made up herself...   Don't let the boundaries of tomorrow hold you back today, for they might disappear and leave you in I don't know...    If my life was a picture, would you paint it? If my life was a song, would you sing it? If my life was worth something, would you live it?  I just made that up, yus you can tell... but her's of course are  GREAT STUFF! Well this is gonna be the last time I write on here as a 14yr old virgin! I'M GONNA BE A 15YR OLD VIRGIN TOMOZ... Take care xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well Frankie came for me in the morning. We walked to school, was ok. We had a chat about "stuff". I miss not walking with her... First lesson was P.E, it was great fun, we were doing step aerobics. I love Hear'say! I can't add smileys because I'm at Nippsipuffs house. It was all good until Can't get you outta my head came on...grrr! Second lesson was business, once again I pressed the "reset" hoping that I wouldn't have to go back on, and the computer once again didn't come back on! Oh dear... At break I went with Corrin and had a fag Third lesson was food, Ben whipped me with a wet towel, it hurt! Fourth lesson was English. I'll have to out an "extract" of it on here, it's so funny! Jess once again ahd me in stitches. At lunch me, Nippsipuff and Tabby Baby went up to safeways, where Russell told us that Sammy said he didn't want him speaking to us, he doesn't want Russ to go as low as our level, how cute? Last lesson was Science, boring. Mr Bradbury full on went skitzipoos at me! It was well scary... I walked back to Nippsipuff's house, we are now on the net, no poo sherlock! Well I know this is pathetic, but Clur, I'm not the one leaving messages on a website, you started it. And the first time I went to safeways was with Sammy, so how do you work that out? I started hanging round with you and Tabby after. And it was me that wrote that pathetic message about Ian calling you a bitch on his blog, I thought you would take it as a joke, but you didn't so it's your loss. Also yeah Sammy may be a good friend, but I don't care LMAO I don't have any good comebacks. So do me a favor, and just ignore me, instead of making me leave lame excuses of why I don't like you. Bye everyone else but Clur (cuz I'm "pathetic",  I might aswell live up to her expectations...) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well just to rest this case, Clur, the only fact of me making you miss Tabby is that I introduced you to Sammy, I'm sure you can work out the rest by yourself. Maybe you should be the one staying by your friends, so stop making it out as if I'm the bad guy, you're not perfect, infact far from it. You call yourself a Christian, so what's with all the hate and slagging off?

      Well todays been another successful day! Woah! 2 days in a row, must be good! Frankie didn't get me, I was left walking to school by myself, I've never felt so lonely before!  urlLink    LMAO! Sorry... Well yeah, I got there, spoke to the usual DuDhIs, eg Corrin! It was pretty funny... First lesson was History, I was poopied because of the tension between Clur, we don't like eachother. But she didn't go. So I had fun with Daniel and Chris...or not!  Second lesson was maths, we were delighted with a maths test! It was well hard, like most people are nowadays (MY HUMOUR, HOW PATHETIC???) we kept drawing things on our "working out" paper, she draw Squorrels, they are soooooo funny! Len and Rik, if you read this, remind me to send you it! At break me and Tabby bought Munchimoos, then we went for a fag, where Corrin decided to tell everyone the jokes I ever so kindly wrote down for her... Third lesson was english, oh Jess makes me laugh!!!  urlLink    We were just reading the book again... Fourth lesson was science, Sammy came in saying all these things, it was quite disturbing. So after putting the tiddies in the petri dishes, me and Sammy wrote lyrics all over my science folder, for my birthday Tabby's making me Puddle Of Mudd, Come Clean, Oh I love her!!! It was a really hilarious lesson, can't write in detail, because it may seem offensive, but sure do I love this guy!!! At lunch, Me, Tabby Baby, Nippsipuff, Sammy and err Clur went up Safeways.  Tabby put Clur in her place, YOU GO GIRLFRIEND! It teaches her not to use her so-called friends  It was well funny, we were in the cafe and Sammy bought a big bottle of coke and he fizzed it up and aimed it at Nippsipuff, Nippsipuff panicked and tipped the bottle over, and it went all over the table and floor! So we all ran out of there, and Ian was like shouting: "Quick!We're going to be late!" It was soooooooooooooooooo funny! The way back wasn't that bad, they were still trying to trip me up though! Argipoos... We tried making Tabby faint, but it didn't work, then Tabby and Sammy started going Skitzipoos because they found loads of change on the floor, they even picked it up, then Samym put it in his pocket... then he breathed, then breathed out... Then when we were walking back into school, Sammy decided to use me as a shield, as Ian kicked puddles at him, thanks guys!   At form time Craig came in late, and we were like doing this weird thing with our tounges at eachother, don't ask! We used to be close, but now we're not in the same lessons  urlLink   . Well I walked him to his next lesson, and got a hug  urlLink   .  Last lesson was business. It was well funny, First of all we had to do this poster thing about Garages, so I panicked and wrote any random crap. Then I pressed the reset button by myself, Amy pressed hers, I laughed. Then because we didn't want to do work, everytime the computer seemed to come on, we pressed the reset button again, until when the computer didn't come back on... so we did nothing for the last 10 minutes, but laugh. I walked home with Frankie, and Nippsipuff has just introduced me to this really addictive game! So I must go play it, I'm listening to 80s music, how sad but yet very fun...  OMGIDDY AUNT DOODAH POOPY! I found out who the guy was, the one behind us when I was playing with my ass, JETHRO CROMPTON ...anyway Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well today's been pretty cool. I woke up just that little bit earlier so I could have breakfast  urlLink   . I'm in a really happy mood because 1, it's been a fanbloodytastic day and 2, I'm listening to "Walking On Sunshine" and I've just realised, it's nothing how me and Tabby sing it! Well went on the bus, sat next to Chrissy at the back, with water dropping on my head, I hate that bus! The journey seemed to take ages, we now go through Bideford, there was this really cute guy that came on today, then I noticed his jumper, and trousers, adn I came to the conclusion that he was gay... Well college was cool, I ended up only writing a paragraph and a menu thing for Sammy. We had music on through like the whole day, Chrissy kept putting on Blurry, because I love it, you would of thought it was predictable after the 3rd time, but it wasn't... Danielle yet again graffitied my leg, how fun? lol Waiting for the bus was yet again great fun. We were all standing around telling jokes, Anton kept laughing at my laugh, how embarrassing! On the bus Anton started sharpening his knives, it was scary! I got dropped off at Tabby's, may I add I'm listening to "I'm Walking On Sunshine"... yet again, it's such a feel good song!  urlLink    Well Rik and Leon finally have our letter! I really hope they write back, it'll be well cool! Me and Tabby went to Safeways, she brought fingers, and I bought the new green fanta, GREAT STUFF! We walked to Ian's, but it's his MoMmI's birthday, so he had to come out later, so we went to the "triangle" in Stratton. This man walked past, full on staring, it was irritating so I shouted to him: "It's ok! It's not alcohol..." To which Tabby found hilarious, after many moanings of our Bishop's popping out our pants, Ian finally came! So me and Tabby released our um... urlLink    , it was great! But the water in the toilet was white... We went back to the triangle thing, where I realised exactly how much fun you can have with yourself and a pole! Then we went to the park, where we sang many songs, yet again. When it came to walking Tabby home, it was great, apart from the fact that my bum was itching, due to it's hairiness. So we were walking back and I just couldn'y handle it, I had to do something, so I struggled with my panties, and Ian decided to shout really loudly "She's itching her ass" due to my most utter embarrassment, we had a stalker! So yeah, a man saw my ass... Then me and Ian started walking back, when my MoMmI pranked me for when  I was being picked up, Me and Ian decided to stand next to the pole, of which is the same height as me, I discovered this by standing next to it, with no shoes on. When I put them back on, to my utter horror, I looked at the ground which I was just standing on, and there was poop, smudged, but I came home, and it wasn't on my feet so I'm ok! I don't know why I wrote this, because it is so incredibly embarrassing! And I can't spell... It won't let me sign into Messenger, o poo! I like had to wrestle with my sister to get on here, well I'll write more tomorrow. Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well Frankie didn't bother getting me in the morning, so my MoMmI gave me a lift in the "banging" metro whilst listening to "Blazin Squad". I went into school, to see her there! She also got a lift... and wouldn't be walking home with me because she's staying over Michaela's, which is ok because I've got college tomorrow! Before first lesson Corrin kept chasing me with her wet coat and slapping it against my face, it was horrible! urlLink    First lesson was p.e. We did volleyball, it was ok, not that special. Second lesson was science, Sammy was being horrible to me, no change there, but it ended up being an ok lesson, I'm glad I make Russ laugh! About my masculinity... urlLink    At break I found Corrin and I stayed with her, it's my "new" thing to do at breaks, so I spend time with all my friends, I saw Chrissy, we talked about her presants, her necklace from her boyfriend is gorgeous! It's this huge crystal heart thing. urlLink    Third lesson was business. Miss wasn't there so I was just emailing everyone all lesson, even though I did do some work because I didn't wanna be behind when she came back. Fourth lesson was english. It was fun. I wrote another 2 pages for my novel, I'm gonna carry on writing it even when we no longer have to do it, I want to get money out if it! I'll tell you the main points:  Ian kills Len - eats him urlLink    Tabby kills Alexia - with a rock  urlLink   ...LMAO SORRY! Tabby and Ian fall in love  urlLink    Jess drugs Sammy  urlLink    Jess seduces Sammy urlLink    Sammy rips Letty's arm off urlLink    Air kills Letty urlLink    Air escapes  urlLink    Rik kills Sammy urlLink     Tabby, Jess, Rik, Ian and Pig live happily ever after   GREAT STUFF!  urlLink    At lunch, I met Ian, Tabby, Sammy and Clur. I don't know why she came with us, because she usually hates Ian, but it's probably because Sammy was coming with us because we had arranged it the night before. We went to Safeways, it was pretty cool, not the funniest, but pretty funny. But on the way back (hence the title) we decided to go the muddy way, in this time, Sammy decided to rugby tackle me when we came to a muddy bit, and so I ended up in the mud, it was dripping down my back and everything! I ain't exaggerating at all! I was literally covered! It was funny at first, but then when I got back to school Tilzey saw me, so I changed into my P.E kit, but he said I had to go home. So I rang my mum, she got me, I got cahnged at home, then Dad drove me back. I got 21% in the maths test, Sammy (I'm sorry if you didn't want it broadcasted over the internet) got a low mark too. So we might be moving down :(.   DROPS OF JUPITER IS PALAYING :D  I went to Tabby's after school, walked back, ate lots of chocken  urlLink   ( I know, I can't believe it either) and we are getting broadband, so that's all good. should be having a bath later to get rid of the mud. Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  urlLink

      Yeah, sorry bout the title, but it hurts!!! Well lets start the day off. My MoMmI woke me up and I really didn't want to go! I was just way too tired! But she brought me coffee, so I ended up waking up. Frankie got me and we walked to school. It was fun. First lesson was art. We're starting a new topic, so no more mess for my school uniform! We're now doing observational drawings, I'm so much better at this! We had to find a corner in the school and draw it...how fun??? But it was... Second lesson was history, pretty boring, Miss Davey reminded me about the detention, great! At break I went with Corrin for a fag. It was cool but yet extremely cold! So I went to see Frankie and the crew, then Frankie tried forcing some food down my throat, so I left her. And went to science. To my disappoitment, Sammy wasn't there. Third lesson, Science, boring, apart from getting Ben's number and Letty telling me about all the guys she pulled... Also I was nibbling on my pen when suddenly it slipped and went into my gum, it was bleeding...I had like tissue in my mouth all day! Fourth lesson: English, I missed half of it due to wanting to go home, but then I went back and was on a role to write a story, damn it's good! Its got me, Tabby, Leon, Rik, Ian, Alexia (she's made up), Air, Pig, Sammy and Letty. Ian's my brother and we all end up eating eachother :). At lunch me and Clur went to the detention. Me and Clur had to do these card thigns for Pop Idol, Jess Watson and Metal pole girl had to do a script thing, Daniel, Tom, Robert, Ben and James got to play cards with the YEAR 8S! But Tom, Kurt, Damo and Aron had to sing Barbie Girl and dance, it was incredibly cruel! I bought munchimoos Form Time: we played hangman, I went up many times, with the words: CHOCKENS, PANIC ROOM and erm... I think that's it, but it was fun!!! Last Lesson: I.T It was pretty cool, just emailing all my mates again. But pretty boring. I wlaked home, now I'm on here (obviously) and later I'm going out with Nippsipuff, Tabby Baby and Pigsipoos. Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Wow! I think this is the longest I've been before without blogging! I'm so sorry but Tabb's introduced me to this new site...lol. Well better do my day then, I woke up, lol, got dressed and stuff, told my MoMmI I was getting bullied so I would be able to get a lift, no such luck, what a caring mother I have! Well yeah.....so I walked to school, it was boring, I can't believe Frankie didn't call for me, I got to school late, then Lettie told me the reason why Frankie wasn't there. She'd gone to see Blazin Squad with Jess Bate, but they didn't tell me because they'd thought I'd be jealous :|. Oh yeah! Cuz I can see my passion for the Blazers....  Well we had extended form time, so we were all generally chatting, my frined Michaela, she's sooooooo tiny! Corrin was joking around calling her anorexic, and that she had to go to the doctors because everytime she ate she felt sick, Michaela ran out of the room crying, she's just so sweet! I really hope she hasn't got anorexia.  Well form time came to an end, like all good things (sarcastic comment) then I went to my r.e lesson, where Alex decided to desert me again, :|. I sat by myself, writing continuously, it was er...boring?  Second lesson was art, we all had a go at Sir, when I say we I actually mean Anna and Sam. Yesterday Sam said my eyes looked esexy   At break LMAO! Me, Clur, Tabb and Jess met up then went to teh usual sitting/singing corner, and we held a sign asking for money, we raised 10p in the end! We even sang Baa Baa Black Sheep on behalf of Monkey/Pig boy's request. The song we sang the most though was Blink 182 - Miss You.  Third lesson was business, half way thorugh the fire bell went off, so I panicked and shut down all my stuff...without saving :@. Pretty boring lesson, Jodie was out the room most of the time, so I couldn't laugh at her eyes :P.  Fourth lesson was Science. It was cool..I got 10 stamps :D. It's because I kept getting answers right, back of the net! It was a pretty poopy lesson, I made my page into rainbow colours though! We left early, got told off, went back, came out.  At lunch me and Tabb went down spar and bought munchimoos, where we were greeted with Adrian John, Adrian John's new car and Bruiser   Last lesson was History, I found it hilarious! But Clur had much Bov, so much Bov infact that she used the word :O. And she also fell asleep...Well yeah, it was the end, and I walked home all by myslef, but the bastarded golferoonies diverted me a different direction, so I ended up walking past Meadow Drive :|, I got home, had roast (but with bacon ;)) Now I'm on here.  It's been great writing on here again, so tomorrow...(college!) Toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

MoMmI gave me a lift to school because of the History trip, it was illegal for me to go due to a consent form I didn't hand in...but I went anyway... it started off raining, the day was pretty poopy, me and Clur tried to pass the time by making words from the cars lisense plates, adn panicing quite often! Well yeah, because it was raining we had to go back to school, we was tehre for third lesson, English...just what I wanted.. :|  It was poo....  Fourth lesson was science, it was well funny! I was tickling Sammy's knee, trying to give him an orgasm...it didn't work, I've recently cut my nails :(, so better luck for tomorrow :)  At lunch I went safeways, was pretty poopy, and wet...  Last lesson was business, it was great :|  Came home, should be going out later, see what happens Toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well today's been cool, no more scary dreams! Lol. MoMmI woke me up at 8:00, brought me coffee, then as I waited for something, I fell asleep, till half eight, then I got a lift and Frankie told me about her calling for me but nobody answering! Lol...oops! First lesson was only half,a s we had extended form time, this was cool, because me and Craig got talking, struth do I miss him! We were getting on just like old times, and I sure do miss them times! Well I went to the remainder of my lesson, which wa rugby, after putting on about 5 layers of clothing, we went out, and it was fun...after I'd been hit on the face with one of the balls, then Miss being hit :P, well yeah, we got to tackle eachother! I got Tabby on the floor...once, she got me many times though :(, then we all rushed back inside because it was raining....back of the net! Secind lesson was science, it was cool, we were supposed to do work about farms, but we didn't! Me and Sammy were just occupied with stabbing my science book with compasses, drawing Daniel's family tree, and talking about old/random cartoons.  At break I went down donkey with Tabby and we had a little dream...went back to school for a great session of Miss Welham...  Third lesson...was with Miss Welham, it was pretty boring, well yeah, nothing els eot say about that. Fourth lesson was english, once again it was poopy, perv shouted at Jess, once again, didn't do coursework :S  At lunch, Tabby failed to meet me, so I attached myself to Michaela and Jade, they decided to stop and talk to Paula, so I went with Lucy, Stacey and Amanda, then I saw Lettie, who had fags :P, so I went with her, it was kinda ok, but they were scaring me with their lesbianisms.  Last lesson was maths, it was pretty funny because Tabby was dreaming, and talking a laod of random things! I discovered I had a mild case of Skitzophrenia...with Bob...and Not Bob. Sir also decided to open the window (even thought it's really ever so chilly down Cornwall), because he wanted to: Change the air Then Clur just randomly said, amy I add this was in a maths lesson, Wow! I really have to run!  Well yeah...kinda weird, went Tabby's after school, then we went Pig's, accompained by Bo, then we had a dreaming session, while playing a lame game involving a flat netball ball, then we found Da, then Olly....I bought munch then went home, now I'm on here, tired and wanting to sleep...with College to look forward to tin teh morning...or not!

      I dunno why that's a title....but it is! The weekend was boring, I didn't have a fag Friday and Saturday, then Nips came round Sunday, so yeah!  Last night I couldn't get any sleep! I finally managed to sleep around 4, then I woke up at quarter past 7 due to a bad dream...it was sooooooooooo horrible! Have you seen Erin Brokovich? Well it was that dude/the blonde one from Britney's toxic video, then there was two kids, a blond girl and a blond guy. The man was sitting on this small wooden frame, which was ontop of a rockery. The kids were telling me about their little baby sister, she'd been taken. Then I looked at the floor...and there was this shawl kinda thing, I picked it up...and said, What's this? The man just ran off... I shouted call the police! As from what he was sitting on was a bag...I lifted it up, and there was the baby, all water logged with blood dripping...I went in to the mother, and told her. She came out...grabbed the baby by the arm and said : This won't be good for my skitzophrenia... as she walked in the house. You just saw the babies head tilt to the side... it was so horrible! Water was pouring from it, and so was blood. I couldn't handle it! Well yeah...Frankie came for me in the morning, was a nice walk to school.  First lesson was Art, Anna didn't go, I think me and Lettie were being immature, but you know...you only live once!   Second lesson was history, alot of work, I need to hand in my slip so I can go to Stratton, so yeah, that lesson was pretty poopy.  At break, I told almost everyone my dream...well I dreamt of a dead baby, it isn't normal!  Third lesson was science, me and Lettie had a laugh, we was writing to Sammy all the way through it, Lettie's found some old photos of me...nice! So I er....went to the opticians and ate....  Fourth lesson...opticians  At lunch, I went down Bencoolen Park with Tabby, Jenny and Loz :|, pretty poopy.  Last lesson was i.t, it was fun, but not as usual fun. Dunno why though. I'm going to Alton Towers April 24th, I'm excited and so's my crew! It's like a little reunition - is that a word? I meant reunion :$.  Well toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well, I wrote loads yesterday, but my computer decided to take up the role of being a naughty chocken, and rested :|, so this is gonna be quite a long one! Let's see...Yesterday I walked to school by myself, Frankie had to get her wages, so it was reasonably ok, just a little weird to be by myself. In the morning I got 2 parcels, one was a Goo Goo Dolls from my larvely sister Monica, cheers hunny,a and another one was a huage advertisement for a Seat Leon.  I got to school, forgetting it was Corrin's birthday, then when Michaela did the whole, *cough cough nudge nudge* thing, I started singing to her.  First lesson was maths, it was well cool. On Tuesday night, me and Clur were on audio conversation, it was hilarious! So we had a really good laugh this lesson, Tabby Baby was naughty and was moved to the back, so me and Clur managed to break my calculator (we decided to because it had frozen for quite a long time), then fix it again, and then it worked :D Also, I told Tabby about the whole pirate conversation thing, she said:  "Why couldn't I be added? It's because I don't like frigging the rigging isn't it?" ...it had me in hysterics! Tabby has a pretty pink piece of paper, it's one of those things....Sammy walked past Sir, I said: he's taller than you! Sir: Yes, most people are! Me: I'm not *winks* I found out, Air has art :D.  Second lesson was History, it was hilarious! I can't remember why now...but it was funny! We're going to Stratton on 25th March.  At break I went up top with Lettie and Anna for a gaf, it was okay, I felt a bit out of place though!   Third lesson was food, it was cool, Lettie came to it, I'm glad she's coming back to more lessons. Pretty slack lesson, did hardly anything. But I wrote these down... Miss Menlove-Platts christian name is Demelza, but because Lettie's just teat tad bit ditzy, I told her it was Dildo, she believed me!   Ben: "Is it Salmonella?" Miss: "No...that's chicken and eggs." Me: "I know! Is it Salmonella?" Miss: "No...."    Miss: "Why are chef's clothes white?" Me: "To see bacteria!"   Fourth lesson was Business, it was ok, at the beginning I was laughing, because of what happened last lesson, I really did find it hilarious! Them Miss started saying about everyone's grades, she's constantly trying to set me the same work as Desra, then I do it, then she doesn't mention that I could get far, just Desra, Metal Pole Girl and maybe Lisa. But then at the end of the lesson, she apolagised because she forgot I was there :|  At lunch, wow!  It was soooooooooo funny! Finally, after like, 4 days, me and Sammy went off for lunch, it started off well, it was raining, then we started laughing at something, which I actually can't remember! When we got there, I remember Sammy calling Robert Medland greedy, he had many bags of sweets. Then we bought a stick of bread, and Sammy tormented the lady who always has a nervous breakdown...about balloons. Then for some random reason, Sammy had to smack this guy's head with the bread... Then we sat in the cafe bit, and there was this baby sitting next to us, and it kept staring at Sammy...then when we laughed, so did it! Coming towards the end of lunch, it's Grandad came, and said: "Have you ate all your dinner... bla  bla bla..." You know, in that patronising voice? Me and Sammy looked at eachother and just couldn't stop laughing. So we left... on the way back, I tripped up :|  Last lesson was science, with Bradders, it was ok, I managed to sit next to Sammy, for about...5 seconds. I got moved, then me and Sammy were sending notes to eachother, and somehow Sammy had to leave, today he told me that Sir had raised his fist at him, I'll get the exact details another time, but he is sooooooooooooooo gonna get done!   I walked home by myself, stayed in, pretty poopy night.  I got a lift to school, it was pouring it down. Arrived at school, went down Donkey with Tabby and Frankie, had a gaf then we headed back up to school, that was when I noticed Tabby Baby had a hairy bottom.  First lesson was science, it was funny, my school computer has now mucked up! Me and Sammy showed Lettie the badger website, she found it mildly amusing. Then whilst she was rating people on hot or not, me and Sammy were on this er...website, it was....different! But cute and funny....  Second lesson was r.e, Jess replaced Alex, it was an ok lesson, Miss wondered why I was so quiet, it was sweet, she's more like a friend than a teacher, I can't believe I just said that....... Lol! Jess said this REALLY loud..: Why does everyone where etnies? They're sucha  dated shoe...I couldn't stop laughing, you should see the amount of people that wear them!  At break I went into the hall, I think Air saw me staring at him, oops! I was just with Clur, it was conversatinaless, lol, is that a word? I hugged her, and it seemed as though she was gonna cry :(, I've never seen her like that before!  Third lesson was maths, it was funny, really funny! Mr Register was bending over,  and his ass was in Clur's face, Tabby came out with:  Isn't Clur the lucky one?  Then I heard a big bang, I jumped, and it turned out to be Lee Bickle banging his head on the table, then Tab attempted to... Then I noticed this HUAGE bogey (bright green too!) In Mark Hollingshead's nose, so I told Tabby, she urged, I told Clur, she said: Yes...thanks..., I told Sammy: eugh! That's gross.......then there's little immature me, laughing hysterically. Then...eugh! He wiped his hand against his nose, and it stretched! Then the next thing you know, he's gone to the toilet, and then, when he comes back, it's gone... Then I came up with the ever so larvely design of the game: Do you think he knows? LOL!   Fourth lesson was food, dude! This lesson was sooooo funny! Miss was using the cooker's as heaters, how cute! Lettie had me in stitches. She told me loads of jokes, here's some of them: A man gets a phonecall from school saying that his son has been caught wanking in school. The dad goes home and goes upstairs... Dad: Son! Did you know that if you wank too much it can make you blind? Son: Dad....I'm over here!  A man comes to the doctors Man: I keep getting this bad rash over my face Doctor: Oh! I had it last week, what I did was rub it in my wife's fanny, it works! Man: Oh thank you!  *one week later*  Doctor: I see it has worked! Man: Yes, thanks. And by the way, I like your house!  Man #1: That man over there is claiming to of been in your class at school... Man #2: That's funny, I don't remember a man who's bald with a beard in my class...  What do you call a sheep strapped to a lamppost in Wales? A Leisure Centre  There was a man, stranded on a desert island, for a very long time. Then a man said... Man: I bet you were hungry Desert Man: Yes Man: I bet you were thirsty Desert Man: Yes Man: I bet you were horney Desert Man: Yes, but I overcome this problem :D Man: How? You were stranded by yourself for so long... Desert Man: Yes, but once, I saw an Ostrich with it's head in the sand... Man: Didn't it feel weird? Shagging an ostrich? Desert Man: Well yes, it did for teh first 120 yards, after that I lost step!  At lunch, I went down spar with Tabby Baby, it was fun...eating.  Last lesson was history, it was good, me and Clur had laughs, with her furry folder :D, we're going on a trip soon :D  Well now, that just took me soooooooooooooo long to write! Well dunno what I'm doing tonight, I'll probably get dreaming *hopefully*   Toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been ok. Frankie got me in the morning, we walked slowly to school as she thought she was going to pass out. She was actually really doing my head in! She just never shuts up! I feel like such a bitch now! It's always: Do I look different today? Do you think my make up looks better? And it's just like...ARG! Well we finally got to school...we had form time for 20 minutes at the beginning, so me and Russ had a long chat, he's going to be performing Blurry for the Union, not next week but the week after...I'm so excited! He says I have to scream...but I doubt I will!  Well that soon came to an end, so i went to the remaining 40 minutes of my R.e lesson, me and Alex had a chat, it was cool, he showed me this er...lovely poem on his phone: Man: If I keep pinching your breasts, there will be no need for your bra :) Woman: Oh! And if I keep pinching your penis, there'll be no need for the milkman. I found it quite amusing...... Oh...and I asked him how to spell "throw"...he answered back with: Twat... Second lesson was Art, it was funny, Tom had dreamer stuff on him, it was quite amusing as Sir had fihured this out, and we could smell it..it was rather funny. Anna was doing weird things with her plaits......... At break me and Tabby stared at Da and Air...I got Clur to get me 2 turkey burgers :D I consumed them...then went to my business lesson :| Well it started off good...this random year 7 had touched Deesray's shoulder... it got me in the gigglymood! It was quite funny...you had to of been there! Then when we inside, we had to do typing tests,  there's this girl called Jodie, and she's a bit err...you know! And she asked Desra something, and Desra looked at her like really sympathetically! Jodie's eyes turned to me......they looked hilarious...searching for an answer...me and Desra just turned our heads...LMAO! Then me and Desra went to speak to eachother and Desra said the most funniest thing to me! She said:   Did you understand any of that?   LMAO! I was laughing all the way through the lesson! It was hilarious! I'm laughing now! And then you saw Miss trying it on with Ryan...it's disturbing! Fourth lesson was science, we had good old bradders! I managed to sit next to Sammy, until he told me to look at Rob's crotch...it was HUAGE! I was in fits..it was in an awkward position..so I got moved :(  At lunch, me and Sammy were waiting for ages for Tabby and Clur, on the wait...Air hugged me! Ok...that's an over statement...he said hi! Ok....he smiled...oh! You got me...HE NODDED HIS HEAD! Wel yeah.I went down Donkey Lane with Tabby Baby, it was pretty poopy, I need fags! Lol. In lunch form time Sir was saying about Work Experiance placements, Russ said that he wanted to work with Mr Bradsley's Wife :| It was funny at the time! Last lesson! LMAO! It was history.......I've never laughed so much! Lol...I managed to write down some of the funny things...so bare with me!  The woman thing... ...Metal Pole Girl describing the ever so great tranvestite dentist, who lives in Stratton  :|  Sanddunes ...LMAO! Miss said that Bude was a pile of sanddunes...I found it hilarious...  Hello I'm Bob! ...I did an impression of a fish with my candy stick :D  Hello I'm bald! ...I tried to find out what Bob sounded like..Miss then butted in and started to talk to us about our fondness of talking to our machines! Like screaming at computers, confessing love to guitars...or you could be like Clur's mum.... and say thank you to vending machines .. :| LMAO I think it's sooooooooo cute! Can you imagine that? "Thank you" Awwwwwww! Then Jess Martin :| Came out with:  I don't know where I live!  Umm...ok! And of course....

First lesson was art, I need to hand in my other piece of heiroglyphics homework, otherwise I'll have an afterschool detention, oh dear! It was a funny lesson, Luke er......was making strange noises, it sounded like a squorrel/dolphin, then he came out with this:  How do dolphins and rats fuck? With a leaf  It may not seem funny to you! But hell it was hilarious to me! Second lesson was english, saw Jess had recovered nicely! Lol. Perv shouted at her again, I really do hate him!

Sir drew on my hand :| me and Sammy did the usual, no work. He told me about the song he had made up, it was hilarious, then we tried one........but it didn't work! Lol Fourth lesson was badminton. It was great! Because there was only 16 people we did this thing, we had to try to win a cup. We had to go in couple's then play against eachother, me and Tabby lost against Frankie and Nicola, so we had to play in the "loser" game, for the plate. Well me and Tabby kicked ass, and sure as hell! We won :D. Then we played the cup winners and lost, 6-1. At lunch, I went with Michaela and Frankie, it was ok. Managed to talk to Kurt about teh whole "Air" situation going on, Little Miss Sexy Detective has worked a few things out ;) At form time it was hilarious! There's this guy called Barry, who no one likes, Sir had to read him something out and it went like this: LMAO!  Sir: Barry Random person: IS GAY! Sir: You've got to go to... Random person: A FIT FARM  Last lesson was maths, I sure do have ALOT of things written on my arm........so here it goes!  Peedlepoo .......what Tabby said  Its a kite..ITS A RHOMBUS ....Sir said it's a kite..but it was blaitently a kite!

She answered with....you'd break it :|   I heard Russell's eyes light up .........a brainer of a comment from Mr Register.

      School was cool, went home to Tabby's house. We got ready, then went to Jade's, I felt awkward because I don't usually hang out with them, so I only knew Jess and Tabby! We went to Safeways, then back to Jade's where we ate, danced and drank. We then went out, supposed to be going into Bude, but we didn't make it! And we ended up staying at some random persn's house, at this time Tabby had managed to kiss most of the party, infact all the party apart from Jade and Roxy, so basically she had kissed  Kayley Jess Sarah L Sarah B Emily Olivia Me  Then this random guy who walked past, called  Ben  Then when we got to the house, she kissed Kayleys boyfriend  Brad , but Kayley said it was alright. Jess spewed all over herself, I saw Letty, Alana, Hollie and Rich, so I said hey.  We then went into Bude, went down Budelight adn saw Nips and his crew, Tabby pulled  Wilson . Then I walked home, then she came back to mine.  Bov for writing everything, but I think I've found a not so much new love fo my life! Toodle xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well today's been well cool. Because I now have broadband, I got a bit carried away last night and stayed on until half 11, so at midnight I had a shower! Then I slept....  Frankie came for me in the morning, then we headed out on our expedition to school, it was ever so chilly! We got there late, so I had to stand by the door, which was embarrassing because my hair was all over the place, and people laughed because that's how hardcore my form group is.  First lesson was history, which was great because me and Clur got to talk, and have a laugh.   Second lesson was maths, I thought it was great, but there's tension between Clur, Tabby and Mr Register, I discovered Sir loves the Cha Cha Slide, so I sang it to him, he told me to shut up :(  At break, I went to the hall with Tabby Baby and we bought munchimoos, I met up with Jess and we headed off to English together.  English was great! We had to go to a separate room and we talked through th script, I'm Simon, which has been feminised to Simone, oh we have such great imagination! In this lesson Jess decided to ask Chang whether he had a small penis, then he asked why and she said that I told her :|, everyone knows that the average size of a Chink's cock is 3 inches! Ask Nips...he seems to be the expert. Jade Morgonator told me that she liked my eyeshadow...nice!  Fourth lesson was science, it was hilarious! Sammy discovered Dabiel's  "Uno-Brow" , he's drew a diagram of it in my book, it's hilarious! Don't ask why...but we work in eachother's books...this is what I recently discovered is what he wrote in my book:   It's often important to know the real size of things through the microscope structure is needed when measuring Daniel's thing. When you look down teh microscope at Daniel's fing, you would have to clamp your mouth together incase you cry with laughter abd get a log sheet from Mr Ryan. It is nessesary to use the most magnifying lense you can find, because of the small siza of his thing. Please do not view this specimin enless you have a strong stomach   :|  He also decided to pick at my trousers with a compass...loose threads are everywhere...then he started on my jumper...  At lunch me and Tabby Baby went to Safeways, it was extremely chilly, we sat in and got chips, then we went back to see Luke with the ever so famous fart machine.  Last lesson was Business, pretty poopy, I HATE MY COMPUTER, it resets, then doesn't come back on, then when it does, it doesn't load the screen properly...GREAT STUFF!  Got a lift home with Frankie, it started snowing, later I'm going out with Nippsipuff and Pig, I'll write more tomorrow, or I won't...I'm going to Jade's party  Toodle xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well today's been one of many fine days. I stayed round Corrin's last night, I then discovered how great is actually is to be single. Me and Corrin stayed in her Mum's bed. It was great...  We woke up nice and early for college, met Chrissy and went off to the bus...the journey was long, but since when hasn't it been? We got there...the usual poopy kind of stuff. I've finished my ssignment, and it needs to be typed up. So I will do it. I've also got a photo of me with hair...I traded the other one of me with Danielle's pic. It's great...she's now on my wallet...and will soon be on my wall.  After college I went to Nips, where we moved his computer and had kebabs, I ate his...  We went to Pig's and it was great...shooting a penguin...I could do it the furthest, being on webcam, oh the life of being a teenager! I think me and Pig gto on really well today, great stuff.  Well nothing else to report apart from the ever so relaxing journey home with Nips in his ever so lovely car listening to Queen, struth I sure did feel good!  I'll DEFINATELY write more tomorrow Toodle xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well I just wrote loads and it just deleted it...but hey! Put a smile on your face and everything will be alright. Well as I've already written...I'm just missing everyone. I just really hate what I've become, it's breaking my heart to see all my friends grow up and move on, I feel like i'm the one being left behind, I don't ever want to stop the friendship we have, I suppose I have Peter Pan-Syndrome! I guess I just love them so much! I never wanna let them go! So here's a personal note, to all of my group, don't be offended if you're not mentioned, it just means I don't love you :P   Letty  Babe! I love you so much! You're without a doubt probably the one I'm most closest too. I just can't stand to see you hurting. I hope you know I would do anything for you, you're family is mine, I just miss you all so much! It's just it seems like I'm only with you when you have no one else to call. I just don't want to only be your friend in that way, I respect you so much than that. Please babe, you don't realise how much I need you right now.    Frankie  You're always there for me, I suppose it's because I brought you to the group, I love you! Lol, that's pretty much all I have to say, I wanna say thank you, it seems as thought you're the only one who seems to bother with me nowadays, and I never wanna say goodbye to you.  Well thats just about it for tonight! LMAO! Yeah I know but Clur's come online, and I've missed her!lol, well I'm gonna talk to her, because I respect and love her xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxnow go talk to your friends lol! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Hey...sorry I can't keep you up to date quite as often as I used to...but life had finally catched up with me, and it's bad!    Wednesday  I didn't go to college, because the whole nation (apparantly) had  a test, so I had to do it. School was ok, after I went to Letty's house, watched the videos when we were singing to Avril Lavigne, it was scary! Because it was Alana's birthday yesterday we had cake :D, I had about a quarter of it...I felt sick! Then I met up with Pig and Nips, we went to Bude, I'm so freaked out by how much they spend on gambling machines, they could of won soooooo many 20ps that night, but no! They had to settle with the jackpot...*tuts* I went back to Letty's house, I must admit, hey boyfriend is definately one of my favs!    Thursday (today!)  Woke up, walked to school with Letty, then sat down in form, to see Kristie was at school, so Letty deserted me. But I was happy to see an ever so lovely looking Tabby Baby.   First lesson was Maths, it was ok, apart from Sir pointed out that all last night when I was studying really hard on "maths coursework" I'd done the wrong bit :|. So I have to do the RIGHT one tongiht for tomorrow, but I am d=gonna do it, for him I'd do anything ;).  Second lesson was History, Clur decided to fianlly come, but then she desrted me again :(, she had guitar practise, or is it practics? I dunno...ask Mrs Welham  At break me and Tabby Baby went to the hall, I got a quid off Tilzey and bougth a pasty :D, great stuff  Third lesson was food, I actually behaved! I did all my work, I 've worked very hard today, I'm so proud of myself! And today...me and Ben...DID NOT FIGHT :O  Fourth lesson was business, it was mildly amusing because Ryan sat next to me, he's fOoNy.  At lunch...LMAO! Me and Tab were moneyless, fagless and had knowhere to go, and nothing to do...so we just like, pestered round everyone, it was highly boring...lol  Last lesson was science, I was pissed with Letty, but hey, I'll get over it, Bradders got rab...again. It was, yet again, mildly amusing.  I got a lift h ome with Frankie, I sooooooooooooooo overpower her!  Frankie: Jess you aren't getting a lift  Me: Yes I am Frankie: No your not Jess:Yes I am! It goes on like that for ages... then when her Mum's there, I cower and decide to finally agree with Frankie, and I walk...then Frankie calls me over to the car, it's like that everyday, I wouldn't change it for the world...yeah I'm sad...but I love life!  Well meeting Tabby Baby and Pig tonight, probably Nippsipuff aswell...depends how he feels.  Toodle xxxxxxxxxxx

      Well it deleted my Sunday entry, which was just the usual really, we went to church, went swimming, saw a guy who was a little hairier than usual, went to Jax, thats about it!   Monday  First lesson was Art, pretty cool. Asked Letty about her asking my SISTERS BOYFRIEND TO SLEEP WITH HER!! Apparantly it isn't true, but why would he lie about it???  Second lesson was English, we watched more of the film, getting good! Well not really...but hey!   At break we went down Donkey, Tabby didn't come to school, so I spent the day with Letty.  Third lesson was Science, I was able to sit next to Sammy (finally!) we had to do stuff with this bacteria, and I stupidly touched my belly button with it, so I'll probably growing hair out of it!  Fourth lesson was p.e, we did Badminton, it was great, I managed to get a shuckcock, and it's on my bedroom windowsill :D  At lunch I went up to Safeways with Letty, Kristie and Anna, which was weird because they've all kissed eachother!" Actually to clear the record... KRISTIE DID NOT PULL ANNA! It was alright, but I didn't feel as though I fitted in, but hey!  Last lesson was maths, it was ok, apart from I was getting scared about the whole "Clur and Sammy throwing pencils at eachother" thing...Sirs ass was looking great though!   I got a lift off Frankie (in the end!!!) and I went into my house, and did nothing. I tidied a bit of my room, watched "Three's a crowd" thing, Finn was sooo fine!   At night, Karen greeted us with the Finding Nemo dvd, GREAT STUFF :D:D:D:D:D   Tuesday  Todays been ok... Frankie came for me in the morning, Mum wouldn't give me a lift, so I took the car keys with me, so she couldn't go anywhere...  First lesson was R.e, but we had extended formtime, which was pretty poopy, because my nose kept stinging for some reason and I couldn't stop sneezing! ...After 20 minutes I went to R.e, for once, BOTH ME AND ALEX LAUGHED, we were talking about teh Simpsons, he actually enjoyed my company! Do you know how happy thatmakes me feel? How desperate do I sound????  Second lesson was art, it was funny! We were decorating our pathetic excuse of a folder (it's paper folded in half :|) well yeah, Sam tried drawing a mouse, then this happened...  Anna: That looks like those sugar mice things! Sam: Oh yeah! The ones made outof chocolate  Um...no Sam! The ones made of sugar....  At break me and Letty went down donkey, had a fag, went back for thired lesson  Third lesson was business, it was ok, but pretty boring.  Fourth lesson was science, I really wanted to go skitz, dunno why though! There were pickled snails and pickled frogs at the back, it was gross! Kayleigh had a fart machine, it was really funny, Sir kept looking at us really disgustedly!  We kept running out of the lesson aswell...but I got my work completed...so I'm a good girl really :p.  At lunch I went with Letty and Anna....pretty poopy  Last lesson was Hostory...was ok.  Got a lift home with Frankie. Enough said.   Toodle xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Umm...not much else to say really, just that Poo and Crap's singing on the way back was very entertaining. Oh yeah! I got a huage Piglet balloon which was great, and still is! It's on my ceiling, it's helium so that would make sense! Well I'm not gonna spend all my time on the computer (I'm not that lame) and I'm gonna go out and sunbathe because it's so bloody hot! But not yet, lol, my parents are having a barbeque and that would just be embarrassing! Someone decent come online. ARG! Lol, I'm gona have to occupy myself with downloading music, but what??? I've downloaded 5cds worth already! And I now have no idea what to do and I have been reduced to listen to Reel Big Fish - Take On Me, I really should delete it, I prefer A1's...yeah...should I ring Len? Or would that just be lame? Or perhaps embarrasssing? I will later, I think, yes I will, but it will be scary....arg! Jess, you can do it *takes big breaths* well yes,  Well that is all Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well, you can tell I'm back at school! Todays been cool. I showed off my hair, and I was delighted to see Lucy's aswell, it's brown! Lol, for the first time in...her life! First lesson was history, it was cool, not so much hardcore work to do, but I have to do chapter 6, so I'll do that. Second lesson was maths, it was ok, very easy work, finally I understand it!!! It was quite fun, Sammy is looking sexier than ever! Lol, he's tanned and...*drools...*  At break we printed off Tabby's work, and I didn't want to go to English, I was by myself and I gte ignored, it was a rational explanation, although I didn't tell Sir that, I said I had period pains :P, oh the joys of being of being female! So I managed to skip about 10 minutes of his lesson, and got a hot water bottle! The lesson wasn't actually that bad. I got my anthology book, we looked at this poem, which was kinda suicidal, we had to go in partners and discuss it, but of course, Sir didn't even notice my existance, and I worked on my lonesome. I worked well though. It was a good poem, but an even better interpretation :P.  Fourth lesson was great, me and Sammy were full on chatting, and I found my homework diary! YEY! Sammy was saying that he missed me on holiday, apparantly there were things that reminded him of me, like car sized chockens! Lol, he's so great! And to think, that was teh only hour of just us two for 3 weeks, he's going to Wales tomorrow :(. This is his MoMmI's site, go on it, it's great  urlLink  . I managed to get a hug too, :D. DUDE! I love him.  At lunch me, Clur and Tab went up to Safeways, it was cool, Tab was extremely paranoid, but that's how things are! YEY! Going to Alton Towers Saturday, I'm so excited!  Last lesson was Business, it was shit. Me and Desra had a laugh though, Luke got caught playing games and he was in deep poopy. Well that's a;; to say. A fanbloodytastic day today, the weather is ever so delightful. Well yes, that's all I got to say, I'll probably sray in tonight, Tab's reuniting with her family, after a month :D.

      Well I'm sorry for not writing for well, a long time! I've actually been occupied...so I'll list through the days I haven't wrote about...  Today  Well, Tab stayed over last night, we stayed up till about 4, due to her playing that damn:  "I get that joke..Amanda...hehehe.."  I WAS SLEEPY OK!!! Well yeah, I was woken up to my DaDdI playing Fatman Scoop :|. It worked! I was up by 11! I've stayed most of today on here, I've tidied a bit of my room up, it was a state, so now all the poopy that was on the floor, is now on my bed! I also er...caught up on my knitting...but ssh! Lol, I came back on here and have been downloading some more tunes, hence the title! Lol, I've just had a conversation with Rik, he said I'm a legend! Lol, Tab, I'll tell you next time your orund, cuz I can!   Tuesday  This was a very funny day lol, I woke up at 3, rang Tab, told her she was staying over, washed my hair then went to her NaNnI's. Clur rang me on the way so I met her, and we walked up together. We did all our hair, then went into Bude and bought Gaf's. Then we sat up the Union talking about loads of great stuff. Sorry, I'm listening to "My Heart Will Go On" and it's making me feel emotional, so Clur and Tab!  I LOVE YOU!!!  Well yeah, we met up with Josh and Gary, we went on a really long treck, because Tab wanted to be symmetrical :|, then we went to the graveyard and was laughing at dead people (I'm sorry, but we're immature) there was a dude called Archibald, and someone else called Cobbledick. It was a fun night, Clur went, we stayed out with Josh and Gary, then we went, watched City Of Angels, Tab cried (bit not because of the film :S), then we came up with these:  Please! Not the cheese! I do not wish for wish Thrust anyone thrust?    Monday  Lol, I woke up, got changed into a pink skirt, pink top with matching thongs and socks, put my make up on and went on the internet. I spoke to Pig and he said how he was going out to meet Bo, so I said: O! I'll look out the window and wave to him!" He was there, then I went out with them, we walked, I sat, walked some more, sat some more....Bo went in, Tab came out, then we went back home. I think I did nothing else but go on the internet till early hours in the morning.   Sunday  Um...I think it was a day when I just randomly stayed in, I think this was the day i watched Randall and Hopkirk, it was cool...I ate chocolate :D   Saturday  Me and Tab rearranged my room, it was er...fun! LMAO Where's Waldo? I love the Simpsons! I was like full on having a nervous breakdown (I always do when I'm rearranging my room) and I looked at Tab, and she was there looking at my Where's Wally book! The cheek of it! Not that I have a Where's Wally book... 2 weeks of being married to Harry!   Friday  It was very cool! I called for Tab, she got fags, we went back to mine, watched Home Movies, Clur came, we left to meet Josh and Gary. It was a very cool day, shame Gary didn't speak much though. But I'm sure he will in future meetings! Lol, I guess he was scared! Josh was all over Tab, his new nickname is Loby, he has soft earlobes! And soft everything! That night was so good! We were in Bude and he doesn't get on with Pieface! LMAO! We were holding his Phillangies all night (Me and Tab) and Danny was being nicce to me, I think, which was different. Then I lost my fags, found Pig adn his crew, Air was hiding from me, I found my fags, they were where I "de-thonged" myself,w e went back to Bude, that was when Josh and Gary had gone, and we were talking to Pig and that. We left soon after Mon did, I wonder why! Lol  Well that is all! My arm aches from typing! Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Well yes, I'm going to write about my hardcore dream, because I can! Well yeah, I woke up forgetting about it, but just now I've had flashbacks, so I'll write about it. I don't have a clue why, but I was walking through school with Da, Air and Mon, and Air let me wear his hat, so I did, loads of people were just staring at me, I remember shouting: C'MON MON! Lol, I don't know why, then when I had to stop at my form room, I tried to take the hat off, but there was string holding it under my neck :S, and I now realise why he wears it all the time, it's sooooo comfortable! But the thing that made me definately realise that it definately was a dream, was that they were laughinh, and actually having fun with me! Lol, yes... Last night I met up with Lettie, saw the photos family, I look cute, as in 10 year old cute, then i met up with Tabb and walked her to her NaNnIeS house, we had lemonade, listened to something on her phone, watched a bit of 2DTV, then I walked home. I saw Kurt and his hardcore crew, he said I look female :|.   Well yes, nothing else to write, apart from tabb is due to the dentist today, and LEN! Hurry up! I stayed ont he internet so late last night just in order for you to come online, AND YOU NEVER DID! So get your ass in gear! Yes.......I haven't had nicotine for about 36 hours now :|  Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well did next to nothing today, woke up about 8 to my sister recieving a phone call about a remote control, she then decided to leave the room, with westlife still playing.....:| I hate sharing rooms! I should be blaring good old Goo Goo Dolls and Nirvana at highest volume from my bedroom.......anyway! Yes, I got up, got ready, tried to listen to Lisa's music, but I couldn't! So I escaped to the living room, so I spent the majority of today avoiding Stacy's Mom (DUDE I HAYTE THAT TRACK SO MUCH!) Whatever happened to talent??? And where is all the Goo Goo Dolls songs? Why aren't they repeatedly played...arg! I can't wait to own my own tv..........  Well Nips came round, we talked to Rik on audio......well kinda......well not at all! His Nan didn't know how to open a microwave! How cute is that??? Well I'm so lame, that was near enough the only highlight of my day! Well I ate, it was poopy, oh yeah, Fran came, yes :|.  Well I was supposed to go round lettie's but I got bov because Frankie was there, and lets just say, she's "one of my fav's" at the moment....so yes, I ended up watching Tv, and oh how it sucks so badly! It's just how Harry Hill descibed it in his last episode.......yes..........I watch it....I even record it!   I threatened to kill this girl that Harry (my husband) was talking to, she has now added me, and having a go at me, she's 5ft 11! I'm not.........lol I'm scared! Dude! I'm thinking about divorce.....then I see him on webcam, and I think to myself....hmmm......it's him that wants the divorce, like I'm gonna let him get what he wants! Lol, Why am I writing this? Because I can!  Well that's enough my faithful blog, I larve you!  Toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well the days have been pretty cool, I 'll just run thorugh them for you  Friday  Me and Tab met up, we bougth cds, but mine were for my MoMmI's birthday, adn I bought Ice Blonde hairdye, it ahs turned out orange! Lol, but it doesn't look that bad I suppose. We later went to Jax, as there was a party in Bude, so no one would be out. We came home, and did nothing! Lol, Just take alot of photos!   Saturday  Did absolutely nothing! Lol, videoed me, Nips and Liza. It was soooooooooo funny! Mum bought drinks up, and I was taking a sip, and Nips started doing this weird dance with his neck, i found it hilarious! So I spat out my drink, then as we were recovering over that, Lisa tripped up; spilling her drink EVERYWHERE, then........She broke a glass, this was all in a time gap of 1 minute, it was hilarious! The rest of the day was pretty poopy, I watched American Beauty, and cried! It's such a beautful/emotional film! Then I finished off the day with good old Harry Hill.   Sunday  Did nothing today, woke up at 3, due to imagining the cyclops from Johnathan Creek, so I didn't sleep till late that night. I woke up in pain, I'm surfing the crimson wave if you know what I mean, for all the dumbass people out there (think what colour crimson is...and add it to the fact that I'm female...) Well yeah, Nips came round, we've basically been on the computer all day, I need to tidy my room, family are coming down and I'm being pushedout of my room for their happiness :@:@:@ ARGIPOOS!  Well thats all thats happened in my sad...sad life Toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been cool, as soon as I woke up, I asked my MoMmI for a lift, she said no, it looked as though I'd continue to walk to school, for the last time.  But I had good old John Rzeznik to keep me company, which was cool. I got to school nearly late, he just got the register out. Well yeah, that was an interesting piece of information! Well yeah, first lesson was maths, I met a very rab Tabb! I told her about mine and Rik's argument, i think she's a littel bit annoyed, also I told her about Nips reading her blog, it's nice to know she only let Sammy and Pig have the address, it's nice knowing your a close freind! Even though she's wrote all that on her old blog, but you know! Well yeah,a pretty shit lesson. But it was followed by a good one.  History was great, we were watching these dodgy video, with dodgy music, me and Clur were in fits, but Miss told us to stop being immature, so we did! Lol, but it was hilarious! I'll write more about it whn I've had a boring day, some time in the holidays.  Break, we went down donkey, Tabb gave me a fag! Yes! That's what I thought.......didn't do anything else...  Third lesson was food, found out Michaela is badly ill, she can't eat, if she does, it makes her sick and she throws up, so she can only drink, but me, being me, cheered her up, which was cool, we played some games, it was cool.  Fourth lesson was boring, Badger has just given me loads of coursework!   At lunch, we went down donkey, then spar and bought minchimoos, on the walk back to school, I danced to Luke's ringtone, it was Austin Powers theme, it was great.  Last lesson was science, it was really boring, so I left many notes in Sammy's science books.   Boring now, so until next time, toodlepip xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

We had extended form time, which was fun because we discovered how infectious yawns actually are, yes, 20 minutes of yawning was great, we were placing bets on who would yawn next...oh the joy!  First lesson was r.e I got 31% which was actually great, Alex (smart guy) got 20%, so I feel privellegged, it was kinda cool, Alex allowed me to sit next to him! Lol, it was fun talking about random things...  Second lesson was art, I was continuing my "relationship" with Sam, I drew an ever so perdy rose, I'm hardcore, and I deserve a quiche! It was fun talking with him for an hour, I sang him : "Can't take my eyes off you..." he blushed the little cutie! And I also managed to wink at Anna...  At break we ate...  Third lesson was business, pretty poopy, Morganator's voice is starting to do my head in...  Fourth lesson was science, it was ok, I fell out with Lettie at the beginning, but she came back, Sammy's continuing to be a dickhead...bov for him innit mate :| I come from Landan...  At lunch me and Tab went down Pig's I was in hysterics due to finally figuring out that he doesn'y actually laugh! Just cough...Say Da, wouldn't let him go!  Last lesson was history, I discovered me and Angy had the same results, 32%, it's a sign :|, or not! Lol... Well that was about it...  After school I went Tab's, then we went to Pig's, Nips came, Tab left, I left...

      Well I sure do miss my blog, infact I miss my old life! I was listening to err...a cd me and my friend made a while back...and it made me think, I never see her anymore, and I just generally miss hanging out with all my mates. Well I'll do what I haven't done for a long while...  Today: I had a shower, walked to school with Frankie, we had a good chat about life...it was cool. I got there, and just generally socialised...and accused Michaela of performing some kind of sexual activity and a certain someone...;)  First lesson was art, it was great, my work is actually starting to look good! I was trying it on with everyone! Even Mr kIng ;). Well yeah, I said I wanted to suck his phallus, and I've fallen in love with someone else...Sam Hayden...there, I confessed...he is officially now, "my relationship". I hugged him for ages and he's just..mmm......Sam!  Second lesson was english, it was ok, we just did some of our essay for when we come back in 3 weeks, we've got work experiance soon, and I'm pooping myself!!  At break me, Lettie and Tab, it was cool...Mr Bardsley is a new target to seduce ;)...just kidding, I don't dream about seducing my teachers...which leads me to my third lesson...  Science with Mr Ryan, :P, we were doing an experiment, Sammy was being pleasantly nice to me! It was great! I even got a hug! Lol...he made me a bracelet and I've sooooooo got over him *rolls eyes*...  Fourth lesson was p.e, it was great, we were playing "tennis volley" and Miss kept saying: HERE WE GO. So me and Tab kept singing the Geeks song, it was great, then we started calling Miss a curse because she kept making us loose dammit! :@  At lunch we went down Lettie's...but she wasn't there! So we hung out with Larnie, it was cool chatting like old times again, although I felt a bit awkward...but she's my sister dammit! I can't feel that way, they bought a double bed for Larnie especially so I can sleep with her! I used to stay round hers for months on ends you see...  Last lesson was well I can't remember yet...wait a sec...oh yeah, it was maths, I got the lowests results on the second test, as well as the first, I got 19%...I'm becoming so bad! Well yeah, it was a laugh because Tab laughed in the Bitch's face...  Tab came mine after school, then we went Pig's, Kris came, Tab left, Kris left then me and Pig just hung out, and I edited my site loads...  Well that's all, so until tomorrow  I LOVE SAM   Lol, oh yeah, if you ever read this Len, I love you, even if spelling my MoMmIs name is a disability.

I've discovered Air isn't a bastard, infact he's a really sweet guy! The other night I was thinking, Tabby's got everything, and what do I have? Nothing but the taste of prawns when I eat Jaffa Cakes...  My exams are finally over, I've got both bad and good results, got an A in Food, 2 B-s in English, an E in science, 23% in maths, oh dear!

      Well, I've missed alot out, life is slowly improving which is good. I've still managed to speak to Len everyday, which is getting quite expensive due to I have no credit... College was fun today. I recorded it. It's surprising how different people act when they see they are being recorded... Well Len sent me this beautiful song, so I'm gonna publish the lyrics. I've got nothing else to say apart from just taken end of year ten exams, not doing too well.  So until next time...keeps these lyrics with you   I hurt myself today  To see if I still feel  I focus on the pain  The only thing that's real  The needle tears a hold  The old familiar sting  Try to kill it all away  But I remember everything   What have I become  My sweetest friend  Everyone I know goes away  In the end  And you could have it all  My empire of dirt  I will let you down  I will make you hurt   I wear this crown of thorns  Upon my liar's chair  Full of broken thoughts  I cannot repair  Beneath the stains of time  The feelings disappear  You are someone else  I am still right here   What have I become  My ssweetest friend  Everyone I know goes away  In the end  And you could have it all  My empire of dirt  I will let you down  I will make you hurt   If I could start again  A million miles away  I would keep myself  I would find a way   Toodlepip hunnies xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

LMAO! It feels so weird!!! Yeah anyway... english...we read and stuff, I had the odd outburst of giggles, due to Heywood shitting himself, LMAO! Pig was in hysterics, it was funny...  At break I had a nice healthy sandwich (I'm eating more healthy...)we saw Da, he did this funny walk as he walked by, and now my bird is grooming me...and pecking my ear...yeah, after that was an English test, I was on a roll! 5 pages on two questions! Lol, I think that's an exaggeration, but yeah. I got very sidetracked, so sidetracked I ended up writing about Worldpeace and Goo Goo Dolls lyrics. At lunch me and Tab hung with Pig, and finally met Regard! Lol, the time we finally get to hang with them is 3 days before they leave school, look at mine and Tabby's skill!   Last lesson was maths, we kept singing and we nearly got a detention! Chang said I had a nice personality! Lol, I won't write about him saying about Tabby's ass being nice, SHIT!!!

And I'm sorry I have to stop writing about my boring life because of Kris. He can say one thing and it pisses you off! No wonder why he deleted his blog. Arg!

      I didn't have a clue what to use as the title, so that's what came! Lol, randomness is great. I woke up at 7 today, I thought it was 8 and I got a message from Frankie saying that she wouldn't be coming for me, so I started getting ready, there was me blaring Nirvana at 6:50 in the morning, then MoMmI asked me what i was doing up so early, so she let me sleep until 8:15 :D. Then she gave me a lift!  I got there really early, so I talked to Lucy about the weekend, she still has her Jelly Bear (named Marlin) She's had him a week now, I'm surprised he isn't sticky! Well yeah, it was fun hearing about everyone else's weekend, I thought mine was actually great!  We had form time in the morning, which was cool because they all went into great detail about their drunkeness, it makes me miss my cider drinking days...*wipes tear* what about Friday?:P  Well for the remaining p.e lesson, me and Tab just shooted (well I didn't...but ssh!). It was a laugh, then I was joined by Lettie and her ever so great new BROWN hair! Hunny, it does look good don't listen to what other people say.  Second lesson was science. The test was fun, Sammy was there. I have now discovered that he isn't the person I'm in love with. I think I was once, but now I look at him and just feel like friends.  At break we just festered around trying to have a cigarette, but the teachers kept following us kinda thing, but we managed to sneak one behind the box.  Third lesson was business, it was extremely boring and testy and...pfft... BUT!  I found something out: Press Alt Gr and the .  and you get this: ... :D HEHE! I figured it out in the lesson, Deesray didn't look too impressed...hehe :D  Fourth lesson was English, all the way through I needed the toilet, then I went and it wasn't that bad after all, lol, todays been pretty boring, so I'm gonna go into every detail!  At lunch me and Tab went down Spar, were trampled over by the scabbers down donkey but we managed to get out! And get munch...I couldn't breathe, it was well bad. But it ended up with loaddsa choccy, which is always good :D  Last lesson was maths, it was very funny, despite the fact that Tab was constantly drawing Swatstika's over my maths book...we had an interresting discussion with Chang, I don't fancy him...or even find him remotely attractive...  I went to Tab's afterschool, it was funyn signing all the guestbooks, I cut my hair a little, just a trim, then we came back to mine and munched, phone Len and Rik. Then I walked Tab home and now I'm on here. It's great beign able to access the internet...why did I write that? Tab I love ya babe  Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxx

      Well yesterday was great when it was just me and Tab. We went to church, departed then reunited. We cmae back to mine for a barbeque, then we left in search for Clur and her crew. So we wandered around desperaetly in teh red hot sun, then we finally found them, after hours of walking. We got there, it was lame, maybe it wasn't for Tabby, but because they weren;t exactly my friends I found it hard to fit in, so I retreated up the hills nearly in tears then phoned Len, I've gotta stop doing that! Me, Tab, Gary Jones and Jimmy were all together, teh others had separated from us, and I just remember feeling like such a loser, then I looked at Tabby, she looked at me and she gave me the most beautiful smile as in to say everything would be just fine. It made me smile and I just wanted to hug her for the rest of my life! Well that's all I gotta say, so a huage thank you to Tabby Love ya millions hun xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Well yeah, I kinda slept all the way there, apart from when Poo flicked my head, and I jumped, and then I thought she was talking to me when she was actually on the phone...so yeah I ended up having a conversation with myself...  We got there, and yes, the fights with Angela continued...then Lisa had a bit of my mouth :P. We ate, until half 11 whilst playing this weird "flick the bug in teh frogs mouth" game...Corrin kicked my ass :( but I beat Sophie :D  Then we had to go to this really lame party thing, it was poo. But it ended great, after having another fight with Angela, I told her (yet again) to buy a more supportive bra...not that I stare at her breasts :| HOW DISTURBING!!!

      Well today was so much fun, found a hardcore new song...so I downloaded it, also with five and steps... First lesson was halfed, due to form time, but because all the other people in our year was doing an exam, we just festered around. Then I went back to do r.e, it as pretty poopy, but with Alex next to me, how can I complain :|  Second lesson was art, I finally saw my relationship! It was cool...I can still freak him out ;)  At break I signed out, time for "orthodentist", so I went down Lettie's I was deserted for an hour, so I decided to kill the time and to watch Goosebumps, I can't believe I actually used to be scared of that! Larny came, with Yvonne, so we just ate :P, it was great. Lettie soon turned up so we played this fighting thing, I kicked Larny's ass, but then Lettie kicked mine...but lets not talk about that!   At lunch I went to Pig's, I was then joined by Nips, then Menage and Ferg came, then Tabby. It was quite scary...and embarrassing due to the fact they played the recording of me and Tab singing...  Well the dudes left, so me, Tab, Pig and Nips festered. We took some amazing photos of Nips's and Pig's concentration as they watched Pokemon, when I work out how to put pics on here, I'll make sure they are added!  Well I'm here until half ten, so mew! There is the most adorable Pokemon called Mew...it kicks ass...I don't watch Pokemon :|  Well I better go, due to Tab and Nips having a rather viscous pillow fight...  That is all, so toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx LMAO! NIPS HAS HIS FEET PUT AND THEY'RE FOOKING DISGUSTING!!!

      Well today was ok, woke up earlier, I had to wash my hair. I then just festered in my house... Frankie didn't come. First lesson was art, it was pretty poopy. It was quite amusing though when Sam admitted that he had never heard of Nirvana... Second lesson was english, I dragged Lettie along, it was pretty poopy. At break me, Lettie and Clur went down Spar, it was cool us all chatting, Lettie was saying how she would throw a massive party if I lost my virginity... Third lesson was science, it was poopy, nice to see Kristie back though :| Fourth lesson was p.e. It was quite amusing, and I can't believe how my ctaching skills have grown :|...I'm a natural :|, Miss said I was insane... At lunch I went down Lettie's I broke up a "disagreement" as Larny's ex boyfriend had text her saying something about her current boyfriend being a paedophile, backstabbing ugly bastard...I had to try to convice Mark not to kick the shit out of him. Last lesson was maths, it was turd. I got a lift home with Frankie, then I worked for two hours. I never realised what a shithole I live in...oh well. That is all, I need a fag :( Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well I woke up at 11, due to a bad dream. I can't remember what it was about, but it was scary, and I kissed a guys head :|. Well yeah...I had a roast and then me and Dad had a laugh, due to me swearing at the phone with my hands because Tab didn't say: "Love you too". He told me to say to her that her shit stinks...  I'm over Peegs now, trying to work out how to put photos on here, but I can't so I will not get stressed and I will just give up, I'm watching eastenders now, Gary: I'M KING OF THE WORLD...:|  I'm dressed in my "flannel trousers", Peeg calls them: "towel trousers"...thanks for that!  Well yeah, we've moved his room round, well actually me and Tab did next to nothing, but ssh ;)  That is all for now, so remember this: A friend helps you move...but real friends help you move dead bodies.  Take care y'all  Toodlepipxxxxxxxx

      Well yesterday was cool. School was pretty poopy, I think Perv figured out that I copied my essay from the internet, I have to edit it...bastardo!!!  Well yeah, afterschool me and Tab went round hers, we had another interesting chat with her Dad, which says I feel insecure about my homelife because I've made a hole in my jumper and I chew on the bits...  Well yeah, we got ready and stuff (sexy bum rang me) then we went to Pig's, Nips was there :). Lol...I meant that smile...  It was pretty fun...then me and Tab met Angy and went to his. We watched this film and lets just say we find the word "grapes" amusing. We went home, and played games with chewits, leaving us to be quite sick.  Today I was woken up by a text message from sexy bum. AT 9:30. We couldn't get back to sleep so I tidied my room and were now at Pig's. It was so funny! Earlier on we were watching this brunch thing and it sounded so dirty!  Well yeah, probably no plans for the rest of the day. So yeah, that is all. Toodlepipxxxxxxx

      Well I'll run you through the school day...I woke up at 5, due to MoMmI adopting random dogs, ok Keira is cute, but why wake me up so early? I then went back to sleep, at 7:£0 I got ready. I left the house by 8:15, walked by myself and it was good. I need space by myself... First lesson was history, Clur deserted me :( Well she went into a different room. I typed my work on the computer and spoke to Chris, it's good talking to people you haven't spoken to for a while...  All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me Somebody I can love for them All this money don't mean shit If you ain't got nobody to share it with Love rules the world, you feel me  Len just sent me that, thought I'd share it with you because it's perdy. It's a part of his new poem...  Well yeah, second lesson was maths which completely sucks. Yes I understand simultaneous equations...  Third lesson was english...so I went down Lettie's and hoovered and played worms :P. It was good chatting to my family again, I've missed Yvonne :(.   Fourth lesson was science...again it was down Letties...  At lunch I met Tab and Roxy, and we went down Bude Junior School. I had to give Miss Marriott a form and a cadr to say thanks. I saw Matt and Marc, it was weird, I was walking down the corridors and Marc was just screaming my name...it's horrible to think that I was a part of their lives a week ago, and now I'm just a memory. I knocked on the door, and loads of the kids were saying: it's Jess! I just felt like such a bitch because I wasn't concentrating on what anyone was saying, I was just really badly emotionally overwhelmed. The next thing I knew I had Robyn hugging me. I left...and I regret not talking to them. I had loads of time, and all I did was walk off.  I got back,last lesson was business. The whole time I was just thinking of what I could of said or done. I just couldn't handle it. And now I feel poopyish. I walked home with Frankie, we bought fags and now I'm here listening to Seal, and I just feel so far away from being complete...what is it?  I guess I just get too attached, I've gotta learn to let go. It's so hard  Toodlepipx

      Well I woke up at half six, and got ready for college, I later got a text from Corrin saying she wouldn't be going today :|. So I had to meet the freaks by myself... So I did. The ride up was lame, and teh whole day was. I had to catch up on loads of stuff. I joined Lisa loads of times, and met this guy called John, he's going to her eighteenth, and I can't wait! Well yeah, the day soon drew to an end (thank God) and I'm now over Pig's, after drawing lots of random shat, I have improved, and "on a roll" as they say, I just keep thinking of Helen's sketchbooks and I just want to be her! Her drawings are so beautiful, and mine are just lame :|. Well thats all... Toodlepipx

      Well today's actually been great! I woke up, had a shower...waited for Frankie to come, then we got a lift. It's good speaking to her again, 3 weeks and I missed her! I got at school, and I spoke to Luc, and Tilzey. It's all great!  At first we had to go into the hall to talk about Work Experiance, I have to give Miss Marriott a card :|.  First lesson was art, it was pretty cool. I didn't miss Matt at all :P. And his festering swearing after every sentence...  Second lesson was history, it was (as always) great. Me and Clur just talked about everything! We were in the computer rooms and was just laughing at everything! Things soon got embarrassing when she saw my email from Girland...:| LMAO! I can't believe I just wrote that...  At break me and Clur trekked down Spar, we talked loads, it was great! We came back to a rab Lettie...oops!  Third lesson was science, it was hilarious! Me and Sammy played a game that went like this: When we laughed we had to strip. I lost...lol, but we soon stopped because Sammy didn't wanna take his socks off...so the next game we played was: When Bradders walks past, we have to go all sexy, like I flicked my hair and Sammy would put his finger in his mouth...it was hilarious!!!  Fourth lesson I had "doctors" so I went to Lettie's and we played worms...Mark and Larna joined in too...it was quite fun! We continued to play through lunch..At the end of lunch, me and Lettie (LMAO!!!) went into SEN, we were on the computers and Lettie coughed and farted at the sametime, it was hilarious!!! Barry Salmon was there aswell! I was in hysterics...I think it may of been my immaturity...  Last lesson was I.t, we had teh ever so great Miss Murphy :|, and I found a new piece of information:  NICOLA GLOVER HAD HER HAND ON JOEL TROKE'S PHALLUS AND HE HAD HIS HAND ON HER FANGITA IN SCIENCE . So I decided to email it everyone :), he was rab ;)  Me and Frankie walked home and we got fags, after finally getting a lighter! I had to ask a random! And I saw loads of Dudes from Junior School...I miss it!!  Well that's all, oh yeah! I've finally got over my fear, and I've chucked loads of shat away! Also I'm not wearing any make up and I'm feeling great! Apart from now there is a lump in my throat, yes I'm thinking of Matt again, but what else can I do? I'm probably just another teenager who thinks she's in love when she blaitently isn't! So here's some more lyrics...  in the sun   i picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong  and falling down on your knees asking for sympathy  and being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen  and trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in   May God's love be with you  always  May God's love be with you   i know i would apologize if i could see your eyes  cause when you showed me myself i became someone else  but i was caught in between all you wish for and all you need  i picture you fast asleep  a nightmare comes  you can't keep awake   may God's love be with you  always  may God's love be with you   cause if i find  if i find my own way  how much will i find  if i find  if i find my own way  how much will i find  you   i don't know anymore  what it's for  i'm not even sure  if there is anyone who is in the sun  will you help me to understand  cause i been caught in between all I wish for and all I need  maybe you're not even sure what it's for  any more than me   may God's love be with you  always  may God's love be with you   Take care folks, and toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxx

We then went roung Pig's. Nips came later. And left...we bought munch and we just generally festered in his room. Ooh! Yesterday I finally managed to get the song from the advert. I've wanted it for ages! It's the aftershave thing, by Davidoff. It's called Echo, theres a guy looking through the bottle and the only part of the song they show is: "I'll picture you in the sun, wondering what went wrong..." Well yeah, it's a great song! And it's called this for any others out there who wants to know: Joseph Arthur - In The Sun. And if you haven't seen the advert, download the song because it's fanbloodytastic!  Well yeah, texted Matt a little today, I now only have 15p left, lol, from a fiver yesterday! It was cool, he was extremely drunk!   School tomorrow, after 3 weeks! And you know what? I haven't done a single bit of coursework...o poopy! Oh well, I'll manage to blag my way out of it.

      Well the week was kinda great. Me and Matt didn't talk at all Wednesday, and he didn't come for the afternoon, I found out it was because his friend, yes I'm talking about Dj, had hanged himself. Thursday was good, we went into Bude and we talked, it was great. The kids gave me a class photo of them, I will get it enlarged later. After, me and Tab waited for him to drive past, I waved and we went to Pig's, but on the way we saw Lettie, so we went into town, but angy wasn't there. We then went to Pig's whilst Lettie went home. I joined her later and we watched a film together, one we used to watch when we was younger, it was just like old times again, and I loved it! Tab came over then we left to Pig's again, and then I got a phonecall from Lettie, she was crying so I met her, Oko had told her he didn't want a relationship after 4 months...I tried cheering her up but I'm just not the Jess I used to be, I am completely transformed, for the worst I think. But yeah, after that I returned to Pig, and my 2 binliners full of clothes from Lettie, I left with Nips and got a lift home with his dad. I later had a nervous breakdown leaving me with no friends :|  The next day was full of mixed emotion. From the beginning I was just waiting for Matt to come, when he finally did I felt so great! It was weird...all day we were rehearsing for our assembly. Me and Matt talked alot. It was cool. At lunch I sat with Sophie and the crew then I went to the field and took photos, none of Matt though. After we performed the assembly. I then left after the kids constantly hugging me :|. It was quite funny I suppose, one girl said to another about my hate for them... I then left, but returned to say thanks to Miss Mariott. I saw Matt, and asked him for a hug, then he asked me for his number, I left the building close to hysterics, I didn't know whether to cry or scream with happiness...so i ran to Tab, we then went to Pig's. The night was full of licking stones...we left early.  And today, we've been texting eachother, I now know that he has a 3 year old relationship...so there goes everything I suppose!   Well yes, here are the lyrics of the new song I like, lol:  You say it was like this I was torn between 2 worlds One full of promise And the truth I knew would hurt You say I'm no angel Tryin to put the past behind  So now I try to find A place to leave all Memories in my mind We try, our lives away Then stumble into the grave We cry, and still they stay The past won't go away The story of my life  See I was just thinkin Now my life is on the road The straight and the narrow On the route that I've been showed You know its not easy To try to change your ways  So now I try to find A place to leave all Memories in my mind We try, our lives away Then stumble to the grave We cry, and still they stay The past won't go away The story of my life  A place to leave all Memories in my mind We try, our lives away Then stumble to the grave We cry, and still they stay The past won't go away The story of my Try, our lives away Then we stumble to the grave We cry, and still they stay The past won't go away The story of my life  Well guys, I've got to stop trying to rely on dreams, or promises which I know will never happen.

      Well todays been as lame as ever, yesterday was so good, I painted Matt's hand..and oh! We were just talking all day. Well yeah, that soon leaded onto a really lame day.  I woke up, had a shower and managed to rush my make up, but it turned out ok in the end I suppose. I got there, and was told I'd have to make waves, and make a booklet for the "Bude Trail" we would be attending on Thursday. Well yeah, I went to the library with the class then I went back to do the waves. I did and it turned out bad! Lol, I then joined the class, and the staff treat me as a child, it does my head in. It was only Matt that made me feel welcome. Then it was break, I was supposed to go on duty with Miss Marriott but I didn't...I hung out with Roxy and we were soon impressed by mr Benbow's catching skills... After break I just festered with the kids, but it was with "my crew" not just Marc, so it was cool. Really cool, so cool infact I decided to write that it was cool...even though it wasn't, and Matt didn't talk to me much, so now I'm pissed off because I've only got 3 days to get him to love me! I'm listening to Hoobastank, I'm not gonna chase Matt to the airport, and he's not gonna sing me this song...  Well yeah, after that was lunch, I met up with Tab then we went got fags, came back up and I joined Roxy in the field, Marc told me that Matt had said I couldn't hang out with im at lunch...so I was a bit pissed off. I joined Sam, and shaked this random boys hand after being insulted of having small breasts...well yeah.  After lunch I had to staple loads of papers together, my relationship with that staple really has increased! By about 160 papers :@. It fucked up half way, but Matt sorted it out so it ended up being ok...  I then festered with "my crew" again. I've missed them! Matt only said "see you later" when I left, I really gotta start being "nice".  I'm over Peeg's now, Kris on the way and I'm staying over Tabby Babys tonight, it's her birthday tomorrow so should be good. Oh yeah, Mon, Mark or Steve, if you read this. The cam is working now, and I look great with clear skin and big breasts, lol cameras sure do lie!  Well that is all, toodlepipxxxxxxxxxx

Lol...well yeah, I've made loads of friends at teh place, it ain't awkward at all, at The Strand I hate it...probably due to teh fact that they kept swearing at me...well I'm off, I'll try to write more detail another day Toodlepipxxxxxxxxx

I just try not to let the whole "Rik" thing bother me, but seeing him write what he did, it just seems so unlike Rik! Then him telling me to fuck off...

And if people don't like that, they can shove it up there ass :). Well I couldn't sleep lastnight, due to all the hous pocus shat going on. So I tried to occupy myself throughtout the night, btu at 1 I started feeling sleepy lol, I'm so lame! So I slept with my sister Karen... Jacob kept waking up and crying, so I thought "bov for this" and i went back into my bed at 7, I slept until 12.

The trip back was ok I suppose, apart from when we forgot the blender so we had to go back...It was well cool, Jacob has a toy that plays a foonky tune, but you have to set it off. i tried continuously to make it work, so I could dance, but it never worked. But on the way home it was in a bag in the boot, and it kept playing, all the way back. Well yeah, we went to Pam and Graham's and there was these french guys...: &nbsp; Well we went back and I went online, it was boring and I went to bed. I woke up at 9, went online then I met Tab and now were at Pig's. Well yeah, nothing special happening so I wil be off now. Lol still listening to Steps...toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well todays been, well wet! Lol. I woke up, had a shower then got a lift to school with Frankie. First lesson was science, I was dreading it as I didn't do any of the coursework, but when I got there I realised how much work I had on the school computers! So I think I'll be able to pass that alright, that go tme in the mood for a really good day... &nbsp; Second lesson was r.e, we literally did nothing, me and Alex chatted a little, but then I smelt my breath...and it wasn't good! So I shut up...but I got thinking, out of ALL the people in the class, he decided to sit next to me. This is Alex Smeeth, the cricketer who's gonna make it rich and famous, and I sat next to him in r.e, because he considered me a friend and rather sat next to me than anyone else...I've gotta stop thinking about things! But also, I handed in my history coursework, and it made me feel even better than I felt already!!! &nbsp; At break I found Clurry and Lettie at the drama table waiting for me, they were talking :). I was just thinking (again): Those are my friends, and they're waiting for me...we went down donkey then returned back to the great place (aka school :) &nbsp; Third lesson was maths, it seemed to drag on for ages but it was ok as I was talking to everyone, usually I'm really quiet in the lesson, but I just went back to the old Jess, who doesn't care about anyone elses opinions, it was great :D. &nbsp; Fourth lesson was food. I realised today what great friends I have! Lol, it's been good talking to them again. I mean I love Tab, beyond words, but I've just missed them loads! And...some I haven't! Lol...like Frankie... &nbsp; At lunch I went down Lettie's and did the rest of my history essay. Finishing it made me feel like on cloud #9, it just feels so great going to a lesson, and being able to hand everything in. Me and Lettie then discussed what our plans would be for tonight. &nbsp; At form time it was great; exactly like the old times again! Me singing...dancing...going cross eyed...annoying people. Just great fun :)...and to finish it off...I called Barry a Fat Shit :D and hugged Craig  &nbsp; Last lesson was history, it was great fun, me and Tab doodled the bugle and completely changed everything to teachers being obsessive with moles and girls in skirts... &nbsp; Afterschool I went into town with Lettie and Lana, exactly like old times again; going shopping with Lana's money and spending it all :D. We soon returned, this was when I would dance really horrifically to Britney's&nbsp; "Everytime", also Lana admitted that every part of my body makes her want to throw&nbsp; up :. I finally saw Rich again! It was amazing, I haven't seen him in so long, and I realise again why I liked him...We had tea, got dressed up and I phoned Pig. &nbsp; We met him, Mon, Nips, Da and Bo. Bo gave me a rainbow badge :)...it was Kat's, but ssh! Lettie soon left as they said she looked like Nadia from Big Brother, and may I add, a big  FUCK YOU  to Nips, as Ahmed was voted out this evening :D. Well yeah, it started to rain and we went down to the skatepark. Kat came, and we decided to spin in the rain, it was fun :) I didn't do much...but she did! Lol. Nips did a carpet and we was dreaming, I didn't dream much though. Well yeah, the Rozzers came...took all our details and Pig home :P. So yeah, Da managed to escape, and for someone reason, Mon wasn't asked :S. So yeah, Mon went after Pig was taken, then Da came back and him and Nips went, and Kat was being picked up, so I left. &nbsp; Now I'm on here, won't be able to write tomorrows blog as I am seeing Monica and Mark in Cheltenham. &nbsp; So toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxx &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well woke up, had a bath, had a lift to school with Frankie. The usual really. First lesson was s.e, but me and Lettie didn't fancy that...or food, so we went back to hers and watched Mean Girls, it was pretty good.  At break we went back, I had to because of Maths with Tilzey. It was ok I suppose, wel actually it was just irritating, we did 4 questions in an hour :| Fourth lesson was science, it was turd and I realised I need to do a project and an assignment before Friday (2 days) otherwise I wouldn't be entered into the exam...so I'm fucked! I don't have a clue what to do, and I'm falling behind really bad :( At lunch we went down Peeg's so I could get my phone, and as I didn't have battery I took his old one, it was cool, and I took loadsa photos... Last lesson was art, lmao! I just wrote fart...yeah I'm lame! Well yeah, was a turd lesson really.  And now I'm round Pig's, waiting for my hardcore pizza to arrive. That is all, so toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      I dunno why thats the title...but hey! Wow! Well this weekends been great, and so has today! I've managed to pick myself up again. So lets run through it then...  Friday  School was lame, me and Tab went straight back to mine afterschool and we just festered, until I got a phonecall from a very om Pig, so we met up with him. We was later joined by Mon and Da. The night was cool. Once again, me and Tab didn't drink, but it was still cool. Well...okay maybe that night wasn't so good...   Saturday  Me and Tab woke up quite late, so we went into Bude and bought anti-cellulite cream. We applied it and all that jazz, we've been exercising and this whole day almsot consisted on walking around...due to Mon and Da being phalluses...the night was great! I was told my life will crumble to pieces...but I would be wealthy :D...:|   Sunday  We woke up, no shit :|, and we went back to mine, after applying the cream again :P, yes it has already started to firm us up!!! Well yeah, we went back to mine to kill time before my sisters 18th...but Nips and Pig rang, so we met up with them, had a dream then returned to mine.  The people had started coming, and we stayed in my room; due to being scared. Me and Tab had dressed up again, in the skirts and stuff so Nips and Pig decided to dress up too, so we met Pig's brother...*dribbles*...and yeah...well in the end we started chatting to the people, we immediately got on with these 2 guys, Scott and John. I like Joh, and Tab likes Scott! Lol, well yeah, we were just dreaming at the back of the garage. The night was full of hugging random gay guys, one being called Guy (:|) and there was this really nice guy! We hugged fr ages, his name is Rik. I've asked Lisa for his number...lol. After lots of alcohol later (:|) we went into the living room to watch films, Scott wanted Tab to join him on her lap, so she did. Later my MoMmI came in, yelling at me to go to bed as I had school the next day. It was embarrassing.  Me and Tab went to bed, 10 minutes later we went downstairs, then we went out on the golfcourse and dreamed a little more, John clearly didn't want me, but good old goldfish...So yeah, as Tab was wrecked we decided to go to bed. This was at half two...  At 6 we were woken up, by my very drunken sister. As we couldn't get back to sleep, we just got ready for school...  I saw Rik in the morning but that was it :(  Well yeah, Frankie came so me, Tab and Nips walked to school with her. Nips was meetin Fred *George :|. Well yeah. Me and Tab were tired beyond words can explain...  At registration, I finally saw Craig (ultimate sexybum) and I thought...hmmm...so I said to him, wanna go to the prom with me? It was sooo cute! He just kept smiling and went really red...then said maybe :|. I'm not really happy about it...  First lesson was art, it was pretty poopy...second lesson was english, it was turd apart from when Lettie started randomly laughing at the Levi's adverts becasue of the music, hey hun...WHATEVER TURNS YOU ON!  At break we went down Donkey...third lesson was science, had a laugh with Sammy...and I did something really stupid... Sammy told me to tell someone (who was not wearing a brace) that I had never noticed they were wearing a brace...So I decided to target Joel...so I said to him,  I never realised you had a brace , he said:  I don't , I go  what's that then  *points to front teeth* he replies:  Oh! That's my fake tooth! ...  Fourth lesson was p.e, me and Tab were umpires for rounders, but we were concentrating on the way Jenny moved her legs so often, so we missed out on when a rounder was scored...so we randomly made the scores up...  At lunch we went to Safeway, ain't done that for a while, after calling lots of paranoid little girls lesbians, we ate our food. It was so much fun :|  Last lesson was maths, I was nearly falling asleep.  And just now, whats made me happy? SEXYBUM HAS GOT MY MESSAGE :D  Well yeah, this is too long for my liking, should be short tomorrow, so until then...toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well over the weekend I learnt that my sexybum had gone, with no call, no text. Today at school I think I broke down into tears at least 3 times. I decided to go home.  I just thought of everything, Lettie had deserted me, sexybum...well I guess he couldn't be bothered and just everybosy, it's getting how things used to be. I mean come on...my lipgloss bitches won't even tell me what's wrong when Luc is hysterically crying, what can I do if they never tell me anything? I feel as if I'm just here, floating amongst all the others. Why doesn't anyone appreciate my presence? Do I have "pleas eignore me, I'm a selfish/two face bitch" written on my forehead? Christ! No one even gives me a chance.  Why do I always follow the undescribable weeks with ones lowest of the low?  Nothing else to say...toodlepipxxxx

      Well I woke up, and I stayed at home due to a bad tummay (yes I was supposed to type it like that, so screw u Pig! *puts up little finger where the minging ring used to be on*). So I ended up waking at 9:20, then I cleaned the kitchen for an hour. After mum and Dad coming in and completely ruining it, I thought there would be no point for the living room. So I retreated to my room and played Ozone really loud, it was fun drying my hair to it...damn I'm so vain! Well after that I went on the internet, then I let Karen on and I allowed her to have some of my contacts, the next thing I knew she's talking to Pig and Chappell...so i completely distroyed it and went on (h) :| that smiley doesn't work on here...  Well yeah, I noticed the time was three, so I left to Pig's house, no one answered the door so Tab rang, I met her and now were at Pig's. We haev to leave at 6 due to him going back to his old boyfriend. It's sad you know because Harry treated him like shit, he cheated on him and everything, but Pig just can't see it. I've tried telling him that he's only used so Harry can "unleash the load" but he just can't see it :(  Well I tried...that is all   Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxx  Oh yeah, Pig isn't gay, I made that all up, but he is deserting us for Harry Munchkin, and he won't let me and Tab "pop along" xxxxxxxxxxxxx

      Well the holidays have been pertty good so far, the weather is great, and me and Tab have made some great new friends! We've actually got relationships now, mines Steph Menzies lookalike and hers is Sam, I was jealous of her at first because I really liked Sam, but they had already fallen in love so I just left it. On a more serious note, I really like John. And Rik. I dunno why I like Rik though, he has permanent bov for me and it's starting to piss me off! Well me and Tab keep going up Barnstaple it's pretty cool I suppose, made quite alot of friends which is cool. On Saturday I am going on holiday up North for 2 weeks, so no more blogging from me for a while! Well happy reading and hope y'all have fun. Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxx
