Finally put the white spraypaint to use and painted my bars today. =P  Susan called not too long ago and we talked. That made me happy. Glad she started calling and communicating more often now. hehe. She also wrote me a email back. I wrote a huge ass long one then a few short ones and she just wrote me back. So I had to write her back again. haha. So yeah im in a good mood now cause I talked to my baby! haha.  Shweet Sunday just ended and its Monday.

      Man what a long day it has been. I got about 3 hours of sleep before I had to wakeup and go to work this morning, and I have been dead tired all freakin day. Woke up around 8 and got to work about 9:30 and man it was freakin hot as hell inside that house. The temperature in the house we where working in was easily 110 - 115 degrees. It was cooler standing outside in the sun; being inside was like being in an oven.  Anyways when we where done for the day I was putting some tools in the truck and heard my phone beep and it just so happened to be Susan. She said "HAPPY 6 MONTHS BABY!" in a text message. lol. It was great because I wasn't expecting her to send that at all, I usually text message her first. We talked till about the time I got home then I went and took a shower and laid around and was being lazy after working all day. Listening to it poor down rain. Then she text messaged me again and we talked some more. Her vacation in California sounds more like a 2 week long shopping spree. Just about everytime I talk to her she's at some kind of store. lol.  Yep its been six months. Doesn't seem that long at all but it has indeed been a half a year as of today. I guess that old saying "Time flys when your having fun." is actually true.  Well about 2 more hours and today is over so that means there will be 4 days left until Susan gets back. Man you just don't know how exciting that is for me. =P My constant boredom will end, and I will get to hangout with the best person in the world. =)  Hmm don't know what else to write about. Susan should be calling here shortly. She had to take a 4 hour car ride to her cousin's house and told me she would call me when she got there so you can imagine I'm waiting. =P Well w/e I don't have anything else to write about. Later.

      Haha another day has passed. 5 Days till Susan gets back after today, Im excited. I talked to her for about a hour and a half today she seems so happy that makes me happy. :) I miss her so much and cant wait to see her.   Im hanging out with Kyle again here this is like the third time he has spent the night at my house this week. haha. We went and ate at Taco Bell then went to Wal-Mart to pick up some white spray paint and sandpaper cause we are going to paint some stuff on our bikes. We also bought some cool poker thing and played poker for about 3 hours while watching Motorcycle Mania 3. Was pretty cool.  Man im glad today wasnt boring. I had a decent day for once and stayed busy all day so I wasnt bored off my ass like I usually am. Good thing is I probably wont be bored tomorrow at all either. Im going to work some of the day with my Dad and then im probably gonna work on my old broken down truck. lol. Its not actually broken down just needs to have some things fixed. =P  Well I tried to take apart my bike to put another spacer on my spindle so the bottom bracket wouldnt move and me and Kyle couldnt get the left crank arm on for some reason...dont ask why we tried everything. So I went and stole my sisters little pink Schwinn bike and busted some moves on it. Aired out on our 4 1/2 foot quarter with it and was wall tapping a big piece of plywood we had setup out of a ditch. Heres a picture of me in action. haha. And heres a picture of Kyle doing a Saran Wrap footjam thing.   urlLink Jimmy_walltap   urlLink Kyle_footjam_saranwrap

      Yep another boring day has gone by. Why the hell is summer so boring? I thought it was suppose to be fun. I slept till about 4 and woke up and did something. I dont really remember much from today but I remember listening to music sitting here depressed for a while. The more I think about Susan not being here the more it bothers me. I havent talked to her in 2 days now. Today is Thursday which means exactly a week until she gets back; July 1st for those of you who didnt know. This Saturday(26th) means we will have been together 6 months, its pretty exciting. =)  I guess today was rather boring because I woke up at 4 and didnt really talk to Kyle at all today so I just sat around on my ass by myself the whole day and about starved to death. Maybe tomorrow I wont be so damn lazy. =P  I actually read some of a book today. Just think about that for a minute...Me read a book; never. Thats how extremely bored and depressed I was haha. Its actually a really interesting book I started reading and stopped like last year. Its about a all-female band of British soldiers code-named Jackdaws who are suppose to destroy a key telephone exchange in France. I suggest checking it out.  YAY Susan text messaged me. I sent her one earlier today and I guess she just got it. =P "I was in 6 flags i miss you soo much! I LOVE YOU!" it what she sent. That makes me happy. lol.  I hardley remembered how great Led Zeppelin was. Was sitting around bored today and just blasted all the Zeppelin songs I had in my playlist. It was great because it cheered me up so much. Then I played some Jet and that helped even more. Glad I listen to alot of different music. Have a different kind for about every mood im in. lol.  Well thats about all I can think about to write about right now. Until next time.   - Jimmy

      Yeah Im losing it. I miss Susan so much and want to see her. =/ But yeah cant do much about that.  Today was extremely boring just like yesterday. Go figure. Woke up at like 11 this morning or so took a shower and hungout in the house all day with Kyle who has been here for like 2 days. haha. Man Ive been bored for so long im losing my mind. =P Ive done the same things for two days now. Beat up my brother some, played with my cat, ate and sat. How exciting.  Blah blah sitting here drinking apple juice and listening to Sublime as Wednesday ended about 30 minutes ago. Well I have no more to write. Later.  Hey Susan here ya go. Thinking of you.

      Yeah as the title says...im bored. Im sitting here listening to music and Kyle is across the room on his new computer which is loud as hell but its cool.  I had a pretty fun day. Woke up at like 8 this morning after going to bed at 4; so naturally I didn't get much sleep. Hungout at home with Kyle for a few hours then left for Susan's house. But not before making a stop at Thornebrooke Chocolates to get some of the chocolate covered strawberries she loves so much. I got a pound of them as well as a hunk of fudge which is ridiculously good and a chocolate covered Oreo. It was cool. My mom is the greatest.  The I hungout at Susan's for a few hours and she made tacos for dinner and we watched Degrassi. It was pretty relaxing and fun. I was at Susan's and Kyle called asking to spend the night so I was like whatever sure and thus here we are now. Goofing around on our computers at 3:16 AM or so on a Saturday morning. Oh well.  Think Susan got mad at me earlier but I think its all settled now, or at least I hope so. Cant wait to hangout with her today. I may even go work on my truck believe it or not...  That's about it. Later.

      I havent slept in almost 24 hours, and Im fighting to stay awake cause I dont want to fall asleep and waste the day away. Oh well.   Not too much going on really. Been hanging out with Susan everyday, riding my bike, and just messing around on the internet. I havent managed to update this site though. Im a slacker.   Anyhow, Kyles Bday is tomorrow and we are headed down to Ocala to ride the skatepark there for a while. Its gonna kick ass! I have been since his bday last year which was super fun. It should be an interesting trick considering we are both a hell of alot better since then.   The first week of August me, Susan, & my mom are headed down to Tampa to spend the week and chill down there. That should be awesome. Cant wait to just get away from it all and spend a week at the beach. Maybe get a tan...lol.   School starts again August 16th which blows really bad because I hate school and really dont want to go, but Im going to have to do good this year since I slacked off last year alot. Oh well, we will see what happens.   Until Next time. Later.   I LOVE YOU SUSAN!!!

      Still not a whole lot going on, im still hanging out with Susan and Kyle everyday just being myself. Got my new frame I ordered off eBay in the mail Friday, and went up to a friends bike shop today and put my bottom bracket on and hooked up my brakes. Ill throw up some pictures later. &nbsp; Everything is going good with me and Susan. She came over and hungout today after I got back from the bikeshop. Tomorrow we are going to see Anchorman and hangout all day. &nbsp; Gonna go for my first street ride with my new frame Monday which should be great. Ive only ridden the bike like twice because it poored all day. We will probably have alot of pictures and maybe some video footage. Youll just have to wait and see. &nbsp; Thats about all. Carry on now. Later.

      Not much has been going on lately. Just been doing the usual routine. I finally paid the dude for the frame I won on eBay so that means I should get it around Saturday or Sunday. Cant wait its gonna kick ass.  Not too much is gonna happen today either. Gonna go to Susan's in a few and we may go eat lunch somewhere and hangout at her pool. Should be pretty fun. =)  Well I dont have much to write about I have really been doing a whole lot of nothing lately. As for the website itself goes im gonna start working on it and maybe get a few of the pages that dont have much on them or anything on them done. Mainly BMXing Stuff, Pictures, & Susan's Page.  Thats about it. Later.

Ive just been hanging out with Kyle and Susan just being myself. Its been a while since Ive posted anything on here so I thought I needed too. I bought a Fit Series 2 frame off of eBay the other day for like $202. Thats a pretty good deal considering they are $335 new. This one has been used a little but is still in great condition. It looks sweet. Here are some pictures of it that where on eBay.   urlLink newframe_1   urlLink newframe_2   urlLink newframe_3   Thats about it. Not much has gone on lately. Still burning the midnight fuel here. Well...im starving so im going to go get somthing to eat. Later.

      Yeah! Today was a good day. I went over to Susan's house because they where cooking out. Cooked up some hot dogs, hamburgers, and chicken shish-kabob's on the grill. It was awesome. Then we laid around and watched Life and Oh brother, where art thou? on tbs. For dessert we drove to Coldstone and picked up some ice cream then came back and watch tv again. Overall it was a really relaxing but good day. I enjoyed it alot and the food was freakin awesome. Our familys are probably going to cookout and swim together next weekend at Susan's house. That should be cool too.  Thats about it. No more to write, Later

      Well I haven't had a chance to update this in a while so I'm doing it now. Susan tricked me into saying she wouldn't be home until Thursday night but actually she got home Wednesday night. She said she had a surprise for me but I had no idea it was that. I heard a car and looked out the window and BAM there she was. It made me super happy. lol. So Thursday we just hungout at her house all day and she told me about what she did in Cali, showed me pictures, and then gave me some stuff she bought me. :)  Yesterday we went to the movies and saw Dodgeball. Move is funny as hell I wouldn't mind actually going to see it again. Then we went back to her house and hungout till like 10:40 or so and then I went home.  As for today my mom wanted me to go to some cookout thing with her and I called Susan to see if she wanted to go but she was asleep and didn't call back till my mom left. So now my mom is probably mad at me, But oh well. Its not even the 4th yet. So I don't see how I'm really ruining the holiday. =/ Susan is coming over now and should be here shortly. We might go and see the fireworks on Campus tonight but I'm not sure yet.  That's about it, I have no more to write. Later.

      Well the last couple days haven't been the greatest for me. Monday I didn't get to hangout with Susan at all, yesterday I did but it was a pretty short visit and today I didn't get to see her either. Seems as if she is too busy for me now. Makes me sad.  I don't really know whets happening right now; ive been sitting in my room in the dark for about 3 1/2 hours now. Not talking to anyone except to Kyle on AIM. Im bored and depressed and im going to lose my mind.  Susan and I are suppose to be leaving for Tampa tomorrow morning until Sunday but from the looks of it she really doesn't even want to hangout with me. She has been with her friend Brooke all day and I have talked to her on AIM like 2 or 3 times briefly. Hopefully she still wants to go but if she doesn't ill probably go and purposely get lost in Tampa or something and never return.  It rained today. It quit a while ago but, but its still raining in my head.
