      Well, today I have a few issues that I would like to share.  Number 1: I must really be in the blue, or else just not inquisitive enough...Am I the only person who did NOT know about Katie Murph's performance thingy...I think I might be...  Number 2: I got my Playstation 2 back (from a repair shop in Texas), and I think I'm becoming addicted to video games. I was on that thing at one time for 5 hours! Is that addiction, or is it addiction? My mom is spazzing cause she's been online more that I have! (And trust me, the world is changing if that's happening)  Number 3: I feel sooo left behind! I haven't been online for a few days, and look at all that I've missed! There's been stuff going on that I still have no idea about and....GRRR! It's not fair!!! I wanna know what is going on!!!  Number 4: Actually, this isn't much of an issue, but I was just wondering...How did everyone's graduation pictures turn out? Cause mine turned out AWESOME!! LOL!! I love my pictures, and the money was well spent! ^_^  Number 5: I am also renewing my membership to the I Hate Clarke Club. He didn't say anything to me, its just because everyone else is in it, so I figured that there must be a reason why it has resurfaced. So, like I said, I'm renewing my membership!  Number 6: I am craving a sandwich! Just a plain turkey and cheese sandwich...  Number 7: We have no cheese in the house! None whatsoever! I think that is horribly wrong, and should be fixed. So tomorrow (or whenever I can pull myself away from my Playstation 2) I will venture out to Fishers (yay!) and get myself some cheese!  Number 8: I saw the cutest pair of shoes at the mall! I forget the name of the store, but the shoes were soooo cute!! They were like thong-style flip-flops, but they had a heel!! A HEEL!! Like, an inch-high heel!! I was totally freaking out in the store and hyperventilating because I am addicted to heels! They were SOOO cute, but my mom said, "No, you're not getting them. They're not practical enough to wear everyday." Then we got into a mini-argument over whether we would choose practical or stylish, and I (of course) chose stylish! Who cares if they make your feet hurt? Soak your feet later! So anyways...I'm still stuck without the shoes and I don't think I'll be getting them any time soon, either. Bummer.  Um...I think that's it for tonight. After I get done talking to Joy, I'm gonna sign off and feed my addiction to my Playstation 2. Till then all, Love and Madness!

      OMG all!! So just about 1 minute ago, I was in a chat with Joy, Rebekkah, Clarke, Ashleigh, and Tim. We were talking about basically nothing when Rebekkah mentions how she talked to Adam (or something like that) So anyways, Ash blurts out, "What's up with you and Adam? Why do you always hang together? Does he like you or something?" OMG!!! What an IDIOT!! They're cousins, remember?!? Eww...incest!!! But yah, that was the whole jist of it, um, you'll probably see more about it on other people's blogs. So till next time, Love and Madness!

      LOL to the title. That came from Joy and I's talk about how in Washington, DC at breakfast when Joy tried to throw a cornbread muffin at Julia, but instead she missed and it his Ashleigh in the back of the head. OMG!!! So funny!! I was sitting between Ashleigh and Rob McClenaghan and all I could hear was me and Robert's laughing, Ashleigh's screaming at Joy, and Joy's loud squealing/shrieking laugh in back of me. Ashleigh went on a murder rampage after that incident. When I was talking to Joy on the phone, before I even brought the topic up, I was in hysterics, shaking and crying from laughter before Joy even knew what was going on. So, now I have an incredible headache from laughing so hard. Um, I'll do another post in about a half-hour, so until then all! Love and Madness!

      If you are reading this and you know me well, one thing you know I love doing is scouting out hot guys. I love to just look at them, gawk at them, and just drool over their good looks. There are many famous and non-famous men who I think are just delicious looking. LOL! Now for the list...  Famous: (not in any order) Brad Pitt Hugh Jackman Matt Damon Edward Burns (actor from Saving Private Ryan) Eminem Aaron Stanford (Pyro from X-Men 2) Brian Littrell (from the Backstreet Boys) (yes, I know, I need a life) Ashley Parker Angel (from O-Town) (omg, I embarrass myself!) Ricky Ullman Ryan Merriman Adam Lamberg Um...I think that might be it. If I forgot any, I'll just update the list.  Non-famous: Well, for the non-famous, I feel uncomfortable putting their names incase they happen to stumble along this list, so, like I always say, if you know me well enough, you should know who they are...BTW, only one of them is in our grade...sorry guys!  Okay, I'm sure you're reading this and thinking, "What is up with her taste in guys?" Well, I have a pretty distinct taste. I usually go for the "good-looking" type. You know, blonde/brown/black hair, blue/green/brown eyes, strong jawline, bright beautiful smile, and they have to have good hair! I usually go for any type of hair, as long as its a normal color, and it has to have a nice cut. It can be straight or curly, but it cannot be shaggy or ugly! Lol. Um, this kind of sounds like one of those online dating personals where it sounds like I'm looking for someone. Well, I'm not. At least not now, because I'm not allowed until I'm 16. Doesn't that suck?! My mom doesn't want me becoming a teenage slut/whore/ho/skank...whatever you want to call it. (lol, Joy) Um...my back is hurting and I'm gonna try and find something to do, so until the next post, all! Love and Madness! Please comment!!! ^_^ Much love!

      As you can tell, I'm not like a professional blogger...And I don't proofread my material at all. So on all my last posts, there are typos but hey, who cares? Right? Blogs should be spontaneous, not premeditaded. Haha. Um, my french teacher told me that I should proofread my work, but did I listen? No. I do whatever I want! This is another entry that shows that I have no life...Um...so yah, if you see any typos in my blog, just deal with it, cause I sure don't care. Well, I really think this might be the last blog of the day folks! But guess what? THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW!!!! LEBIF!!! (yah Joy, I made a little change to it. Now it stands for Laughing Evilly Because It's Funny) LOL! I'm off all, and remember, Love and Madness! (not that I'm stealing the autograph saying from the gay guy at Sheer Madness or anything...) YAY 2004 WASHINGTON DC TRIP!!

      I just noticed about a minute ago, that my blog looks like the front of our pack of printer paper. We use HP (Hewlett-Packard) and it's so weird cause I picked this format because it looked familiar to me, and go figure, it looks like my printer paper. LOL! Anywho, go to Joy's blog and go to Rebekkah's too (Um yah, that's it so till about an hour from now, Love and Madness!! LOL!!

      Well, it's 10:18 PM, and I have nothing better to do...I'm sitting here drinking ginger ale and just randomly typing here. I'm running many thoughts through my head about certain people in my life, how I wish my life was, and how Ashleigh and Clarke will ever last (but I won't get into that for your sake. It'll take too long...) Um, I'm not proud of this entry, but hey! Who cares right? I'm cold, tired, and I was hungry but I ate! I think I'm going to sign off, take a shower, and give myself some musical therapy (that's what I call it when I'm in a weird mood and I go into my room and blast my music up to the highest it will go and just listen to it and analyze it. My favorite song to do this to it Switchfoot's "Meant to Live". It's just something about that song...I don't know if it's the vocals, the guitars, or what, but man! I love that song sooooooo much! And when I saw Switchfoot perform it about a day ago, man, it was so frickin awesome! On my next post, I'll have to give you a rundown on famous (and non-famous) men and boys who are extremely hot! Yay! Till then all, Love and Madness!

      Just wondering... Was there a party at Lauren's house that I wasn't invited to? I mean, I don't really expect to be invited, but I thought I would at least hear about it...And then I read everyone's away messages and they generally say 'Over At Lauren's', or something along that line. Wow, I feel really left in the blue about this and I actually find it kind of funny. I mean, we had all those stupid 'exclusion' talks at CCDS, and look what's happening...  LOL! Just kidding! I don't feel excluded, even though I wasn't invited! I know you want to have those little get-togethers with your best friends and not invite anyone else...trust me, I've felt that way MANY times. Um...right...nothing left to say, except that my stomach is really hungry so I'm going to go put some yummilicious food in it!  BTW, today has been a total waste of left-on makeup...

      I have a few words for my fellow readers...  Fingers, urine, llama, butt, maternity, jumping, and furry.  You're probably wondering how all these words tie together (unless you're an alert and thinking Joy Raub...) . Well, e-mail me (Forever Rebel@aol.com) and if your right, I'll do something, I just don't know what it'll be yet. Um...kudos to who or what these words are about!  I also wanna give kudos and a big mazel tov to all the people closest to me such as:  In General...CCDS Class of 2004!!!  But other peeps such as: Ma homegirl, Joy! Ma other homegirl, Jules! Ma homeboys: Matt S, Robert M, and Michael! Ma other homegirls: Rach, Sahiba, Rebekkah, and Carolyn! Ma newest homeboy: Timmy Boy! Ma old-school homeboy: Danny! And to anyone else who I forgot...LOL  Don't hate cause I forgot you, cause now you can't complain to me about how much you don't like me cause we don't go to the same school anymore!!! Hahahahaha! That's only if you were going to say something bad...LOL, anyways...  Piece of advice for all boys and girls out there: Don't make-out and do nasty stuff in the bathroom with people named Eric (lol) that you've only known about 2 hours. It'll do the whole surrounding area some good! Just keep your hands (and your private parts) to yourself! They may come in handy one day when you're bored...LOL!!!  Well, do I have anything else to say for today? You bet I do! Go to poetry.com and search under the name Courtney Berry and go to the first poet you see named Courtney Berry and check out some of my poetry!  BTW, Robert, I really would love what your poem entitled 'Trebor' had to say in it!  BTW, Nick, aka soccerplaya17171, um...it seems as though you are trying really hard to build a friendly relationship with me, and that's kewl and all...it's just that, maybe you should approach it from a different angle. I mean, instead of me talking to you for one day and then you acting like you've known me for years, maybe you should ask me questions about myself. But I love you anyways!!!  Um, I think that's enough for this post...I don't wanna bore y'all...Love y'all much! Love and Madness!!

      Today, I have had a long and quite interesting talk with my best friend Joy. We talked long and hard about memories from our lame school CCDS about State History Day, Graduation, and other times where a certain someone (I will not mention the name for the person's sake...) was nitpicking at picking imaginary little fuzzies off all of the guys (and some teachers). Now, what is it with these magical little fuzzies just appearing all over people? And why do they only show up on men? I'm not sure, but I have never seen any of these mystery fuzzies on any of them...Maybe this person is just using some sort of hallucinogen and weirding out and seeing these little dancing fuzzies on all the men and having to touch them all over their bodies to get them off instead of just telling the guys and letting them take them off themselves. Interesting I know, and I will have more for you next time...

      Okay all, first off I would love to update all of you (which isn't very many, lol) on the current war brewing between Joy &amp; I and Ashleigh. Bascially, Ashleigh is just being a female dog (I have adults watching me type this, so I'm censoring it) and talking all kinds of crap about&nbsp;me to other people. I have been holding in a lot of things that I could have said to her to really crush her, but I'm a nice person, so I never did.  &nbsp;  But, I was browsing through my CD collection and I came across my Destiny's Child CD. There is this song on there that just blew me away with how similiar it was to how I felt about Ashleigh. So, I'll show y'all the song, but I had to tweak it a bit because some of the lines wouldn't have made sense with the situation we're in. So...here it is...Fancy, by Destiny's Child!  &nbsp;   I don't fancy you too much, child    I don't fancy you too much.    You think you're cute, you think you're fine,    You're always trying to steal my shine,    Get off of me, don't mess with me,    You know who you are.     &nbsp;   I've always been so nice to you, girl    Helping you, girl, there for you girl,    You've always tried to compete with me, girl,    Using me, girl, abusing me, girl.    Flirting with every man you see,    Especially if the man likes me.    Baby where's your self-esteem?    Find your own identity...     &nbsp;   You're a liar and a cheater,    And I dont want you no more, (lol, grammar, I know...)    Don't come hanging around my door,    I don't what you came here for,    If you didn't know, then now you know...     &nbsp;   I don't fancy you too much, child,    I don't fancy you too much.    You think you're cute, you think you're fine    You're always trying to steal my shine,    Get off of me, don't mess with me,    You know who you are.     &nbsp;   Roll those eyes girl, twist them hips girl,  Swing those hands all in the air.  If you wonder why you never had a best friend, I think I made myself clear.  Girl change your ways right now today,  Stop hating me, baby find your own identity!  You're a liar and a cheater.  I don't want you no more,  Don't come knockin' at my door  Don't know what you came here for, if you didn't know then now you know...     &nbsp;   I don't fancy you too much, child,  I don't fancy you too much.  You think you're cute, you think you're fine  You're always trying to steal my shine,  Get off of me, don't mess with me,  You know who you are.     &nbsp;  So, yah, that's basically the whole song, even though I chopped like half of it out. But, that's bascially how I feel but, there is more. Um, I'm also doing this just to update my blog since Joy keeps bugging me about it. ^_^  &nbsp;  BTW, Happy belated birthday, Joy! Even though I was the first one to tell you happy b-day "officially" at 12:00 am. Welcome to being 14 years old. Trust me, it's really nothing to celebrate...I hope you had a fun birthday and by the way you wrote it on your blog, it seems like you had a fun time.  &nbsp;  I think that might be it for this post, so, remember to VOTE KERRY! And stay away from Ashleigh...LEBIF!

      Well all, I am ridiculously bored and there is NOTHING going on with my life. Everyone is still in France, and Joy is STILL in Colorado. The only people I have to talk to are Clarke (fun, huh?) and Rebekkah (I luv u Beks!).   I got a letter from Aquinas about a week ago giving me the rundown on all I really need to know. I got basically everything except...my schedule. I am getting extremely ticked off because that's the most important thing to me. I would really not rather be walking around in the hallways not knowing what classes I have to go to. *roll eyes*   But...I got my uniform requirements. Hoo boy. They're really not that bad, but it's going to be a big change. Basically, it's just like a plain white, yellow, or light blue button down shirt, and brown, black, or tan pants. But--we have to have one regualtion skirt. They're actually ::kinda:: cute...Even though I really hate plaid. But, I'm definitely NOT getting a pleated skirt--I HATE pleats! I'm getting a "four-gore kilt". It's not too bad--it's just kinda like four pleats in the front and the back is flat. Um, everything else isn't really that bad. But the shoes can't be taller that 2 inches! That is SO wrong!!! I love heels!! 2 inches is NOT tall enough! ;_;  I also got my summer reading assignment. Wow, CCDS really overworked us with summer reading. I only have to read 1 book! 1, count 'em, 1 book! Yay! It's called Parrot In The Oven and it's by Victor Martinez. I still haven't gotten it yet because the library didn't have any copies and I don't feel like buying it from Borders. The school was even so kind as to reserve copies for us Freshman at Borders. How sweet, huh?  So, yah, I'm really excited for high school. Um...I'm actually starting to get kinda nervous.  I am so bored that I am actually holding somewhat of a conversation with Clarke. And I was the one who started it. Omg, I must be losing my sanity...  Forever Rebel [10:46 PM]:  hey   alben19 [10:46 PM]:  wat do u wnat  alben19 [10:46 PM]:  j/k  Forever Rebel [10:46 PM]:  now u sound like me...   alben19 [10:46 PM]:  hey wats up  Forever Rebel [10:46 PM]:  nm   Forever Rebel [10:47 PM]:  there's no one to talk to, except u, so that's what im doing   alben19 [10:47 PM]:  ash was on  alben19 [10:48 PM]:  but i was still in bed  Forever Rebel [10:49 PM]:  how was she on?

Um, VOTE KERRY!!!

      Can you believe it? I, Courtney, have a strong guilty conscience. And I hate it. I put up a rather mean post yesterday bashing Ashleigh and Clarke (not that I don't do it anyways) but, I felt that I went a bit too far, and so, if it is not deleted right now, it will be. I hate my guilty conscience. That's all for now, I guess...

      About the title...my orientation is FRIDAY!!! I am sooooo excited!!!! The only thing I'm not excited about is having to face Ashleigh, but, I guess I'll just have to learn to block her out...  So, on a lighter note...I got my schedule like 2 weeks ago and I'm going to follow the hip new trend of posting your schedule for the whole internet community to see and have their mouths drop in awe over.  1st Semester:  1. Gov't & Economics - this is weird cause every other school around us takes world studies first, but no, we take this first.. 2. PE - should have taken it in the summer... 3. French 2 - maybe 3...hahahaha! Take that, Wade! Lol 4. Lit 5. Phys. Sci 6. Lunch 7. Study Hall 8. Religion 9. Algebra - yes I am taking it over cause I SUCK at math!  2nd Semester: All the same except... Mod 2: Choir Mod 7: Health  A lot of things are still pending on my schedule, but yah, I'm  really excited!!  Till next time all, (B)uck (F)ush!!  A village in Texas is looking for it's idiot Bush - go home!! Save the environment - Plant a Bush back in Texas I am a full-fledged Bushwhacker and damn proud of it!!!

      Well, I can't believe it has been this long since I have blogged. Um...actually, I'm not in the mood to write, so this is just so that I wont have to see that last entry on my blog. I will try to update more often, so until then...remember to keep your hands and your private parts to yourself, because one day, they both may come in handy, if you know what I mean...lol.
