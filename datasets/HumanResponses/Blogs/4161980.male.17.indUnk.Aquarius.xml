      I really dislike old people.  I mean i think when i reach a certian age where i become irrate and cruel towards America's youth, i want to die.  I mean can you imagine me driving when i'm old.  I am bad enough now.  I don't need to have the drivers of the world suffer even more.

      I was watching the Olympics tonight with my brother Mike and as a fillerbetween events, they talked about the formation of the Chinese Olympic teams.  Apparently, they hold tryouts for kids when they are 8 or 9 years old.  This helps them weed out the gifted children so they can start training at what they are good at, at a young age.  Personally, i think this is a genious strategy and show just one more positive side of communism.  Now I hate to toot the Maria horn here, actually i don't, but I sort of feel bad for her.  I feel as though she is somewhat of an outcast from the other Russians.  I don't think it bothers her, but she missed an oppertunity to compete in the Olympics!  Anastasia Myskina, Nadia Petrova, Elena Dementieva, and Svetlana Kuzetsova.  Svetlana and Nadia are ranked lower than Maria.  Svetlana is 9 and Nadia is 15.  Compared to Maria's ranking of 8, this seems unfair.  The fact of teh matter is, an Olympic team needs team harmony.  Because Maria doesn't fit into this clique and doesn't play doubles with any of the high ranked Russian puts her at a disadvantage.  Maria is no doubt a better player than Sventlana, Nadia, and perhaps even Elena.  Hopefully she remain high in the rankings for the next four years and compete and win a medal in the next summer olympics.

      Well i got my wish and i didn't realize how painful it was.  Deep down i was upset with Maria Mania.  All of the press attenion that Maria was getting really made me feel left out.  I was one of first people to like Maria.  Heck, every day in Chemistry, i would give a mini Maria report to Teddi, Kerri, Cassie, and Matt.  After the reaching the quarters in the Frech i remained ingnorant to the fact that her star was quickly rising.  She had gotten to the final 8 on her worst surface, clay.  Then she entered Wimbledon after winning the DFS doubles and singles title.  She raced through the tournement beating her oponents with ease.  She then showed her ability to come back after facing Ai Suygma and Lindsey Davenport.  I was dissapointed, however, to see that instead of facing the top ranked Russian Anastasia Myskina, she faced Amy Fraizer.  I had hoped that Maria would prove herself and emerge as the best Russian in tennis.  Then she crushed Sereena in front of my eyes on one of the blurriest TVs that i have ever watched.  I continued to show my support for her even though i could barely make out the image of the ball, let alone her beautiful figure.  Not many 'casual fans' would do this, but simply shrug it off for Sports Center.  Then the next day, i watched the match a second time, yes, a second time, at my aunts cabin at the lake.  I was so happy for Maria, but i was in for the shock of my life when i returned home from my vacation in New York.  Cut off from the media, i didn't know the field day they were having with my beautiful Russian.  I became somewhat lost in all of her photos, interviews, and 'fans'.  Fans that just saw her as a beautiful face.  Not an amazing athlete.   Maria has since then taken some time off and participated in the Acura Classic, where she reached the quarters and fell to Myskina and the Rogers Cup where she recently lost to Vera Zvonerava, another Russian, in the 3rd round.  This concerns me as Maria, since Wimbledon, having a losing record against her country.  Russian players have dominated most of the draws from the beginning of the season.  5 Russians reached the final 8 at the Rogers Cup.  In the Acura Classic, there were 4 Russians.  Maria needs to practice in order to combat her countrywomen if she plans to continue her sucess and raise in her 8 ranked position in the rankings.   I will be a Maria Sharapova fan through good and bad.  I am a true fan.
