      I am very sad sad sad yesterday becos of someone in our clique. I feel like so tired in my clique, why they must qurral everytime or let someone punch them. ANd the worst is they act like nothing had happen. " Should i leave the clique ?" have come across my mind everytime. I dun noe wat to do...... The pain in my heart yesterday almost make me cry really cry. When there is a clique meeting or watever, i will always keep quiet cos i feel so scared until i dun noe what to say. Really... nothing to say. Must this always happen on me, like the other time in primary school. I am so scared .... so scared until i dun dare to think to the negative side.Am i so silly to cry or feel scared??

      Hmm... i am so angry this morning. I noe later wat i am going to say is very hurtful but i am really angry. This morning in the 63 bus, there were a bunch of students from outram sec and they were standing on the pathment of ther bus. When i have reach my stop, i walked to the door to get down. Then those idots is like an ailen, dun understand wat i say" Excuse me!". Then finally is the worst and ever stupid guy i ever met. He was standing infront of the door and his right hand was like holding on to the pole. When i was infront of him, i say excuse me as i need to get down and he is blocking me. I say 4 times " Excuse me!!!" and his hand is like keep on holding on the pole. I was so angry tat i shouted at him and the stupid bus driver closed the door and drive a little bit futher of the bus stop. I keep pressing the bell and he was like DEAF!  My sister shouted to him and everyone is looking. When the stupid guy finally let go his hand and as i walk down the stairs i say something which is " FUCK YOu ". I really cant stand it. How come got this type of students who is like so inconsiderate. Stupid school got stupid students. I ...... hope this will not happen on me again or else i will really go mad. haix... she was standing there laughing and i thought she talk to me so i also talk back to her. And i realise she is talking to my sister. So malu!!!! Fine, sharon say something abt her today and i dun remeber liao. I dun noe wat to do and i just wish to forget everything as it is so pain and tired. Really.....

      i cried again... We didnt talk to each other today.And it was like she wanted me to talk to her first. I dun want i really had enough. WHy must i always be the one to speak up first? Does she really treat me as her _____ ? Or she just need a person to company her and i am the one? I really had enough... i feel like crying everytime. Why cant she make the first move for ONCE? Why cant she? Actually i also dun noe wat type of friendship is this? Is she still considered as my best fren after tat qurral in primary school? Or wat? I really sick and get tired. Why must i pleased her everytime ? How long should i remain like this? Can someone pls tell me wat i should do....... I say Sorry to her and she didnt say tat magic word back to me and say " nvm lah". AM i always in the wrong? Am i ..... sometimes i doubt abt our relationship. She dun noe wat i am thinking in the every moment, and i knew. She dun noe tat among all my fren she hurt me the most. She really dun noe.... Alysia said something today and it make sense to me, " those pple who is our enemy tends to understand us the most and the best fren is always the one who doesnt understand us". Is she really my true best fren or my best fren is my enemy? I am so damn confuse. Not going on ...

I tried very hard to smile,joke,laugh and talk to her like normal but i dun feel like i am still so close to her.Why is it that, just one message made my impression change totally.Whenever i think of it, i will still cried like shit.No one understand how i feel or what i had gone through.I felt very lonely sometimes as i dun noe who to turn to when i need to say it out.I think i am so usless as i only knows how to cry and dun dare to talk to her.I am very scared,very very scared.Becos i once lost all my frens and now i dun wish to happen.I did everything to prevent it from happening like, i tolerate the way she treat me and i try to give in to her.But this is the way she treat me back.Change topic,i am going to cry soon.Hehee...  Had been sick for like 4/5 days.All becos of the fried tofu i had for every 3 meals.I also dun wish to eat tofu just that my dad wants the whole family to be strict vegan for 2 weeks.I am going to die hahahaha... My sister kept telling me that she every night dreamt of eating a big feast.Stop here!!

      I am so tired of everything. i dun understand why must she treat her good fren like tat. Is tat her tat i noe from the beinging. Why must she do this to me? i really dun understand..... IS it our friendship is not important than her love relationship. WHy must she makes me feel so terrible like my heart had just shattered. I really dun noe how to face her or talk to her. Should i scold her or just ignore. Rumors had been going round, pple kept asking me " Are you her best fren?". Telling me her bad words infront of me... i can ignore it but should i savage our friendship or i should let go. She is just making me to hate her like the other one. Why must it be her not others!!! I called the black women just now and talked to her. ANd i cried over the phone, am i silly to cried for her? But i feel a little better. But i am sure tat this matter is not going to rest cos..........

      hmmm... i miss my sister,she had just left for her CCA camp.Just read some pple's blog.And i come across one person blog and wat tat person say sound quite true.  For you: Why must i let some problems ruin our friendship,it really dun worth it.Maybe you dun noe how i feel when i am with you,but i also dun wish to hurt you.Rumors are just a pack of words,why must i let it concern me.Although you did hurt me but i will try to forget it cos no use holding on to the past to the future when it does not help.Pple should always be given a second chance.I also dun wish to end our friendship as we are already so many yrs best friends.After some time of thinking shall i savage our friendship,i choose to savage it.It is very hard to start a new chapter in anyone life especially when you had a good or best friends.Maybe one day in the future,when we sit down and talk abt our days when we were young,we may laugh like shit of the things we did.I am sure one day,the four of us will sit down together and talk.And i am going to organise it.Haha.. tats all.  To the clique: Hey,i am fine now as i had solve my problems.I would also like to take this chance telling you guys how i feel in this clique.Although i am always very quiet when we had clique meeting,but i had alots of things hoping to tell you gals.I am very glad tat i am in this clique although the person i dun like is in the same clique with me,i still control.Sometimes i really feel like giving up,but somethings always stops me from doing it.It was the memories tat i had with you gals.You gals did made an impact in my life,and i nv ever regreting to start a new chapter with you all.Although my best friend sometimes dun like me hanging with you gals,maybe becos i spent too much time with you.I can understand tat friendship always had ups and downs but after a while it will be fine.Even though many times someone wants to leave the clique,the others members will do their best to stop tat person.That is the clique sprit.In this clique,i had seen or gone through alots,my thinking did mature(dun laugh) and i am more patient.Dun think tat i always look happy tats mean i got no problems,you are wrong i had a whole stack of problems but i dun wish to touch it cos i hate solving it as many things could happen.Sometimes i will feel lonely in the clique or feeling very far apart from you gals.But i just keep quiet cos i dun think i am the only one and i dun wish to make a fuss.Many times after a clique meeting,i will always ask myself should i give up and leave the clique?I love to be with the clique members as you all always cheer me up,give my some advice or comfort me.I admit tat this yr i did cried alot mainly is the chairperson position.I am looking forward to our next clique gathering which i am planning.Ya..tats all!!

       I am now phsically and emotionally pain.Physically as my whole body are aching becos of that walk.But it will be ok after a while.Emotionally as yesterday i msg the whole clique accept bel and ying min that i feel like leaving the clique.I'm so sorry,but i really cant perseve anymore,i always got a feeling that i was not in the clique.Maybe everytime during the clique meeting i got nothing to say, actually i got alots of thing to say.But i dun noe where to start. This clique was form in last year where all the 11 of us were in the same class.When we are separated to different class,we start to have problems.We always tried to solve the problems,even the most difficult one. In the end,i think it just get worst. I always tried to have&nbsp; positive thinking that once all the problems are solve,we will be like last year.The answer is 'NO'. I am too naive to have that thinking.Recently i just quarrel with ying min, i realized that actually i was all along the one who can stand her,maybe still got someone. Val talk to me yesterday,she say she know why i am sad. I was feeling so terrible yesterday,i feel like hiding myself at a corner and cry.From the being i hate to be a chairperson but i became one of it.I am not proud to be one. I dun understand why i must put up with everyone and wearing a happy smile on my face while other people can have so many different types of faces.I really feel very tired,ying min yesterday msg me&nbsp; some message of friendship.I cry this morning when i read it,why because i didnt expect her to sent me.I admit i feel much more closer to ying min,bel and cor&nbsp;then the rest but i feel more hurt when i got angry with them. I dun feel regret to be in this clique as i always say i am so unlucky with someone i dun like to be. I did tried to accept her but she just cheated me again and again.I really dun noe how to trust her. You all may blame me but i really cant take it anymore. No one understand how i feel now...    My dad friends just passed away on thursday night,his friend dote on me since i was young i really dun understand why she got to die.I cant&nbsp;take it anymore since one by one who i really love just leave me. I feeling lonely as really lonely .

       School sucks today and yesterday.Yesterday,i was so pissed off with someone.And she dun noe why i am angry with her?Becos she insist that mrs wong stared at her is my fault but it is actually no,purse took a alot of my cornflakes that makes me shout.So is it my fault that i shout? But who made me shout? She keep on saying and i was like"ya,it is my fault". Hey,i got temper and patience.I kept controling my anger cos it was really not my fault. Until the last period, i cant stand it cos she just pissed me off just like that. She say i am petty. What if she was the one who didnt do anything wrong and someone keeps saying she was the one.Will you get pissed off. I am not petty it is just that why she can be angry but not me. I am human too. And the another one keeps stepping my skirt and causing footprints on my skirt. It was so dirty . So unlucky that i met cor,juli,sharon and jia rui at the bus stop,and the moment they ask me what happen i just break down. I hate it so much.   Today i didnt really talk to her accept&nbsp;abt the class thingy. Alysia they all ask me why i am angry and dun be angry with her. But i am really mad. I noe friends normally qurral ya then after awhile they will be ok. So let it be for awhile.    Went town with misa to shop.Ok that is very tired cos i actually wanted to go home early and sleep ya. We went to many places.town really changed alot.Haha... Going to buy milk chocolate for my faezah hahaha... Promise her liao ya.

       So i got no problems ok.. My dear dear reply me hahaha in a lousy paper.But at least she did reply me.Today all the lesson are a horror to me,we got to go here and there.ANd in the end,someone lost her way.Can't believe it! Let me clarify something, Sheila and I are both innocent ok,nth happens.I can't wait to see Ying min and Sheila break up.Hahaha... Sheila say i am not concern abt my dear dear,but then does it concern abt her.She is so KPO!!! Hahah.. i know that i sounds mean here but i am just joking. My bus bell didnt come to school today,i heard her mum say she was having fever the past few days,and her fever was like 'on' and 'off'. I hope she is ok cos i kinda miss her. (She) had broken up with her boyfriend and it is like becos of his 'O' level. I dun think that is a good reason anyway i dun care cos i am washing my hands off her business.The whole school stay back today to practice the FUSION DANCE,i think that is a disaster. Today i feel very tired i wish to sleep forever.

      Okay i know i am very pathetic becos my so called lastest entry was like a month ago. Hehee... cant blame me,pple will be LAZY at certain times.Lets talk,i was suppose to go out with sheila,farezah and batu to watch SPIDER-man two.Yah, in the end it was cancel becos someone got to eat maggie mee to save up $$ to buy tickets.But i dun blame her lah cos she had spent her daily allowance on her recess.Haha.. i hope she will read my entry.On the last saturday, I went to cut hair,oh man, that hair stylist was like pronounce my name wrongly.But he did a good job as he cut my hair until very NICE.I am falling in love with my hair.Wow wow wow,then on the actual day i wore skirt it was like so uncomfortable cos i am used to sit very roughly ya.Then went CHIJMES, it was like wasting time there somemore so HOT!! But i did a good deed as i donated $0.70. Haha... Later went to Orchard for dinner,end up no time as i need to go home early ya.Change subject now.I miss my daddy!! Hehee.. Without him around at home, i cant come home late when i go out,not enough $$ to spend and i miss his nagging.Haha.. i know i am weird ya.  I felt that i am treating her very cold as i try to avoid her as much as i can.I know how she treats me, it just that Xinxin told me before no breaking up friendship. Ya,pple did ask me why she treat me like that and somemore i can tolerate.I dun feel like searching for the answer in my heart cos i will be sad when i find it.Dun talk abt her lah.'Clique' hmmm... i dun noe whether i should give up hope anot cos it is like everyone seems like wanting to split.I really agree on what Zenn say'Friends better dun talk abt love relationship between each other cos it will only strain the friendship' Ya.I hope the both of them to be friends back although they are not together cos i dun think it is worth to lose a friend if he/she is a good friend.Ya,batu told me she think it is worth to lose a friend if that person is bad. But i wonder what if one day, you need that person's help how are you gonna to ask for the help? Yup. I think thats all.I will always sit beside my bed everynight to pray that nothing will let us decide on the worst decision as to split cos i dun think it is worth just becos of some stupid reasons ya.Sheila, i hope this is my lastes ENTRY not a month ago. ok...

But i am not mad at her lah.Nowadays i am telling myself to study hard as i cant retain cos i will be killed by my dad.So i must improve on my maths.But i am so lazy to concentrate.I keep reminding myself to save $$$ cos i need $$ to buy thing that i want. Ya.. too bad, i had been spending too much $$. Just as i expected, that faezah had spend all her $$ on foods and now she got no $$ to watch movie with me. Haix... another pig.My hs also got a pig she can spend half of her daily allowance in one day by buying food. Can't imagine what they eat!!! Fine.. I think thats all. Oh ya!
