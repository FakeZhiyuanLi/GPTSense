        My day was horrible today.  Apart from the "drama" in "Shakespeare's theatre" my heart was tied in a knot.  After coming home my madre informed me that Orlando would not be coming home this weekend because he had something to do in Bristol.  I do understand that this is a new life both exciting and adventurous, but I also understand the pain I experienced when realizing I would not see him for another week.  I knew this wouldn't be easy, it just sucks.  There are beautiful, sophisticated girls there and I am some simpleton with which there lies no mystery or intrigue.  I am old, boring and worn out.   Also, I know that I am a bit too dramatic and am making this situation sound much worse than it is, but heck, this is a journal for me right?  I can say whatever the hell I want to!  I really want Orlando to follow his heart and if he wants to participate in anything he can go for it.  I want him to enjoy college, experience new things and have fun...I just miss him...that's all.  I love Orlando.

        Hopefully, you have figured out that my "theme" is William Shakespeare's  As You Like It . I, of course, am Rosalind, the strong-willed, independant young woman and Orlando is my lover. He left this morning and I was trying to find a way to dispense my emotions. I thought this would be much more exciting than a journal.    As I mentioned he left this morning. It is the strangest feeling for him to be so distant. Orlando holds in his chest the other half of my soul. I feel empty without him. They say "absence makes the heart grow fonder." I hope this is just a little bump in the cobble-stone street. We have been together for 3 years. Most couples are married by that time, but our ages keep us waiting. We are still young and must establish our careers first. I have small doubt that our love will fail, I just hope my Orlando will not be tempted by an Eve to eat (or whatever else) a forbidden fruit.   If the fruit is "consumed" I will be left with no other choice but to close the gates of Eden, not matter the pain. But once again, I have small doubt. Our love is strong and shall brave the elements! I love Orlando...as he does me.   But "True is it that we have seen better days." -William Shakespeare,  As You Like It
