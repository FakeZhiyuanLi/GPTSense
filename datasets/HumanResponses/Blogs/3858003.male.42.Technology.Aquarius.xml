        urlLink    Aug 18, 2003 - Avi, Will and our dog, Valentine.  Valentine is a Scilian Mastiff and was the only baby in our house until Shai came along.  When we started our adoption process, we created a letter to introduce ourselves to expectant mothers who were looking to find a loving home for their baby.  You can view our letter at: &nbsp; urlLink http://avi.goldberg.net/avi_and_will_are_adopting.htm &nbsp; urlLink

       Welcome to our SwampLog.  This is the Weblog we are starting as a place to store our thoughts, feelings, photos, opinions, and just about anything else about our family.    The Garcia-Goldberg family.  In October 2003, my partner, Will, and I were blessed with the birth of a little boy that we adopted - his name is Shai Garrett Garcia-Goldberg, our son.  His birthmother Bekci, lived with us for the last month of her pregnancy and together we formed a unique bond via the process of Open Adoption.  Our little boy, has brought much wonder and blessedness into our lives.  We describe the feeling that being a family brings as a deep, rich, lush swamp - hence the name of our "blog": SwampLog.

       Some days, Shai, you can be a really cranky baby.  I guess that’s all part of being a baby, but sometimes it can really work your Papi’s nerves.  Papi (you know the big guy they call Willie) knows you don’t really mean to get so cranky, but after all he takes care of you day in and day out, and doesn’t always get a lot of help from your Daddy (me) because I’m usually at work all day.  So do me a favor and take it easy on him…he really wants to be the best dad a baby can have, but you don’t have to test him so hard.
