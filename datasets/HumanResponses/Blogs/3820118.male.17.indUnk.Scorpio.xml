      Let me tell you, when I sneeze, I really sneeze.&nbsp; Just now I was sitting at my computer playing America’s Army, and it all came out.&nbsp; Maybe even some brain tissue.&nbsp; Anyway, not to get into details or anything, but I had to give my arms, my keyboard, my cell phone, my mouse pad, my monitor, oh and let’s not forget my face, a bath.&nbsp; Then I couldn’t stop sneezing for about two minutes.

      I’ve realized, I order too much stuff online.&nbsp; It’s not that I enjoy spending money; I just enjoy receiving packages in the mail.&nbsp; I think if I would’ve gotten more mail when I was younger, I wouldn’t have this urge to buy things.&nbsp; Although, the things I buy are completely worth it.&nbsp; I guess this is just another sickness I can add in with my lying.

      &nbsp;I bought the limited edition Asics Onitsuka Tai Chi shoes that were used in Kill Bill Vol. 1.&nbsp; I got these about a month before Vol. 2 came out, which was a good thing, seeing as how they sold out before Vol. 2’s release. &nbsp;Even though I had to fork out $160 dollars, I feel my investment was worth it.&nbsp; Tonight I checked eBay, and several pairs of the shoes I own, were selling for 200-300 dollars.&nbsp; I’d say I came out ahead, even though everyone else that I know feels I’m stupid for paying that much.&nbsp; The way I see it, if Quentin ever did release a Volume 3, my shoes would go up in value. &nbsp;Also, if (and yes I do say if) Quentin Tarantino were to die, my shoes would go up in value.&nbsp;

      This is a caution for everyone who wears pants.&nbsp; When applying the pants to your body, be sure not to place your foot into the pants with the heel going in first.&nbsp; This will result in pain and possible death.&nbsp; I did this, and it almost cost my life.&nbsp; Please, for your sake and your family’s, don’t kill yourself while putting pants on.

      Just to let everyone know, this Sunday at 4:00pm Eastern Time, Domino’s Pizza on HWY 8 in Lexington, N.C. will be closed.&nbsp; We are having a mandatory meeting (which we get paid to attend) to resolve any work conflicts.&nbsp; It’s basically like psychiatry, only with pizza.

      As I was taking a shower tonight, I came across something. &nbsp;I knew it shouldn’t have been there, it was so out of place.&nbsp; I reached up, and right above my lip was a pubic hair.&nbsp; Now, normally if it was mine I wouldn’t care, but this time wasn’t mine.&nbsp; This time, it was a blonde pubic hair.&nbsp; While staring at the curled hair in my fingers, I wondered, who’s could it be?&nbsp; No one in my family had blonde hair.&nbsp; No one I knew that came to my house had blonde hair.&nbsp; My mom and dad were gone almost all day.&nbsp; My sister’s away at a girl scout camp and my brother left after I woke up.&nbsp; So who was the owner of this mystery pubic hair?&nbsp; The world may never know.

      Working at a place like Domino's should be illegal.  In order for the store to make any profit, the workers can't get paid much, or work very often.  So therefore, I only get to work four days out of the week.  Then, once I get dressed and drive up to the store, I get sent home around two to four hours after being there.  Personally, I think that should be illegal.  I'm not sure what they could do to improve, but something needs to be done.  Maybe a kid's meal?

      Not true for today.  Actually, today Doug was cooler than normal.  You see, at some point this week, most likely today though, the QRT was supposed to come.  QRT - Some jackass hired by corporate Domino's that drives to all the different stores and checks the cleanliness and toppings on the pizzas.  Last time he came, we had a different manager.  He wanted everything clean.  He even made me scrub down the heat racks with a little pink toothbrush.  Now that didn't bother me too much, but I figured Doug would have been ten times worse.  Not true.  Today he really didn't seem to care about anything we did.  I messed up on thirty chicken wings, he didn't care.  Then I messed up on a medium thin crust extravaganza, he didn't care.  It was great.  So now I ask myself, where has this Doug been?  The Doug that was a great asst. manager.

      I can’t get enough of there beer-bellied rednecks who love all big things of life.  Basic redneck male:  I love my big ol wife, and my big cans of beer, and my big ol truck, and my big trailer.  I like to go out to big restaurants like the Copper Slop Bucket and eat big plates of food so that I can work on my big gut.  Then I like to go home and drink several big cans of beer then beat my big wife and throw her on my big bed and ravage her big hole.  Then after nine big months, we have a big ten pound baby, living in my big trailer, and I’ve become a big waste space and perfectly good oxygen.

      Frank Sinatra is amazing.  Every time I hear him sing, it reminds me of my mom’s dad, whom I’ve never met.  Every picture I saw of him though reminds me of Frank Sinatra.  He wore that kind of “playboy” swag that looked refined and casual.  There’s nothing better in life than sitting at my computer, hearing ol’ blue eyes singing.

      Alright, so if you know anyone who’s a homosexual, and they get into a car accident or something, and they go into a coma, you can tell the family of the gay guy, “Hey, he was a vegetable, now he’s a fruit.  At least he’s still in the produce section.”  What do call a cocksucker from Guatemala?  A tropical fruit.

      I was just watching TV when a commercial came on for birth control.  The commercial was advertising a new pill called "seasonale" the makes a female only have four periods a year.  Now I'm thinking to myself, how the hell can that be healthy?  If females were meant to have only four periods a year, they would.  I picture a lot of lawsuits in the future.

      I have the sweatiest underarm's known to man.  These boys sweat like pigs, and it's always very obvious.  It doesn't bother me that I have a huge patch of moisture on my shirt, I just find it kind of odd.  I never see anyone else in the world walk around everyday with sweat patches.  I don't need to be doing anything to sweat either.  I've been sitting at my computer all day, wearing deodorant, and I've still got some sweaty ass arms.  I've tried every kind of anti-perspirant, I've tried shaving my armpits (thinking maybe all the hair kept heat inside, causing sweat), and NOTHING WORKS!  I think I'll just chop my arms off.  urlLink

      I found my cat around X-Mas time.  She wasn't nearly as big as she is now, nor was she as fluffy.  I originally picked her up as a present for my girlfriend, since she loves cats.  Well, my girlfriend's parents wouldn't let her have the cat, so instead, I kept it.  It came time to take the cat to the vet.  This was a rather surprising visit, because the vet said my cat (which looked like a kitten, and was half the size of my other cats) had already been pregnant twice, it was missing half its teeth due to fights, and it had scars all over it's body.  So, after this lovely visit to the vet, where I got so much information, it was time for a name.  The only thing that popped into my head was Miss "N".  The reason I chose this name?  Well, my cat was taken out of residential area by me, therefore it's missing.  Then, it's a female, so Miss.  Finally, it's had a tough childhood, and already been pregnant twice, "N" for nigger.  So there you have it folk.  Oh, and I'm not racist, I'm just using a stereotype for my cat's name.

      Damn, I never thought I'd collect comic books.  I always thought that would be the coolest thing in the world, be a comic book guy.  I used to own the 300th Anniversary Edition of The Uncanny X-Men.  That was supposed to be my comic that was going to start it all.  Well was I ever wrong.  Over the course of the past two days, I've already ordered 15 of the 35 Maxx comic books.  So now, my comic book days have begun.

      That's right, there's a cool guy in Tallahassee, Florida who makes copies of the original episodes of the Maxx.  It’s a two disc set for only $9.99 and shipping/handling is only $3.00.  I’d recommend anyone and everyone to buy a copy of this great re-release of The Maxx.  You can find The Maxx  urlLink here .  urlLink

       Barney  – alternative way to say trouble; it comes from the name Barney Ruble (The Flintstones) .and Barney’s last name, Ruble, rhymes with trouble.   Droogs  – term used for a crowd of people who defend each other; similar to gang or posse.   Gullet  – the chunk of fat that hangs in between your chin and your neck.   Gulliver  – British slang for stomach; traditionally used when talking about stomach pains.   Ripley’s  – alternative to the saying “believe it or not”; the idea came from the popular TV show Ripley’s Believe it or Not.   Twas  – not really slang, really just old English that I incorporate into my everyday conversations.   I have so many different words I make up each day or unordinary words that I use.  Check this post frequently for new additions.

      Some how, on the way back from getting my cell phone fixed, my dad and I got to talking about his job situation, and his career experiences in life.  He might be getting a job with Rack Room Shoes in Charlotte, which means he’ll have closer, permanent job then the one he has now.  Anyway, after we got done talking about his current job position, we started talking about his life at PPG.  He was telling me about how his old boss, Wes, just got fired the other week.  He was told the reason he got fired was for playing games on his computer (what a stupid fucking reason.)  So anyway, then my dad got to talking about what he did during his breaks and he told me all about his comfortable chair, and the story of how he acquired it.  You see, shortly after my dad had just started there, PPG passed around a catalog and told everyone to pick out which chair they wanted.  Well everyone else in the factory picked really expensive “ergonomic” chairs.  Not my dad, no sir, he said “Fuck ergonomics”, and when he got that catalog he picked out “…a fucking comfortable chair” and on top of that, his chair was roughly one hundred dollars cheaper than everyone else’s.  Then once he got it, everyone else was jealous and wanted to trade with him.  He then proceeded to tell me how he’d lie back in his swivel chair and prop his legs up and take him a nice hour and a half nap.  He misses that chair to this day.    Yeah, that’s my dad, always looking for a way to get out of actually working.  Like father like son.

      Stephen King used to be such a great man.  Since his release of the Green Mile, he's gone down hill.  I was watching Kingdom Hospital today, and I just thought the concept was stupid.  An anteater that can shape shift and speak.  Ghosts that shoot blue lasers out of their hands.  What the hell has Stephen done?  Then, on top of not being able to write anything worth reading, and releasing shit grade movies, he goes and downgrades Kill Bill.  Who the hell is he to talk bad about Kill Bill?  His mind is fucked.  Also, he needs to keep the fucking beard, he looks ten times better.  urlLink

      I think in all honesty, I’d give up anything in life, to work with Quentin Tarantino, George Carlin, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Moore.  Carlin, Moore, and Buscemi would of course be acting in the film.  Then I could be the guy that gets Tarantino coffee or orange juice, maybe even fruit punch; just as long as I could sit by his side and watch the master at work.  urlLink

      I was lying in my room just now watching “Eyes Wide Shut” when I had a craving for Mexican food or something hot and spicy.  So, naturally, I got up and traveled to the kitchen.  When I got there, I noticed all sorts of wonderful Mexican meals I could’ve eaten.  There was chips and salsa, a special dip my mom makes with sour cream, black olives, and cheese, even, chicken quesadillas.  After searching through the vast amounts of food we had, I finally chose…. Coco Krispies.  I know, I know, what the hell was I thinking?  Well I’ll tell you what I was thinking.  I wanted food right then, the second I walked into the kitchen, I wanted my food ready.  So damn it, instead of taking time to heat anything up, I made my ass a bowl of cold, chocolate, cereal.

      Alright, so I’ve got it narrowed down to about four different animals.  The first one, a ferret, wouldn’t happen any time soon; just because I share a room with my 21 year old brother.  The second and third are two separate water species that I’ve wanted for quite some time.  The second is a blue lobster/crayfish.  They just look cool, and I’d like to have two or three of them.  The third is some type of exotic frog.  I just like frogs.  The fourth one is kind of a stretch for me, a lizard of some sort.  Now what I was thinking about doing was setting up a cool tank that had both lobsters and a lizard.  I’d make three quarters of the take water, with gravel, and let the lobsters hang out there.  Then I’d have a little sand beach for the lizard, with trees and such to climb around in.  I think it would work out, but I’m afraid when the lizard drinks, the lobster might get mean and try to have lunch.  Maybe I’ll just have to try it and find out.

      No need to go into detail on this one.  If you’re a fat ass, don’t eat at an "all you can eat" buffet, especially if you’re not happy with your weight.  It’s fucking common sense.  Try a lean cuisine for a change.

      I hate big deal birthdays.  First it’s 13, not really that big of a deal, but it’s when you become a teenager.  Next is 16, sweet 16.  I don’t really remember anything too sweet about my 16th birthday.  Then 18, which is coming up for me, is the time you become an adult.  Well I considered myself an adult at 13.  After 18 comes 21.  21, the legal age to buy alcohol, big fucking deal; most people drink plenty of alcohol before the age of 18.  BIG TIME GAP.  40, the stupidest big deal day of them all; by the time your 40, you shouldn’t care how old you are.  People who celebrate 40th birthdays and think it’s a big should be shot, at least twice.  Then comes 50.  I’m not even about to comment on 50.  Basically the same rules apply as 40.

Every day I see some fat guy in blue jeans or shorts riding a motorcycle I get pissed.  Bikers used to wear black leather, smoke, drink, rape women, and piss blood.

      So I went to my dad's barber.  He's a cool old southern NRA kind of guy.  He's got this awesome pearl white fro and a mustache to boot.  Basically I let him free style my haircut, but I told him to make sure it was clean-cut and very 50's looking.  So he got to work.  During this whole experiment, my dad and the barber talked about Bears in the wilderness.  Needless to say, I'm satisfied with my haircut.  urlLink

I bet that guy at the front of the bicycle pig parade is a proud conservative Christian, and I also bet he molests children on his spare time.  While on the topic of child molestation, read the interesting did you know fact below.  DID YOU KNOW? Doug (my manager) has a daughter who was molested.  In addition, a fellow employee, Rob, has a criminal conviction for child molestation.    How can I not love Lexington?

      I don’t need to party, especially for no reason, with my co-workers.  Tonight there were two parties.  One involves lots of booze and probably some form of statutory rape.  The other is just a couple of friends, getting together to drink much more alcohol and shoot heroin and smoke pot on the side.  Now let’s think, what am I doing?  I’m driving.  On top of that, I don’t do drugs.  Why would I want to hang out at two pointless parties?  Although, I don’t know, maybe someone died at one of the parties.  That would’ve been worth it, especially if it was someone I knew.

      Today Doug was just an overwhelming asshole.  It all began with him eyeballing my and looking like a dumbass.  Since I couldn't stand the sight of the fool, I flipped him off and told him to kiss my ass.  Then he said, "You're pushing it Ben."  I wonder what that's supposed to mean.  I hope he'll fire me.  Since I was pushing him so much, i decided another nudge wouldn't hurt.  I then placed fifty chicken wings in the oven stacked on top of each other, that way they wouldn't cook.  Next thing you know I hear "BEN!!" coming from Doug.  "DID YOU DO THIS?" well i don't know Doug, I might have, I can't quite remember.  Then, after his ploy to ditch work, he came back in to Domino's to give us some kind of printer paper for the credit card machine.  Before he made it into the door, Sam, Alisha, and I shot Doug another bird.  Well need less to say, that didn't make him too happy.  He said "You guys need to be doing something more productive than shooting me the bird."  What could be more productive, I thought.  Then after that, Doug left.  So, I got to spend the rest of the night making pizzas and money.

      Who could ever forget the Maxx?  I can remember late nights staying up just so I could see the big, sad, purple, hobo.  I don't think any superhero has influenced me more than the Maxx, and the sad thing is, most people have never even heard of him.  The Story of the Maxx:  Though he thinks he's a typical super hero, Maxx is homeless and lives in a dumpster in New York relying on handouts from Julia Winters, a social worker working out of her home. Maxx dreams of another reality where he's a hero, in an imaginary land similar to the Australian Outback. On their adventures in the outback/real world, these characters encounter Mr. Gone, a caped figure who perpetrates crimes on women with the help of small creatures called "isz".  I about spent $75.99 (a whole paycheck) on a Maxx action figure last night.  Just so I would have something to remember him by and I'd always have something cool to look at.  Maybe some day the Maxx will hit it big and come back from Africa.  urlLink

      Everyone seems to be in love with the Atkins diet these days.  Most of America, or at least the people who hate themselves, want to loose weight and please society.  Well I have the top three greatest diets in the world, and best of all, they’re proven effective.  1.	The Tape Worm Diet – Simply ingest a single tape worm.  You can eat whatever you want, whenever you want, and the tape worm will do all the work.  Just wait and watch those pounds shed off. 2.	The Finger Diet – A great diet, even though it’ll affect your looks in other ways.  Just cram your longest finger down the back of your throat, and watch magic happen. 3.	The Holocaust Diet – The Nazis loved this diet.  This one is more difficult than the other two, but still works just as well, if not better.  Every other day, eat one slice of moldy bread.  You’ll be gaunt in a matter of days.  So there you have it folks.  Not exactly the preferred methods of losing weight, but proven effective, and cheap too.

      It didn’t really hit me till tonight.  The reason I love and will continue to stick with my girlfriend.  Most of my life, I’d been the guy who got picked on.  The guy who never got the girl and the guy that was always the fat ass.  This wasn’t always true though.  When I was younger, before the fourth grade, life was great.  I was the fastest runner in my class, and everyone seemed to like me.  But all of that was about to change.  I can remember my first experience of rejection like it was yesterday.  The odd thing is, it wasn’t rejection by a female.  It was rejection by guys that I thought were my friends.    It was my ten year old birthday.  The day I stopped caring about people.  I invited a couple of my friends to go see the new hit movie Space Jam.   You know the one with Michael Jordan and all those crazy Looney Toons characters.  I only invited four guys.  My four closest friends:  Bobby Seaman, Seth Firquin, Anthony Marker, and Antonio “_______” (he moved.)  We got into the movie, and got great seats.  We were the only people in the movie other than my mom and dad, who sat on the opposite side of the theater.  As we were watching the opening previews for the movie, the preview for 101 Dalmatians came on.  After several funny scenes of the movie, and what I thought were funny comments from everyone, I decided to make a comment.  It was about a scene where one of the two crooks fell on an electric or barbed wire fence (I can’t remember which one.)  Immediately after that scene, I quietly said “Ouch, did you see where that hit” or something along those lines.  Seth Firquin then said, “Why’d we invite this faggot?”  Pain to my ears.  Someone I considered a friend.  Probably my closest friend out of the group just talked shit about me.  After he made that comment, the rest of them joined in, bashing me in their own little group; all except Bobby Seaman.  Can you imagine how you would feel on your birthday?  Then after the movie, I had to spend the rest of the night with them, even eating dinner with ‘em.  From that day forward my life had went to shits.  In the sixth grade, I met my first “love.”  Her name was Amber Leffew.  I had met her at my sister’s Girl Scout meetings.  I thought we’d hit it off, but she wanted me to go out with her twin sister Ashley.  I almost had my first kiss in the parking lot of a church.  I spent most of my sixth grade year chasing after Amber.  I even kept a sad pathetic little journal about how much I “loved” her.  Then, about half way through the year, Amber met Naza, a hot, buff, Mexican.  He had joined the group of cool jocks guys that made my life hell at the movie theater only two years before.  Once again another heart-breaking moment:  As I was standing in the hall, while everyone else was using the bathroom, Naza and his droogs decided to poke fun at me.  “No wonder Amber wouldn’t want a guy like you; you’re a fat ass with a little dick.”  Then all of his friends began chuckling.  Assholes.  By now it’s my seventh grade year.  Middle school is hell.  It was around October, and I was in physical education.  I hated PE, and this day only assured my hate for the general population.  After a grueling hour of working out, playing pointless games that never amounted to anything, not even fun, it was time to change clothes.  I was always the guy who waited last to change.  When I put on my clothes, they were wet.  After I put them on, I noticed an odd odor.  I reached down to smell my shirt, and then realized what it was.  Some fuckers had relieved themselves on my only pair of clean clothes.  So now I was faced with the problem of wearing urine soaked clothes all day.  I began crying in the locker room, only to be stopped abruptly by my gym teacher.  She never asked why I was taking so long, as if she would’ve even cared.  When I left the gym, I hurried to my next class, and asked the teacher in there what I should do.  She was awe struck.  She told me to go to the guidance office and talk to them.  I wanted to go home.  When I arrived in the guidance office, they gave me a pair of old elementary hand me down clothes that was two sizes too small.  I continued the rest of the day feeling such depression.  Nothing else was ever said about that day.  Time for eighth grade.  I accumulated a few “friends.”  None of them ever new anything about me though, we just talked and they allowed me to hang around them.  One day at the lunch table I made a joke about making a list of people I’d like to see get knocked off.  The funny thing about the list though, was all the people on it were my friends.  I’d put them on there for silly reasons too.  Like someone took my orange, so I added them to my list and they even sat there and watched me do it.  Then, Felicia Sherman, who I never told about my list, told her mom about it.  That resulted in a week of suspension from school and a visit to a psychologist, to determine if I was going to kill anyone or not.  Of course, I’m sane, and he even told me I was a “genius.”  Then, later on that year I got suspended from school for participating in theft at our local theme park.  Because of the suspension, one guy I considered a great friend, Michael Holbrook, went to a different school.  So now I had to go into high school with my best friend.  My first year of high school went by quickly and lonely.  Though I came across a “great” person.  She seemed like a sister.  That relationship didn’t last long at all.  She only seemed to talk negatively about herself, and never said anything good about me or herself.  That negativity just wasn’t right for me.  At the end of my ninth grade year, I noticed someone in my keyboarding class, Kristi Weaver.  She was someone who always had a smile on her face and always wanted to make everyone else happy.  I told a friend in Algebra class about this mystery female, who was older than me, and hopelessly out of reach.  Eventually I found out that she might be joining the school Yearbook staff, which led to me placing an application.  I got into the class, yet she never applied.  Even though we weren’t forced to be close together, everything seemed to work out.  We started dating.  The thing that struck me about her though, and that made me want to stay with her even though it got stressful at times, was the fact that she really seemed to like me.  She was the only person that ever made comments about me being sexy or funny.  In the past everyone had talked down to me, or degraded me.  This girl was different for sure.  Then I got my payback.  The girl I had started dating, used to date a “cool” person, Cory Sullivan.  Cory wasn’t happy with me, or the fact that I was dating his ex.  To combat my relationship with my new found love, he began making threats.  He told Kristi she had changed.  That she wasn’t the good Christian girl he once knew, and that I was the one changing her.  That didn’t affect her love for me.  Then the instant messaging battles started.  Each night I was instant messaged by Cory and his droogs.  They made death threats and repeatedly called me a homosexual (only in cruder terms.)  Each time I got messaged and was threatened, I wasn’t fazed at all.  My love for this girl was like a protective plate of steel, that nothing could penetrate.  After almost a year of being hassled, Cory came clean.  He let me know the only reason he was an ass to me, was because he was jealous of my happiness and my ability to not care what another person has to say.    After that, my high school life was set.  Since then, things have only gotten better and better.  I’ve got more friends than ever, almost everyone seems to know me, I’m going to be the editor of the Yearbook staff, I don’t care what other people have to say about me and I’ve got a beautiful girl that makes me feel good about myself.  All and all, I can honestly say, even though life sucked throughout school, I’m happy I had to go through because it made me probably the emotionally strongest, open-minded person I know.

      I can’t stand driving places.  It’s not that I don’t enjoy the easy travel; it’s just the fact that while I’m driving, I kill everything in my way.  One night, as I was coming home from a friend’s house, I killed an Opossum.  That night was one of the few moments, past the age of ten, which I’ve cried.  After I hit the poor bastard, I had to stop my car and reflect.  We, as humans, are so greedy.  We think the earth is ours.  I hate that about mankind.  Hopefully, at some point, I’ll be able to quit using an automobile to get around.

      Even though my cat can be an evil little son of a bitch sometimes, I love it.  I don’t think I’ve ever liked a cat more.  I think the reason I’m so attracted to it, is because it’s about as lazy as can be.  It has three laying spots, and one eating spot.  If it’s not in any of those places, then it’s traveling to one of ‘em.     urlLink

      Don't ever buy the Motorola T720 model phone.  It's a worthless little shit.  Granted it's been a semi-great phone for a while.  Last night I tried to plug her up to charge, and nothing happened.  Tried my mom's charger, nothing happened.  Switched the charger to several different outlets, nothing happened.  Can you see where I'm going with this?  I hate my phone.

      Alright, here’s another easy meal.  This one's a little more healthy, but not much.  Ingredients are as follows:  1 Package - Kraft Velveeta Cheese Extra Thick 1 Bag – Hamburger Buns with Sesame Seeds 1 Bottle – I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter Spray  Simply grease up your pan with the ICBINB spray and then began heating it.  Now while the pan is heating, make your grilled cheese, adding ICBINB as needed.  Now place the grilled cheese in the pan and let sizzle.  Before you flip it the first time, make sure and push on the top of you grilled cheese, to flatten it.  Continue doing this till the bread is a nice dark brown.  Now remove the grilled cheese and enjoy.  Make as many as you’d like, the whole family will love them, even grandma.

      He doesn't suck because he did anything in particular, I just can't stand to look at him, or hear him speak.  Anything he does or says makes me want to just kick him in the jaw.  Sometimes I wish he would?  Quit.   So anyway, on a lighter note; I was standing around today at work, as usual, when Christy (a driver) came in with a problem.   “My hubcaps lying in the middle of the road, and my foot hurts, will you please go get it?” is what she uttered to Doug.  Well of course Doug being the asshole that he is replied “I can’t leave the store, who else would manage it?”  So I decided to play Frogger, or I should say Benner.  I casually walked out in the road while several cars were zooming past me left and right.  I actually think I felt the mirror of a mini van brush up against me.  Once I grabbed the hubcap I realized it was broken, so I left it there and dodged cars back to the store.  Christy yelled at me for leaving it out there, and said she’d fix it with duct tape.  Of course, a typical redneck thing to do, repair everything in life with the wondrous grey tape.  So I then went back into the road, once again dodging cars (even more this time.)  I brought the hub back and handed it to Christy.  Doug then said, “You should have made her go get it.”  To that I replied “Doug, I would’ve done that, but I’m not a rude ass prick.”

      I wonder if children my age or younger ever take the time to just lay down outside and watch the stars, a sunset, or the clouds.  I hear old timers and baby boomers say all the time that they used to enjoy doing things like that when they were children.  Are today’s youth too caught up in technology that they don’t have the time for nature’s simple pleasures?  The other day, while I was at work, a storm quickly rushed through my town.  After the storm had passed, I went to take out the cardboard boxes to the dumpster.  While I was outside I noticed the lightning off in the distance.  How could we as human beings not stop to appreciate something so beautiful?  Then when I started to make my way back inside, I noticed a break in the clouds, where it was a gorgeous blue.  Then I stopped what I was doing, and took about three or so minutes just to enjoy the scenery.  It looked almost like a painting in the sky.  I just hope, at some point, every child and teenager can take time out of their “busy” life to enjoy nature.

      So imagine it's the middle of the summer.  You haven’t eaten anything all day.  You’re vacationing at the beach with your family, but there’s a catch, two families that are “friends” of your family are there.  At around 5:00, your family decides to go grab something to eat.   You arrive at supposedly the greatest restaurant on the beach, “Mollies” on Friday night.  When you get there, there’s a bit of a wait.  Now there’s five in my family, and four in the other family that ate with us.  When we get in there, all the parents sit on one side of the room, while my girlfriend and I had to sit with two toddlers and my sister.  After waiting thirty minutes to place our order, I started to realize, this place isn’t all that great.  But oh wait, it gets better.  So after waiting for two hours, we finally got our food, and it didn’t look like very much.  These restaurants prices were outrageous too, $14.95 for a plate of shrimp scampi that was maybe the size of my fist and taste like greasy noodles with frozen shrimp.  Now after spending a total of ten seconds eating my food, the child across the table from me spills his Coke into my plate.  My bread was soaked, the noodles became Coke flavored, and everything was brown.  Now this didn’t faze me at all, I continued eating every bit of my meal.  Then my mom and the waitress noticed it and decided “Oh you can’t eat that; let me go get you another plate.”  At this point, I’m wondering if I’ll be out of this hell hole by midnight.  Surprisingly, in only thirty minutes, I got a plate back, although they forgot my two pieces of garlic toasted bread.  So after going through this entire ordeal, I was told I had to take the children, who ruined my meal, to Wings (the chain of tourist traps.)  Once I got over there, I ditched the kids.  By now, it’s 9:00 at night, and I’m starving.  Now you would think, after going through all of this, I’d be angry?  Not at all.  I’ve come to find out that I am the most mellow, calm, peaceful person I know.  I enjoy the fact that I can be happy and enjoy myself, even through the worst of times.

      Alright imagine.  It’s 8:00 in the morning.  You’re a freshman in high school sitting in your science class.  You spend the whole class period picking around with friends, sleeping and talking.  Then the bell rings at 9:30.  You walk down the hall, but something’s different.  People are stunned, crying, and acting hysterical.  I didn’t realize something was wrong until I made it to my second period class where the TV was turned on.  I noticed a very familiar building that had smoke billowing from it.  It was the World Trade Center.  Okay.  Now it’s one month later.  American pride is booming.  There are American flags every where, and every shows support for each other.  It seems as if the nation is finally bonding.  Now think about today.  Where have all the American flags gone?  What ever happened to the little flags hanging out of car windows?  The flag magnets on the back cars?  People wearing patriotic t-shirts?  You mean to tell me we only care about America, and show our pride for it, when several citizens die by foreign terrorist hands?  Or is it because we lost our tallest buildings?  Today we’re in a war.  A war that’s beginning to look like another Vietnam.  Yet I very seldom see any sign of patriotism.  Where are our hearts lying?

      Have you ever noticed certain things are taboo or just not right, or that you’re supposed to do certain things because society says so?  Take wearing deodorant for instance.  My dad doesn’t wear deodorant, and neither does my co-worker Sam.  Why is that wrong?  Sure, they smell a bit, but who cares?  I don’t, and they don’t.  So why, because society says, “YOU HAVE TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH, YOU MUST WEAR DEODORANT, YOU MUST BE SKINNY AND BEAUTIFUL”, does everyone listen?  I’m not a beautiful person, I’m not skinny, and occasionally I don’t brush my teeth or wear deodorant.  Does that make me disgusting or wrong?  I’m happy with my life.  I’m comfortable each and every day.  Society can say whatever they want, but I don’t care, I’m going to live my life how I want to.

      Now if you’re not afraid of carbs, high fat, or high sodium, this recipe is for you.  Alright, so you’re going to need:  2 Packages – DiGiorno Three Cheese Tortellini 2 Packages – Cubed Ham 1 Bundle – Green Onions 1 Package – Swiss Cheese 1 Bottle – Ranch Dressing  Now once you’ve got all your ingredients, boil the noodles and slice up the onions and cheese.  Now, once the noodles are cooked, at everything together in a fairly large bowl, except the cheese and dressing.  Then set inside the refrigerator.  Now once the noodles have cooled down, add the cheese and dressing.  Now mix together, and you’ve got a meal for at least five people, probably more.

      Whoever made my school schedule is either a saint or an asshole.  I can’t decide yet.  You see, I have two classes at my school, which doesn’t bother me.  But then, I have to drive, during third period, about five to six miles to a school behind our old K-Mart (now Roses, big upgrade.)  Now this bothers me, because I’ll have to leave school immediately after second period, rush to Eanes (the school behind Roses), then come back to school for Yearbook.  This could be good or bad.  I’m hoping it’s going to be good, because when I think about it more and more, third period is the longest period at my school (due to lunch.)   So, since my class is only fifty minutes at Eanes, and classes are normally an hour and thirty minutes at school, plus lunch time, it may be grand.  Although, I don’t know where I’ll eat.

      I got to thinking about this the other day.  What does something smell like when it rots?  It’s been my experience that it smells pretty bad.  So, what does your breath smell like in the morning?  Pretty bad, I’m guessing.  You know why that is?  It’s because when you watch the television, it rots your brain, causing it to begin to smell.  When you sleep at night, the smell rises out of your skull, and it escapes through your mouth.  That’s why your breath smells.  It’s because you’re watching way too much TV.

Don’t waste your money.

      I can’t get enough of those Ovaltine commercials.   Just watching how unrealistic they are, and how horrible the acting is, makes me giggle.  I saw a commercial the other day that had a father grilling out in a park.  As he was grilling, several children ran up and said “More Ovaltine Please!” so he immediately poured them all a glass.  As they were drinking this wonderful chocolate beverage, they each explained why Ovaltine was great.  Then at the end of the commercial, the grill-master explained why kids love it.

      I wonder what the new slang/racist word will be in several hundred years.  I got to thinking about this the other night.  Now a day saying the word “nigger” or “nigga” seems to be the cool thing to say; and just imagine if the racist firefighters/police from Mississippi were still living today, and could see today’s culture.  Although I don’t understand why I never hear people go around saying chink or spic.  But in several hundred, or maybe even thousands, of years everyone should look the same; or at least the same skin tone for that matter.  So what will people talk about then?  Will they come up with some new slang term for short people?  “Hey, look at look at that midg over there” (Referring to midget.)  I hope they come up with something cool.

      Since I was starving tonight, because I hadnt eaten anything all day, my father made me some bratwurst.  Now he told me I could eat all I wanted, and he would eat the leftovers for breakfast in the morning.  That sound like a good idea to me.  I eat three brats with some salt and vinegar chips, expecting there to still be three brats in the kitchen.  But, unbeknownst to me, the last three brats went missing.

      I was reading through the book of Genesis the other day when a thought occurred to me.  Supposedly God made light, and he called it day, then he made it dark and called it night.  What lovely names.  But then, if you continue your reading, it says he created the sun on the fourth day.  Now how the hell are you going to have day or night without a sun?  What ancient Hebrew jerk off wrote this book of fairy tales.  He should have proof-read his material before making it public.  After all, that's the kind of shit I have to do in my Yearbook class.

      Tonight, I decided to sit and spend some time with my mom.  She has this obsession with watching reality TV shows like Survivor and Big Brother.  Well tonight the new Big Brother 5 and the new Amazing Race came on.  I didn’t really have too much of a problem with Big Brother 5, yet.  But, the Amazing Race was awful.  It started out introducing the different teams, and boy were they a hoot.  The teams consisted of a midget and her sister, a black internet entrepreneur couple, an elderly marine and his sheltered daughter, two pizza making brothers, conservative Christian models, a cast member from an older season of Big Brother and her boyfriend (whom she doesn’t get along with), an elderly couple that meet online after their spouses died of cancer, two twins who argue a lot, and middle-aged bowling moms.  Now I’m thinking, “Where the hell do they find these people?”  After I figured out the answer to that question, which was of course America, I asked myself “How the hell do they expect a midget to run around the world?  After all, midgets have short legs, and can’t run very fast; and if there’s any kind of rock climbing or anything, she wouldn’t be very good competition.”  So after pondering both these questions, the race started and immediately it got brutal.  The teams were ordered to run from one end of a pier to the other end, and load up in some nice new Mercedes-Benz.  When the teams started running, it was as if they were running from the bulls.  Two men, one being the elderly marine fellow, got knocked down and trampled.  About ten minutes into the show, you find out that when the man fell, he hit some nails sticking up out of the pier, resulting in him needing stitches and ruining some new pants with loads of blood.  But the saddest thing of them all about this show, had to be the fact that not only was I watching it, but so was at least one one-thousandth of America.  That bothered me.

      Now realize, I would never pay for a meal at Golden Corral, or as I like to call it “the Copper Slop Bucket.”  But since my girlfriend, Kristi, was closing tonight, I figured I might as well spend three hours enjoying free food and white trash.  Although everyone that comes into the Copper Slop Bucket isn’t white trash, a lot are black or even yellow.  During the afternoon, after I got my paycheck and cashed it, I decided I’d be a nice young man and pay my girlfriend a visit at work.  Big mistake.  As soon as I started to drive towards the Copper Slop Bucket, a Pepsi can in my back seat began to leak slowly.  It was spewing every where.  So while this annoying can is destroying my car, the asshole on the other side of the road swerved into my lane.  “FUCKING JERK OFF” I began to yell.  So once I got into the parking lot, I began to search for the can.  Once I caught the little bastard I quickly laid it out side of my car.  Smooth move dumbass I thought to myself.  The can was squirting upwards, right onto my driver side door and window.  When I opened the door it got on the inside of my car.  Another fucking mess I have to clean.  As I’m sitting enjoying my “fine” meal (of which I never had dessert) I noticed and abnormally large female wobbling towards me.  Now this lady obviously had to realize she had a weight problem.  What struck me as odd though was the fact that she had just paid for her buffet, and she immediately made her way to the dessert bar.  Now as I’m sitting here watching her pile on chocolate brownie after chocolate brownie, with extra sprinkles of course, I began to think.  I wonder if she realizes the reason her ankles jiggle is because she stuffs her face with sweets and carbs.  Now I’m not supporting low carb diets by any means, but for Christ sakes people, five buttered up rolls are too many.  When will people ever learn?  Once again as I’m enjoying slop from the trough, I noticed another lady.  This lady didn’t do anything that annoyed me; she just looked like a fucking retard.  Now keep in mind, it’s the middle of July.  This lady was wearing an orange shirt with a pastel purple sweatshirt.  What the fuck, it’s the middle of the summer, and it’s not like she’s cold either.   She’s wearing short denim shorts, which was too much, mainly because she was in her late 30’s so her thighs were kind of, yeah.   Also, she’s wearing red Reebok tennis shoes.  Now, on top of all of that, the best thing of them all was her hair.  She had greasy Gerri-curls like something out of the 80’s.  What the hell was this ladies problem?  I know I’m no homosexual model or anything, but I know what looks like shit and what doesn’t.  Then to finish off the night, some little boy stood in front of the restroom where I was eating.  The restrooms were closed because one of the employees was cleaning them.  So the little boy decided he best spends five minutes waiting for them to open.   He was no more than six feet away from me, holding his baby cock, whining and making groaning noises.    I don’t think I can handle Lexington much longer.

      Seeing as how yesterday was 4th of July, a lot of people were going out and having good times.  My fellow co-workers decided to do the same thing.  I was invited to meet everyone at Domino's at 1:00 am to travel to some co-workers house.  Now this house belonged to two lesbian lovers; so automatically, I'm thinking bad idea.  Also, the girl who invited me is known to be really easy, and she's mentioned before she'd like to have her way with me.  Then, on top of that, there's supposed to be loads of booze.  Now let me stop for a second and think.  Several co-workers, lesbian lovers, a slut, and alcohol; this doesn't sound like the kind of bonding I wish to participate in.  So today, when I went to go pick up my lousy paycheck (and when I say lousy, I mean $76.99 for two weeks) I was bombarded at the door with stories.  The two lesbians made out with all the girls.  Several girls ran around outside naked.  The assistant manager took photos of the slut's bare ass, and the slut was giving out free lap dances.  So, after hearing all of this, I'm invited to come to another party tonight.  I think I’m going to have to pass.

      I've been sick all of my life. I'm a chronic liar. This troubles me because I don't want to lie. I find myself lying at the strangest times; times that I don't need or want to lie. Afterwards I ask myself why I just lied to this person, and I can never seem to find an answer.

      I'm in the mood for Chinese food. I find this to be a common problem.  I think I'll move next door to an oriental restaurant when I get older.   urlLink

      Why do opossums, squirrels, and frogs seem to feel the need to commit suicide each day?  Is life as an animal really all that bad?  It's almost as if they realize the car's coming down the road, and they don't care.  I feel so bad for them, but then again, if life's really that bad, fuck 'em.

      What the hell happened to southern hospitality?  Being the young southern gentleman that I am, I often wonder, why is everyone so damn pissed off?  As I'm driving down the road, everyone seems to think they own it.  If I'm standing in line in a store, everyone's rude. So what happened? Are computers and new technologies overwhelming the minds of simple-minded rednecks?  Surely not.

      So I was walking outside of my local redneck watering hole (Wal-Mart) and I noticed a rather peculiar sight.  An elder man was rolling his wheelchair up towards the store when he realized he had just rolled over some gum.  The next thing I knew, he was blood red, ranting and raving about "GODDAMN BASTARDS WITH THEIR GUM!."  After I got in my car I began to ponder, why is it that the able bodied people spit their gum on the floor, only to make themselves and others angry.  This is something that will bother me for quite some time.  But I'll still be the guy who sticks gum in all sorts of funny places.  LIKE MY  STOMACH !

      My Boss at Domino's Pizza is a son of a bitch.  I was standing there, just minding my own business making pizzas, when my manager decided to say loudly "Fuck all Democrats, Democrats need to just die."  Now how am I to feel, a very liberal democrat, when my boss (a person I once considered my friend) talks shit about my opinion.  I reacted to what he said the only way I could think of at the time.  "FUCK YOU DOUG!" with my middle finger at attention, waving in the air.  Being amazed at my reaction, Doug turned around and asked "are you a Democrat Ben?" I immediately replied proudly with a "YEAH!"  Then, my manager had the nerve to say, "I'm sorry I offended you, actually I'm sorry you’re a democrat."  After that Doug and I got into a rather large argument.  He proceeded to say, "I think we should kill all the Iraqis, every damn one of 'em." To that I replied, "What did the Iraqis ever do to us?"  "They came over here and blew up our buildings." he responded.  So then I asked "Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't that Osama and Afghanistan?" He then proceeded to say "Yeah, but Saddam funded them."  I then fired back saying, "Well what about in the late 80s, when the United States funded Osama with a million dollars?" Pretty much, after that, he kept his mouth shut about the war in Iraq. Then, as I was getting back to work, I overheard my manager and a driver start talking about gay marriage.  They were firing back in forth talking about how if gays are allowed to marry, the next thing will be incest.  I find this rather odd, seeing as how one third of our employees at Domino's are either lesbian or bisexual.

      Alright. Now just imagine, you've meet the person of your dreams.  They're perfect in every single way you ever thought possible.  You realize you want to spend the rest of your life with them.  Therefore you have a wedding. Why? What is the need of the wedding ceremony?  I've heard it's so the wife can be the most beautiful women in the room at the time.  But really, that shouldn't matter.  If the man really loves the wife, he should always think she's the most beautiful women in the room.  So what's the point?  Is it the "great" sex at the end of the night? Because where I'm from, you don't need to go on a honeymoon to have great sex.  So why not, instead of running off and having a wedding with all your friends, just have a great life.  Spend every day proclaiming your love to your spouse.  Spend every night having a great night, sex or no sex.  I just can't see the point though, of wasting "X" amount of money on a wedding.   urlLink
