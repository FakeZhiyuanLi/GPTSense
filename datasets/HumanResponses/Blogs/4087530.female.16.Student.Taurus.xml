      Now watching " urlLink Asterix erobert Rom ", I guess for like the 10*10th time or so, but it paradoxicly never bores me, it is really funny. On this occasion, I should also mention my second favourite Asterix movie ever which is "Asterix und Cleopatra".

       urlLink What country are you?   My result: You're the United Nations!Most people think you're ineffective, but you are trying to completely save the world from itself, so there's always going to be a long way to go.  You're always the one trying to get friends to talk to each other, enemies to talk to each other, anyone who can to just talk instead of beating each other about the head and torso.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and you get very schizophrenic as a result.  But your heart is in the right place, and sometimes also in New York.  (well, earlier I was France^^")  I also did the Book Test, and I was "Watership Down"

      What is an  urlLink Art*o*mat ? Created in 1997, Art*o*mat machines are retired cigarette vending machines that have been converted to vend art. Currently, there are 71 ACTIVE MACHINES in museums and various locations throughout the country.   "Interestingly, according to modern astronomers, space is finite. This is a very comforting thought - particularly for people who can never remember where they have left things." - Woody Allen

      Momentarily listening to "Micronomic" on Lali Puna´s LP " urlLink Faking the books "   urlLink Some things to do with liquid nitrogen   Here are some of my favourites:  Put on a rubber surgical glove with a hot dog (saussage) stuck in one of the fingers. Put the hot dog in the liquid nitrogen and then, to the amazementof your friends, smash your "finger" with a hammer. (Wes Denisson)Comment: Keep in mind which finger...  Get a pot of boiling water and pour some nitrogen in it. You will watch the mists of hell shrouding the floor. It's good fun to test how longyou can stand sticking a finger into it - a cool feeling ...  Freeze a can of shaving cream and then peel the can away from thecream. Put the canless cream into someone's car. Let the oven-likeheat from the car's sitting in the sun defrost the shaving cream. 2 cans will fill an entire car. (Coulter C. Henry, Jr.) [sarcastic laugh]

      So, the following lyrics belong to another one of my favourite songs which is called  Monochrome (Yann Tiersen)   "anyway i can try anything it´s the same circle   that leads to nowhere   i´m so tired now   anyway i´ve lost my face,   my dignity, my look,   everything is gone   and i´m tired now    but don´t be scared,   i found a good job   and i go    to work   everyday on   my old bicycle you loved   monochrome floors   monochrome walls   only absence near me   nothing but silence around me   monochrome flat   monochrome life   only absence near me   nothing but silence around me    i´m pilling up some unread books   under my bed   and i really think i´ll never read again   no concentration just a white disorder   everywhere around me you know   i´m so tired now    but don´t worry,   i often go to dinners and parties   with some old friends   who care for me take me back home and stay   monochrome floors   monochrome walls   only absence near me   nothing but silence around me   monochrome flat   monochrome life   only absence near me   nothing but silence around me    sometimes i search an event   or something to remind me   but i really got nothing in my mind   sometimes i open the windows   and listen people walking   in the down streets   there is life out there    but don´t be scared,   i found a good job and i go   to work   everyday on   my old bicycle you loved anyway i can try anything it´s the same circle   leading me nowhere   and i´m tired now   anyway i´ve lost my face,   my dignity, my look,   everything is gone   and i´m tired now    but don´t be scared,   i found a good job   and i go   to work   everyday on   my old bicycle you loved   monochrome floors   monochrome walls   only absence near me   nothing but silence around me   monochrome flat   monochrome life   only absence near me   nothing but silence around me"   Well, I have to admit that it represents my mood sometimes -.-

      Did I really slept till almost 12:00? -.- ...and I´m still tired *sigh*  Well, okay here are the lyrics of one of my favourite songs (eventually it is known to you from the  Cruel Intentions  OST).  Ordinary Life (Kristen Barry)   "and i shed my soul, feel it kneeling down   i´m clutching my faith, pull it tightly round   you´re moving your mouth, but you don´t make a sound   but i feel the walls slowly tearing down    heel to toe takes you from my side   in and out, every breath divides   my eyes to your head, i can´t go the distance   but when you go you take me in an instant    in this life, i´ll give it time   ´cause it´s always spinning up from behind   it´ll be alright, it will be fine   ´cause it´s nothing more than ordinary life    and i show you my sins, show me all your scars   as we settle in, it´s written in the stars   your watery eyes got me send me floating   and my weak heart is swimming with devotion    in this life, i´ll give it time   ´cause it´s always spinning up from behind   it´ll be alright, it will be fine   ´cause it´s nothing more than ordinary life"

      The following lyrics belong to two other songs of   urlLink Wir sind Helden    We only must want (" urlLink Müssen nur wollen ")   "Do I always have to must what I can One hand carries the world and the other one offers drinks? I can with all my ten feet in twenty doors and with the eleventh one in the nose still perform ballets But if I could how I wanted I wouldn´t want anything at all But I know that everybody is ought to want something -  We can do everything exactly like the pippin trained monkeys we only must want we only must want we only must want we only must  Do I always have to must what I can One hand in the stars the other one in the ass of the front man? This is the land of the limited impossibilities We can ride horses backwards without legs We can everything that is too tight widen with the percussion drill We can be lucky and nonetheless lead affiliated groups  We can do everything just like the pippin trained monkeys we only must want we only must want we only must want we only must"   Good afternoon? (" urlLink Guten Tag ")   "My voice against your cell phone My wrists against your nail care lotion My teeth against the ones of Dr. Best and his son My soul against your soft epilation  It was in the selling off, in the offerings, this special action Exchange of dumb old life for a new version I had it barely tested at home when I already knew that there was something wrong with this product - this is the reclamation  Good afternoon good afternoon I want my life back I do not exchange anymore I want my life back Good afternoon I admit I was delighted first but your life does not tweak and pressure only when you stoop - Good afternoon  My voice against the one of the whole talkshow nation My wrists for a tired Halleluja and beans My teeth against your tame revolution Visions against the absolute television  It was in the selling off, in the offerings, this special action Exchange of dumb old life for a new version I had it barely tested at home when I already knew that there was something wrong with this product - this is the reclamation  Good afternoon good afternoon I want my life back I do not exchange anymore I want my life back Good afternoon I admit I was delighted first but your life does not tweak and pressureonly when you stoop - Good afternoon"

      Two poems I rather post in their original language (which is in that case German). I guess it is quite difficult to translate them into English. Maybe I start an attempt at a subsequent time.  Wortfeld (Susanne Mette)   "Mittig -   ein Wortfeld   brachliegendes Gewächs   ungekämmt - fieberheiß    Zuckendes -   - eine Augenöffnung groß   spielt im Handraum Geist    Bewusstsein   dreht biegt bricht   das Eingeweide Wort -   - gekrümmte Laute   systemverzerrt   zu neuer Frucht"      franz.-hochedlinger-gasse (Ernst Jandl)   "wo gehen ich   liegen spucken   wursten von hunden   saufenkotz    ich denken müssen   in mund nehmen   aufschlecken schlucken   denken müssen nicht wollen"

      Here is my translation of the song "Monster" by   urlLink Wir sind Helden  :   "Now you´re standing there with your dragon killer trousers   You say you want me and you settle into my flat now   You know I like you and I even like the rose   But, you know, I don´t live here by my own      I think you can hear it in the adjoining room   Do you hear it breathing, do you hear the scratching on the wall?   Think of a big animal and imagine it twice as horrible   My pet doesn´t bite, it munches you out of your hand      Can you hold my monster?   Can you can you?      A ravenous fire warmnesses his limbs   His breath burns, his vista is dead and cold   My monster is blind, it tramples everything down   When it unsnaps, are you maybe gonna say Stop?      Do you see the sharp paws?   Do you see the teeth?   Do you hear the snarling deep inside of his stomach?   I see your legs are trembling -   just to mention -    when I notice that then my monster notices it, too      Can you hold my monster?   Can you can you?"   (the original german text you can also find on their homepage above)

       urlLink Realms of the Haunting  is one of my favourite videogames, though I actually didn´t play it longer than up to a certain point. Ahem, well but I watched my brother spending a pretty long time (in general due to the length of the game) with Roth.  "Goodness reflects the light and evil bears the seed of all darkness. These are the mirrors of the soul, reflections of the mind. Choose well." - Unknown  The unexpected death of his father draws Adam Randall to Helston, a village in Cornwall, into a seemingly forlornly, old manor-house. Unknown to him, Adam enters the showplace of a battle between Good and Evil which is already lasting several milleniums - and that being the reason of Adam´s nightmares.  As Adam you betake into a colossal and complicated 3D world with more than 20 different, with Motion Capture rendered kinds of demons, 15 varying weapons for your defense and more than 2 hours of integrated video sequences which content clues and make clear the objective target.  In the course of this adventure epos you will be willingless fascinated by the obfuscatory mights of the Realm and the potencies of an old french magician whose aim is to throw the world into an age of darkness. (text translated from the backside of the german CD carton)  Throughout the "game sessions" with my brother respective afterwards (that is NOW) I´m/ was really drawn to the game and everything amounting it. I also plan to create an adaption of Roth on  urlLink RPG Maker 2k , but recently I was pretty flegmatic and unmotivated, I hope I´m soon ambitious and enthusiastic enough to start and end this project in a good way.

      Listening to: Joanna Newsom´s " urlLink The milk-eyed mender  "  Lyrics for "Sadie"    "Sadie, white coat,  carry me home.  Bury this bone,  take this pine-cone.   Bury this bone to gnaw on it later;  gnaw on the telephone.  ´Till then, we pray & suspend  the notion that these lives do never end.   And all day long we talk about mercy:  lead me to water lord, i sure am thirsty.  Down in the ditch where i nearly served you,  up in the clouds where he almost heard you.   And all that we built  and all that we breathed,  and all that we spilt, or pulled up like weeds  is piled up in back;  it burns irrevocably.  (we spoke up in turns,  ´till the silence crept over me)   Bless you and i deeply do  no longer resolute, and i call to you   But the water got so cold,  and you do lose  what you don´t hold.   This is an old song, these are old blues.  This is not my tune, but it´s mine to use.  And the seabirds where the fear once grew  will flock with a fury,  and they will bury what´d come for you.   Down where i darn with the milk-eyed mender  you and i, and a love so tender,  is streched - on the hoop where i stitch - this adage:  "Bless our house and its heart so savage."   And all that i want, and all that i need,  and all that i´ve got is scattered like seed.  And all that i knew is moving away from me.  (and all that i know is blowing  like tumbleweed)   And the mealy worms  in the brine will burn  in a salty pyre,  among the fauns and ferns.   And the love we hold,  and the love we spurn,  will never grow cold  only taciturn.   And i´ll tell you tomorrow.  Sadie, go on home now.  Bless those who´ve sickened below;  bless us who´ve chosen so.   And all that i´ve got  and all that i need  i tie in a knot  that i lay at your feet.  I have not forgot,  but a silence crept over me.  (So dig up your bone,  exhume your pine-cone, my Sadie) "

      Haphazardly read the following in the regional newspaper from last Tuesday: "Mixer of toxins planned murder in the Charité" Subtitle: "Police is searching perpetrator among the colleagues - Hard competition fight in the&nbsp;line could be the motive" The report iniates with the words "A murder attempt similar to the ones of Agatha Christie excites Berlin: In the well-known university clinic Charité an unknown person tried to murder a heart specialist -&nbsp;through poisoned mineral water." Further on it is said that the toxin was pretty rare and was not traceable in the human organism. Reputedly only cooperators had access to the substance. Well those lines remind me of a two episodes longing case in one of my favourite japanese animations "Detective Conan" (does anyone know? It´s actually quite famous and popular, I guess^^").

      The following biography is taken from  urlLink http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=174    Dave McKean was born in Taplow, Berkshire in 1963. He attended Berkshire College of Art and Design from 1982-86 and, before leaving, started working as an illustrator. In 1986 he met author Neil Gaiman with whom he has collaborated on many projects since. Their first book, Violent Cases (1987), has been printed in a number of editions worldwide, and adapted for the stage. Their most recent collaboration, Mr. Punch (1994), is currently being developed as a CD-ROM by Artemis Communications for whom Dave is the Art Director. In between, Black Orchid (1988), Signal To Noise (1990) for The Face magazine, and the popular Sandman series of graphic novels to which Dave has contributed all the cover illustrations and design. Arkham Asylum (1989) written by Scottish author/playwrite Grant Morrison, which is still the single most successful graphic novel ever published, was also illustrated by Dave. 1995 saw collaborations with the Rolling Stones, a digital Tarot, and a book of photographs co-published by Dave's Hourglass studio and Allen Spiegel Fine Arts in California. Between 1990 and 1996, Dave also wrote and illustrated the 500 page comic novel Cages, which won the Harvey Award for Best new comic in 1992. Dave has contributed to The Residents' groundbreaking CD-ROM Bad Day on The Midway, and has directed the title sequence for Neil Gaiman's first TV series Neverwhere. In 1995 he produced the image to launch The Sony Playstation, and in 1996 was one of four photographers chosen by Kodak and Saatchi's to launch their new colour filmwith a book, video and global ad package. He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker and has won many awards including the international Amid Award for the best album cover of the year (one of over ninety covers designed, illustrated and photographed since 1990, including recent releases by Michael Nyman, Tori Amos, Real World, Altan, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Bill Laswell, Alice Cooper, Front Line Assembly, and Bill Bruford), and the World Fantasy Award for the Sandman covers. Also in 1995 he was one of the winners exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum for the National Book Awards. In 1996 he composed and performed the music for the BBCRadio adaptation of Signal to Noise with saxophonist Iain Ballamy. He has exhibited in America and Europe including solo shows at The Four Color Gallery, New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Madrid, and The Maritime Museum, Carlisle. Projects for 1997 include his first childrens book with Neil Gaiman, The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish, a book with Stephen King (Wizard and Glass), a book and feature film with Iain Sinclair (Slow Chocolate Autopsy and The Falconer) and three short films (Whack!, The Week Before and n[eon]) which he is directing and designing. He has also completed commercial work for the films Alien 4 and Blade, and has produced the poster, press and TV graphics for Eurostar. He lives on the Isle of Oxney with his wife and studio manager Clare, and their children.   On the site below you can find a bunch of Dave´s works:   urlLink http://www.dreamline.nu/

      Yay, I finally bought Kante´s LP "Zombi". Argh, on Thursday I finally had to haul myself into school after holidays. Yay, I found somebody (that is two people, what a success) who accompany me to the cinema to watch "Coffee and cigarettes". Apart from that I´m tired.  I actually pretty like French, but in the lessons of yesterday I almost felt asleep. Sigh. And I received my books for school. Half of them is as thick as about one or two thumbs.  One mate rhetorically wondered what they thought when printing the history book. Our librarian´s answer: "Well, they are full of mistakes anyway." Now I´m becalmed. Now, we can search for all the mistakes. This is gonna be a great pleasure, I suppose. The books of men´s history have to be rewritten!

      Woodstock by Joni Mitchell  "I came upon a child of God He was walking along the road And I asked him where are you going And this he told me I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm I'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band I'm going to camp out on the land I'm going to try an' get my soul free  We are stardust We are golden And we've got to get ourselves Back to the garden  Then can I walk beside you I have come here to lose the smog And I feel to be a cog in something turning Well maybe it is just the time of year Or maybe it's the time of man I don't know who I am But you know life is for learning  We are stardust We are golden And we've got to get ourselves Back to the garden  By the time we got to Woodstock We were half a million strong And everywhere there was song and celebration And I dreamed I saw the bombers Riding shotgun in the sky And they were turning into butterflies Above our nation  We are stardust Billion year old carbon We are golden Caught in the devil's bargain And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden"

      I wrote that recently (5 minutes ago or so -.-) The "nuclear resistant tree" is from "Agrippine", a cartoon on ARTE (French-german channel)  "I pass the nuclear war resistant tree He´s quite large; Even with my legs I can watch the leaves It is night  I walk over the grass I break it I kill it With my fat body Clumsily I let my body sink I think"'Ouch', they would say" If they were able to If I was able to hear them  I walk across the sand It is running through my toes But I am dirty due to other things  My awareness is touched by the wind I open my arms Like a bird That dives to the floor When it finally thuds on the ground The air is running past my arms Fingers Dust is whirling around My ghost, you can find him in the sand  Someone´s standing behind me His head is frowning over me With his talons he reaches under my shoulders and heaves me I ask him to let go of me"

      Listening to:  urlLink Radiohead - OK Computer   In the morning I watched a report on TV wherein a group of students had staged a drinking competition. They consumed as much and as fast mineral water as possible. One of them fell into coma after he had drunk about 4 litres. Reason: due to the intrusion of much water into your organism the cells of your body expand. This can be very dangerous if the brain is affected; the amplified cells press against the scullcap and you might fall into coma.

       urlLink Blowfish   urlLink The Simpsons: "One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish"  Here is a translation that I made from  urlLink this german text about blowfishs :  New Cadelonia, 7th September 1774. Mistrustfully reserved natives are observing the spanking foreign ships which landed in the silent bay of the natives´ southern paradise. The strangely bright skinned invaders didn´t augur well. Captain Cook, who was to return from the southern ice pack border to New Zealand during his second worldtrip, leaned at the concretive railing of his "Resolution" with the flag of Great Britain and ordered to load the boats with gifts. The 7th September should become an unfortunate day for navigator and discoverer Cook as well as for two co-travelling scientists. Towards evening the boats docked back, and the sailors delivered Captain Cook a silver  Toado , a mighty blowfish, as a gift of the natives. As it turned out later, it was a  Spheroides sceleratus  whose extreme poisonousness was well-known to the inhabitants of the island. Probably one man uttered doubts at the fish´s edibility. Cook however quickly brushed theworries aside with the clue that he ate the same fish in Australia without any harm and that he tasted good.  Prepared in the right way, this fish is in deed a true palatal pleasure that lets the hearts of gourmets beat faster just at the sight of the fish. But the cook, who was more accustomed to the preparation of native herrings, obviously didn´t know about that because he calculated served the men liver and ovarion of the blowfish, that is his organs containing aside from the residual intestines and the gonads the heaviest fish toxin in general,  Tetrotodoxin  (TTX). Each of the three men received just a small amount, a sample quasi....  It started harmless. A creep on the lips, after a few minutes also at the fingers and several toes. Hours later the men laid down, far gone. Feelings of numbness on the whole body, incorporated with a feeling of floatation, martyring pains in the chest, frightening muscle infirmity that soon crossed over into paralysises of arms and legs. The men survived, rather due to a good whimsy of mother nature, since a blowfish contamination ends lethally with aprobability of 60%. A pig that ate from the residual intestines was found dead the next day.  Equally John Buff who stood on the "Duck River Bridge" (Parramatta near Sydney) in the afternoon of the 18th April 1821 and watched at the peaceful picture of a sunday fisher. He fried the caught blowfishs on a grill. The meal shoudln´t do him well. The report of the physician and mortician showed the following: 10 minutes after the meal he felt a numb feeling allaround his body. His tongue swelled and he complained about being really thirsty. Weak and strenghtless he laid himselfon the floor. After he had drunken some water, he asked, paralysized on his arms and legs, to be turned onto the other side. This was John Buff´s last request before his good soul disappeared into eternity.  From the first morsel up to his death only 20 minutes had passed by. Blowfish contaminations were feared even in ancient times. In the grave of Pharao Ti, 2700 BC, there was the picture of a  Tetraodeon stellatus , which was named "spt" or "shepet" by the old Egypts. This means baneful or toxic. Also the OldTestament offers us a clue: "That´s it what you may eat of all that lives in the sea. Everything which has flappers and scales, you may eat. But what has no flappers and scales, you must not eat, it should be considered impure to you.  - Deuteronomium 14, 9-10. Blowfishs have a skin that feels tender and sleek, with just tiny scales and abortive flappers.The fish appeared to the Olds as scaleless.  Blowfishs live in the tropes and subtropics. Only a few of them dare to enter the temperate zones. Some also succeeded in adapting to the freshwater, and they live in rivers now. Even the Mediterrean Sea knows a blowfish type, which is calledTetraodeon fineatus and whose poisonousness is unavowed. About 50 of the 1000 living sorts are known as toxical. Contaminations happen all around the world, but in Japan they are most frequent. There they are considered to be a delicacy for centuries. The Japanese call it "fugu" and their mouth waters when thinking of this tickling meal.   Who survives has to pay the devil.   Relishing Fugu is like Russian Roulettes: You never know whether the served fish is really nontoxic. The following numberscan demonstrate this forcefully: In the years 1956 to 1958 there were 715 contaminations in Japan, thereof 420 with lethaloutgoing. Which is 60% thus. This rate is nearly typical for blowfish contaminations. In the course of the last years this percentage has declined clearly however as well as the total number of contaminations.This is not due to the sudden fear of the Japanese but to the whole opposite. It is rather the government that restricts the preparation of Fugu to licensed cooks. They learn in courses how to flay the very sinewed skin, which contains toxin sometimes, in the most considerate way. Then, how the toxical organs look (ovarians or testicles, liver, gallbladder and gut) and how to remove without the slightest infraction. For instance, when you cut off the gallbladder, then the TTX canseep into the flesh and cause contaminations.  An American professor who held lectures at the University of Tokyo for a long time explained to me after a dive in the Caribbean (we just discovered a blowfish) with lighting eyes: "You know, it is the toxin that providesthe condiment, it gives you every palatal pleasure that no steak in the world can offer you."  And in deed, in Japan the most contaminations are reported in midwinter, thus before the fishs´ spawn periode which startsin spring. Before spawning there is a higher gonad activity (increased hormone production) leading to a higher production of TTX which then is stored in the named organs and eggs. After spawning (summer, fall) the fish has lost a large amount of his poisonousness. The flesh is stale (like the flesh of the nontoxic blowfish types) and spares itsspecialty.   Tetrotodoxin - heavier than Strychnin  TTX is the heaviest protein-free toxin at all. The lethal dosis for a 20 gramm weighing mouse lies at about 16 micro grammand for an adult man at about 1-2 milligramm. TTX is a nervous toxin. It blocks the nerve conduction by impeding the transport of sodium ions through the cell membrane. Further on it reduces the sensitivity of the skeleton musculature as well as the contraction ability of the heart.   Typical is the fast start of the symptoms after 5-30 minutes.  Slight contamination:- infirmity- dizziness- formication in face and on limbs- frequent queasyness, rare emesis  Mid-heavy contamination:- feeling of numbness all around the body with a feeling of floatation- the heart muscle is seized with a weak, fast pulse and decrease of blood pressure  Heavy contamination:- respiration disorders- becoming blue- chest aches - paralysises of limbs, laryngeal muscles and outer ocular muscles with grotesque strabismus  Death mostly occurs after 6-24 hours through respiration paralysis, casually after some minutes after heart paralysis. Who is able to survive the first 24 hours can expect complete cure. TTX was also introduced in modern medicine. Aside from Morphine it is used antispasmodic in the process of cancer therapies.   The toxic ball  When I started with the memorandum of this chapter one thing was certain: TTX is THE toxic weapon of blowfishs. Every reef bandit knows the danger that appears when consuming the fish and its spawn, and he avoides them assertively. But does he really know the lethal danger that is hidden in the fish? I affirm this concerning the spawn, but for the fish itself I am unsure. My worries are based on an illustrative experience:  Maledives, December 1975. I play with a little blowfish, barely larger than 20 cm. In his clumsy helplessness he looks a bit pathetic, and due to pure compassion I free the little guy back. At once he drains water and paddles with his abortive flappers into the protecting reef. Then he suddenly has a fit of nerves, and with desperate effort he struggles through the sparse amount of spare water. Because behind my back a group of  red snappers  greedily runs across the reef. Suddenly one of these robbers strikes in a flash with a forceful flap stroke. But my little friend had realised the danger long ago and had inflated back. Still he isn´t perfectly round, when the baring teeth of a snapper grab him. In vain, the sinewed, leathery skin of the blowfish proves to be an effective protection. A second attack fully fails. The teeth coudln´t capture the plump fish anymore. I can´t remember any longer whether this was a toxical blowfish. Anyway, I can´t imagine that a snapper could differa toxical from a nontoxic blowfish. That´s why I got the hypothesis that TTX is just a "haphazard" waste product of themetabolism process. Haphazard?Does nature create such a heavy toxin really just haphazardly? The trace of this thought would shock my biological world view and I let it fall as a too heretical matter.But it doesn´t want to get out of my head completely. Because who if not random caused such entirely different types like the Costa Rica frog  Atepolus , the western american salamander  Taricha torosa , the moonfish  Mola mola  and the Grundel  Gobius criniger  to produce exactly the same toxin, Tetrotodoxin?  We should rather leave the exploration of this academical issue to the scientists or way better, to the philosophists.

      Momentarily listening to Lali Puna: Faking the books  Here the trailer of the recent  urlLink Myst IV-Revelation   Today I finally started reading a volume of Detective Conan after quite a long time (you probably know times when you have enough of your usually favourite activation or something). Well, I was actually exceedingly content with what I´ve read, though it was at about 3 or 4 o´clock, due to my sleeping disorder^^". I also adepted something about Tetrotodoxin, the toxin contained in globefishs. When you orally consume a dosis of about 0,5 to 1 milligramm, the lethal effect arises just a certain time later, so that victims normally can be saved yet. But when the toxin is injected intravenously, then the nervous system is going to get paralyzed due to the fast spread in the organism, and the victim dies because of transpiration failure.

      Couldn´t sleep that night for some reason -.-  Here´s the intro of RotH I told about in the last post, well, it´s a translation, I originally wrote it off in German of course.  "My father died six months ago. Since he and mother were divorced, we thus had our problems. I haven´t seen him as often as I should have, but you know the habit: You think, you have all the world´s time to iron things out. But there is always something more important to do and you postpone the call on next week. Then a letter of the advocate arrives and suddenly it is too late. You cannot do anything anymore, everything that should have been said, remains unsaid. Forever.  My father was pastor in a village near Cornwall. He was very popular, had time for everyone...except for his son.  I don´t know why, but recently I started to dream of a house, incredibly lively dreams. [image of Rebecca Trevisard, another main character] At the same time I had other dreams which were realistic as well, but not as sinister. On the contrary. I knew that I haven´t met her before, but that she existed nevertheless.... somewhere.  Then I was visited by this priest. He was counted among those people my father never liked but who he distrusted. I even intended to shut the door before his nose, but something kept me away from doing so. He said, his name was Elias Camber. He and my father would have met on a congress some years ago and corresponded  since then in a loose way. He told me that father´s letters would have sounded very worringly. He would have found out something about a strange house at the outskirts. Something dreadful. Then the letters would have stayed away, but one week before father´s death he would have received a parcel with a note, in which he asked Camber to implicitly hand it out to me.  Almost everthing Camber had told me was lied. There was no priest with his name in Cornwall. I surveyed that. For some time, I just ignored the whole matter, presumably I also didn´t want to deal with it.  But the dreams became more and more worse.  Finally I opened the parcel after all two days ago. It contained the fragments of some rune stones, some pieces were missing. I searched every imaginable book for it, but I couldn´t find out the identity of those things. I only know that they have a certain aura.  [image of the house and its closer surroundings] Well, here it is, the house Camber told me about. The house of my nightmares. Something has piloted me here, I just don´t know what. Or why."

      Guess, I officially started work on my adaption of RotH on RPG Maker which is going to be very difficult since I´m not able to play RotH anymore. You know, the game was published in 1996 and it doesn´t really work on XP (well, I can watch the intro that is quite a pleasure for me, but when I push the left key in the game itself then I just twirl around and I can´t stop it). So I have to find out everything that I can to reconstruct the game as satisfying as possible. I recently searched for pictures, documents etc. Today I wrote off the text of the intro (a somewhat Sisyphean labor^^"). What I fear is that I´m not able to get the story arc for I don´t know the whole coherencies. Well, we will see.
