       Hay Everyone!!    As y'all know this past thursday I was in a pageant!! Well was that ever fun!! The ladies in it were : Sarah Awalt, Kathy Curran, Amber Hanrahan, Ashley Hickey, Me, Alexa La Pierre, Tia Larkin, Amanda Lunn, Stacey MacMullen, Krista Wheeler, Kelsey Zinck and Kristin Zinck.    We all arrived at 5:30 to practice our walk and get our make-up done. WoW!! Y'all would not believe the make-up the put on us!! I felt like I was a cake and they were iceing me!! Lmao!! Then after what seemed like forever we finally put our dresses on!    Once we got out on stage the support from the crowd was fanominal!! After running back to the music room to get changed there were clothes flying everywhere!! Then it was time for our back to school outfits! (YaY!) I honestly didn't think I did too well on that therefore I wasn't thinking I would make it into the top 6!!    Then, of course it was time for the dance! Lmao!! It was so stupid ...I loved it!!    Then it came time to anounce Miss Congeniality! Congrats Ashley!! SMILE!! We all knew you were getting it!!      By the time the top 6 were to be anouncedwe all were goin crazie!! Finally the names where starting to be called: First up it was Kristin, and then me! I was in shock!! I'm not quite sure of the order after that but the other four ladies were: Amber, Tia, Krista, and Kelsey. Then there was the question and answer session! Unfortunatly I did not get the Iraq question even though I had a good answer for it.    So, in order to make it more nerve racking they had an intermission. While the potential top 3 practiced our speech the others hurried to make sure we all looked ok! (Teeth Check!!!) When we got back on stage the intermission was not over. Therefore in order to cool off and have some more fun we all began dancing!! Lmao!! I guess you could see us all!!    Then the time to anounce the top 3 came along! When they called me first i was really not expecting it!! I guess the look on my face was priceless! Along with me for the ride was Kristin and Tia. The speeches were great!! A lot of fun to do aswell!! At the end the final standing were: Tia Larkin-Queen 2004 Kristin Zinck-First Runner Up Kaleigh Irving-Second Runner Up     Thanks so much to everyone who made this possible!! You made this experiance worth while!!     Later!!

       Hay-lo!    The tea party was great!! No tea!! Lmao!!    I just wanted to add a quick little update before the pageant tomorrow (holy shit!). At the tea party we finally got to meet the judges and they were pretty cool. Except for one guy he was a little creepy looking and he always gave me mean looks!! They just asked us question about ourselves, our family, our interests, and other normal questions. It was a little long though (I found!), we were there from 645 till 930!!!    Afterwards Krista, Amber and I went to Chicago Way Pizzeria. Well that was fun we ate and ate!! Lmao! On the way to the Irving I had on Krista's shoes....Well!! I twisted my ankle and then! In the process of trying to keep my balance I smacked my head into a pole. Well I fell onto the ground and was killing myself laughing and then these two gangsters walked by!! Lmao!! That made me laugh even harder!! Needless to say we had a fun night!!    The Pink Panthers (under 16 girls soccer) won their challenge cup game!! 3-1!! Awesome job girls!! Hope y'all do as good tonight too!! I wish I was there!! Good luck!!    Later!

        Hay All!          The tea party is tonight...YaY!! It should be cool to meet the judges but there's only one problem.....I don't like tea!! Lmao!! I'm goin to Krista's a little later to get my hair done! LoL!! I think Amber's coming up too! That's if she finishes her speech!! Haha!         The questions are really getting to me! They're nuts! If I make it to the top six all I hope is that I don't get the Iraq question; a couple people already now my answer for that!! "Do you think that it was a good decision not to send our troops to Iraq?" "Yes, I do think it was a good decision because the Americans are killing enough of us already; we don't need the Iraqis (?) killing us too!" My mother will kill me!!        The dance for the pageant is definatly interesting!! Lmao!! It's the best! Don't doubt that I'll be up there killing myself laughing during the dance!! It's a darn good thing that we not get marked on it!!         I've decided that I'm not going in a convertible in the parade!!! Lmao!! I'm going in a little red wagon!!! Melissa's little red wagon if I can get it!! And then for Jade I'm gonna fall out of it in the middle of the parade!! Haha!        Well I best go prepare for tonight!   Byyye!
