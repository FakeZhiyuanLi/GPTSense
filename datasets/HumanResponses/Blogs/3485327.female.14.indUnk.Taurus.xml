      i think i may love dave.. i just dumped john. and i care about dave... but then alex really turns me on. like lots. and i crave doing something. and its not just a momentary thing either. its like the feeling that i want to do that thing just doesnt go away. like i want to do that thing. and that thing is not sex. but still... urgh.. so confused. toodles

      k so maybe amanda wasnt the friend i thought she was. maybe it just seemed like she was being my friend and inviting me over and going out 4 lunch with me and wanted to go on the trip with me and wanted to be on the bus with me. i am not a lesbian. and the only reason she hates me is because i hate bekah.. well she hates my good friend mel and i dont hate her for that!! so wtf. ugughghghghhg people!!! jesus. i just want to die. is that too much to ask? like helooooooo?????.. oh well... whatever.. if she wants to hate me for absolutely no reason and ruin a perfectly great friendship whatever. she can go live in her little world of pot (which by the way u CAN get addicted to. pay attention in health class bitch) ok so the long and short is i will most likely be sleeping on the floor in quebec because amanda hates me and is being absolutely retarded. so its gunna TOTALLY suck :|. i want my mommy :(. this blows. ughghghghg everytime i see her it makes me want to cry.. i cried a little today... so stupid. why cry over something like this?... maybe because she was (or so i thought)my best friend.. who was nice to me until friday. then hated me on saturday.. and now is calling me a lesbian. and dirty. and hates me. and she was my friend!!!!! it hurts :(. make it stop :(
