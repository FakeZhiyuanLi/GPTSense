      I'm so frustrated.  I want to throw it all away- give it all up.  I can't.  I want to...but I can't bring myself to do it.  It's like when you have a dog with caderacs in each eye (blind) and you know it'd be better if you killed it...but you can't bring yourself to do it.  I'm irritated and I want it to stop.  I know it won't unless I leave.  If I get away from it all...then I'll be okay...I'll be better...but I can't leave.

      John 13 talks about Jesus washing the disciples feet.  He stripped down to a towel and washed and dried their feet, saying that they need to serve people just as Jesus was serving them.  To not literally wash people's feet, but to serve.    In SF...while I was doing a 'reflection' of some sort, I overlooked when James and Heather washed our feet... I have John 13 outlined in my bible- I wrote how humbling it would be for me to wash my friend's feet for the main reason that I hate feet.  I don't want people touching me with their feet...and I kinda don't want people touching my feet.    God had other plans.    James washed my feet.  Which was a little strange to begin with...I don't think anyone has EVER washed my feet.  Lacy said that it was a humbling experience for her...but I think mine was more of a realization.  Right then and there I realized how much James and Heather do.  That they've done.  This past year has been hard on me spiritually, what with Rob leaving- but I let go of him...and on Thursday night while I watched James and Heather wash feet and pray...I let go of Rob completely.  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.    I don't think I can say this enough- thank you James and Heather for coming to South.

      I woke up this morning around 10:30, ate a doughnut, and took a shower.  While in the shower I remembered that if i was still in San Fran, I'd be at the mission, acting out being a nose...or something of that sort.  I think today was the worst of missing all the kids.

      The 13 through the 19 I went to San Francisco.  Home of the "weirdos", the "bums/hobos", the "gays" and the "sinners".  And although I saw people taking off their pants in the middle of the street, men high off their mind, people of the same sex holding hands, men wearing dresses and skirts- I also saw people.  I saw not just a 'city of sin' but a city of sadness.  Where children are afriad to walk down a street in broad daylight because two murders had happened a couple weeks earlier, where the homeless have a better attitude than I do when I don't get the CD I want at Christmas, where all the kids need is love-- nothing else.   This week has been extrodinary for me, and as I come back home to my comfortable home and bed and kitchen full of food-- I wonder if anything that I saw and/or heard will stay with me.  Will I remember the constant sireans?  Will I remember how there was a locked gait/bars on windows and doors?  Will I remember the sound of children laughing and giggling over flat balls and plastic cups instead of softballs?  Will I remember that there was a gay pride flag on almost every street because no one cares?  I told James and the team that I will have a better attitude when I came home.  I really hope I will.  I hope that I remember that there are kids who get beat every night, that there are people who's last meal was two weeks ago, that some kids live right across the street from a house full of a gang, that some people haven't felt a bed in a month because there's no room in any shelters.  And as I live in my safe neighborhood, in my warm house, under my covers in my bed- that there are people out there who are less fortunte and I should never pout over a "wrong present" or something meaningless like that.

      I've been talking about Change lately...but that's because on Sunda I found out Katie and Colby are leaving SACC...I think this is going to effect me as much as Rob's leaving effected me...

      It's funny...my dad and i never have really had a good relationship...and I know that's a common tale, but I've found that it's harder to deal with than to hear about- as are most things.  He's not a christian, he doesn't go to church, he leaves in the morning before I wake up, and gets home around eight at night...the number of hugs I've given him since i got out of third grade I could most likely count on two hands...he drinks- he smokes...we have nothing really in common...  And as Father's day is here, I miss something I've never had.  A good father.  And I realize that I may have it better than some girls, but it still hurts.

      I think it's funny how different males and females are.  I colored my hair today and two men that I know think...I shouldn't have done it because i guess it looked better before.  But all the women I talked to, loved it!  Said it looked good with my complexion and it looked better darker...then of course there's the men who didn't even notice at all.  I think it's funny that women except change better than males...  Speaking of change...it's strange how things you thought were never going to change, do.  How people you think are your strong hold in life...leave, and you find you can do fine without them.  That happened to me today.  people I look up to and consider practically my siblings, are leaving my life.  Now that I'm writing all this down, I think it's because God's trying to make me depend on him.  Like I don't think other people are dependent on these two people as much as I am...it's hard to even think about and I almost want to be mad...but I guess this is the part where I close my eyes and hold out my hand for Jesus to take and start taking those steps of faith.  The only thing is- I'm scared and I don't think I'm ready to.

      So as my trip to San Francisco draws near, I pray that I'll be ready.  This is my first mission trip...what if I miss up the prayer with someone?  What if I give them the wrong impression?  I should trust God in everything that I do, but...i'm scared.  I'm scared to give Him everything.  I've never done that with anyone.  And even though it's not really that evident to people around me- I try to supress it as much as I can.  I think that's why I'm so scared about this trip- because I can't let go of my fears and insecurities... It was a good day though.  San Fran draws near and I try to piece together everything that I need to figure out by then or everything that I need to sort out.  I keep thinking about my old youth pastor.  The last time I saw him he said 'goodbye' to me in an odd way...like he knew it was going to be the last time I ever saw him. I've been thinking about that last goodbye and what I know he's done since he's left our church, to my family, to my youth pastor and to my friends, and I wonder what would've happened if he never left, would he still be going on the downward spiral?  Would he keep our youth group in one place instead of where my youth pastor is taking us now?  Taking us places where we never thought was possible... It was hard letting go, but I think it was even harder embracing my current youth pastor.  And people kept telling me he was going to take our church far.  He was going to take it places it hasn't been before.  And I realize that now, and now I have a strange feeling of not wanting to grow up so I don't have to leave the youth group because I want to go places with it.

      Oh man, school's coming to an end and I see myself and everyone around me getting...lazy.  My math teacher said she'll drop our lowest test score, and if that means our lowest teast score is our final...bye bye final.  it's awesome, but it's also giving me a reason NOT to study.  I honestly don't know how I'm going to make it through college alive.

      "I'm not going to say that God is on our side, but that we are on God's side"  -John Kerry   I'm at my aunt and uncles house until Friday. All this week I've been introduced...as it were, to the Democratic national convention. Which makes since considering they're both democrats. Today I caught the last half of Kerry's speech about his role as a President. This qoute and what he said about his religion caught my attention. But this particularlly. I don't like how he put this. now, granted I'm not a democrat, but I'm not a republican either. There's most likely things that will rub me the wrong way with Bush's speech. But this sentence says to me that American's are equal to God and we get to decide if we're on God's side or not. Maybe I'm taking this the wrong way...but that's what it says to me.   Why do we even have to have a president? It's irritating...especially coming from a house that has one parent in each political party. It's sickening how one conversation about stupid poiltics can ruin a whole afternoon or night. How one mention of political issues (gay marriage, middle class, social security) can enrage so many people. Quite frankly, its disgusting. I hate it. I hate the problems it causes and the people it divides.   Maybe I won't even watch the republican convention to see if anything strikes me...Let me rephrase that- I won't.

      It figures that something you don't want to happen turns out to be a good thing. God's just too smart for us...Too bad i can't get some of that genius for my Pre-Calculus homework...   Heather has been a blessing in my life...today I and a friend spent two hours talking about things that we struggle with...and i realized that Heather is a  true  blessing. I've always been thankful that she's come to our Youth Group, but today I know God sent her to us for a particular reason...And I thank Him for that.

      I always feel bad for my old bible when I get a new one...   I got a new study bible last christmas I think...or was it at my birthday? i can't remember...but it was everything that I wanted...except the weight (it feels like I'm workin out when ever i carry it!) But I haven't used my old one...in months.   I feel sad for it.   Like it's not being loved enough...   I have notes from sermons by P. John, Jeremy, Colby and Darrel...I think there's one by James...I have notes that I wrote on my favorite verses, encouraging notes from my friends that have things to do with verses...I have my bullitin from Kathy's funeral and Rob's leaving party...the slip we got when the Church decided James and Heather were coming...Letters to God, songs that corrispond with verses...   But in my new one...I have drawings and a couple sermon notes...   It doesn't seem the same! James said that if you want to see what someone is really like and what their thoughts really are- look in their bible. It's like a journal!   Maybe i should just use my study bible for studing...and take my bible everywhere else...   Jeez...took me long enough to figure  that  out.

      It's not about perfection; it's about our intimacy with God, or our connection, our relationship with God. Once we get through that, once we realize that we can be imperfect, flawed, broken; those kinds of things are the ingredients of spirituality. - Mike Yaconelli  Awesome qoute.  James might've used it, but i honestly don't remember.  But this is truthfully my life in a nut shell.  I always thought you had to always be committed to praying EVERYDAY and reading your bible EVERYDAY...and if you skip a day...UHP!  You're in trouble!  And though these things do really incredibly help our realtionship, doesn't mean they MAKE my relationship with God...  At youth conventions I feel really...attacked.  They do altar calls and ask the crowd all these questions like if they've doubted God and things like that...and I always feel myself saying 'yes' to every question...and I'm already a CHRISTIAN!  So I never go up...but when I talked to Heather i found out I'm just vulnerable...I don't have a very high opinion of myself as a Christian...and those youth rallies just ATTACK ME spiritually...which is kinda messed up.    But this qoute makes me think of a true christian...one that isn't perfect...one that I am.  That's encouaging!  Yay for Mike Yaconelli!

      I think I spelled that right...but it's german, and I don't TAKE german...I heard this from Micah and Jordan and kept saying it over and over thinking it meant, "You dumb"&nbsp; but...as it turned out it meant something completely different which I don't care on sharing with you all.&nbsp; Anyways- the real reason that I made this post is because...I feel I can live up to this phrase really well.&nbsp; And the reason for that is that I think I know everything one day and there's nothing more I can learn...and then, BAM- a stroke of genius...or rather someone elses stroke of genius hits me and it's takes me a long time to chew and swallow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day someone made me ask for something that I didn't really NEED to ask for, but they made me anyway...but then maybe a half an hour later I realized that was most likely a good lesson in humilty.&nbsp; That I shouldn't just ASSUME i get things, but either ask or think about if I need it... Jeez.&nbsp; You'd think I'd know by now.

      So I finally found out why I didn't like the fourth of the July thing!  Thanks to James and the people who wrote an incrediable article, I know.  I'm an expatriate!  “Expatriate” - someone who lives as a non-citizen in a country not their own.   We are, all of us who know Christ, expatriates- living for a time in a foreign country. We can enjoy it, but if we ever stop feeling homesick, we are in trouble.   So, next Fourth of July, go ahead and light off some fireworks, thank God for the freedoms you have, enjoy a nice parade or picnic… but maybe leave the Star-Spangled Banner out of the worship set, okay?   Awesome article, I didn't get a chance to see who wrote it, but you all should check it out- http://www.opensourcetheology.net/node/view/391  (i tried the whole 'weblink'...didn't work out too well. Just copy and paste)

      So I was thinking about the fourth of july yesterday while I was at the beach...I know, a little late- but still.  And is it bad if I don't have pride for my country?  Freedom is cool and all, and I'm so thankful that I have it, but there's other things I would want to sing other than the National Athem...(jeez I need a spell checker)...But maybe..I'm just lazy.  I enjoy seeing fireworks, but I would rather do other things than watch a bunch of fire and chemicals expolde in the air.    Maybe I'm being Cynical.  But is it such a crime to not enjoy your country's Independence Day?

      Well went and saw Spiderman 2...finally.  It couldn't have come soon enough.  I absolutely LOVED IT!  Special effects are neato.  But then someone pointed out to me that through-out the whole movie there was no cursing or sexual innuendo's...which are so common in today's world.    The movie's on my the top of my list now.

      James 1:2-3 says, "Consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverence."  I always used to hate this verse.  Mostly because I didn't know how to do that.  To be happy when I'm going through something that tears me apart.  And I mean truely happy.  I could fake it and answer my friends' questions with 'I'm fine' or be sarcastic and pretend to be happy...neither of these I'm sure is what it means.  Or what God wants us to do.  Wants me to do.    People say that God fills you with his love and it'll make you joyful...but is it wrong for me to say that it doesn't do that for me?  Maybe I'm not allowing for him to fill me with joy when I'm going through something hard.   But the thing is...I don't know how to let God do that...  Man, I need therapy or something.

      Funny thing- I went to James' Blog today and got interested in the Johnny Baker blog...I went there- looked around, and saw something about the top 100 spiritual movies...Sounded interesting so I went to the sight and saw all these movies which I never thought would be spiritual!  Like...Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Groundhog Day...it just seemed too weird!  But then it hit me, these movies may be "spiritual" but being "spiritual"  doesn't mean it's "Godly" or following any religion.  It's funny how obvious things such as this can hit you at an unexpected moment.

      People are interesting.    And so are words.    It's interesting how someone can forever break you...especially of people with love between them.  I've seen so many people been broken for weeks and months on end because of a love relationship that fell apart.  Whether it be between two friends or a couple...it's a lasting thing that stays with you most of your life.  It's also interesting how words can affect you so deeply.  There's a saying that goes, "I might not remember what you said, but I remember how I felt".  How true.  One right word might stick with someone for a week, but one wrong word will stick with someone for more than months.    It seems so obvious.  People get attached to people, and then words break them apart or bring them together.  But it's almost sickening how one person can be so heartbroken and so hurt and so...damaged over someone else.    So why, after so many mistakes of the human race, haven't we learned to guard our mouths and our hearts?  To remember that nothing is final with a boy or girl until marriage and nothing is final with your parents until they pass away and nothing is EVER final with God?  and that you're friends most likely will move away.    That the words you say can never be taken back and neither will the actions.  That no matter how hard you try you will always have some heartache if you don't guard your mouth and your heart.    I would bet big money on the fact that the devil LOVES it when we don't guard ourselves...knowing that we'll mess up and eventually, get hurt.  Too bad we can't gain the wisdom of 54 years of life when we're 17.  Too bad we can't get God's exact plan for our lives when we're 4.  I guess that's what the bibles for...and good pastors...and good spiritual mentors...and the Holy spirit.  To help us through the big mess ups and the emotional and spiritual 'scrapes' of life.

      Camp Mayfield is getting closer. It happens every year...and I remember every year I've gone. I've been there four years...going on five. I'm kinda excited. But this reminds me of something James told the youth group a while ago- about getting a spiritual high after accepting Christ at an alter call, and then a week later do everything the same way. I wonder how many kids do that from Camp...I know that I used to. Go to camp and 'be spiritual' but then the week I got home- nothing would be the same.  People have been on my mind a lot lately. While I was up in Seattle, and I saw people I started looking past their appearence and started thinking about their eternal destination. Wondering if they believed in anything, and if it was Jesus...or if they had been disappointed by Christians and Jesus and God...  It's starting to freak me out...but I can't stop. This will probably be on my mind at camp as well. When I'm surrounded by Christians, I might end up doubting them, thinking them only 'week Christians' who are true christians for the week and then return to their normal lifestyle after camp.  I really shouldn't do that...right? Because the judging is up to Jesus Christ. Not to me. But I'm not going up to random people and asking if their true christians or not...but still- i find this a little 'off' and wrong.  Lets hope I'll remember this at Camp.
