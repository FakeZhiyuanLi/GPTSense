      Following the infamous incident with our boy Matt, WVCW management decided that the best thing for them to do was ban all variety format talk shows.  Basically if you didn't focus on the music, then you didn't get a show.  In the Spring of 1998, the station's new Program Director, Derrick A! decided that a morning show would be allowed to have the variety format, so he approached two members of his staff about doing the show.  Those members formed the longest running gimmick on WVCW in years, Milton and the Posse.  So actually it was called  The Morning Show with Milton and his Posse  and every Monday and Wednesday morning at 7 o'clock Milton the Albino Love Machine and his sidekick Cool Dr. Money would provide news, comedy, music and more.  Early on in the show they decided that they should have theme days.  So due to the vast collection of 80s music and cover songs they had,  80's Mondays  and  Cover Wednesdays  were born.  Every Monday for the second half of the show, the duo would play 80's songs ranging from Wham! to Kajagoogoo.  It didn't matter.  The same went for the Wednesday time slot, where any cover of a song were open to be played.  The show also saw the birth of  The Piece of Astor .    Both of the personalities on the show needed to take a short break in the middle of the show to smoke or do something else, so they discovered this CD left over from the station's world music days.  It contained a 14 minute song by a man named  urlLink Astor Piazzolla  who was in fact an accordion play.  So, at the halfway point of each show, they would play the Piece of Astor sounder and be off.  Astor Piazzolla wasn't the only piece of the old world music the Morning Show would utilize.  One morning Milton stumbled across a disc by the band  urlLink Pizzicato Five .  He picked a song called "Happy end of the world" and played it for the people.  The song was so uptempo and fun, that the entire studio began to dance.  From that show on, every Wednesday Milton and the Posse would dance to the Pizzicato to close out the show.  They even grabbed people off the sidewalk out front to join in.    About halfway through the semester, Milton and the Posse had recruited several new members to the crew.  Sara Johnson was brought in as the News girl.  She brought an excellent ability to deliver the news and ability to play straight man to Milton.  She was the perfect foil for him, and the chemistry between the trio of Milton, Money, and Sara was never matched by any of her replacements in the coming years.  One morning as Sara was reading a story about the still recent death of Princess Diana, the mentioned that reports said people could hear Diana yelling out the name of her dead boyfriend before she died.  As the story was being read, quietly at first then much louder, Milton began yelling Dodi, Dodi, Doooodiiiiii.  Sara finished her news report, maintained her composure as much as she could and proved that she may very well have been the most professional one on that entire show.  No wonder she left after that semester.    The Morning Show was always trying to think of ways to self promote.  At the time, no one was really promoting their show, and those who were had cheesy fliers that looked like they were made by a ten year old kid with a dot matrix printer.  Since everyone else had cheap looking ads, the Morning Show decided that their advertisement would consist of two parts, fliers and remote broadcasts.  The fliers for the show set the standard for what WVCW fliers would become.  They consisted of an image of some kind (in this case Brak and Eric Cartman), and a funny tagline.  The remotes were also original.  Around March of 1998, the Posse decided to do a contest where you could Win Your Weight in Pennies, and the remote would focus on that contest.     Up next what happened with the Penny Promotion, as well as eviction, corruption, apathy, and resurrection.

       This story originally appeard on the other blog. This is a reprint of the first draft of Chapter 1 Part One.  Look for the rest of the story and revisions to this Chapter in the coming weeks.    So I began working at the college radio station at VCU in the Fall of 1997.  It had a pretty kick ass location, and okay studio, and a window that looked out onto the common area in front of the building.  By the end of that year, all of that would be gone, and the rebuilding would begin.  University red tape, mismanagement, controversy, and lawsuits laid the groundwork for the demise of a once popular institution.  The station would find itself mired in obscurity, that still haunts it to this day.  The Fall Semester 1997, started off the same as any normal year would at WVCW.  There was a new General Manager, a new Program Director, and a bunch of eager young air personalities just waiting to have their voices heard.  One such personality was a young man we will just call Matt.  Now Matt thought that he was hot sh*t.  Matt had been a caller on Howard Stern's radio show several times.  He thought that gave him experience, and a buddy in Stern.  He was wrong.  Now you see ol' Matt got himself a little radio show with a couple of his buddies.  Matt decided that he could very well be the next Howard Stern, so he needed to model his show off of the one of his idol.  He did some stupid gimmicks and took some calls, but on one October day he went too far.  Matt, decided it would be fun to do a sketch mocking a guy who lived on his dorm room floor.  The guy who shall remain nameless, was a dance major at VCU, and was working hard at school and making friends.  Unfortunately he was targeted by Matt and his Posse as a homosexual.  Whether he was or not, we may not know, but that didn't matter to Matt and the boys.  The boys portrayed him as a flaming dancer, all the while giving out the guy's dorm room number, and his phone number.  What Matt didn't count on was his victim had a friend with a tape recorder, who rolled tape of the show and gave it to the victim.   (I realize this would be easier with names, but legally I can't give out names without permission.)   So, the victim called the Police, the Dance Department Chair, the Student Media Commission at VCU, and of course his lawyer.  The radio station management immediately fired Matt and company and was forced to air recorded apologies every hour.  Matt really didn't seem to care about the damage he had done.  Sure he was expelled from school, barred from every working in student media if he were ever reinstated, and faced the possibility of monetary loss, the only blow that came as a disappointment to our boy Matt came from his hero.  He phoned Stern to let him know the situation, expecting Stern to fight for him.  Stern just commented on what an idiot that Matt was for pulling that stunt, and how Stern can get away with more because he had lawyers.  He called the kid a moron and basically crushed his hopes that he could be Howard's heir apparent.    The law suit results are still unclear, but it did lead to the radio station banning all talk shows, except one (We'll get into that later.).  This incident was a blemish on the radio station that caused a public humiliation to VCU.  A humiliation WVCW would pay for the following May.   Stay tuned for the rest of the story coming in the next several days.  Chapter Two will talk about the one remaining talk show, and how that laid the groundwork for the rise that the station would receive years later.

       VALENTINE'S DAY  Tomorrow marks one of the holidays that I just don't get, Valentine's Day.  If you are not in a relationship, it is a day to remind you're not.  If you are in a relationship, it means that you have to go out and buy a expensive flowers and dinner or other gifts to show someone who should already know it that you love them.    Here is a quick story, which will act as today's post.  About 3 years ago the radio station I ran in college was doing a remote broadcast from the Hibbs Cafeteria.  The woman at Hibbs said that it needed to have a Valentine's theme to the night.  My thought process was, if you are eating dinner at Hibbs, either a) you are too cheap to take your significant other somewhere nice, meaning that after they eat that nasty food they would be leaving you;or b) you don't have anyone to spend Valentine's Day with.  So, we decided to create the  St. Valentine's Day Massacre  at VCU.  We picked the most depressing, heart breaking songs that we could find and played them all evening.    A sample of the playlist:  Even Hitler Had a Girlfriend- Mr. T Experience Last Kiss-Pearl Jam Angry Johnny- Poe Hurt- Nine Inch Nails   During the playing of Hurt, a girl came up to our table and pretty much summed up a REAL view of Valentines Day.  With tears running down her face, she asked "who sings this song?"  We told her it was Nine Inch Nails.  Still crying, she thanked us and ran out of the cafeteria.   Off to spend another Valentine's Day alone.

       EQUALITY FOR SOME, WHY NOT ALL?  Although most people will tell you that America is a pretty equal society, moving away from its past prejudices, in reality we really haven't moved that far.  While relationships between blacks and whites have improved dramatically, we still are a nation living in fear of what is different.  One thing that the vocal majority fear more than just about anything lately is gay marriage.  Look at the recent events in the "great" state of Massachusetts, Bush's state of the union address, even here in Virginia.      In the state of the union, Bush talks about saving the sanctity of marriage.  Then later his administration said it might propose a constitutional amendment banning gays and lesbians from marrying.  In Virginia, the overwhelmingly elderly white male General Assembly voted to support said amendment even though they have the state's first openly gay delegate in their midst.  In Massachusetts, there appeared to be some progress in this debate when the Supreme Court ruled that laws banning gay marriage are unconstitutional.  What does the Massachusetts legislation do in response to this ruling?  They call a constitutional convention to amend their constitution to outlaw gay marriage.  What the HELL is wrong with these people?  What in the blue hell is the problem with allowing homosexual men and women to get married?  Is it a problem with the word marriage being applied to more that one man and one woman?  Would "civil unions" be okay?  Why can't these gay couples have the same right, as straight couples to get married, be families, and reap the governmental and insurance benefits that go with it?  If it is a problem with the meaning of the word marriage, then change the definition.  Make it say:  "Marriage is a union between two people."   This would prevent the argument that says by changing the definition of marriage, you open yourself up to suits on polygamy and various other perversions of the term. The bottom line gays and lesbians may never be treated the same as everyone else.  It is not fair, but in this country it could very well be true.  We are a puritanical society.  A country founded on religion, a religion that says it is a sin to be homosexual.  A government that is influenced by the religious right, and a country that is close-minded and resistant to change are a dangerous combination.  There are still laws on the books in the state of Virginia that makes homosexuality a felony for God's sake.    Government should just take itself out of the marriage business all together.  If there truly is separation of church and state, then the state should not be in charge of the religious term of marriage.  That solution will NEVER happen.  Do you realize how much money the government makes off of people getting married?  Gay marriage is not an issue that will disappear.  As long as gays and lesbians are denied the same rights as heterosexuals, they will be out fighting for them.  Why not let them get married?  The government should be more than happy with that.  With more people allowed to get married, then the government will make more money off of the marriage cash cow they continue to run.

       POLITICAL RANT  Okay, so I didn't go vote in the presidential primary yesterday.  I was tired and did not feel like driving across town to my voting precinct.  I am glad I didn't.  My one vote would not have helped anyone defeat John Kerry here in Virginia.  I am not exactly sure what makes people believe that John Kerry is the candidate that can defeat Bush.  Remember Michael Dukakis anyone?  He was much like Kerry in that he came out of nowhere to become the Democratic Party's candidate in 1988, against George Bush.  In one of the most lopsided elections in our lifetime, Bush walloped Dukakis, using the philosophy of telling the American people that he was the stereotypical Massachusetts democrat.    Why wouldn't that work again?  There is no reason it shouldn't.  Kerry was Dukakis' Lieutenant Governor for god's sake.  Let me see, what else could one say about Kerry?  How about telling the American people that he is Ted Kennedy's buddy?  With the way people view ol' Teddy, that has to hurt Kerry a little bit.  Now I am not saying that any of the other Democrats are any better that Kerry.  I am not saying that ALL of Kerry's politics are wrong.  I just think that if the democrats think he is going to be the next Clinton then they are wrong.    If they want a strong candidate that may have a shot to beat "W" in November, then maybe they want to look at John Edwards.  In a lot of ways he resembles Clinton, he is as good of speaker, he is youngish, energetic, and most of all comes across as REAL.  That is one of the appeals of Bush is that he comes across as a real person, not a politician.  If the democrats intend to defeat Bush in November, Kerry "the Politicians Politician" is not the way to do it.

       PT : Question about physical therapy: Are these people supposed to be doctors?  I had therapy yesterday afternoon, and after my stupid stretching, I had another of the most PAINFUL, UNRELAXING massages ever.  You mean to tell me that people actually pay for these things.  Why would someone put themselves through that kind of pain and torture only for a few minutes of post massage comfort.  Have you ever stopped to wonder if the pain loss you feel is just a reaction to the amount of pain the massage made you endure.  They say that in massage, the ends justify the means.  I was told by my therapist that it is better to experience a little discomfort during the massage (she said "discomfort", I say PAIN) than to hurt later.  B.S.  Anyhoo, back to my orginial question, are these people doctors?  Do you have to go to med school for this, or can you just get a bachelors degree at  urlLink VCU ?  Just wondering, because you never call your therapist "Doctor," it is usually something like "Skip" or "Kelly."

      Alrighty, the first real posting.   I decided to let this first post give a little background about myself.  I am 24, and I work for Richmond's only Classic Rock station 96.5 The Planet.  I have been working there for the past 4 years (on this run).  I currently work every Sunday evening from 7-Midnight, with the last to hours being the train-wreck of a program called Little Steven's Underground Garage.   I have a degree in Mass Communications from Virginia Commonwealth University.  It basically was a waste of 5 years, because it has been two years since I graduated, and I can't even get an interview, let alone a full time job.   I currently drive a BRAND NEW 2004  urlLink Volkswagen  Beetle that I am still looking for a good name for.  Hopefully in the comming weeks I will give someone the oppurtunity to help me out in that department.  I am also looking to start a website to use to give information about myself, the radio station, and other tidbits as soon as I learn HTML code.  I am all out of stuff to say.  Man this writing a blog business is tougher than it looks.  Talk to you later, J

       RICHMOND PART II: The City Revitalization   "Our city is in great health.  It is the best time we have had-the most excitement we have seen since rebuilt the city after it was burned down in the 1860's.  We have only just begun."  -Calvin D. Jameson, Richmond City Manager  Amen to that.  Richmond is in the midst of great change both politically and physically.  The people may FINALLY get to elect their own mayor instead of the crooks on city council picking from within their own ranks.  The crooks on city council may even be forced to undergo some major investigations into their continued legal issues.  Even better than that, the once dilapidated downtown is beginning to undergo some cool beautification processes.  The first step happened earlier last year when the convention center was opened.  Just this past December, Main St. Station was reopened as train station after years of being either a failed mall or state office space.  The Sixth Street Marketplace has been torn down, and work has begun on building a theater district in its place.  Over on Brown's Island, work is being done to renovate the old power plant area into housing, office, and retail space.  The question is, will it work?    I don't know if the people of Richmond are going to quit moving out to the counties, or shopping in them for that matter very easily.  It has been a really long time since the city was a viable option for people.  It has a reputation for its high crime and murder rates, so what makes city leaders feel that people will forget all the years of disarray.  Although these changes are all good on paper, Richmond is NOT Baltimore.  The people of this city are not like the people in Baltimore.  We don't do change that well.  Hell, people here are still fighting the Civil War most of the time.  The city improvements in Baltimore were well received and have worked, but remember they built two things to draw people to downtown...a baseball stadium and a football stadium.  So, should we build a baseball stadium in Shockoe Bottom?  Hell yes we should!  A city stadium next to or near Main St. Station would drive more people to downtown.  The Diamond is old, outdated and falling apart.  Instead of spending the $18 million to renovate it, tear it down and use that money to help build the $80 million or so you need for a new ballpark.  Baseball however, may not be the answer.  Richmond is not all that passionate about their sports franchises.  We are a major league town with minor league teams.  People will bleed maroon and gold for the Washington Redskins, but god forbid they pay $12 bucks for a Richmond Braves, Speed, Renegades, Riverdogs ticket.  So is the theater district the answer?  No. I don't think that there are enough theater goers in this city to do what leaders want them to do.  They plan on building two new theaters as well as expanding the 100 year old Carpenter Center.  We didn't have a professional theater company in Richmond until this week when the Barksdale went pro.  (Okay we had the Virginia Theatre, but they went broke two years ago.)  How do they intend to keep continuous performances going to keep revenue flowing?  Theater is a step in the right direction, but there needs to be more. The Power Plant project on Brown's Island is another positive step.  The luxury condos with views of the city and James River may actually bring the city more residents.  The plan for the actual old Power Plant include possibly a ESPN Zone or Hard Rock Cafe'.  The problem with that is, I don't think Richmond is a big enough city for a Hard Rock, and we don't have a major league sports franchise, so why do we need a ESPN Zone?  We still don't even have a full time ESPN Radio affiliate.  Another positive step, but come on where is the draw?  The final piece of the puzzle to drive up business in the city remains a mystery to political leaders.  I do have an idea that may help some.  Instead of bickering over and suppressing Richmond's very historic past, why don't we celebrate it?  This is one of the most historic cities in the United States, and we don't really seem to care.  We are too busy fighting the Civil War, that we refuse to celebrate our historic role in it.  I am not saying celebrate the Confederacy or the ills that led us to war, I am saying that we need to embrace our role in the war, and use the historic landmarks around here to help teach people the history of the time.  People love to visit historic sites.  Lets give them a historic view of the city and let them enjoy the city's redevelopment, and appreciate how we have learned from the past, and are working to make Richmond better for the future.  For more information check out the article on the redevelopment program in today's  urlLink Times Dispatch .

       RICHMOND PART 1: THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY  Greetings from the  Capitol of the Confederacy.   The funny thing is the Civil War was over 100 years ago and to look around Downtown Richmond, there are some spots that you would think belong in the capital city of a war loser.  Anyway, the city of Richmond is more than the historic Confederate capital.  It is a hotbed of political activity, socio-economic change, and even a pretty nice train station.    As far as politics go, it is hard to get anymore political than the General Assembly.  In session now, the legislature is filled with aging political relics and fresh young blood with staunch Republican views.  (Remember, this is a body who voted to support a US constitution amendment banning gay marriage when there is no such amendment proposed yet.)  The funny thing is, if you go over an watch the Assembly in action, you learn a lot about the people we have running the state.    My first visit to this session of the GA came in January.  I sat there and watched the House Committee on General Laws chairman and two other delegates literally fall asleep during the meeting.  They are supposed to be discussing legislation,  NOT SLEEPING!   In future meetings there was little sleeping, but there was a lot of not paying attention going on.  Delegates were looking up stuff on laptops, ordering the page to get them food, or some were even talking on their cell phones.  Now I don't mean to sound rude but, WHAT THE #@%! ARE THESE PEOPLE DOING!!!!  They get paid very well to work three months a year and what do they do, they obviously don't give a crap about being there.  The people didn't vote for you so you could sleep, talk on the phone, look up porn or whatever on laptops, or whatever the hell else they were doing aside from making laws.   It is very disheartening to see this kind of stuff happening.  Unless you go to the committee meetings though you miss all of this.  You go to the gallery and watch the session you get to see Girl Scout troops introduced, and "Points of Personal Privilege."  You may occasionally get to see them vote on a piece of legislation that most of them haven't even read.  What kind of government is this?  Its the Virginia General Assembly dammint, and its Virginia's government, and we're content with it.  At least enough people to keep from making any sweeping changes anyway.

       COVER SONG:  As I type this I am hearing the DAMN Limp Bizcuit cover of the Who's Behind Blue Eyes for the 5th time today.  Does Y101 have any other songs?  I don't know, but I swear to God if I hear this friggin' piece of trash one more time today I am going to go nuts.  Someone should kick them square in the nutsack for ruining perfectly good radio with this piece of crap.   "L-I-M-P Discover"    Maybe they need  Levetra  or  Enzyte .

       SNOW   So the supposed weather experts are again calling for snow, and as I look out my office window, I can see it falling.  Remember when snow was fun and exciting?  Remember when you got excited every time the weatherman said the S-word.  ("Snow" get your minds out of the gutter).  What happened to those times?  I'll tell you what happened.  Reality...That's what happened.  You grew up, moved into the real world, and you realized that snow is nothing more than cold, slippery rain, and it sucks.  You know that if the TV calls for it, then you better avoid the grocery store.  You know that if it snows a lot, you are going to be stuck inside with your family for God knows how long, with nothing to do.  You also know that even in a light dusting, the moronic in this area will completely forget how to drive!  Richmond isn't know for having the best drivers anyway, but you throw in a little precipitation of any kind, and they just can't handle the added pressure.   Those reasons alone don't answer the question of when snow stopped being fun.  An even better reason is you no longer get out of school for it.  Most of us have to still go to work.

       PRESIDENT'S DAY  Okay, today is one of the least significant holidays ever.  No one really gives a hoot that it is President's Day.  Car dealerships and furniture places are all having sales, but aside from that, most people aren't even off of work.  I am however, and instead of posting a diatribe about Presidents and their day, I am going to take today off and clean my house.

       UPDATE ON THIS MORNING'S POST   So I took the basic jest of this morning's post and sent it to Ukrop's corporate office.  I actually got a response and they seemed to legitimatly care.  Surprise, surprise.  Here is what they said:   "You're right.  We should treat every customer as just what they are -- a customer.  I am very surprised to hear that our associate did not do so.  We have two stores on Patterson and I believe you were in The Village location.  This is the location that I will be speaking with.  I will determine who the associate is and because customer service takes such a high priority with us, we will take the action that we feel is appropriate when an associate does so strongly not exhibit what should be provided.  Additionally, I will relay this to Bobby Ukrop -- he places a huge priority on customer service.  This will be dealt with.  Thank you for taking the time to let both the manager and our corporate office know about this issue.  I hope you will accept my apology and my assurance that this will be researched and action taken."   So perhaps we can score one for the little guy.

       SECOND CLASS CITIZEN   Why is it that when you look like you are under a certain age, that people feel like they can treat you like a second class citizen and get away with it?  Last night my sister and I went to the local Ukrop's supermarket to get some dinner, and were treated just like we were trashy lepers, that came in to kill the shoppers of the store.  First let me give you a description of the two of us.  I am 24 years old, I probably look about 17.  I was wearing a nice sweater and slacks that I had worn to work yesterday.  My sister is 28, and probably looks 16-18.  She works in a law office, so she was dressed even nicer than I was.  We regularly visit the store to pick up dinner on nights when my fiance' works.    We showed up in the Kitchen section at the Ukrop's and no one was at the counter.  So we stood and waited.  Ten minutes or so passed and still no help.  The guy who was supposed to be working the kitchen area kept peeking up at us from a door that was in the back of the section.  Still no help.  FINALLY, the Deli woman came over to help us out.  I greeted her with a quick "hi, how are you doing?"  She just stood there.  No "hello," no "how can I help you?"  She just stood there grimacing.  So I gave her the order, and she made it seem as if my presence was an inconvenience to her.  I was HOT.  So HOT in fact that if it had not been for the kindness of the cashier, I would have made a scene.  I worked at Ukrop's in high school.  I know their mission statement and values.  No where in there does it say treat some customers like family and others like trash.  This is not an isolated incident but, I have NEVER felt more like a second class citizen then I did last night.  Why was I treated this way?  The old man behind me was treated like he was a member of the family that she hadn't seen in years.  If I'd never shopped there before, I may have understood a little bit but, I am there every week.  Usually three times a week.  I spend a lot of money in that store, and dammit I deserve to be treated like a person, not an inconvenience.  So I called the manager, he said he was sorry and would take care of it.  Does that make everything okay?  NO!  Just because I look younger than I am, people don't automatically get the right to treat me like trash!  I work hard for everything that I have, and I deserve the same treatment as someone who is in their 30s, 40s, or even 300s.  Society seems to believe that if you are under a certain age, then they have the right to treat you like a "punk."  Who the F#$% gave people the right to judge me, or anyone for that matter because they look a certain age?    It happens everywhere, and it needs to stop.  Just because my sister and I look like kids, doesn't necessarily mean we are.  There is no excuse to treat anyone like a second class citizen.  It doesn't matter how old you are, what color you are, what gender you are, or what sexual orientation you are; you deserve to be treated with a little respect.  This society is one that has long treated someone different as a pariah.  Look as recently as yesterday with G.W's support of banning gay marriage.  Well I for one am tired as hell as being treated like I am beneath the rest of the world around me.  I don't care who I have to call, I don't care who I have to yell at; I will NEVER be treated like I was at Ukrop's yesterday and go quietly again.

       GAY MARRIAGE REVISITED    "Today I call upon the Congress to promptly pass and to send to the states for ratification an amendment to our Constitution defining and protecting marriage as the union of a man and woman as husband and wife," -George W. Bush   CNN.com is reporting that President Bush has called for Congress to create, pass, and send to the states a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.  WHAT THE F#$%?  According to the article he says it is what the American people want.  Who are these people?  Who really gives a damn if the definition of marriage is changed?  The religious bigots that think that because the bible doesn't condone homosexuality, then the government cannot condone it either?  What about separation of church and state?  If you have an opinion on the topic of gay marriage, either for or against, contact you congressman, the media, etc... so we can really see if a constitutional ban is REALLY what the American people want, or if it is just prejudice ramblings of an moron from Texas and professional old narrow minded fools in Congress.  Somewhere Jerry Falwell is smiling. (Hopefully near the back feet of a horse that can kick the bastard's teeth in.)  To read the article on CNN.com  urlLink CLICK HERE .

       PET OWNERS  So this weekend marked the annual Pet Expo at the Showplace here in Richmond.  The event is actually a pretty cool concept.  You are invited to bring your pets to the show to walk around an look at items and information to help you take better care of your animal.  So, as we walked around with the dogs, I noticed a very disturbing problem that keeps responsible pet owners from bringing their pets along with them in public... LAZY A** PEOPLE !!  As we were walking I watched a couple let their bulldog take a dump in the middle of the floor.  You may say "it is a dog, it happens" but instead of picking it up, they just casually walked away.  Thus leaving a huge pile of crap in the middle of the floor.  I am sure these people were not alone, but that is not an excuse.  It is not isolated to just the Pet Expo either.  In September we had a new outdoor mall open up at Stony Point here in Richmond.  The mall was unique in that they decided that dogs were allowed to come too.  After just three months, mall management was rethinking their policy.  Why?     LAZY A** PEOPLE!!!   apparently people were not picking up their dogs crap not just outside, but inside as well.  In the article in the Times Dispatch, a dog was said to have pooed on the marble floor inside Saks Fifth Avenue and what did the lazy owner do?  They left it there of course.  How difficult is it to take care of your animal?  We have two dogs, a Border Collie and a Pomeranian.  The Border won't go to the bathroom anywhere but outside, no matter how bad she has to go.  The Pom, who is almost 1 year old, only goes inside when she absolutely can't hold it anymore.  These dogs were  TRAINED  to go outside.  It doesn't matter anyway, the girls are always the best behaved dogs in public anyway.  Why?  They learned to be good to other dogs and especially respect people.  If your dog can't be taught those two key traits, then don't take it to public places.  Why would someone that knows their animal is antisocial, and not potty trained take the animal out to a mall or even the Pet Expo?    Basically it boils down to the fact that people are inconsiderate.  What is important to them is all that matters and to hell with those around them.  It is kind of like when you are at a restaurant and the people at the table beside you are making out, or even worse fighting, and you are stuck having to deal with it.  These people want to take their demented animal out into public, so screw those of us with good dogs who only want people to pay attention to them.  The Border Collie loves people so much, she would probably bite her own leg off before biting them, yet so may A-holes have brought their demented dogs into public that people perceive her as a threat. (Unless they give her a chance, then they love her.)    People need to start taking responsibility for their pets.   Clean up after them, teach them discipline .  If people can start doing those things maybe animals could become more welcome in the public world.  As a pet owner I realize that they want to take their dogs with them out on the town, but if they don't start taking care of them, then that screws every responsible pet owner out there.  Take the extra minute to  pick up the poop , spend the money for obedience courses, expose your pet to others, but most of all treat the animal like they were one of you kids.  You wouldn't let your kid take a crap on the marble in Saks Fifth Avenue and not clean it up.  Would you?

       PROFILE   Since the web geek at 965theplanet.com still hasn't added my profile to the personalities section of the site, I have decided to post my radio station profile here on the Blog.  They sent out survey questions and here are my answers to them.     Where were you born and raised?    Born in Richmond, raised here, probably gonna die here.    Education?    VCU- If you can call it an education.  They took my money, and built buildings and gave me a piece of paper, but I think that hardly qualifies as education.  Most of it came from the college station WVCW or Richmond’s Only Classic Rock Station 96.5 The Planet.  (Shameless Kiss Up.)     What the worst job you've held (other than your current one)?    Worked as a bagger at Ukrop’s. The only good thing about it was in the winter you could watch old ladies fight over the last gallon of milk and the last loaf of bread when the weatherman said Snow.    Any hobbies?     History, Space Ghost, I also have a Beetle.    Why radio?    I don’t like wearing suits.     Why do you love classic rock?    I get paid to love classic rock.  I LIKE classic rock because it brings back a time when people listened to music that had a point.  It wasn’t just noise, or worse than the noise, the bass.       5 desert island albums?    Journey-Greatest Hits Def Leppard – Hysteria Manfred Mann’s Earth Band They Might Be Giants- Flood Dashboard Confessional- The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most    Favorite album cut?    Currently: Radio – Alkaline Trio Of all time: Two out of three ain’t bad – Meatloaf (Just Kidding…or am I???)    Greatest live rock show you've ever seen?     I really don’t think that the greatest live rock show I have ever seen could even begin to qualify as Classic Rock, so I will just say Motley Crue.    Junior or Senior (Earnhardt), and why?    Does it matter?  One is dead, and the other is all over my television, selling everything from beer to cologne to auto parts.  Whether you choose one or the other, it doesn’t change any of that.  Personally I choose the Macho Man Randy Savage (He only tries to sell me Slim Jims. “Snap into it!”).   Maybe it is just too controversial for a Classic Rock station's website.  After all, I did kind of dodge the NASCAR question.

       THE BEETLE HAS A NAME  After weeks of searching we have found a name for the Beetle.  It was decided, because it hates my fiance' that the Beetle was a female.  The new name for the Beetle is a old German Frau name (Hey, it is a Volkswagen).  The Beetle is now named Eva.  Since my fiance', sister, and I named it, no prizes were awarded.  Thought someone might like to know.

       CELEBRITY   So on Saturday I was working a remote at an Ntelos cell phone store with  urlLink Dick Hungate  and these kids won a couple of T-shirts off of us.  The kids left with their Dad, but came back 5 minutes later asking Dick and I for out autographs.  I suppose that I should be flattered, after all how many people get asked for their autograph.  I wasn't flattered, I just felt uncomfortable.   I AM NOT A CELEBRITY .  I am just a person like everyone else.  It is not just kids.  A lot of adults that win stuff from the radio station seem to have the same misconceptions.  So to clarify; Just because we are on the radio, it doesn't mean that we are stars.  It is just a job.  A job that requires you to push a button 6 times an hour and talk into a microphone.  That's it.  There is no glamour, no lights, just a job.    I suppose someone could think it was more.  After all, when we push that button our voice is broadcast for all to hear.  So what.  Just because the city of Richmond can hear you when they get into their cars doesn't mean that you are any more important than anyone else.  We aren't famous.  Sure people may know the voice and the name, but radio people can walk around the street without anyone having a clue as to who they are.  Later Saturday afternoon I was talking to another one of my coworkers,  urlLink Bishop , who said that he was approached outside of a station event.  He was at McDonalds with his son, wearing a B103 jacket, and a group of kids encouraged by their parents asked him to sign anything from empty fry containers to hamburger wrappers.  Our autographs are worth absolutely nothing.  Unless my signature is on a check or something, it has ZERO value.  I am not a movie star, athlete, or a public official.  I guess I can be considered a public figure, but I am not  urlLink Gene Cox .  The funny thing is with the local TV people, fans will see them in public and say "hey there is so and so," they don't run up to them with a pen and say "sign this."  There seems to be some kind of misconception about the people on the radio.  Maybe people find them cooler, or maybe the mystery of their identity revealed is a big thrill.  Either way, it makes for an awkward situation.  Later on this week I may dispel some myths about Disc Jockeys, but until then remember:   RADIO PERSONALITIES ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM YOU.  BEING ON THE RADIO DOES NOT MAKE SOMEONE A CELEBRITY, OR EVEN A ROLE MODEL.   They are just people with jobs, low paying jobs at that.

       OSCAR PICKS REVIEW   So I guess I didn't do too badly with my picks.  I missed the Lord of the Rings for best picture, and director.  I honestly didn't expect it to win because it is a fantasy film.  It was an excellent film and did deserve to win the award so good for it.  (A little bitter Seabiscuit didn't win though.  I like Seabiscuit. :0 )    As far as best actor goes, I still think Bill Murray deserved to win it.  I didn't see Mystic River, but I find it very hard to believe the Spicoli was the best actor among the five nominated.  Who knows?  Quite frankly who really cares?  My day is no different after the Oscars than it was before.  Just thought picking them could be fun.  Maybe I will have better luck next year.  (Even though four out of seven is not too shabby.)

       OSCAR PICKS   Not that I really care, but I decided to make my predictions for the Academy Awards.    Best Animated Film: Finding Nemo  (Great Film.)   Best Supporting Actress: Rene'e Zellweger, Cold Mountain  (What is up with her face?)   Best Supporting Actor: Tim Robbins, Mystic River   (I liked Shawshank Redemption)   Best Actress: Charlize Theron, Monster  (She looked ugly as hell in this movie.)   Best Actor: Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl  (If not him, Bill Murray.  I don't like Spicoli.)  Best Director: Sofia Coppola, Lost in Translation  (Didn't see it)   Best Picture: Seabiscuit  (I liked Seabiscuit)   I will update you tommorrow on how I did.

       SUPER GUEST ENTRY: SUPERSTAR MICHAEL J. LIEDTKE'S WRESTLEMANIA XX PICKS    I have decided to allow for the wrestling encyclopedia, Superstar Liedtke to give the blog his Wrestlemania XX predictions.  On Monday, we will compare each other's picks, and see who is right or wrong.  Again, I feel as if I have no life, but this is fun for me.    Goldberg v. Brock Lesnar  I wouldn't be surprised to see no finish at all but, I pick Lesnar.  Because the rumours of him leaving WWE are rampant, the NFL likely won't pan out.  McMahon could bring him back after he flops in football.  My guess a limited dates run, similar to Goldberg.  Winner: Brock Lesnar    Triple H v. Chris Benoit v. Shawn Michaels (HBK)   for the World Title  I pick Benoit, though it could easily be Triple H.  Winner: Chris Benoit    Undertaker w/Paul Bearer v. Kane  I would like to go out on a limb and pick Kane but, I can't.  Kane would need to be built up to continue this feud.  That said he won't be, and the feud will continue anyway.  Winner: Undertaker    Eddie Guerrero v. Kurt Angle   for the WWE Championship  WWE needs more top stars on Smackdown!.  Eddie losing would kill his momentum.  Winner: Eddie Guerrero    Stacy Keibler/Miss Jackie v. Sable/Torrie Wilson  Who gives a damn.  Bottom line all four of them are going to lose some clothes.  Winner: Stacy Keibler/Miss Jackie    John Cena v. Big Show   for the US Title  Broken wrist and bad knee aside, Cena wins and Big Show goes on to feud with the WWE Champion. (Bye Brock!) Winner: John Cena   Cruiserweight Open (Chavo Guerrero v. 10 Cruiserweights)  Chavo Sr. was right.  Chavo Jr. doesn't deserve these shenannigans!  Chavo retains, then again I don't see it happening (both Guerreros winning).  So I pick Rey Mysterio.  Winner: Rey Mysterio Jr.    Mick Foley/The Rock v. Ric Flair/Batista/Randy Orton  I would love to see Terry Funk make it a six man.  He won't.  Since the WWE needs more young stars and Rock is leaving again following mania, Orton pins Rock.  The Legend Killer.  Winner: Ric Flair/Batista/Randy Orton    Molly Holly v. Victoria   for the WWE Women's Championship  I am going to go with the upset and say Victoria will win.  I wish I didn't see Molly bald after mania but I do.  At least it would lead up to a good feud.  Winner: Victoria    Chris Jericho v. Christian  CLB wins in a "creepy" way.    Winner: Christian    Fatal Four Way for the World Tag Team Championship  Garrison is the name of a loser.  Oddly enough, he will be coming out a winner.  Winner: Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak    Fatal Four Way for the WWE Tag Team Titles  Since the Bashams run seems to be over, and I am tired of the other two teams, I'll pick the Worlds Greatest Tag Team.  Although Rikishi and Scotty may actually retain their titles.  Winner: TSPWGTT    There you have it Superstar Mike Liedtke takes a stab at predicting Wrestlemania XX.  Call your bookie and make your bets.

       TOP TEN WRESTLEMANIA MATCHES PART III: NUMBER ONE MATCH    Wrestlemania X7: Edge & Christian v. The Dudley Boys v. The Hardy Boyz in TLC II   The second installment of the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches provided the best match in the 19 Wrestlemania's to this point.  As the match progressed, All six men then climbed the ladders, and were battling up top.  All of them fell, with Christian falling over the top rope to the floor.  Spike Dudley ran in and gave Edge the Acid Drop off a ladder in the ring, then gave Christian an Acid Drop from the ring apron through a table at ringside.  Rhyno then ran out, and hit D-Von with a ladder, gored Bubba, and gored Matt through a table in the corner.  Lita then ran out, as Edge was climbing the ladder.  Lita pulled Edge off and rammed him into the ladder.  Rhyno grabbed Lita for a slam, but Spike hit him with a low blow,  Lita then hit Rhyno with a rana from the top.  Spike hit Rhyno with a chair, and he fell into the ladder, knocking Edge off. The Dudleys hit Rhyno with the Doomsday Device.  Lita hit Spike with a chair.    Jeff Hardy set up a huge ladder at ringside, and put Spike and Rhyno through a table with a senton bomb. D-Von and Christian climbed to the belts, and Matt Hardy took their ladder way, so D-Von and Christian hung off the belts suspension ring.  They both eventually fell.  Jeff Hardy went from ladder to ladder, fell, then climbed up and tried to get the belts.  Bubba and Matt climbed up the big ladder, but Rhyno shoved the ladder, and the two men fell into the two stacks of two tables that had been set up at ringside earlier.  This left D-Von against E&C.  D-Von climbed one side of a ladder, with Christian climbing the other.  Edge grabbed D-Von's leg to stop him, as Rhyno climbed under Christian and boosted him up so he could grab the belts. Nice.  There you go the greatest match in Wrestlemania history.    Some of the info on the match came from  urlLink 1wrestling.com 's review of the match.  Just in case you were wondering how in the heck I could remember all of that.  I couldn't  I really just remember the giant ladder, the carnage of the match, the interference from Spike, Rhyno, and Lita, and the way Edge and Christian won.  This match had everything.  It was the best of the TLC matches.  The amount of damage all nine of these people did to their bodies to entertain the fans was enough to make this match a classic.  This is the TLC that people judge the rest against.  A+ Match.  Okay, there you have it the Top Ten Matches of Wrestlemania.  No more posts this week, stay tuned next week as we see how the Wrestlemania XX picks turned out plus Chapter 2 in the  Rise and Fall of WVCW  series.  Plus whatever else comes into my head.  Remember  urlLink Wrestlemania XX  is this Sunday at 7:00 PM only on PPV.    To order Wrestlemania  urlLink CLICK HERE .

       The Rise and Fall of WVCW: Chapter 1 October 1997    I decided to day to begin a series that chronicles one of the most important places in my life, the great WVCW.  Although it no longer is a part of my day to day life, I will always carry the people and the work that was done at WVCW with me.  It was a second home to me, and it's story needs to be told.  Hope you enjoy Part One.   So I began working at the college radio station at VCU in the Fall of 1997.  It had a pretty kick ass location, and okay studio, and a window that looked out onto the common area in front of the building.  By the end of that year, all of that would be gone, and the rebuilding would begin.  University red tape, mismanagement, controversy, and lawsuits laid the groundwork for the demise of a once popular institution.  The station would find itself mired in obscurity, that still haunts it to this day.  The Fall Semester 1997, started off the same as any normal year would at WVCW.  There was a new General Manager, a new Program Director, and a bunch of eager young air personalities just waiting to have their voices heard.  One such personality was a young man we will just call Matt.  Now Matt thought that he was hot sh*t.  Matt had been a caller on Howard Stern's radio show several times.  He thought that gave him experience, and a buddy in Stern.  He was wrong.  Now you see ol' Matt got himself a little radio show with a couple of his buddies.  Matt decided that he could very well be the next Howard Stern, so he needed to model his show off of the one of his idol.  He did some stupid gimmicks and took some calls, but on one October day he went too far.  Matt, decided it would be fun to do a sketch mocking a guy who lived on his dorm room floor.  The guy who shall remain nameless, was a dance major at VCU, and was working hard at school and making friends.  Unfortunately he was targeted by Matt and his Posse as a homosexual.  Whether he was or not, we may not know, but that didn't matter to Matt and the boys.  The boys portrayed him as a flaming dancer, all the while giving out the guy's dorm room number, and his phone number.  What Matt didn't count on was his victim had a friend with a tape recorder, who rolled tape of the show and gave it to the victim.   (I realize this would be easier with names, but legally I can't give out names without permission.)   So, the victim called the Police, the Dance Department Chair, the Student Media Commission at VCU, and of course his lawyer.  The radio station management immediately fired Matt and company and was forced to air recorded apologies every hour.  Matt really didn't seem to care about the damage he had done.  Sure he was expelled from school, barred from every working in student media if he were ever reinstated, and faced the possibility of monetary loss, the only blow that came as a disappointment to our boy Matt came from his hero.  He phoned Stern to let him know the situation, expecting Stern to fight for him.  Stern just commented on what an idiot that Matt was for pulling that stunt, and how Stern can get away with more because he had lawyers.  He called the kid a moron and basically crushed his hopes that he could be Howard's heir apparent.    The law suit results are still unclear, but it did lead to the radio station banning all talk shows, except one (We'll get into that later.).  This incident was a blemish on the radio station that caused a public humiliation to VCU.  A humiliation WVCW would pay for the following May.   Stay tuned for the rest of the story coming in the next several days.  Chapter Two will talk about the one remaining talk show, and how that laid the groundwork for the rise that the station would receive years later.

       TOP TEN WRESTLEMANIA MATCHES PART II    To view the Bottom Five, see yesterday's post: Top Ten Wrestlemania Matches Part I    5. Wrestlemania III Ricky "the Dragon" Steamboat v. Macho Man Randy Savage:   Although it may not be the most memorable match on the Wrestlemania III card, it is definitely the best.  Despite Macho Man's best efforts and an Atomic Elbow off the top rope, Steamboat wins with a small package roll up and takes the Intercontinental Title.     4. Wrestlemania 2000 Edge & Christian v. The Dudleys v. The Hardy Boyz:   The first of the great confrontations between these three teams was a classic by itself.  Originally a ladder match, the Dudleys introduced tables to the contest thus laying the groundwork for the TLC matches to come.  Edge and Christian win using two ladders with a table across them (like a scaffold) to grab the belts.  Match features a Swanton Bomb by Jeff Hardy from the top of a ladder onto Bubba Ray Dudley on the floor.  Kick Ass.   3. Wrestlemania X8 The Rock v. Hollywood Hulk Hogan:   This match had everything.  The Icon v. Icon billing was definitely lived up to as Hulk and Rock gave the fans a show that will be remembered for years to come.  Hogan came into the match as the villain, but the fans in Toronto cheered him as if he was the good guy he was in the 1980s.  The face in the match (The Rock) was booed out of the building by the crowd who had loved him earlier in the night.  This forced WWE to bring back the Red and Yellow and let Hulkamania run wild again.  Despite surviving several Rock Bottoms and Hulking up, Hogan was pinned by the Rock following a third Rock Bottom and a People's Elbow.  The post match was classic.  The Rock, obviously happy for Hogan, and the legendary Hulkster posed in the ring, in a moment that worked out better than anyone could have imagined.   2. Wrestlemania X7 The (Bad) Gimmick Battle Royal:   The Iron Sheik won the match, but nobody really cared.  This match saw the return of Mean Gene Okerland and Bobby "the Brain" Heenan to the WWE.  It also featured some legendary performers such as the Bushwackers, the Gobledy Gooker, Freebird Michael Hayes, Hillbilly Jim, and of course Sgt. Slaughter.  The commentary on the match is priceless comedy, including The Brain commenting during the combat footage of Sgt. Slaughter's entrance video, "He's shooting blanks now." Classic.  Post Sheik's victory he and Slaughter recreated some Cold War drama by fighting it out, ending with Sheik falling victim to the Cobra Clutch.  Go Joe!   And the Number One match in Wrestlemania History Is...:  You have to wait until tomorrow.   I may have a another non-Wrestlemania post later in the day.

       DEATH PENALTY  So yesterday a Virginia judge sentenced the DC Sniper John Allen Muhammed to die by lethal injection this October.  Due to Virginia law, he probably won't die this year, but at least he got what he deserved.  Today another judge is going to sentence the man who supposedly pulled the trigger in shootings Lee Malvo to life in prison.  Does that make any sense?  So let me get this straight, the mastermind behind the killings gets the death penalty, but the actual shooter gets to rot in jail.  There seems to be lack of logic here.  According to the reports from the trial, one woman on the jury of Malvo said "No" to the death penalty, because he was just a kid.  In Virginia, death penalty verdicts must be unanimous, so the actual shooter is going to live and use up taxpayers dollars in the Virginia prison system for the rest of his life.  People have made a case that because Malvo was only 17 at the time of the shootings, he was unable to avoid the grip that Muhammed had on him.  He was not as responsible because he was under the control of the real psycho right?    WRONG.  At 17 you know right from wrong.  You are able to make your own decisions.  Using the mind control logic on this case is just a load of crap.  The kid not only killed most of the people, he laughed about, drew pictures of the killings, and even was the one that tormented police.  How in the Hell do you chalk it up to "he didn't know what he was doing?"  You can't however, one stupid woman did.  Because of her vote to make him live, Malvo will avoid the proper punishment for his crimes (at least until he is tried in the other killings).  Thanks to this woman, the families of the victims will be denied the justice they so richly deserve.   I know that some people will argue that the death penalty is immoral.  They say that only God has the right to decide who lives or dies, so it is not the government's place to take a life.  My question for those people is, was it right for Malvo or Muhammed to take all of those innocent people's lives?  The answer is NO.  Both of these men deserve to die for their crimes.  If we can kill thousands of people in the "War on Terror" then these two menaces to society definitely need to die too.  Malvo should eventually get the death penalty.  It may not be for killing Linda Franklin in Virginia, but there are many more victims in Virginia and Maryland for him to be tried for killing.  Hopefully one of those juries will lack someone who thinks that 17 year olds don't know right from wrong andcan't think for themselves.  What do I know?  I am the one that says that Timothy McVeigh got off light for the Oklahoma City bombings.  Sure he was put to death, but it was by lethal injection.  Whoopee.  He should have been put through the same hell he put his victims through, i.e. putting nitro-glycerin caps on his teeth and giving him the option of starving to death or biting down thus blowing his head off.

       TOP 10 WRESTLEMANIA MATCHES PART I    Continuing this week's theme of counting down to Wrestlemania XX, today we take a look at my top 10 favorite Wrestlemania Matches.  Keep in mind, that I missed a couple of shows during the lean years, so These only reflect the Mania shows I have seen and the matches that I enjoyed.      10.  Wrestlemania X7 Chris Jericho v. William Regal:    Although the ending wasn't pretty, and you could see the blood pouring out of William Regal's nose, Y2J and the Commish, put on a heck of an entertaining match that saw Jericho pin Regal to retain the Intercontinental Championship.   9.  Wrestlemania III Hulk Hogan v. Andre the Giant:  How could this not be on the list?  The drama of whether or not Hogan could slam Andre was enough to keep the crowd fully engaged in the match.  The moment that Hogan lifted Andre for the slam, you could just feel the energy of the crowd.  Hogan getting the pin over a man who could not be beaten was the moment that solidified Wrestlemania as a truly special event.   8.  Wrestlemania XIX Trish Stratus v. Victoria v. Jazz : An excellent match featuring three of the most talented divas in the WWE.  Victoria held the title since Survivor Series, and was insanely desperate to keep it.  Jazz's involvement in the match really made little sense, except she was returning from injury and was receiving a push.  Victoria and Trish's feud was about to come to a head.  Trish walked out of Seattle with the Women's Title that night, but lost it to Jazz a short time later.     7.  Wrestlemania XIX Shawn Michaels v. Chris Jericho : How could this not be good?  Two of the most entertaining performers in WWE history put on the show of the night at last years Mania.  Despite everyone believing that Jericho was going to take this one, HBK scored the clean pin after an excellent match.  The best part may have been the post match when Jericho tricked Michaels into thinking he had earned his respect, and then proceeded to give Michaels a beatdown.     6. Wrestlemania XII Shawn Michaels v. Bret Hart : After going the almost a full hour in this Iron Man match without a pin fall or submission Hart locked the Sharpshooter on HBk with only seconds remaining in the match.  To the shock of Hart and the crowd, HBK did not tap out and time expired on the match.  It was at this moment that WWE President Gorilla Monsoon restarted the match under sudden death rules.  HBK hit the Sweet Chin Music on Hart and got the overtime pin.  Thus winning the WWE Title.  Excellent match.

       WRESTLEMANIA XX PICKS   Alrighty, for the fun of it I will reach into my crystal ball and make predictions for this coming Sunday's Wrestlemania XX.  It will be interesting to see if I am correct on any of these or if I am way off the mark.   Goldberg v. Brock Lesnar  It has long been reported that this will be Goldberg's last match with the WWE.  Does that mean he will lose?  Originally I would have said that this match was a lock for Lesnar, but with rumblings that he will be taking some time off after mania, look for a surprise here. (Maybe some interference from Vinny Mac, or a Legend)  I am going to go ahead and say Goldberg wins.  I don't like Brock Lesnar.  Winner: Goldberg    Triple H v. Chris Benoit v. Shawn Michaels (HBK)   for the World Title  As much as I would love to see Chris Benoit win the title, I just don't think it is going to happen.  If Booker T wasn't good enough to beat HHH last year, why is Benoit?  I think this match will come down to a screw job ending seeing HHH pin HBK, thus setting up Benoit v. Triple H at Backlash.  With Benoit winning the title then.    Winner: Triple H    Undertaker  w/Paul Bearer  v. Kane  If the Undertaker doesn't come back wearing the purple gloves and silly hat, then I am going to be pissed.  I think it is really cool that Taker is coming back as the dead man and bringing back Paul Bearer is a nice touch too.  Bringing Taker back as the old gimmick makes me wonder why they didn't do a hybrid.  You see he was the undead, then a biker.  It only makes sense that he comes back as an undead biker.  Back to the match, Kane has been used terribly throughout his tenure with the WWE, Look for that streak to continue this Sunday.  Winner: Undertaker    Eddie Guerrero v. Kurt Angle   for the WWE Championship  Who wouldn't want to see Eddie hold onto the WWE title for a little while longer.  Eddie just kicks so much A@# that he deserves it.  Kurt Angle on the other hand has become a little stale.  They need to bring the character back to the naive bad guy that he was when he first came into the company.  No clear advantage in the match, and whomever wins this promises to be one of the best matches on the card.  I will go ahead and say everyone will be disappointed in the outcome.  Winner: Kurt Angle    Stacy Keibler/Miss Jackie v. Sable/Torrie Wilson  Who cares?  This is the T&A match of the night. Somebody is sure to end up showing their goodies in this evening gown match.  I say the Raw chicks win, but I don't know or care why.  Winner: Stacy Keibler/Miss Jackie    John Cena v. Big Show for the US Title  Despite the fact that I may be Big Show's only fan, I see him dropping to title to the Dr. of Thuganomics.  This one may not be pretty, but it should be entertaining.  Word Life!  Winner: John Cena    Cruiserweight Open    (Chavo Guerrero v. 10 Cruiserweights)  Easily could steal the show.  With all of the company's Cruiserweights in the match, if given any time will be full of all kinds of cool spots and probably a neat finish.  I hope that Funaki wins (no one else is pulling for him) but I am going to pick a surprise winner for this match.  The M'Fer.  Winner: Shannon Moore    Mick Foley/The Rock v. Ric Flair/Batista/Randy Orton  Just to make it clear, I am fan of 3 of the 5 performers in this match.  Ideally I would have Ric Flair turn on Evolution and help the Rock n' Sock Connection win the match.  In reality that kind of event will NOT happen, but I still say look for Rock n' Sock to come out on top, all while elevating Randy Orton and Batista to legitimate star status.  Winner: Mick Foley/The Rock    Molly Holly v. Victoria   for the WWE Women's Championship  Quite possibly on paper my favorite match on the card.  I am a huge fan of both women and with Victoria regaining the title two weeks ago from Molly, they put significance back on the title.  The match stipulation calls for Molly to shave her head bald if she loses.  Unfortunately for me (I am a huge Victoria fan, C'mon she's crazy and hot) the title will go to my second favorite Diva.  Thus saving her hair and setting up a nice feud with Vicky in the future.  Winner: Molly Holly    Chris Jericho v. Christian  What this match means to me is the end of Monday Night Degrassi.  I have enjoyed the backstage story that has built up this match since November, and am really looking forward to seeing Jericho and Christian fight at Mania.  Hopefully the match will have some interference from Trish and maybe even a surprise (i.e. Edge and Christian reunion? That would reek of awesomeness) Somehow I doubt the E&C reunion part, but I do see the CLB defeating his former friend, and maybe even stealing his woman.  Winner: Christian    Fatal Four Way for the World Tag Team Championship  I don't really care, but can I see the Dudleys capturing their 900th title.  I would like to see someone new win, but I don't like the newer guys in the match.  Maybe if they had included Hurricane and Rosey or Val Venus and Lance Storm I would be more interested.  I am going to however pick the thrown together champions to retain.  Winner: RVD/Booker T    Fatal Four Way for the WWE Tag Team Titles  Again I don't really care.  I hate the APA, and I don't really like the Bashams.  Scotty and Rikishi have again gotten old and I guess I am sick of seeing a dancing fat man in a thong.  I like the Self Proclaimed Worlds Greatest Tag Team, but they have been more or less Velocity stars or jobbers as of late.  I still choose them.  Winner: TSPWGTT   There you have it, my Wrestlemania XX predictions.  Remember these picks are based on the currently announced card if any other matches are added to the show, I will post my predictions later on this week.

       IT'S ABOUT TIME    Sorry for the delay in updating, but I had class on Wednesday and Thursday, and I was working at the radio station of Friday.  Hopefully this week I can catch up.   This weekend marks the 20th Edition of the WWE event Wrestlemania.  As the week goes on I will go into some detail as to why the event is worth the 5 hours and $50.  I will also look ahead to Sunday's show and give some predictions for the matches on the card.  Today I want to talk about Pete Rose.  What does that have to do with Wrestlemania you ask?  Pete gets inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame this weekend, so I guess that makes him relevant.    I still have the Sports Illustrated from 1989 that announces that Pete Rose bet on baseball.  I remember thinking as a kid that I did not understand why he deserved to be banned from baseball for something as silly as gambling.  Now, 15 years later I have seen players with drug habits, criminal charges and various other problems continue to be banned and reinstated by the powers that be in baseball.  Still however, no Pete.  I suppose you could argue that he violated the number one taboo in baseball by betting on the game.  Did he hurt anyone?  No.  Did he present himself as a role model, only to find himself in a less than honorable position?  Maybe, but gambling addiction is something that is just as controlling as drugs and alcohol abuse.    So all Pete Rose is guilty of is betting on the game, and then lying about it.  Right?  Right.  For 15 years baseball has been saying that all he had to do was admit his indiscretions and they would forgive and forget.  Now he has, and people are judging him as  criminal who soiled the reputation of the game.  Who in their right mind believed that he didn't bet on the game?  No one.  Most people knew that he was full of crap, so why make the fuss now that he had been lying.  Sure he admitted it in a book.  Sure he made money off his confession, but wouldn't you if you could?  I know I would.    Anyway, the baseball Hall of Fame is where he deserves to be.  There are bigots, rapists, murderers, drug addicts and the like in there, so why keep a gambler out.  The experts say that character has as much to do with HOF eligibility as your on field performance.  Funny wasn't racist Ty Cobb the first inductee?  Kudos to the WWE for acknowledging the contribution Pete Rose has made to sports and entertainment.  Aside from the free publicity they are getting for Wrestlemania by doing it, they also sort of get to poke fun at Major League Baseball for keeping the all time hits leader out of the sport.  Plus after seeing Pete Rose feud with Kane in three Wrestlemanias and one No Mercy commercial, I will be kind of fun to see what the WWE has in store for "Charlie Hustle" following his induction, and his appearance Sunday night.

       Wrestlemania XX Review and Scorecard   For the most part Wrestlemania XX lived up to the hype. With the exception of maybe two matches, the show was quite entertaining.  The Goldberg/Lesnar match, despite being funny because of the crowd hating the match, was a train wreck.  Good riddance to both of those guys.  The Diva Evening Gown Match was equally as bad but, who didn't expect it to be.  The Trish heel turn was interesting, although I called it last Tuesday.  Good God was she HOT.  Anyway I am pleasantly surprised by the Title matches, Guerrero deserves to keep his belt, and no doubt Chris Benoit deserved to win that World Title match against HHH.  Great show, well worth the 50 bucks to watch it.  Definately a must buy when the DVD comes out.    Now, On to the Scorecard: Goldberg v. Brock Lesnar Winner: Goldberg  Jon wins this one.  Triple H v. Chris Benoit v. Shawn Michaels (HBK) for the World Title Winner: Chris Benoit Mike wins one.  Undertaker w/Paul Bearer v. Kane Winner: Undertaker Both Jon and Mike win.  (2-2)  Eddie Guerrero v. Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship Winner: Eddie Guerrero Mike wins (3-2)  Stacy Keibler/Miss Jackie v. Sable/Torrie Wilson Winner: Sable/Torrie Wilson Both lose (3-2)  John Cena v. Big Show for the US Title Winner: John Cena Both win (4-3)  Cruiserweight Open (Chavo Guerrero v. 10 Cruiserweights) Winner: Rey Mysterio Jr. Both lose (4-3)  Mick Foley/The Rock v. Ric Flair/Batista/Randy Orton Winner: Ric Flair/Batista/Randy Orton Mike wins (5-3)  Molly Holly v. Victoria for the WWE Women's Championship Winner: Victoria Mike wins (6-3)  Chris Jericho v. Christian Winner: Christian Both win (7-4)  Fatal Four Way for the World Tag Team Championship Winner: RVD/Booker T Jon Wins (7-5)  Fatal Four Way for the WWE Tag Team Titles Winner: Rikishi and Scotty  Both lose (7-5)  So the Final score for the Wrestlemania XX predictions were: Special Guest Superstar Michael J. Liedtke wins by picking seven of the twelve matches correctly.  The rematch will take place for Wrestlemania 21 in Los Angelos in 2005!

       NOTE FROM CARP    I just realized that the theme for the majority of the posts this week has been lists.  So as an addendum to this morning's post, here are the top 5 shows that I think should come back to television.    Dallas  -  Who doesn't miss J.R?    M.A.S.K.  -  In this age of terrorism and high oil prices, this force is needed to fight Venom once again.    Facts of Life  -  Teenage girls could have respectable role models with mulletts.  Not like anyone but Jo is up to anything.     Laugh-In  -   I realize Dan Rowan and others are dead, but it was a funny show.    "CHiPs"  -  Maybe they can make the CHP like The Sheild.  Renegade Ponch.    Honorable Mention :   " BJ and the Bear -  Now there is a concept I can't get enough of, a man and his monkey." (Mallrats reference)    Hey Dude -   It's a little wild and a little strange...

       TELEVISION   So I was listening to the radio on my way to work this morning and they were talking about old television shows that should be brought back on the air.  According to reports, Family Guy will be returning to TV in the fall do to the success of the DVD releases of the show and this sparked the discussion.  The funny thing is that the successful sales of classic TV on DVD show that there just isn't anything that good on television anymore.  Television today seems to focus on various versions of the same crime dramas, news magazine shows, unfunny comedies, and of course the cheapest television to produce...Reality TV.    The good news is, unlike even a couple of years ago, if you find yourself wanting to escape from the terrible programming on television today there is a pretty good chance you can see the shows you love on DVD.  Here are some Ideas for TV shows on DVD you can check out:   Cheers: Seasons 1&2 Green Acres: Season 1 All in the Family: Seasons 1&2 The Avengers Charlie's Angels: Seasons 1&2 The Flintstones: Season 1 Laugh-In GI Joe The Jeffersons: Season 1 The Jetsons: Season 1 The Simpsons: Multiple Seasons Kids in the Hall The Larry Sanders Show M*A*S*H   There are many more good shows yet to be released on DVD.  Some are coming later this year like Quantum Leap and Wonder Woman.  Others such as the Facts of Life and MacGyver are still in the works.  Some other good shows that are being worked on but are having music clearance issues are WKRP and Charmed.

       THE RISE AND FALL OF WVCW CHAPTER 2: MILTON AND THE POSSE   Following the infamous incident with our boy Matt, WVCW management decided that the best thing for them to do was ban all variety format talk shows.  Basically if you didn't focus on the music, then you didn't get a show.  In the Spring of 1998, the station's new Program Director, Derrick A! decided that a morning show would be allowed to have the variety format, so he approached two members of his staff about doing the show.  Those members formed the longest running gimmick on WVCW in years, Milton and the Posse.  So actually it was called  The Morning Show with Milton and his Posse  and every Monday and Wednesday morning at 7 o'clock Milton the Albino Love Machine and his sidekick Cool Dr. Money would provide news, comedy, music and more.  Early on in the show they decided that they should have theme days.  So due to the vast collection of 80s music and cover songs they had,  80's Mondays  and  Cover Wednesdays  were born.  Every Monday for the second half of the show, the duo would play 80's songs ranging from Wham! to Kajagoogoo.  It didn't matter.  The same went for the Wednesday time slot, where any cover of a song were open to be played.  The show also saw the birth of  The Piece of Astor .    Both of the personalities on the show needed to take a short break in the middle of the show to smoke or do something else, so they discovered this CD left over from the station's world music days.  It contained a 14 minute song by a man named  urlLink Astor Piazzolla  who was in fact an accordion play.  So, at the halfway point of each show, they would play the Piece of Astor sounder and be off.  Astor Piazzolla wasn't the only piece of the old world music the Morning Show would utilize.  One morning Milton stumbled across a disc by the band  urlLink Pizzicato Five .  He picked a song called "Happy end of the world" and played it for the people.  The song was so uptempo and fun, that the entire studio began to dance.  From that show on, every Wednesday Milton and the Posse would dance to the Pizzicato to close out the show.  They even grabbed people off the sidewalk out front to join in.    About halfway through the semester, Milton and the Posse had recruited several new members to the crew.  Sara Johnson was brought in as the News girl.  She brought an excellent ability to deliver the news and ability to play straight man to Milton.  She was the perfect foil for him, and the chemistry between the trio of Milton, Money, and Sara was never matched by any of her replacements in the coming years.  One morning as Sara was reading a story about the still recent death of Princess Diana, the mentioned that reports said people could hear Diana yelling out the name of her dead boyfriend before she died.  As the story was being read, quietly at first then much louder, Milton began yelling Dodi, Dodi, Doooodiiiiii.  Sara finished her news report, maintained her composure as much as she could and proved that she may very well have been the most professional one on that entire show.  No wonder she left after that semester.    The Morning Show was always trying to think of ways to self promote.  At the time, no one was really promoting their show, and those who were had cheesy fliers that looked like they were made by a ten year old kid with a dot matrix printer.  Since everyone else had cheap looking ads, the Morning Show decided that their advertisement would consist of two parts, fliers and remote broadcasts.  The fliers for the show set the standard for what WVCW fliers would become.  They consisted of an image of some kind (in this case Brak and Eric Cartman), and a funny tagline.  The remotes were also original.  Around March of 1998, the Posse decided to do a contest where you could Win Your Weight in Pennies, and the remote would focus on that contest.     Up next what happened with the Penny Promotion, as well as eviction, corruption, apathy, and resurrection.

       RADIO NEWS   **UPDATED**   In case you don't listen, Cox Radio Inc. blew up B103 after roughly 17 years to bring you the new Mix 103-7.  At about 11:58 pm on Sunday, B103 played "It's The End Of The World As We Know It" by R.E.M and at the start of Monday kicked off a new legal ID complete without the "B" monicker.  The idea behind the switch is very good.  Lite 98 has had the soft rock market cornered for years, and needs a little competition.  B103 however has been floundering as a Hot AC station for several years, and was desperately in need of a jump start.  I don't know however if the station as it had been know for years needed to be erased.  The B103 name was not the problem.  While the music sucked, the on air staff was not too bad, and people still listened to B.  It was on the same page as Q94 and the former XL102 in terms of name recognition.  So while the music needed to be switched up, why not utilize the B monicker that has for years been associated with that frequency.  As far as the airstaff goes, there has not been one since the weekend.  Does that mean that the likes of Sheri Blanks and Richmond landmark Jon Barry are out of work?  I guess we will find out, although the only airstaff that has been removed from their website are Eric and Tara: the B103 morning show.  Hopefully that means that the rest are safe.  Sheri, may not work on a soft rock format, but Jon Barry has the voice, the look, and the personality to be very successful again on that type station.    Anyway, just a note on what is happening in the world of Richmond radio.  Good luck to them.    Here is a list of some of the revolving airstaff at B103 since I began working for Cox:  Mo and Sally Bender and Jackie Lisa Greene Rebecca Wilde  Bishop Charlie Travis Griffin                         Dead Air Dave Enzo                                    Dave Reynolds Ozone                                  Kelly Boom Jeff Cochran Eric Summers* Tara Hart*                          Plus all the part timers who have come and gone over the years.  Maybe this change could bring some stability to the station.   urlLink Click Here  to check out the new Mix 103-7   UPDATE:   From what I understand Eric and Tara have both been let go from the station.  Both Sheri Blanks and Jon Barry are slated to return after a brief hiatus.

       BAD MUSIC   Have you noticed lately the abundance of bad music out there?  I hadn't really given it a lot of thought until this morning when I was trying to think of the five worst songs of all time.  Good grief it was hard thinking of just five.  Every time I thought that I had one of the worst songs ever, another one popped in my head that was 10 times as bad.  The funny thing is, people LIKE this crap.  The bad music that was running through my head were songs that are or were once hits.  My top 5 worst songs list:   1. Have you forgotten?- Darrel Woorly (he rhymes BinLaden and Forgotten. Very Sad.)   2. Freebird-Lynyrd Skynyrd (Sorry, but I just can't stand it.)   3. Poison - Bel Biv Devoe   4. Behind Blue Eyes - Limp Bizkit (How many times a day does it have to be played? Really.)   5. St. Anger - Metallica (It was long and crappy. End of story)    Those were just the songs that I hate more than any other.  Throw in the crap on the radio such as HIM and Trapt, and we can fill up the entire blog with crappy music lists.  Anyway, the reason this music is there and popular is because the marketplace, such as radio and television, doesn't allow for anything different.  Look at the American Idol.  In three years of that show, there have been maybe 3 people that have sounded different from everyone and everything else out there.  One of them won the competition last year, but do you ever really see anything about him?  No, but Clay Aiken is all over the place.  MTV will never play songs by bands like Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, the Get Up Kids, and Reggie and the Full Effect.  You rarely, if ever hear them on the radio.  However, the Limp Bizkit, the blink 182 (which I don't dislike completely, but wish they would return to the music they used to play), and the TrapStainCreeNicklebackstank are all over the place, yet some of the bands you can't really even tell the difference between.    My advice, go out to your local record store and pick up 5 albums that will cover your entire quota of good music.  What you choose is up to you, but here are some recommendations:   1. Alkaline Trio - Any Album 2. Barry White- Greatest Hits 3. Led Zepplin- Any Album 4. Beatles- Number 1's (or anything else) 5. ANYTHING BY the Ramones, NOFX, Black Flag, Lagwagon, or the Vandals

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY PO!    Sorry about the lack of posts last week.  My baby girl Katie was sick and I was busy taking care of her.  I am happy to say that she is getting better, and should be back to her old self soon.  Thank God.  I care about her as much as just about anything, and I am so glad she is okay.  Now onto today's post.   Today marks the first birthday of quite possibly the greatest little Pomeranian ever...Ociffer Po-Po.  Although she did not come into our lives until May, she was born to the breeder on March 21, 2003, and has been a handful ever since.  She is loud, annoying, she peed and pooed everywhere, but it has been a great year, and she is a really great puppy.    Po was a gift to my sister as an early birthday present.  When she first came home with us she was scared of everyone and everything.  She weighed about 2 pounds, had no defined face and pooped in the road, but she was adorable.  Even my fiance' and I's baby girl Katie fell in love with her. Over time her fear turned into fearless and she was into everything.  She would run up the stairs, down the stairs, out the door, on the couch...Everywhere.  Po later started to behave like a cat.  In July, she met Mac the cat.  Mac was a 9 week old kitten that my fiance' brought home.  She and Mac were attached at the hip until we moved into our current home.  Now Mac lives with my future mother in law, so Po only sees her sporadically.     Anyway, Po has grown a lot since the first day we met her.  She doesn't fear very much.  She has learned to go to the bathroom outside.  She shows us all a lot of love, and has made us all happy.  No one has been made as happy as my sister and Katie.  My sister has someone that give her unconditional love and affection, and Katie has someone to teach how to be a good dog.  Katie has become sort of a role model for Po over the past year, and if she learns anything, she may be the second best dog ever.  Only behind her cousin Katie.    So on your first birthday Po, I dedicate the blog to you.  Here's to a long and happy future for you, your mommy, your cousin Katie, your Aunt Em, and maybe even you "Uncle Daddy."   Call me crazy if you want, but Katie and Po are the closet thing I have or may ever have to kids, so I love them like the are.

       LIFE   Have you ever had to stop and think about where you life was going?  Did you realize that it wasn't going the way you planned it?  Well if you answered yes, you can rest assured that you are not alone.  It happens to everyone.  I think it is funny how people create this roadmap for their lives only to realize that they never will be able to follow it.  Life is not something you can plan ahead, all you can do is look back and evaluate the choices you made.  It is funny what you can learn from reflection.  Going into college, I had the great plan to go to law school, become a lawyer and get the hell out of Richmond.  I really didn't want to go to VCU but I went because I didn't know what I wanted.  I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I had made a different choice, and I realize despite the bad things in my life, I would have missed out on the things I love most.  I wouldn't have ever known how much I enjoy radio, wouldn't have known my closest friends, and probably would be alone and miserable somewhere.  In college, my plan was changed to become a radio personality and move the hell out of Richmond.  Again didn't happen, instead I still live in Richmond and couldn't be happier.  When I look back I realize if I had left, I wouldn't have gotten together with my fiance', I wouldn't have Katie, and I wouldn't be living with my fiance', my sister and the dogs in the apartment.  I would have missed sharing my life with the people who are now the most important to it.    It is funny how life works.  My fiance' had a chance to go to ODU on a full scholarship, if she had taken it we would not have ever got together.  My sister had this plan to be married, probably with kids, and to have a great job.  She ended up with a bastard husband who treated her bad.  Although she sometimes wonders why she married him in the first place, if she hadn't then the three of us would not be living together, she would have never bought her Beetle, and she would have never picked up Po-Po.  Therefore she too would be without the things she loves most.  Sometimes life seems like it has given you a raw deal but when you look at it you realize that things happen for a reason.  The choices that you make in your life may seem to be the wrong decision but you ultimately will walk away with what is right.  Life is kind of like a game of blackjack.  Some hands you win, some you lose but if you play long enough your gonna break even.    I again find myself in one of those spots where I face a major decision that will change my life.  I may be working in radio full time in the coming weeks or I may not be doing it at all.  The choice is really out of my hands.  The decision will be made by the powers that be at the radio station, but no matter what happens it will be what was meant to happen.  I hope that I look back on the outcome and say that it was ultimately a good thing.  Only time will tell.  If you take anything away from this post, which I note is kind of out of character, take the statement about life.  I will repeat it here again to show its importance.    Life is kind of like a game of blackjack.  Some hands you win, some you lose but if you play long enough your gonna break even.   I wonder how I would do as a psychologist?

       OPENING DAY   I was thinking about it today, and this year is the 10th anniversary of the last baseball strike.  Ten years ago, opening day was basically a holiday for me.  I would spend days leading up to it anticipating the upcoming baseball season.  I would come in from school and watch all of the televised games that I could, and even head outside for a game or two.  Then the strike happened.  Then I stopped caring.  What was there to care about really?  It showed me then, that the baseball was a "sport" full of money grubbing slimebags, who wanted to make another 20 million dollars or so to play a game.  When playing resumed early in 1995, I was no longer as excited about it.  Now don't get me wrong, I still loved the game, but I hated the sport.  I caught a couple of games live and on television.  Even when the team that I had cheered for when they couldn't win 10 games a year won the World Series that year, I really wasn't as excited as when they lost it two years earlier.    A lot has happened to the sport in 10 years.  As time progressed, I began to notice that I cared about baseball a little more.  I was caught up in the home run chase, the questions of who will be able to beat the Yankees, and moments like Anaheim winning the series with a rag tag team.  Last year, the baseball season was so exciting and featured an incredible story between both Boston and Chicago that it was hard not to care about the game.  Hell for the first time in years, I found myself talking about how good the games were, and guessing who would win the World Series.  (By the way, I didn't see Florida doing it that is for sure.)  With all that has happened, the exception being the steroid controversy, I find myself excited for the start of the baseball season today.  The first time in years I have felt this way.    The game itself is pure.  It is one of the most entertaining spectator sports to go see and play.  The game saved the sport.  No matter how much BS the players and the owners pile on top of the game of baseball, the game stays pure.  In 1994, when the strike happened, the Richmond Braves won the AAA championship.  I was there, and for those games, those moments, I didn't care that the Majors were on strike.  All I cared about was watching a game I loved.  So as this baseball season starts, I hope to be getting myself re-acclimated to a sport that used to be my favorite pastime.     Picks for the Season  AL-  East - Yankees:  I don't think they could lose the division  Central - Royals:  If they improve on last years surprise they could go far. West - Angels:  In the outfield . Wild Card- Red Sox:  Just so Sox fans can be excited again, and disappointed again .  NL- East - Marlins:  It won't be the Braves that's for sure (they are gonna suck)  Central - Cubbies:  Harry Carey would be proud . West - Padres:  I like their mascot . Wild Card- Phillies:  I stand by my no Braves in the playoffs   AL CHAMP: Angels NL CHAMP: Cubbies  World Series: Goes to the Angels.   Sorry Cub fans the goat strikes again.  Holy Cow .

       RICHMOND, ONE OF THE BEST CITIES IN AMERICA?   Well, according to the Partners for Livable Communities it is.  This national non-profit group has named Richmond one of the most livable cities in the United States according to an article on  urlLink Richmond.com .  Richmond is one of 30 cities being given the honor at a press conference next week.  Now before you get all crazy and say that Richmond is NOT one of the best cities in America, you need to understand that this group rates cities based on very specific criteria.  They are:   New economy : Which includes embracing technology, revaluating urban assets and staying abreast of change.   City center : The creation of a gathering place for the entire region.   Housing : Affordable housing options that encourage investment in certain areas of the city.   Regionalism : An area that is not divided into local jurisdictions and supports regional cooperation.   Tourism : Successful tourist destinations.   Leadership : Community leaders who dedicate themselves to improving the quality of life for all residents.   Neighborhoods : Strong residential, retail and cultural components that appeal to every person young and old.   Environment : The maintenance of high environmental quality through effective land-use and transportation strategies.   Human development : Developing and sustaining innovative assistance programs.   Finance : Partnerships between the government and the private sector  Nowhere in there do you see that they judged on the basis of safety.  Richmond may be one of the most livable cities in America, but it is also the sixteenth deadliest city based on 2003 statistics.  Last year, Richmond posted 94 murders which pales in comparison to cities like New York and LA, but we are a HELL of a lot smaller.  If you look at it per capita Richmond is really unsafe.  According to an article in the Virginia Pilot overall crime is down, in terms of homicide rates however, in 2002, the city of Richmond's 37.8 murders per 100,000 tops those of Atlanta (35), Cincinnati (19), Houston (13), Los Angeles (17) and New York City (7).  As far as that goes, Richmond has twice as many murders as the larger city of Norfolk, as well as Alexandria, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, and Hampton combined.    Again safety wasn't a factor in this decision and based on the felons on the city council, they ignored the leadership criteria also.  If you think about it Richmond really isn't a bad place to live.  Sure it is as conservative as it comes.  Sure it hates change with a passion.  Sure it gets boring.  But despite the murders, the conservatives, and the boredom, the people are very nice here.  There's a good, albeit not united, music scene.  There are lots of historical sites to see, and lots of cool places like Maymont and Belle Island to explore, great neighborhoods like the Fan, and a uniqueness of things like Carytown and Shockoe Slip and Bottom that make Richmond a nice place to live.  If I were forced to live in Richmond forever, I would be just fine.       UPDATE:   In case you were wondering, Richmond's murder toll is at 30 as of Monday April, 12.  Since Monday was day 102 of 2004, that means we are averaging a murder every 3.4 days.  At that rate we will end the year with 107 or so murders.  Watch out Chicago, we are after you.

       MOVIES   Today I have decided to talk about movies.  Alright, I have decided to talk about going to the movies, as well as to list some of the best movies of all time.  First off, going to the movies.  I have been to the movies quite a bit recently.  I have been privy to films such as "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton," "Ella Enchanted," "The Girl Next Door," and "Jersey Girl" in the past couple of weeks.  Now first off, I did not choose all of these films.  I think if I had a choice I would have skipped the "Ella Enchanted," but since I didn't really I went.  Now I don't like to go to the movies unless I think that I will really enjoy the film.  I don't like spending $15.50 on two tickets, plus the 8 bucks it costs for the popcorn and drink.  It really makes the movie going experience difficult because, if you don't like the film, your out a the cost it takes to fill up the car with gas.    Now with the movies I have seen the past couple of weeks, some have been really good while others were okay.  None of the films has really sucked or made me feel like I totally wasted my money.  "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton" which comes out on DVD today, was actually a decent little movie.  I suppose I enjoyed it because I look almost exactly like Topher Grace, and his character was a dead ringer for me.  All in all it was a typical romantic comedy, but it did have some actual funny parts.  "Jersey Girl" was an excellent film.  It may not be the feel good hit of the year, but Kevin Smith put together an great script and cast that made you feel for each of the characters in the story.  Hell, I hate Jennifer Lopez, but I even felt bad when her character died in the beginning.  "Ella Enchanted" was a cute little movie in the vein of the Princess Bride.  It even featured Cary Elwes as the villain.  I don't know if it was worth the $15.50, but my fiance' loved it, and the chick from "The Princess Diaries" was really quite hot.  As for "The Girl Next Door," it was probably the worst of the four films.  It had some funny parts, but it dragged on and was full of the dick and fart jokes that I am not huge on.  Plus, why does a movie about a porn star moving in next door have more male nudity than female?  My sister went with us to see that and she loved the film.  Not because of the male nudity ,not because of the story or jokes, but because of a blue Volkswagen convertible Beetle that was featured throughout the film.  Worth $15.50?  Not really.  Would I watch it again?  Maybe if it was on HBO and there was nothing else on.  Still, I don't regret seeing it.  I did laugh, even if it wasn't that hard.  It just kind of sucks that the theater companies, lead by Clear Channel's Regal Cinemas, try to rape you with the prices to see a movie.  It leads people including myself to for-go the movie theater experience and to take a chance on video or DVD.  If you can rent a movie for 4 bucks, why pay $15.50.  You just have to wait a little bit longer.  An example, last year I kind of wanted to see the film "The Rundown" with the Rock in it.  I wasn't sure about how I would like it, so I waited until it came out on DVD in March.  I picked it up at Target because it was fairly cheap and I am sure glad I did.  It was a great movie.  I just kind of wish I had seen it in the theater now.    Now for some of the  Best Movies (in my opinion) of All Time:   1.  Rear Window (Quite possibly Hitchcock's best and most underrated film) 2.  Citizen Kane (A little long, but damn is it good) 3.  Young Frankenstein (Gene Wilder's Hamlet.  Plus you get Frau Blueker, neeheeeh) 4.  Casablanca (Here's looking at you kid.) 5.  Dogma (A hilarious take on the whole religious scene by the master Kevin Smith) 6.  The Love Bug (Of course it is great.  If you don't agree, you have no taste) 7.  Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks best film) 8.  To Kill a Mockingbird (Gregory Peck was awesome in this) 9.  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Cover your heart! It is the best of the Three) 10.Jaws (Who knew sharks were so scary?)  Honorable Mention goes to: 12 Angry Men (Another Classic)   Worst Movies of All time (In My Opinion)   1.  Waterworld (I could take a dump on celluloid it would be a better film) 2.  Dirty Dancing (I hate Patrick Swayze) 3.  Gone With the Wind (Frankly, I don't give a Damn.) 4.  Scooby Doo (Good Grief that was awful) 5.  In the Bedroom (Trash.  Did it ever end?) 6.  Fight Club (First rule of Fight Club, it sucked.) 7.  You've Got Mail (I saw it before.  It was called Sleepless in Seattle, and it sucked then) 8.  Titanic (3 hours to see the boat sink.  Great.) 9.  Simply Irresistible(If you haven't heard of it...You're lucky) 10.The Matrix Series (Dude.  Whoa.  Keanu Reeves SUCKS) Honorable Mention: Point Break, (Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze.  Yuck)   Top 5 Guilty Pleasures:  Bad movies that I really liked   1. Six Pack (You toad sucker.) 2. The Happiest Millionaire (Fortuosity that is me by word) 3. Dude Where's My Car? (Honestly I don't know why I liked it) 4. The American President (I just like it okay) 5. Varsity Blues (I do not wont your life.) Honorable Mention: The Princess Diaries.

       WITHDRAWAL   Funny thing withdrawal. Under a doctor's order, I have been forced to cut my caffeine intake to once a day.  That shouldn't be a big deal but for someone who only really drank caffeinated drinks, it sucks.  I was okay on day one.  I really didn't notice that I had only had the one cup of Mountain Dew.  Day two on the other hand started what I can describe only as the worst feelings ever.  I developed a massive headache that will not go away.  I became really tired, and I also became really bitter.  Today is day three and things are still bad.  I decided to have my one can of soda this morning to help wake me up.  Unfortunately it didn't.  It also didn't make the headache go away.  All it has done is make me want some more.  That is all I have today.  Again my head really hurts.  I will post something more detailed and relevant on Monday.

       ENOUGH ALREADY   I wish people would learn that I do not want most of the junk e-mails that I get forwarded.  Now, I don't mind if it is something funny or creative, but I DO mind if it is preaching to me or telling me what to think.  There is a lady in my office who constantly sends out these damn e-mails that are either letters from God or Republicans.  I sometimes tend to believe that this woman is going to send out an e-mail saying that God is a Republican and everyone else can go to Hell.  I DON'T CARE!!!!   I can't stand for people to send me anything that tries to tell me how to think.  I know my views on God, and I am comfortable with him/her.  I've read the Bible.  I don't need anyone telling me their interpretation of it as fact.  I know what is happening in the world.  I follow the issues that we are facing as the upcoming election approaches.  I will vote for whomever I agree with more on the most issues.  Not because I get an e-mail trashing the other political party.  Here is the e-mail that prompted this rant:   "Even if you are a democrat, it is the truth!!!  I thought all my friends should see and know this!!!!!!!!!!!!!  -----SOCIAL SECURITY: When Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, introduced the Social Security (FICA)Program. He promised:  1.) That participation in the Program would be completely voluntary, 2.) That the participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program, 3.) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income tax each year, 4.) That the money the participants put into the independent "Trust Fund" rather than into the General operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program, and, 5.) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income. Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month -- and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the Federal government to "put away," may be interested in the following: Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the independent "Trust" fund and put it into the General fund so that Congress could spend it? A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the Democratically-controlled House and Senate. Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding? A: The Democratic Party. Q: Which Political Party started taxing Social Security annuities? A: The Democratic Party, with Al Gore casting the "tie-breaking" deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the U.S. Q: Which Political Party decided to start giving annuity payments to immigrants? A: That's right! Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party. Immigrants Moved into this country, and at age 65, began to receive SSI Social Security payments! The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it! Then, after doing all this lying and thieving and violation of the Original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away! And the worst part about it is, uninformed citizens believe it! Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions during this 2004 election year! If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe good changes will evolve. How many people can YOU send this to? Keep this going clear up through the 2004 election!! We need to be heard!"   Who gives a F@$#!  While I admit that some of these things sound bad, bitching about benefits being given to legal immigrants is just plain ignorant.  My fiance' is an immigrant.  She does not have citizenship in this country.  She pays into social security on every paycheck she gets.  Does that mean that the author of this e-mail doesn't think that she deserves social security in the future?  What a load of horse-pucky.   Now before I am accused of being a bleeding heart liberal...I VOTED FOR BUSH IN 2000!  The only time I have voted completely democrat was in 2001's Virginia Gubenatorial race.  I identify more with the democrats, but in 2000 and even 1997's Gov. Race, I hated their candidates.  I don't know yet who I will be voting for in November.  I don't like ol' GW, but I dislike John Kerry more.  I think it will depend on what happens between now and then in Iraq and whom Kerry picks as a VP.    My sister forwards me e-mail often as well, but I am not complaining about those.  The difference, those are usually some kind of survey (which as I mentioned before, I love) or something that has some legitimate humor.  I don't get the Politically Preachy e-mails from her.  She gets it, now I wish these other damn people would.

       GAS PRICES   Is $1.83 too much to pay for a gallon of gas?  It is about what you have to pay now for a gallon of milk.  It is less than you pay for a gallon of soda?  However, you don't by milk or soda in 15 gallon quantities.    First off, I don't think that you really can blame the BP, Chevron, Exxon, Shell stations for the higher gas prices.  Most wholesale prices for them are falling in the $1.75 range.  Think about it, they are only making about a dime on each gallon of gas you pump.  That is not that much of a profit until you factor in that they make about $2.00 on every car that fills up during a day.  But are gas prices really that high?  If you look at the current rate of increase, gas prices here in Richmond have risen 23 cents per gallon since January.  That is a trend that has swept the country as the war in the middle east rages on, and OPEC continues to cut supply.  If you look at past prices adjusted for inflation, gas prices are really not that different than they were in the 70's and 80's.  But this is 2004, and the prices continue to rise.  According to AAA there are several factors for the continued increase:  Increased consumption, both domestically and worldwide.   Complicated federal and state clean fuel regulations, which have created 17 different fuel blends across the county.   Chronically low US inventories.   That is the bad news, but there is worse news.  There is nothing we can do about it.  AAA predicts gas prices to continue to rise throughout the summer, and says that they could be well over $2.00 a gallon by the end of the year.  We have to drive, so we can't stop getting gas.  I am just wondering if all of those people who drive those monster SUVs are regretting that decision.  Look for a move toward smaller, less gas consuming vehicles over the next couple of years.  This is a cycle.  Remember the cars of the 50s and 60s that were massive who gave way to the age of the Volkswagen and the Honda.  Now watch as the SUV gives way to the age of the Volkswagen, Mini, and other small cars.  All of this is a cycle and until we get rid of OPEC and other gas controlling groups, it will continue forever.  By the way, since I am supposed to be including my opinion in these posts, I think this gas increase sucks.  I don't have the money to pay for really high gas prices.  I can't do anything about it, so I will take my Volkswagen to the gas station every week and I will dump 20 bucks or so down the drain to fill up my tank.  I just with they got the gas mileage the classic Beetles did.  FOR AN UPDATE on last night's 4 cent increase from Richmond.com  urlLink CLICK HERE !   GAS PRICES LIST  (From Richmond.com) Prices for a gallon of regular, unleaded self-serve gas are:   National $1.93   Virginia $1.77   Charlottesville $1.81   Richmond $1.80   Roanoke $1.77

       FRIENDS AND OTHER FINALES   I realize that I am a couple of days late talking about the series finale of "Friends," but you know, it is better late than never.  Now first of all for those of you that have been living under a rock for the past 10 years or so, the show that brought us "Ms. Chanandler Bong," "Smelly-Cat", and Marcell the monkey has come to an end.  "Friends" joins the other great television programs such as "Cheers" and M*A*S*H in the fabulous world of syndication only television.    Now the "Friends" finale had a lot to live up to.  I don't know if you caught the debacle that was the "Seinfeld" finale years ago, but if "Friends" delivered like that in its final show, then its legacy would have been destroyed.  Why?  Well, "Friends" was the kind of show that HAD to end with a happy ending for everyone.  I could not have the characters go to jail, Rachel leave for Paris or something like that.  All the loose ends needed to be tied up.   Could you imagine the outcry from the "Friends" fanatics if Ross and Rachel had not ended up together.  They would have been crying bloody murder, and written off their favorite show as BS that teased them for 10 years.    Fortunately, I think the show did deliver on its expectations.  There were some really funny moments in the finale, there were some sad, you got a little angry at times, but all in all they did the job.  They say that the show was ending because they were running out of stories to tell.  Well they told the most important story last Thursday and left a memorable finale that will stand the test of time. (At least until the reunion movie, in a few years).    So to all the "Friends" fans out there, I hope you enjoyed your last episode.  You can own it tomorrow on DVD if you did.  "Friends" will live on in DVD and syndication for many years to come.  Much like we did with Cosby and Cheers we have watched Classic TV being made first hand, and sadly there may never be another network comedy to fit that category for a long long time.  It will be interesting to see where this finale rates among the top finales of all time.

       EXCITING CHANGES AND A RETURN   I realize that it has been quite some time since I last ventured to the blog to post my random thoughts and opinions.  I have been so busy with everything that the blog has kind of taken a back seat to everything else.  Well that ends today.  First up I would like to let you know that some changes are coming to the basic look of the blog.  There will also be some updated links, and a special section for the posts on the Rise and Fall of WVCW, which also will continue.  Hopefully in the coming weeks I will be able to come up with things to talk about, but if I don't I assure you that there will be at least some kind of silly quiz or news tidbit waiting on the site.    Keep checking back for the changes and updates.  Thanks for stopping by, Jon

       PUDDING PIES/POPS   One of the great things about being born in the late 1970's is that I got to be a kid and grow up through the entire 1980's.  I know you might be thinking "big whoop," but if I hadn't I may have been like these kids today with their lack of respect for the really great things we had back then.  Today I have changed my original plan and decided to come up with a couple of 80s themed lists.  Most of which are stuff my fiance' has never heard of.  (Give her a break, she's younger and from another country.)     TOP 5 80s Cartoons  1. M.A.S.K (Again, in this age of terrorism and high gas prices, this show could still be popular. Plus you had T-bot) 2. Shirt Tales (Come on, who didn't love Rick and Digger.) 3. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (I'm talking about the original here.  With Cringer.) 4. Transformers (Generation One.  Megatron the most underrated cartoon villain.) 5. C.O.P.S (Fighting Crime in a future time.) HM: The Get Along Gang (Each one was special in its own way)   Top 5 80s Food Product  1. Pudding Pies (Hostess' crown jewel. Best dessert ever.) 2. Pudding Pops (They are back, but not as tasty.) 3. Mr. T Cereal (It was shaped like T's Fool!) 4. Cookie Crisp (Complete with the cookie cop and crook) 5. Pepsi Free (I realize it was caffeine free Pepsi, but it tasted better) HM: Micro Magic Fries (Crinkle fries in 2 minutes.  Hell Yeah.)   Top 5 Nickelodeon Shows  1. You Can't Do That on Television (Dora can kiss Moose's Ass) 2. Pinwheel (Sesame Street for poor kids.  Gotcha last) 3. Danger Mouse (The greatest secret agent in the world. Bonus points for the Bananaman shorts at the end) 4. Mr. Wizard's World (Science at 7 in the morning. Pass me a Bunsen burner.) 5. Today's Special (Come on, the mannequins come to life.) HM: Double Dare (Good but not great.)   Top TV Commercials)  1. Mc. Donalds (Who didn't love Mayor McCheese?) 2. Honey Comb (Andre the Giant singing the Honey Comb song. Priceless.) 3. Kmart (It's your brand name savings store) 4. American Express (Do you know us?) 5. Vanish (My baby wrote me a dear John letter...It's cleaner!) HM: Nine Lives (Morris was the most snooty cat ever)  I am interested in your lists.  Click on the comments link below and let me know your opinion on each of the categories.  More posts to come after lunch.

       RATS  So I had a good bitter post to put up this morning, but I went downstairs to the snackbar and got some Mountain Dew and some Hostess Donettes.  Now I don't feel as bitter.  Come on, who can be bitter while eating Donettes?    Look for me to post the bitter post during my lunch break.

       YO IT BE HOT...   Man, could it BE any hotter.  I am not normally one to complain about warm weather, but man it is hot.  Last year, we didn't have days as hot as recently in July; Now we have them in May.  How hot has it been?  For the last 2 weeks it has been in the upper 80s and lower 90s, with humitures of around 100 degrees.  By living in Richmond, we have to deal with the outrageous humidity, but that usually isn't until late in the summer.  I don't know what is causing it, but man I could use a couple of good solid 85 no humidity days.  It has been so hot that even in the middle of the night it is still warm.  So warm that I haven't slept for a damn in the past two weeks.  I am working tonight until midnight, hopefully that will exhaust me enough that the heat won't matter.  If it doesn't, then I am filing a complaint with that no good mother f'n nature.

       WVCW   Have you worked so hard to make something a success, then because of formalities you can't do anything to stop others from destroying it?  Welcome to today's post about WVCW.   Now I know you may say, "Just get over it", but that is easier said than done.  WVCW was my Mecca so to speak.  I was kind of shiftless and lost until the day I stepped foot in that door.  When I became General Manager in 1999, I was dedicated to make that place a success.  I kissed so much VCU ass that my teeth should have been brown, I spent upwards of 80 hours a week in that station working.  I went out and bought them a website (with my own money) so that they could begin webcasting.  I automated the station to modernize it, and for what?  So others who followed me could destroy it.  All the public relations I did with VCU has been lost.  The students who had learned of the station's existence, lost.  Then in March, WVCW lost its website.  The webcasting the station had been doing was lost.    I went down there a couple of weeks ago, and discovered the renewal slip for the website.  We took it down to the "Student Media Director" so he could do it, and guess what?  When I looked at the domain this morning, I saw that it had been released due to lack of payment.  Now the website is completely lost.  Or is it?    I purchased the domain this morning.  I called Peter Feddo the webmaster and told him to put the page back up.  Only now since I own the site, WVCW.cc will be under my control.  The site will undergo a redesign, and look for a link to this here blog, so the kids know who their editor is.  I don't want to see something I worked so hard for killed.  I guess the only way to see that happen is to take care of it myself.

       RICHMOND REDUX   Mark your calendars.  Next Saturday, June 12 will mark the end of the old Thalhimers building downtown.  The once vibrate city landmark, and beacon of shopping, is now an old decaying shell that is home to rats and debris.  Come Saturday, it will be no more.  The call for a new Performing Arts Center meant to breathe new life into the Broad St. district calls for the building to be torn down, and a lavish multi-million dollar facility to be built in its place, opening in time for the Jamestown 400th Anniversary in 2007.   I guess in a way it is a good thing.  People all over the world will ascend on the Commonwealth in 2007, to help celebrate the first permanent English colony in the New World.  City and state leaders plan to invite dignitaries such as the President and the Queen of England to the city to celebrate.  I for one would be really embarrassed for the Queen or even ol' GW to be shown what that area has become.  Then again, if they are here and watch the news, they will see all the murders that this city is known for.   Hopefully the attempts to revitalize the city will not fail.  There is work going on to transform Browns Island, renovate the Capital complex, City Hall, and many others.  Maybe this can help clean up this historic city and give it a brighter future.

       COLORADO, ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH   So this morning I came into work to the discovery that I would have to take the state car out to get it gassed up and washed.  On my way back, I was told to stop and get my boss a sausage mcmuffin, and myself something.  My boss then gave me some money.  I had the hotcakes.  I just think that it is very nice.  This eliminated any bitterness that I could post today.  Coming up later, a Beetle post.

       THE PLAN FOR JUNE   June is going to be a screwy month around here.  I have a lot on my plate for the month, so the blog may be neglected.  There are several remotes coming up in June that I will have to leave work for, plus from 6/15 - 6/20 I am on vacation.  There will be no posts during that week at all.  As for the rest of the month, I will try to post something, but you never know.

       Memorial Day   So how exciting is my life?  I hadn't had a day off since the 15th of May, so yesterday was a welcome change.  Unfortunately my exciting life called for me to spend the day sitting around and going to bed at 9:30.  Boy do I know how to have a good time or what?

       RONALD REAGAN  Today we mourn the loss of the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.  I know I tend to rant about the Republican Party, but Reagan was different.  He was a man for whom I have nothing but praise.  As the nation celebrates the memory of Reagan, I too join in the sadness felt by a grateful nation. I was born in the late 1970s.  I was 2 when Ronald Reagan took office in January 1981.  Reagan was the president who shaped the world I grew up in.  I can recall as a child the talk of the Cold War was just as big as the talk of terrorism today.  Reagan took a stance against the Soviets and eventually saw the Evil Empire crumble at his feet.  I can remember when the Challenger exploded, Reagan helped comfort even a kid like me.   I don't know where Ronald Reagan will fall in the list of great Presidents.  I do know however, he was the best President in my lifetime.  He shaped the world in which I grew up, and still influences the world we live in today.  Take a moment on this national day of mourning and give thanks to a really great American.  Thank you Ronnie-baby.   Thanks for everything.

       THE BEST OF THE FIRST HALF    Considering it is June, and the only other thing I have to talk about is the death of Ronald Reagan and is impact on this country, I decided it is time to put the first six months of 2004 in a top 5 list form.  Enjoy.     TOP 5 Movies:  Up until Friday night, I would have had a hard time with picking five movies I've seen in 2004, let alone the best movie, but now it is not that hard to do.   1. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (I can't believe that.) 2. Jersey Girl (Not the feel good hit of the year, but it was good.) 3. Win a Date with Tad Hamilton (I was pretty good in it.) 4. The Girl Next Door (I haven't seen that many movies this year) 5. Ella Enchanted (It was bad, but I have only seen 5 movies from 2004)  Top 5 Radio Played Songs: 1. Vindicated-Dashboard Confessional 2. The Reason-Hoobastank 3. Walkie-Talkie Man-Steriogram 4. Cold Hard Bitch-Jet 5. I Miss You-Blink 182  Top 5 Televison Programs: 1.

       IT SURE HAS BEEN AWHILE   So June was a slow month.  I had nothing interesting to talk about.  July is slowly shaping up that way too.  I don't know why, but there just isn't anything that I really feel passionate enough to write about.  I suppose that I could write about the election, or the beheadings in Iraq, but that is already being beaten to death (pardon the pun) by every other blogger in America.  I suppose I will just continue the sabbatical until something interesting comes in my head.  Until then, keep checking back...You never know when I will post something.

       GOOD LORD IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME.    I realize that it has been over a month since my last post, but man did the really have to go and change the blogger.&nbsp; I do like that I can now upload pictures to the blog, and expect a bunch to come in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp; I will say that things have been pretty interesting over the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; I am waiting to hear about a full time Promotions Director job at the radio station.&nbsp; I am moving to a new casa on August 4, and we lost Digit, the dwarf chameleon we adopted in March.&nbsp; Keep checking back as a new look and newly updated blog will return in August.&nbsp; Until then, take care.&nbsp;   PS: Look for a complete wrap up of the 2004 Democratic National Convention early next week with my thoughts on the winners and losers as we count down to election day 2004!
