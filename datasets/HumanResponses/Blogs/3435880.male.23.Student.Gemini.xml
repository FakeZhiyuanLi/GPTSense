      So if you've noticed to the right, we (being I) have a new book of the moment for ya. I'm not too far into this one yet as the demands of my academic life have swelled beyond the banks of normality and are currently washing away the homes of the people of "Fun-ville" i.e. the majority of my brain. Usually I'm content to sit back, do the minimum and come out on top at the last second... most of the time that is. But now I have been forced to take a pro-active role in my schooling as the level of work has been bumped up not one, but 3 billion notches. I know that you're probably thinking "That's a lot of fucking notches" but I assure you that in the world of Rhino, the notch that measures productivity are as milliseconds are to a day. That's still 34.72 days folks. So it's not as much as my standard work unit might make it seem, but it's still a lot.   I know I've been bitter about school and the work involved, but I'm still psyched. I'm so fucking close right now, I can feel the cramp of my future cubicle and the pressure that will eventually cause me to boil over and k... um... maybe we should leave it at that.. This is your frienly neighborhood Rhino signing off... R

      but really..it isn't his fault. It's my own for not doing that assignment soon enough. I don't know if anyone reading this can empathize, but Segmentation faults with C-strings and sockets are enough to drive a man to murder. Now... if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go beat some puppies.

      Some people seem to be a bit, how should we say, "put off" by the fact that these days I am often declining invitations to partake in the consumption of alcoholic beverages or simply group loitering. I am quick to assure them that I'd like to spend more time doing such things but alas I cannot due to my hectic school schedule.   I offer as proof some of the things I've been up to over the last few weeks. Exhibit A (labeled "CPSC 310 Assignments") appears to the left of the screen and consists of a list of links that will increase as time goes on. So I offer the opportunity to those who would question my loyalty and character to look upon those documents and take a second to imagine the ammount of work that goes into producing such a document. Not to mention the fact that it was done during the summer session and as such the time provided to doing so was much shorter than normal. So to those that this applies... read them, and then give a call so we can arrange a time when you can lick my scrotum.  R

      I just finished reading "Black Hawk Down" which, in my opinion, is a great telling of a truly amazing story. When I first saw the movie, I was amazed at the ferocity of the whole thing but the actual reality of the story didn't hit home. I knew it had really happened, but I didn't realize the depth of the stories of those involved and the impact on the world this event had. In that way, the movie is really just a small fraction of what actually happend.  I got the special edition DVD as a birthday present last year and watched the movie again. Afterwards, I popped in the second disc and watched the special features which includes a history chanel presentation as well as a PBS presentation where the actual soldiers present on the mission were interviewed. Suddenly, in my mind, the story had just been taken to a new level. I needed to know more.  So I recently picked up a copy of the book. It progresses at a very quick pace providing second by second detail of the entire mission. I just powered though it. Not only does it give an account of what happened, it also gives an insight to what individuals were thinking and feeling throughout the duration. Not only that, it provides an angle that the movie did not. The angle of the Somalis. The account of people that were in the fire-fight but on the other side. More importantly though, it provides an incite into why the somalis fought back so furiously.  The result of this battle not only changed the lives of those directly involved on either side, but the world. The outcome of this fight changed American foreign policy because the U.S. was fearful of more American loss of life if it was to intervene in a foreign conflit again. This led to the US ignoring the Rawandan genocide in and around 1994. The butterfly beating it's wings in Somalia caused a hurricane in Rawanda. Makes you think...

      or is it? I just tried to log in at ubc student service center to check out my schedule for my class tonight. Lo and behold, i wasn't allowed to look at my timetable. "Hmmmm...." i thought. "that's odd" Apparently they can charge you for a course... and if you don't pay for it... they won't tell you where it is. Isn't that funny? Damn straight. I thought so too. I did manage to find a way around it.. they haven't blocked off all access yet.. I could still check my calendar and that has all the pertinent info in it.   And in light of my financial situation... (ie: I owe, but have nothing to give) I figured it was time to finally turn in my tax forms and get my refund.   WAIT! I know what you're thinking.. "Tax refund? But it's July... Tax season isn't till next spring...unless...." you pause, "...no... couldn't be... has this fool just be so surpassingly lazy as to have delayed simply asking for his money?" And I say...Yes... and no. I filled out the forms in March... and then I just kinda forgot. And then I didn't feel like bothering to do it. But regardless, it shall be done.. and I, Rhino the nearly graduated, shall pay my tuition no matter how it hurts... and I can tell ya... it hurts.  FnR

       Apparently if I died tomorrow, I would go to  the Sixth Level of Hell   The City of Dis!   Here is how I matched up against all the levels:     Level    Score       urlLink Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very Low       urlLink Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   High       urlLink Level 2   (Lustful)   Very High       urlLink Level 3   (Gluttonous)   Low       urlLink Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very Low       urlLink Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Low       urlLink Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very High       urlLink Level 7   (Violent)   Moderate       urlLink Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   High       urlLink Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Low      Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Hell Test    Hmmm... i suppose that this is bad. I guess this kinda shows a breakdown of my underlying psyche. Only moderately violent... hmm.. ok. Take it.. it's fun. If you're religious I don't think it's possible to get below level 5. Give it a shot.  Oh who the hell am I kidding.. Go for it adil.

      Oh yes... its time again. Time for what you ask? Time for Rhino to get down is what time it is! Coming up on June 28th at the plaza of nations.. we have Clutch comin... I didn't manage to see them last time they were here so I'll be sure to make it this time. Don't know who's opening... but who cares? It's Clutch.. for those of you that don't know... check out "The Mob Goes Wild", "The Soapmakers", and "A Shogun Named Markus". They're all really different songs, but I figure that Clutch's sound is pretty well covered.   Ahem... we go now from hard rock to extreme death metal. July 19th at the Commodore, we have CANNIBAL CORPSE with The Black Dahlia Murder and some other band.. don't remember the name. For the uninitiated.. if you've seen Ace Ventura : Pet Detective... you've seen Cannibal Corpse. They were the band playing in that club that Ace Ventura had to go through to see his fish buddy. Are you as excited as I am? LOL.. of course not you dorks... you can go on with your "Postal Service" and "Taking Back Sunday" hippie nonsense. What kinda person listens to that stuff anyways? LOL..   Oh and you haven't noticed, there's a huge thing on the right called Warhead. It's an Otep music video.. not a documentary as some may have thought. Worth a listen though anyways.   Well, this week is study week. So most of my posts for the week are gonna be rants full of explitives, anger, and frustration. But at this time next week, I will be 3 credits shy of being a University Graduate. Wow.. and it only cost me into the 5 digits.  later, FnR

UBC, kits, Boundary Superstore, 33rd and Knight, Oak and Broadway, Vancouver Intl Airport...SW Marine Superstore(trying to get a deal on something... spent more on gas than i would have saved had I actually found what I was looking for).   Other than that it was okay... I've always loved blasting my music for others to hear... i don't know why... I think I must like the "What the hell?" looks... tracks of the day:  ====================================== Dimmu Borgir - Absolute Sole Right Lux Occulta - Library On Fire Iced Earth - Jekyl and Hyde Pantera - War Nerve Pantera - Suicide Note Pt.II (this one's the fuckin shit) Shadows Fall - Flesbold At the Gates - Blinded by Fear ====================================== FnR

      So I've been sitting around reading that  urlLink Kim Jong  page. Pretty funny.. good for a laugh... but other than that... I've been listening to Kyuss... yeah.. i know you people probably don't know it... but here's a name I'm sure you know..... Queens of the Stone Age. You know them don't you. Yeah. Some of the guys from QOTSA were members of Kyuss. It's basicly stoner/groove metal. Really mellow stuff that has a good drive to it. Really good listen. I would recomend "Size Queen", "One Inch Man", "Gardenia" and "Space Cadet" for starters. It's some really good sheeit.  Some other bands that I've re-aquainted with is Crowbar. They're slow metal too, but no too melow. It's got a really dark feel to it despite some of the catchier riffs they have. One thing I love it the breakdowns they do. I mean you have a song doing like 60 beats per minute (that's 1 per second for those that have trouble with math) and then the breakdown comes and it drops to half-time. And during these breakdowns, they have some of the most amazing and crushing riffs. Really gets into ya...you can really feel it. Hard to explain. Anyhow. Have a good one. It's bed time for me now...  FnR

      .....but for how long? Despite having one of the worst birthday mornings ever... i have gotten back into my regular routine of sleeping in and then going to class late and then spending the next several hours in the computer science lab.   Oh... and a bid "Suck my Nuts" to the 417 TAs... what the fuck was assignment 3? Were you on crack when you wrote that? I have never seen an assignment where the provided information was more vague and erroneous... so much wasted time one that bullshit.  Jeebaz...

      i'm now 23... so tomorrow, as on all festive occasions such as birthdays i'm going to school at 9am, then i'm going to get my government sanctioned "Happy B-Day" kick in the fucking balls. (Driver's Licence renewall) mother fuckers... hmm.. what else.. oh yeah.. my group project is due tomorrow at 6 so i have to go in and hand in a paper with all of our signatures on it... even though we hand it in electronicly.. for what reason... i do not know. Afterwards.. i guess i'm gonna do some birthday stuff.. I don't even feel like it. So fuckin drained.   So right now (12:50 am June 3rd) i am spending my time working with my group to finish this bullshit off. At least one of them knows what's going on. Ugh... this ... sucks.  But fuck it. Shit happens right? Happy B-day to me.  FnR  PS: The odds of me getting any B-day action is about 30,000,000:1.

      they never fail to come up with stranger music... get this. Heavy Polka music.. that's right. It's pretty hard to describe.  urlLink Here's a video for ya.  It's not streaming, (it's 23 megs) but well it's fun. The music has this kinda folk music feel to it but then there's these crushing guitars accompanied by some really throaty vocals. Good fun though. FnR
