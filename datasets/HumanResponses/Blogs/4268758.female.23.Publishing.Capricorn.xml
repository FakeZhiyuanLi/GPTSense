      Spent the weekend with the folks and my sister and her family. Will is so the cutest baby right now. At the party for him, he was passed around so much and so easily that at one point Mari turned to me and asked, “Have you seen my baby lately?”   The highlight of the party, however, was Spiderman. We were supposed to have a moon bounce for the kids, but we were in the middle of a monsoon, so instead the entertainment company sent over Spiderman to make balloon animals. But they sent him an hour early, before basically all the guests had arrived. So there we were, 11 adults, Spiderman and three children, two of whom were terrified.   First Spiderman and his assistant (a scruffy guy with a big grin, undoubtedly due to the fact that he wasn’t the one in tights) pulled out a jump rope for limbo. Thomas was the only one who wanted to play, so he just walked around them in circles while the rest of us cheered with undue levels of enthusiasm. Finally Mari took pity on them and she handed the mini-DV to Mom and brought Will over. Now, even though the camera was already running, and could have been left on a table and done just as good a job, this was asking a lot of Mom. She didn’t know how she was supposed to hold it, what buttons to push or how close to stand, so she kept yelling frantically at Mari that she didn’t know if she was getting it. Then she decided to push all the buttons, one of which put it on pause, making her even more frantic and loud. Mari, squatting underneath Spiderman and his jump rope with Will held out in front of her, stopped and said “Oh Jesus Christ, Mom,” before rolling her eyes and getting up to fix it. It’s nice to see motherhood hasn’t softened her.   Musings on the Olympics:  The men’s basketball team lost, for the first time in the history of the Games. It was a fairly pitiful thing to watch, and it even made me a little mad. There was no sense whatsoever that they were a team: Larry Brown couldn’t get them to come to practices, so they didn’t have any plays, the guards couldn’t shoot from outside and the forwards couldn’t play the post. It’s upsetting because basketball is such an American sport – it’s big, fast and aggressive, and it’s at its best when you have amazing individual talents that understand how to complement each other to be even greater. But this team - a group of guys who didn’t care about their performance because there was no paycheck involved - represented the side of America that I can’t stand, the one that the rest of the world faults us for.  Then I watched the women’s team. It’s a lot of veterans, like Swoopes and Leslie and Staley, mixed in with the bright young things like Taurasi and Catchings. If you ask me, (and probably anyone else who’s seen her in action) Taurasi will end up the best woman ever to play the game, and I’m sure she knows it. But she hasn’t been the standout this Olympics. She only takes a shot if she’s wide open, and even then she usually passes. Why? Taurasi says this isn’t her olympics, that she’ll have plenty more chances to wear the American jersey. But for Swoopes and Staley, it’s the last shot at something great, and so they’re the ones who should be the stars. Tear.

      I finished White Oleander last night. I’m surprised at how much I liked it, because it’s fairly flowery, and usually I have no use for that kind of writing. But I loved that no sentence was wasted, like Jeanne’s hidden squirrel tomatoes. One thing though – I wanted more of Ingrid, the mother.  At the heart it was Astrid’s story, and it would probably be hard to stay with a character so toxic, but still I was intrigued by her.   Other events of last evening: fondue birthday party for Miller. It was great girly fun; appletini’s and cosmo’s followed by cheese and chocolate, with last year’s bump and grind rap hits pushing us from one course to the next. The event was highly pi-phi’d, plus me, Conway and Whitney. I honestly tried to see what Flinny does, but I’m not sure her theory is totally solid. We talked about Conway’s date, and I was surprised by how anti-metrosexual she and Maggie are. It’s not like they hate the whole phenomenon; I just pegged them as ardent supporters. What do I know? Big plus of the night was that Whit lives uptown, so I had someone to ride home with.  So this whole party for Will thing Saturday. Mom’s a little crazy about it, but in all fairness a million times better than normal. I’m curious about who’s coming, but that could be a serious red-button question, so I’ll leave it be. Really I just want to know why we’re having a moon bounce.

      I’ve realized how solidly I’m in limbo now. I’m actually okay with it, basking in my own futility and all. It seems so normal for folks my age, to have no idea what you’re doing or why you’re doing it, and that helps. It also makes me a bit unoriginal, but I’ll take unoriginal and validated over what-the-fuck any day.  So here I am, writing for the sake of writing, because I don’t know what else to do, and that seems like the best reason possible. A probably lame thing has occurred to me because of this: my favorite books to read are memoirs. Which means the best shot of me actually writing a book would most likely be one. But then I find that so self-indulgent, such a cop out. Remember a few years ago, around the whole Dave Eggers craze, how there was all this talk about young writers who took the easy road by writing about themselves, not even bothering to fictionalize, and what that was doing to literature, and on and on? There’s a good point in all that. Although it would be kind of funny to go around telling people “I’m writing my memoirs,”  in breathy, French-tinted whispers.  Just spent some time google-ing about writing memoirs, and it’s horrid – talk of “honoring your journey” and “writing abundance into your life”  and gag me. I hate when everything becomes New Agey and therapeutic, a nice bit of irony considering my main motivation right now is therapy. Sigh.
