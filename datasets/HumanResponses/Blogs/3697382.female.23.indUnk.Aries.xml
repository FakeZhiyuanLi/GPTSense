						   Slowly, a siphoning emptiness expanded within him. A whirlpool of doubt and disconnected anger. "I want to break something: a glass, a tree branch, a bone, the sound barrier, just break something. 'Fuck' to the institutions, the academy, corporations. Fuck the signs I see. Make me part of the conspiracy to turn everything on its fucking self-diluted head." There's darkness and filth and fury and he wanted it just for the sensation. Bending the will of something. Soiling the pure. Art for art's sake. Hate for hate's sake. Anger for the altar of pure, severed rage. Put 'The World' against a tree and flail the whip, beat the controlling impulse out of it, make it bleed with the mind-numbing, spirit-destroying, oppressive blood that flows in its rivers – make it lose its control to desperation, fury, emptiness. "Make it stop following me, invisibly behind, wanting me to conform to man-made bullshit." Taking the small bit of his life-experience that he actually learned for himself, he fled. On purpose, he left the lights on inside. "Fuck the electricity bill," he told the others, who raised fists in agreement and shattered the glass ceiling of limitations. Fury met with intensity. Genius accepted and respected by genius, automatically. Fury only acknowledged by more powerful fury. His emptiness accepted.

						   Grant Morrison - Scottish comic book writer supreme - has overloaded my mind, over-mind, dirty-mind, and philosophical-mind with his latest mini-series, The Filth.   One of the best things I've ever read was written by Grant Morrison, The Invisibles. Non-linear exposition of conspiracy, binary, life behind life, and post-structuralist birthing of a new consciousness/existence. He works in self-referential thought aggregates, word-bubbles combine with insanely imaginative images, overloading your eyes and brain.   Why are we so uncomfortable with the filth of our lives? The glory and freedom and cleanliness is easily accompanied to complex degrees by pornography, sewage, and trash - who's wiping the arse of the world?   It disgusts me. It's dirty and foul, and it disgusts me even more that I don't get it, that I see the filth and close my mind and turn off everything that makes me a thinking, intelligent soul. I buy into the person/anti-person binary – but "this shit is more complex that that."   It's not Us vs. Them. I want to be Us, but who the hell is on the inside with me? We're going to sit and blame Them, and not take responsibility for our own lives and our own actions. Our minds and freedoms have been put in jail.    "Our sentence is up."

						   "You have to do what you love doing, otherwise you will get ill. I've been teaching for thirty-four years. I love it. It's a way of life. It takes patience, knowledge of your craft, and a sincere desire to help others in their own growth and development."   In the woven, smart, dove-tailed eyes of Gene Arant, there's a sliver of sparkle. He knows you, small thin hairlines, eyebrows blending away into a wrinkled skin dusted with a white beard - shrewd thin eyes. Gene has a heavy-set neck. His words remind me of something my mother always said, ingrained in me now, and originally from my Pitaji, literally "Father," my mother's father. Here's a meme, a saying, a coloquial idea-virus: "Health before wealth." The idea in principle, black as the basepaint coating of a car. The clear, easily-understood white of snow. But in practice, grey like a cloud-ridden day.   Just having learnt first aid, there are so many ways to be injured and die, and taking the prize in many cases is stress. High blood pressure, aneurisms, stoke, heart attacks, hyperventilating - all caused by some degree of stress. Why take the high-stress job? Live your life to make it last - but if we've learnt to love the stress, where do we move? Can a cosmopolitan downgrade into rural, quaint, simplistic life? My hairdresser's brother has moved to Malta to find his simplicity, and I to Australia, but complication follows.   Looking back on your career and saying you love it. Saying you helped. Saying you practiced patience and aided in people's development. Saying you brightened children and were brightened by them, that is a wish of mine. For now - I help kids through St. Vinnie's. For now, I am learning the "knowledge of my craft." Even now, it takes patience to wait for that learning, moving at a snail's pace. It takes so little time to learn to hammer a nail, but the art of making nails, so timeconsuming, now mechanized, is lost to all but a few.   "But for the want of a nail, the horse was lost. For the want of a horse, the knight was lost. For the want of a knight, the battle was lost. And so it was, the kingdom was lost, all for the want of a nail."   And in this conspiracy of Aquarius: the show Big Brother is just softening us up. Soon we'll take less and less notice of Big Brother, until he finally descends upon us - and we embrace surveillance. He's making us used to it. He's spreading himself like a meme, an idea virus. Saying "Big Brother" is passé now. Soon it will be ubiquitous.   But will surveillance add more stress? Will our health go or be saved? Will we find what we love doing and open "sincere desire" or be lost, becoming Invisibles, symbolized by the blank badge?   I was smarter when I graduated high school than I was when I graduated from a University. The world was more real. Few instances of living are "life experience." Few instances of travelling are equal to "life experience." Touching lives, Gene Arant and the hundreds or thousands of children he has taught in 34 years, that is real. That is life gloriously and fully lived.  Some day, soon or later or concurrently or permanently, I will be a teacher. They can affect change.

						   I've just bought a coffee-table book called "Amazing Men." Courage - Insight - Endurance. It's complied with photographs and quotes - edited by Joyce Tenneson, and filled with the wisdom and insight of men, all over 60. I've decided to use their quotes to see life from a different end of time and add a new mix in my kaliedescope.

						   Tuesday, May 25, 2004   Should I use this time to work on all the essays I have to do?   Elementary, my dear Dr. Watson!  Poscolonial representations of Bhangra music and South Asian identity plague my virtual paper, courtesy of Microsoft Word. I never write more than a few lines on real paper anymore. Why aren't my metaphors good enough for academia?   Why can't I just apply quantum mechanics and superpositioned particles (here and there at the same time) to South Asian identity as constructed by bhangra music? Maybe because quantum mechanics is Einstein-level brainwork - and bloody confusing. I feel a lack of excellence approaching, and have for some time now.   I'm fucking lazy, I sit and browse the Internet - for jokes, porn, Friendsters. What the hell? I read IM profiles instead of chatting; I chat instead of writing emails; I write emails instead of letters; I send letters instead of presents; I use presents as phone calls - which I never make anymore. Is this my migration - Australia, post-college, grad-school, jobless? I sense the end of my structured path approaching, or maybe I'm already repelling down to the black-and-white tiled floor of the Mad Hater's Tea Party. What am I supposed to do next? Motivation has forsaken me.   Just read The Alchemist on my 22-hour Quantas-assisted odyssey from New York to Melbourne - and realized that I used to have a Personal Legend - I even spoke at my high school graduation about legends. "Lancer Legends" it was titled. I have great ideas mixed with aspirations of great and final conformity. Blending anonymity. "You are either an Invisible or a number." Has being a number ever seemed seductive? Do you know what I'm taking about? Money and wealth and a nuclear family - a purpose unto themselves, right? All the rest, all who fight the power grow tired. Set free the chains that bind and find more tidy phrases to sum up an existence we have no clue how to organize.   Shave, shower, eat something, and go back to writing this essay. They say there's no excuse for falling short of excellence - but I'm finding a heap of 'em. Maybe I should join Laura and try to win the lottery. Then I'd be full of ennui (boredom) - but rich. And I'd be one step closer to selfish madness.   A toast - to the fervor of Zealots (not murderers). Perhaps colonialism and the will to dominate arose from this very same boredom - untempered by humility or empathy. Shouldn't I know - a good postcolonialist asks and simultaneously laughs at the irony.  Signing off outside Zion -

						   From the journals of Sandeep Varma: April 29th, 2004.   Identity isn't a static concept, one should expect changes in life. There are a few exceptions: sports and traveling. Your sports team, the Home Team, whatever your sport, rarely changes throughout adulthood. As a kid, I was bandwagon fan - whichever team was winning was my team. Then, I read Dante, and Nietzsche, and comic books authored by people who loved superheroes as much as philosophy. I learned that the indecisive were banished outside the gates of the afterlife, unable to even enter Hell. God was dead. Mankind was evolving, awaiting a Hindu Zarathustra - the next man. Superheroes played favorites - home cities, bold home colors. Just like sports teams.   Since I moved to Australia, I've superficially adopted new sports teams. I've discovered the cricket ground, the AFL footy oval, the Premier League Soccer pitch, the NBL court, and the rugby field - and with each a team. Filling me with magic grab-bags of colorful team patches, quilted together. A net of identity. Something to put in your ruck-sack as you leave for youth hostels and forked-tongued devils of a world outside dimensions of the home team.   Sports are the shoelace of masculinity. In the "crisis of masculinity" caused by the rise of feminism, male bonding via sports, deprecating humor, ties, beer, and the phrase "your mother" can be found still flourishing. There must be a choice: a team, a home, an identity. Overseas, Australians talk cricket bowlers and Angelinos discuss Shaq, Kobe, and the Lakers. A traveler devoid of opinions cannot change and often never leaves; a man traveling without a home team has no heartache allowing him to flirt with foreign women.   What does it mean to be a man, an American, a Hindu, living in Australia? When does traveling end and here begin? Can I own my identity until I choose a home team? Must I see the symbols of my team on t-shirts before I feel accepted - as a man, as an Angelino?   Yes. God yes. It's lonely here, far away from home team supporters I call friends. Men are alone, in crisis, frozen, and socially inept in ability to create networks of team-lovers. Men use less words than women; our home team speaks for us. Our support for our team helps us support our self.   The declining number of paid AFL team supporters reflects the current crisis of masculinity, the crisis torn apart by inability to commit - the greatest Dantean sin.   Only a die-hard Collingwood fan can understand half-naked Packers maniacs, braving frozen snow to show their painted flabby chests to their team and to television. This is the ultimate male, the zenith of fulfillment, the front row. The craving of lonely men. They are seats with purpose and identity.   Traveling men are a diaspora, yearning for the home, in exile, spreading legends of the heroes, the team superheroes in their bright colors. These wanderers wear team uniforms with pride in the cloth's power to construct their identity.   Television and the internet, radio and newspapers, phones and photos - all connect the traveler with his home team. A hyperlinked, heterosexual presence echoes in mediums and messages. This globalized convergent world keeps us forever alone, forever in touch. So, I sit in front of a computer, cheering silently as the game score is continuously updated. I watch to belong. It brings me closer to home: a Lakers fan and his community of men.

						   Returning to the city after a week with 40 kids brings you into a crashing reality of singularity and disillusionment - from doing the real work of charity and hope and aid and goodness, to the self-obsessed sexually-"metro" lifestyle. Where my apartment is dirty, my clothes are dirty, and my spirit is soaring, I find withdrawals from the simplicity of children. No television. Being outside. Making kids smile and laugh - and the kids queuing up for showers, running nude with dirty underwear, smiling and laughing and joking with big bright eyes - they touch your spirit. Ten minutes after he enters the shower - a 7-year-old boy asks how to turn the water on! Where do these kids' minds go?   Post-camp celebration with many a drink well into the evening - the Walrus - wielding his guitar and repertoire of pub songs - telling us that "You know what impresses me about you guys, St. Vinny's Kids camp? It's that lots of people talk about it, but you actually do it." After a week of little sleep, freezing cold, ADD and ADHD kids, you question if you get through. At the end, when they write you letters, and tell you that they "just wanna stay on camp with you" - it's impossible to doubt your motivation and reasoning. The Walrus' words swell my pride.   And, it raises the question, how responsible are parents? I have a friend from Penn, she is ADD - and manages her condition well. Is this disease, and so many other related conditions, the product of our age? Of our pollution, polymers, and polysaturated spreads? Is the violence, sexism, racism, and frustration bred into children? We succeed in making children attention deprived, and berate them for lacking a concentration of more than a few minutes, but our soundbytes create their grammar. They listen to the radio; they watch the popular movies, and they consume "There's something about Miriam" on TV - then proceed to bash me with their fists, run in terror, and pinch my ass when I fulfill a camp tradition of cross-dressing at our "disco party." How do we un-breed these tendencies out of children?   I had damper from the fire and boiled lollies from Sovereign Hill, home of the second largest gold nugget in the world. Damper = Australian camp tradition. Damper = large ball of dough, heated to produce a mushy biscuit-like cake. Damper = it popped my cherry.   I believe I'll find myself talking to people as I talk to children for a few more days. Some teachers I know never unwind properly, and will occasionally slip "Now, are you all finished with that sweetheart?" into adult conversation. Inescapable, the vocabulary of child-speak. "Coochie, coochie, coo, Mr. President."

						   Turning my hands inside-out, interlocking, stretching, hearing my stiff writing-knuckles bend and shuffle and set to the outpour of words once again. I'm craving, it's writing I've missed. What's writing but my honesty to my mind? My thoughts sit inside me and build up turbulence, and need release - whether punching a tree, bleeding knuckles, outside in the early hours of the morning, covered in rage and wet with rain; or the stillness of meditation. Whether the organization of following a recipe, blundering through a busy schedule,  consuming comic books, or mindnumbing the fury with the idiot-box, I have to find ways to blunt my intensity - and I hate it. It's a question of people - to bounce ideas and exchange furies and understanding - and an outlet. I go to the gym because image is everything. Because I want to be strong - because it brings me closer to an invulnerable colossus.  I want everyone in the world to stop being white. The collective unconscious of a minority race. There are MORE of us than you, and yet you're "progress." You're "Western." You run the show.   My girlfriend is white. We have our 3 year anniversary in a few days - and I love her still. Every minute? No. When I move beyond the color? Yes. When I'm reminded of it? - I'm too ultimately color conscious and I draw back. Why is my race so import ant? Because I'll never be President of any country, or blonde, or have blue eyes, or play professional sports. Because I can count the second generation Indian characters on TV with one hand. Because, in the end, I told myself I was better than the "whites" to compensate for not being one of them, and I hate both those streams of thought. For having lots of visible black hair on my arms and having bushy black eyebrows.  I think excellence is something which, when people are missing it, I'm turned off. Personal demons exorcized, mind and body fit and moulded to sharpness, socially versatile. "Never settle," I've often advised others, and told myself. Everyone does. Including myself. Is there perfection, and can I achieve it? Can i be part of it?  I spend time finding Indians on Friendster. I'm researching Media Literacy and Diversity in Children. I watch the Olympics and think - there is excellence. There is the closest man comes to perfection. Greek marble gods - chisled bodies formed of disciplined minds.  I have too much energy to sit and read long-winded documents, to not go out, to be bored socially. Slowly, I've made inroads to friends and community here in Melbourne. The St. Vinnies crew, the LaTrobe crew, Adam, Loz, Michael & Brooke, Stan, and a door opened into the Indian Club. But still, no best friend.  Damnit, I'm not this negative. I'm positive with people, but I've lost the ability to say what's necessary to people. To say what's on my mind, to be reflective and insightful. To connect. It's slowly returning. I need to be alone for it to foster. I need creativity and inspiration. To be in touch with my own mind and it's pure rightness. I need to write.
