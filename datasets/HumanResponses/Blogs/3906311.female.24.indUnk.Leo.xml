       I've been really busy with so many people coming to visit me I really haven't had time to post here. I'm grabbing some quick songs to post before my parents come pick me up today, since now they're up to visit this weekend. Everyone loves me!   urlLink Jarabe de Palo  is a group from Spain I never would have heard of except that my best friend took a semester abroad there and came back with them. From what I've heard of them, the group is pretty diverse musically and with what instruments they use and sorta half traditional with salsa and latin music. After that, it's all in Spanish, which I don't understand at all.      Jarabe de Palo - Perro Apaleao 3:23    Jarabe de Palo & Celia Cruz - A Lo Loco 4:15

       Got a quickie today - this one comes to us from a vinyl album of songs from the  urlLink Dr. Demento Radio Show  (if you've never heard the Doctor's show, it's a place where you can hear the most oddball songs and skits around).  Today's song is a cover of the Led Zeppelin song "Whole Lotta Love".    "Whole Lotta Love" - The Temple City Kazoo Orchestra    urlLink [ buy  Tales From The Rhino  ]      urlLink The Tofu Hut  is running a special now on acapella music, and some of it sounds like it's from novelty records (such as this particular song) - check it out if acapella music is your sort of thing... I've got a few acapella tracks I'm tempted to post on here if I don't see them show up over there, oh yes...

       By request of  urlLink Teague  comes an investigation into ukelele music!  First off comes   urlLink "Uke Til You Puke"  , a sort of punk-rock ukelele ensemble.   "Tiptoe Thru the Tulips"    Next is the   urlLink "Serious Ukelele Ensemble"   No full songs of theirs to sample, but they do have short clip of a few different songs on their two albums...   "The William Tell Overture"   "The Entertainer"    (files no longer exist on source server, links therefore removed)     urlLink John King   has taken various classical songs and set them unaccompanied to ukelele...   "Allegro, from Concerto in D" - Vivaldi     "The Washington Post March" - Sousa      urlLink The Hazzards   (formerly known as "The Ukes of Hazzard") is a two-girl ukelele group out of New York City. In addition to their one song available for free download and 5 others for $1 each, they also have  urlLink a music video for their song "Gay Boyfriend" available for viewing .   "Let's Get Romantic"      urlLink Jonny Flash   has some of the oddest covers of songs I've heard.   "I Think I'm Turning Japanese" - cover of The Vapors      urlLink The Fabulous Heftones   perform all sorts of old-timey music, and all their songs are  urlLink free to download !  As if just plain ukeleles weren't strange enough,   urlLink ukelele/typewriter   provides an accompaniement that makes ukeleles themselves look normal!   "Creep" - cover of Radiohead      urlLink Ukelele Afternoon   brings ukelele music to Tokyo - probably best to check out the  urlLink english pages , but I've found some mp3s on there that weren't on the english site, and some that were even off a  urlLink totally different site as well...    donguri.mp3     "Ukelele Holy Night"     "Everybody Needs Somebody To Love" - cover of The Blues Brothers      urlLink Sonic Uke   brings ukelele music  urlLink live to NYC  from their  urlLink front stoop !   "The Wind Cries Mary" - cover of Jimi Hendrix    ---  What makes this all amazing is this is only a small selection of the  urlLink large variety of ukelele music  that is out there... there seems to be people doing ukelele music for most genres, and several of those artists look like they appear in performance while wearing a cow suit. What the correleation is between ukeleles and cows is, I have no clue.

       For those of you with  urlLink iTunes , I've set up an  urlLink iMix  with all the songs posted on Radio KRUD that are available in the iTunes Music Store, making it easy for you to purchase any songs we post here that are available on there as well. Permanent link for it is over on the right for easy access, and if they don't have particular songs that we post that you'd like them to have, then why don't you  urlLink let them know  what it is that you'd want in there?

       I'm feeling a little bit out of it, recovering from jet-lag, so not much of an intro for this song... just some nice quiet blues (as nice as this song sounds, aside from the whole being abandoned by your girlfriend and becoming addicted to cocaine bit of the song, haha). Comic-con was lots of fun, and I got to do a little bit of promotion for Radio KRUD while out in San Diego, so if you're coming here from hearing about it there, I'd like to welcome you and hope you enjoy our selections.        "Guilty", The Blues Brothers     urlLink [buy  The Definitive Album ]    I think I'm about ready for another nap...

       I first heard  urlLink Sevara Nazarkhan  last year opening for Peter Gabriel on his  Growing Up  tour. Going in not knowing a thing about her, except she was on the Real World label, I expected something good and interesting, but she blew me away. For starters, Sevara has an immaculate voice that she really uses as an instrument. Her phrasing is sharp and crisp, then smooth and flowing together, perfectly matching the song and creating moods without the benefit (for me) of understanding what the words mean. Sevara is a singer songwriter from Uzbekistan, where a woman singing and accompanying herself on a stringed instrument is an ancient tradition. Her music is steeped in this tradition, but has many other qualities as well. Peter Gabriel introduced her by saying her sound was a mix between traditional and modern music, but it's how she accomplishes that mix that really astounds me. That and the fact she's a pop star in her native country. Her debut CD on Real World showcases less upbeat and poppy songs, most of them traditional folk songs in fact, but when I saw her perform, she also did songs in a cowboy hat that were decidely more modern without skipping a beat.

       I'm a big fan of buying music I normally wouldn't listen to in other countries. For some reason, that distance seems to make things normally boring and unpalatable into something interesting. It also forces me to broaden my tastes and not just write off entire genres. I like having something of everything. So when I went to Ireland for a couple weeks about 4 years ago, I picked up everything I could (especially the beer, since I was under the drinking age back in the states). I came back with a lot of dance, pop, and eletronica- things totally foreign to the rest of my music collection.  The bigs hits while I was there were Robbie William's  Rock DJ , Madison Avenue's  Don't Call Me Baby , and other listenable, tongue in cheek dance pop tunes. My favorite (as well my little sister's) was Morcheeba's  Rome Wasn't Built In A Day . It's poppy, fun and sweet and gets stuck in your head. Morcheeba, as I've since found out, is a trio that seems to defy cateorization. After getting  urlLink Fragments of Freedom , which is a great album all in the same vein as  Rome , I picked up  Who Can You Trust?  and  Beats & B-sides , both with their own flavours, but both decidely more mellow, jazzy and smooth. It's the sort of thing I'd reccommend as a starter set to trip/trance/pop styles on account of its accesibility, without me knowing much at all about those genres. They don't rely on jarring or dischordant sounds, like a lot of the trance stuff I've heard. The song I've picked out from  Who Can You Trust?  is the oddity on the album, with horns and strings and is probably the most interesting track, music-wise, though not very representational. The rest is a little bit more electronica, though similar in tone and variation within the song.   But, as usual, you get to judge for yourself. And feel free to tell me things I don't know about this group, or the genres involved, because while I admit my lack of knowledge, I still want to know. I like music, ya know.    Morcheeba - Rome Wasn't Built In A Day     urlLink [purchase Fragments of freedom]     Morcheeba - Col     urlLink [purchase Who Can You Trust]     I really reccommend Glenn's mix CD, even though I already have my own Jetsetting CD. It's called Frank Sinatra's  Come Fly With Me . XD

       Like I mentioned in my previous post, I'm going to the San Diego Comic-Con for the weekend (I'll most likely be hanging out somewhere with my chums around the  urlLink Keenspot / urlLink Keenspace  booth *shameless plug*), and for the lack of posting while I'm away I've created the first radioKRUD Virtual Mix CD™! It's a zip file (84 MB! set some time aside for the download!) of a mix of several different songs that would be perfect for a mix on its own. This one in particular is titled   urlLink "Music to Jetset By"  ... the overall tone of the album is generally loungeish / jazzy music that make me think of travelling (especially in airplanes). While I've got several dozen more songs that make me feel the same way, I tried to go for a relaxing tone on this mix, and arranged a few in the order of the things they remind me corresponding to an actual trip.  Track Listing (click the album covers to buy each cd - with a large mix like this I strongly urge you to buy the albums these songs are from, or at least try to get the individual songs off of Apple's  urlLink iTunes  store):    urlLink     1. "The Girl Next Green Door",  LUXURY , Fantastic Plastic Machine   Yeah, yeah, I know I covered FPM just a post or two ago. Hearing this song at the beginning makes me think of elevator / lobby music from the 60s: stale air smelling of cigarettes... plaid suits... fiberglass seats with vinyl cushions... molded plastic furniture... public address systems from which you can't understand what's being said... white courtesy phones... and from there the song becomes more sophisticated yet still retains that underlying tone of canned music.     urlLink     2. "Incident at Gate 7",  Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi , Thievery Corporation   Thievery Corporation is one of those bands who tend to make me want to take a nap. This particular song makes me think of just hanging out in the airport, waiting for my flight, staying cool, calm, and collected while people bustle about. If I could only find someone to follow me around all day every day I'd have so much fun picking out songs for my own soundtrack.     urlLink     3. "Everybody Ready",  Action Figure Party , Action Figure Party   I always think of the airplane tugs when I hear this song, or I think of taxiing to the runway. I could see this song being used in a commercial for  urlLink Southwest Airlines , but why Southwest I couldn't tell you, they just seem like they'd work together. Of all the songs on this mix, this one is probably the odd man out. Compared to the others, this one is more of a jazz than a lounge sound.     urlLink     4. "Airplane",  The Sound of Music , Pizzicato Five   As the song picks up tempo in the beginning I can think of the plane doing its takeoff roll and rotating at the end of the runway. This one's catchy, and I had to include this song in the mix even it if wasn't - the song ends with the sound of jets flying by, making this one completely apropos.     urlLink     5. "So Nice (Summer Samba)",  Six Degrees 100 , Bebel Gilberto   A nice calm song as the plane reaches crusing altitude, dipping over, under, and through the clouds on a nice summer day, the sun illuminating the landscape below.     urlLink     6. "Toh-Sui",  Ki-Oku , DJ Krush   I really like this album even if most of the songs all run together. This song in particular appeals to me with the brass tones being interspersed. I've heard a little bit of other DJ Krush albums and they don't really sound anything like this particular one, so if you like jazzy/lounge sort of music then this one is a good one to get, but don't expect all his work to sound like this.     urlLink     7. "Missione a Bombay",  Jet Sounds Revisted , Nicola Conte / Eddy & Dus Vs. Jazzalektro   I used to work at Tower Records back in the day and one day on the store playlist we had  urlLink  "Bossa Per Due"   playing - I liked the music (it kind of reminded me of the in-game music if you've ever played The Sims, but the signature track "Jet Sounds" recently became popular due to being used in a certain  urlLink Joe Boxer commercial ), and bought the album.  "Jet Sounds Revisted"  is a collection of remixes of the different songs on  "Bossa Per Due" , so if you enjoy this then I'd recommend checking that album out as well.     urlLink     8. "Dolphin Dance",  Maiden Voyage , Herbie Hancock   More cruising in-flight music, but this one is more jazz than loungey.     urlLink     9. "Bright Nights (feat. Yukimi Nagano)",  Waltz for Koop , Koop   I discovered Koop via the  "Jet Sounds Revisited"  album... nice and soft...     urlLink     10. "Shadows of Ourselves" 11. "Lebanese Blonde" 12. "Le Monde"  The Mirror Conspiracy , Thievery Corporation   The style of Thievery Corporation gives me more of a feeling of being an international traveler. If I were filthy rich and could afford to travel internationally at the drop of a hat, I'd hire someone to follow me around with a pair of speakers hooked up to this particular album, just so I could have music to set the scene, hahaha...     urlLink     13. "Il Cerchio Rosso" 14. "Bossa Per Due"  Bossa Per Due , Nicola Conte   See my notes a few paragraphs back about  "Bossa Per Due"  - the song "Il Cerchio Rosso" really does sound like in game music from The Sims!     urlLink     15. "Room Service",  The Fifth Release From Matador , Pizzicato Five   Just the thing to relax to when you finally arrive at your hotel, stretched out on the bed with your shoes kicked off!   So that's the mix - I had to take the other songs I've posted off to fit this up, but I think that the mix in this one makes up for it. Like I said, most of the songs are of a jazzy/loungey type, so if that's not your sort of thing then you might want to steer clear and check out Megs' post about The Rutles instead.  See you when I get back!

       I am going to be very, very, very sad this week. Comicon in San Diego is a yearly tradition for me, but my moving to Canada prevents me from going this year. So I will miss the chance to hang out with fellow radioKRUDer Glenn while helping Dave pick up the slack. We've gotten a few emails about the pictures - I drew them in Expression (a vector program) and they're supposed to blend in perfectly with the site design for radioKRUD I haven't quite finished yet. If you're on  urlLink Livejournal  and want to get this blog on your page, I set up a  urlLink syndicated feed there .  ONTO THE MUSIC!  By request of my dear friend Susan, I've dug out my old Rutles CD and ripped a couple of songs from this classic group. There are so many amazing songs in their repitoire, it was hard to single the number down, but here's what I choose to represent such an iconic band that has recorded so many hits through such a long period of time:       urlLink Hold My Hand   urlLink Ouch!   urlLink Another Day     Dirk, Nasty, Stig and Barry (the Rutles) were a Beatles parody put on by Neil Innes and Eric Idle (of Monty Python fame). These songs come from the movie that chronicles the group from its comic inception to its even more comic end. It's hilarious as a parody, but the Beatles imitation is downright creepy in the songs.  Hold My Hand , with it's "yeah yeah yeah"s manages to combine at least two Beatles songs into one, sounding like both at the same time, while not actually borrowing the Beatles tunes.  Ouch!  doesn't sound as much like  Help! , but has a lot more fun with the "love hurts" concept than any song I've ever heard.  What's great, though, is that these songs stand alone just fine. I got tricked when I first heard them. I was 14 and a friend stuck them onto an otherwise serious classic r&b tape and since so many bands of that period had silly songs,  Another Day  didn't stand out as fabricated to sound just like them. When he tried it next with  Piggy In the Middle  and  Cheese and Onions , I got it. But then, I was even then a Monty Python fan and knew Eric Idle's musical work with the show, as well as Neil Innes, who colaberated with them on songs from the movies.   urlLink [buy the album]   [buy the movie!]

      I don't know if any of you&nbsp;have ever heard of a website called  urlLink http://www.pitchforkmedia.com &nbsp;but that's where I usually go when I want to find very obscure songs by unheard of bands. Pitchfork Media deals with music news, album reviews, and they also provide a section where you download free MP3s of, as I stated earlier, relatively unknown bands. &nbsp; For the most part, I have not been disappointed with the songs I have found there. In fact, I've found some real gems that have made me want to go out and by the CDs that these unknown artists have released. Some of the better bands I've run across are the Desert Fathers, Girls Are Short, the Russian Futurists, Oneida, the Doxies, Fiel Garvie, Sea Ray, and Raising the Fawn. Those bands are all worth checking out as is  urlLink http://www.pitchforkmedia.com .  &nbsp; Also, I would like to apologize for the severe lack of substance in my posts. I'm at the family computer right now and my own computer does not have an Internet connection, so I can't do as much as I normally could with these posts.

Hope you enjoy it!

        urlLink Fantastic Plastic Machine , aka Tomoyuki Tanaka (no, not  urlLink that Tomoyuki Tanaka  of Godzilla fame, the  urlLink other Tomoyuki Tanaka ) provides us today with music to cover pretty much any mood. It's lounge crossed with electronica crossed with dance crossed with retro crossed with crossed with cool crossed with I think you get the idea. And how cool is FPM?      I don't think things could get cooler than that guy right there (especially if you see his picture on the front page of his  urlLink his website  - that one in particular just EXHUDES coolness!). To me, FPM is like natural pop music - nothing really artificial here!  It's hard to describe the songs overall, though. They can't be tied down to one particular genre, but overall they'd be considered somewhere between pop and electronica.  You can really tell the difference between Tanaka's early works versus his later ones too... the overall tone is much more mature, so it may be possible that you don't enjoy earlier works as opposed to later or vice versa.  My main complaint about FPM is that too many of songs all seem to sound the same in the end... there's only a few particular songs I can place to their titles, and those are generally my favorite tracks as well ("Take Me To The Disco" from  urlLink Beautiful ; "Theme of Luxury", "Honolulu, Calcutta", "He Became A Beatnik", "Lotto",  "I've Forgotten My Fagotto", "The Girl Next Green Door", and "MPF (Mezzo Pianoforte)" from  urlLink LUXURY ; "L'aventure Fantastique", "Dear Mr. Salesman", "Bachelor Pad", and "First Class '77" from  urlLink Fantastic Plastic Machine ). These songs all really have something major (some hook, or lyrics, or even just how cheesily retro they are) to distinguish them from one another. Everything else eventually puts me to sleep because of their unremarkableness, but I suppose that could be a good thing in the case of a cd selection for soft party background music. It also took a few listens for some of the other tracks (some of my favorites, in fact) to grow on me - I wasn't sure if I liked them or not until I gave them a few listens so I could think them over.  Other than that, I think FPM is a rather good listen. It's as if 60's pop/dance music were still being made today! See what you think!

       Tonight I went with a friend of mine to  urlLink Artscape , a free art festival held in downtown Baltimore every year - this was my second year going (last year was much better since I was able to actually attend more than one event), but it's great to go at all if you can because there's three or four different  urlLink stages  with all sorts of different musical acts or bands performing. It's kind of like a small-scale  urlLink Music Midtown  with the same variety of acts, but (my favorite part) this is FREE! :D  A shame I missed out yesterday - Isaac Hayes was performing, and how cool would it have been to hear  urlLink the theme from "Shaft" ?? But I digress...  Tonight we went to see the Violent Femmes (who aren't really "violent", nor are they "femmes" - false advertising, I say! When I hear "violent femmes" I want to see catfights!). I hadn't really known much about them other than that they did the hit "Blister in the Sun" and occasionally hearing "Kiss Off" yet not knowing the title of that particular song until I  urlLink looked it up  about 3 minutes ago. After that concert, though, I've got quite a bit of appreciation for their artistry. Not only did they rock out, but I heard them cover all sorts of genres - rock, pop, blues, country... this is a rather versatile group.  But see, the first thoughts that usually enter my head when I hear someone mention "Violent Femmes" are either "out of tune" or "bad singing". But this is where they actually ROCK - while most, ok,  all  bands have some semblance of musical harmony ( urlLink "The Shaggs"  notwithstanding - I'd say that "My Pal Foot Foot" is more an excercise in dada than actual music), you have to admit that singer/guitarist Gordon Gano doesn't exactly have a throat of gold. Furthermore, during the concert they brought out a brass ensemble during one of the songs, and they belted out the most bizarre cacophony I have ever heard outside of the dopper effect on a bicycle bell.  However, being "out of tune" or having "bad singing" doesn't really hold them back - they rock out at practically everything else! Guitar melodies went up and down with fingers flying all over the place! Bass lines thumb-da-da-thum-thum'ed like crazy! In fact, one of the best things to see during the concert was the percussionist rocking out INCREDIBLY hard on the drums! He was beating those drums as if they owed him money! What's more, unlike most percussionists, this guy was not sitting down on a little stool for the duration of the concert... oh no, this guy was running around and jumping up and down and banging and beating and clanging and clashing all over the place! Amazing!  This is where we flashback to last-year's Artscape: at this same particular stage last year I saw the "Preservation Hall Jazz Band", best known for their performance of "When The Saints Go Marching In". I've never been to New Orleans, but apparently they're one of the must-see things-to-do down there. They performed at last year's Artscape, and it was an overall entertaining show.      The best part was (and you'll have to skip ahead to about 5:55 into the song to hear something similar) their percussionist - he looked as if he was ready to fall asleep for most of the set, but when they came to that final song and launched themselves into a rowdy version of "When The Saints Go Marching In", boy howdy did that guy become alive. He rolled into one of the most impressive drum solos I've seen - when you're hitting those drums and cymbals hard enough to cause one of your cymbals to go flying across the stage then I consider that a fantastic feat.      -   "Jesus Walking on the Water" , The Violent Femmes    urlLink [ Buy the album! ]   -   "When The Saints Go Marching In" , The Preservation Hall Jazz Band    urlLink [ Buy the album! ]

        I went to college in the middle of nowhere, Virginia,  at a woman's college. Needless to say, when a band of handsome guys who played incredibly fun music were in the vicinity, I was  there . Carbon Leaf is one of those local southern acts that I discovered while in college and boy-deprived. When  first saw them in 98 or 99, they weren't alltogether great, but some of their songs were excellent and their overall energy was just fun. Over the years, they've honed that potential into a real quality sound and their songwriting ability isn't so much hit or miss as  hit . The last time I saw them perform was last fall in Atlanta and I brought my parents with me to the concert. My dad is even more of an audiophile than I am, being a recording engineer and not just someone who grew up around recording engineers, and given that they were playing in a small venue, their sound was such that even my dad was impressed. But let's face it, my whole family is one big sucker for Celtic music and rock n' roll, and Carbon Leaf's blend is usually pretty darn good.   The band also encourages sharing certain of their albums via mp3. You can go to their  urlLink webpage [carbonleaf.com]  and find a mass of songs for download. I'm just going to pimp one of my favorites here:     Carbon Leaf - Shine   [This album  urlLink  Echo Echo   is one of their best. Also reccommended highly is  urlLink  Five  Alive  , their live album. But going to see on of their shows live is the BEST.]  Actually, I lie. Better than a Carbon Leaf live show is a  urlLink Jump, Little Children  live show. Similarily "cursed" with a just plain clumsy name (Carbon Leaf is a little too neohippie, while JLC is named after a really awesome song, it's long and easily confused), the band just changed their official title to what has been their nickname for a long time. They now go by just "Jump". Which is a lot of what you do at a concert. These guys are just plain  fun . At least half the time. The rest their come out with sweet, uncanny softer songs that utilize one of the best voices I've ever heard.  The song I'm posting of theirs is one you can't buy on any album. I like that kind of sample, because then I get both a taste for the artist and don't feel cheated when I buy the album and already have some of the songs. The reason  Pink Lemonade  isn't published is because of the evils of copyright extension. Most old stuff ultimately goes into the public domain, but the keepers of  You Are My Sunshine  are very, well "greedy" and thanks to lobbying on the part of bigger copyright holders (like Disney and its mouse) they get to keep it. But you can't have  Pink  without the Sunshine.     Jump, Little Children - Pink Lemonade     If you like  Pink , the albums that reflect that sound best are their early  Licorice Tea Demos  and  Buzz . Both are availible together in their  urlLink Early Years  compilation, as both albums are out of print.  urlLink Magazine  was probably their most well known  release, featuring the ballad  Cathedrals .  urlLink Vertigo  has some excellent songs, including some of my favorites, but is an exercise in bad recording. The mix is dull and bland. Their latest,  urlLink Between The Dim And The Dark , on the other hand, is one of their finest recordings and is their best album, as opposed to a bunch of great songs in one place. Their sound has mellowed over the years, but deepened as it went.  I've always enjoyed them the best, still, as a live band. I've  travelled states in the dead of night to see these guys and they're one  of the things I miss most about living down south. Thank goodness for the  urlLink Live Music Archive and the dedicated people who record their concerts!

       Welcome to all the listeners from  urlLink The Tofu Hut  - gee, only a few days live and we're already being pimped out? I guess that means we're starting to hit The Big Time in musicblogging already (whatever that is)! The mind boggles! Have a look around and see if you like what you hear - the site's still going through some changes thanks to megs, so we are going to have a redesign shortly. But who cares what the site looks like? On with the tunes!!  Continuing on from yesterday with peppy Japanese music, if you've listened to at least the music to  urlLink Cowboy Bebop  (movie or tv series), or even listened to a few other various anime soundtracks, you ought to be familiar with the work of  urlLink Yoko Kanno .  I found out about this particular album when I went on a trip to Japan to visit some friends for two weeks, and ended up wandering around the country by myself for one of those weeks. During my stay in Tokyo I was wandering through Shibuya and found a  urlLink Tower Records store  and figured I'd take a look around. After poking around I saw this cd set up for sampling, and after giving it a try I was hooked - took me a little over a year to find the cd, but thanks to the magic of the internet and my new favorite webpage for cds from Japan ( urlLink cdjapan.co.jp , of course), I was able to hunt it down. Tonight I'd like to share with you some of her work - used for TV commercials - as part of the group "Samply Red". Think of it as music from Cowboy Bebop meets big band jazz, or just plain old big band jazz if you haven't heard the music to Cowboy Bebop...        "Perfect Rouge III TV Version"     "Perfect Rouge II TV Version"     urlLink Buy the album!

       Ahh, Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, or 東京スカパラダイスオーケストラ if you're Japanese. This (and by "this" I mean their cover of "Hit The Road Jack") is perfect pick-me-up music, yet has enough of a lounge sound to keep you in your seat - I suppose it's the type of music that would have you reclining in your La-Z-Boy, yet you can't resist tapping your feet in time with the music.  Not all of their songs have that kind of happy-relaxed feeling. Oh no, some of them (the theme from "Tetris", or their take on the theme from "Lupin the 3rd", for example) have a kind of wild anything-goes feel to them. In fact, actually, the theme to "Lupin the 3rd" makes me feel like getting in wild car chases from the police. I guess that's the nice thing about ska... it's kind of a controlled chaos. I'm not much of a ska fan, but I know what I like.   urlLink This site  says more than I can ever say about the band. Take a look through to see what T.S.P.O. is all about, and then download the songs. Go ahead and cut loose and dance if nobody's looking. I won't tell. Really! Promise.    "Hit The Road Jack"     urlLink [ Buy the album! ]     "Tetris"     ルパン三世'78 (Theme from "Lupin the 3rd")     urlLink [ Buy the album! ]

      The Daveman here with a bit of an introductory post. I figure I'd just say what music I listen to (i.e. what kind of stuff you might find me posting here). I guess you could dumb down my musical tastes to "everything" because I do in fact like almost every conceivable genre out there. It doesn't mean I like all the music I hear, but the chances that I will are pretty good.  Anyway, I'll start off by introducing an artist who has had his hand in a number of musical genres and done well in them all as far as I can tell. He's a bit of an idol of mine, a man by the name of Devin Townsend. He's the lead singer of the heavy metal band Strapping Young Lad and has also formed a punk rock band called Punky Bruster and gone solo to do alternative rock. He has his own label called Hevy Devy Records at http://www.hevydevy.com where you can download a full track from each of the albums he has released. I was able to get a really cool live version of "Oh My Fucking God" by Strapping Young Lad from their live album  No Sleep Till Bedtime  from mp3.com, but I don't what's going on with that site nowadays. All of Devin Townsend's work is of high quality, so go check it out any way you can.

        Well, well, well. Here we are. When Glenn first asked me to join in on this MUSICBLOGGING(!!!) adventure, my first concern was that we might populate it exclusively with Frank Zappa songs.    So, I consider it my duty to begin with a Mothers tune. Or rather, two tunes in one. I don't have this album (  urlLink We're Only In It For The Money   - link to amazon.com) on CD, just taped off a friend's LP, so I'm not sure where I got this mp3 from. It takes an instrumental he did in 1961 and pairs it with the lambast against hippies and not-hippies and just about everyone that runs through this album. It's also a couple of really catchy songs. The reprise of Ugliest Part is a classic. It's the kind of song that you sneak onto mix tapes for friends at the very end.   Frank Zappa - Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance / What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body (reprise) (mp3 format) (2.4 mb)    I'll balance this out with another Frank of reknown.    Frank Sinatra - On The Road To Mandalay (mp3 format) (1.4 mb)    I was reminded of this song while reading Alan Moore's  League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  (the comic book, which is fantastic and should bear no relation to the movie). Volumn two, Issue Three is titled  And The Dawn Comes Up Like Thunder , which is the strange ending line in this song. Sinatra gives it such a strange gusto everytime he comes to it, it really stands out as memorable. It's a strange song, period; it's much more flexible and all over the place than most of the standards he sang. The song is from   urlLink Come Fly With Me   (link to amazon.com), one of his many theme albums on the Capitol label. If you have any interest in Sinatra, start out with the Capitol albums. I know you want to hear "My Way". Buy the song on i-tunes, but don't buy his later albums. The Capitol albums are class all the way through for the most part, and arguably his best years singing.  OK, that's it for me this time. I'm just glad this sort of thing is legal up here in the fabled Canadas. For now.

       Hello and welcome to radioKRUD - I suppose it's best to provide a quick intro as for what drove me to do my own musicblogging...  I had been reading my friends' list on  urlLink LiveJournal , and one of the particular people whose journal I followed had been posting a song or three every few days. I downloaded each song she posted, adding them to a particular playlist of just the songs she had posted, and after a while I noticed that I really grew to like most of the songs I had found out about from her. I'd buy the albums of some of the bands she had posted songs from, and started keeping an eye out for more material from many of the artists. Eventually I got around to asking her one day where she found out about these songs, and one of her sources she pointed me towards was  urlLink The Tofu Hut . I started to poke around and realized that I myself did a little bit of musicblogging occasionally since I liked to post various songs in my own journal and type up a short blurb about each - I just tried to share different types of songs I myself enjoyed, hoping that it might help others find new artists that they'd enjoy as well.  At the same time that I was discovering other musicblogs,  urlLink soul sides  posted a brief article titled (get this)  urlLink "So You Want to Start an Audioblog" ! What serendipity! I was toying with the idea of starting my own musicblog, and here was the kick in the butt to get me started. I'll be joined shortly by two of my friends who were also keen on sharing other songs that they happened to enjoy as well, so there ought to be a diverse selection of tunes coming through here in due time. radioKRUD is going to be going under some fixing up over the next few days as well as we finish getting things straightened out over here, so bear with us.  So, now that that's out of the way, on to the songs! Today I'd like to make a case against remastering - for the most part, remastering is a good thing! It helps songs sound cleaner (to me, at least - others with ears more golden than mine may take offense at the slightest bit of sound-sanitizing), etc etc. Well, recently I'd taken to listening to old  urlLink Frank Zappa  tunes - most notably his  urlLink "Crusing with Ruben & the Jets" ... Zappa was heavily influenced by old doo-wop music, and I myself tend to prefer his songs like this or his instrumentals over some of his more raunchier material, but I digress...  As you can see on the album's page on amazon.com, the cd's recieved rather mixed reviews. In the time that I listened to the songs from the album, they were all recorded from the original vinyl version. Eventually I couldn't stand it any longer and wanted to get my hands on a copy of the album so I'd have a better quality version of "Jelly Roll Gum Drop", and was I dismayed to hear that the cd remastered version of the song sounded sloppy, as if the Mothers were out of sync and recording in a tile room with all the echo. I suppose that I'll eventually get used to it, but it's going to take a while. While the remaster was done and approved by FZ himself, I personally think he missed the mark with it as the quality of the material in the remastered version has gone greatly downhill. All I can say is it's a good thing I kept the mp3s ripped from the original album! I'll let you decide for yourself which sounds better...    "Jelly Roll Gum Drop" (album version)  - Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention    "Jelly Roll Gum Drop" (cd version)  - Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention   Feel free to let me know what you think in the comments... thanks again!

       Quick post before I go off to bed for the night... just poked around until I found something I had that was pretty random, and these two fit that criteria, I'd say... not much to say about them, other than I can see why Hulk Hogan's singing career never really took off...    urlLink "Hulkster's Back"     urlLink "I Want To Be A Hulkamaniac"   - Hulk Hogan  ---  I used to run a small internet radio station off a spare computer I have on my home network - I got it back up and running recently, and I was thinking of putting a link for it up on here, but a) I don't know if anybody would really listen to it, and b) with the  urlLink royalty rates  I'd have to pay, I don't know if it'd be worth it. What say you? Then you'd get 24/7 listening to the songs in my library (except when the power goes out or my network goes down, of course, haha :P), and depending on listenership I may do a live show once a week or something, similar to  urlLink Dr Demento . Hmm... anyways, why not leave me some feedback in the comments with what you think? I'd never want to put up affiliate links for the amazon.com album links on here (since I'm providing more of a service as a hobby and don't want to profit), but if I do set up an internet radio station on here I may do that to help defray the royalty fees. Or maybe I won't get caught! But then again, I  am  running a musicblog here, posting songs up every day or two... I laugh in the face of danger! Ha! Ha! Ehh...  Yeah, leave some feedback. I'm still thinking this one over.

       In her last post, Megs was posting about some songs she purchased because she learned all about them from another musicblog - here's two songs whose albums I purchased because of musicblogging as well...  Yeah, so it's more Brazillian music, but I love how the instrumentation matches the song. For a while, all I'd really listen to were  urlLink "Homenagem A Mongo"  and this... these two particular songs are the culprits for me wanting sambas, haha.    urlLink "Os Orixás" - Trio Mocotó    urlLink [ buy  Samba Rock  ]     ---  I never really listened to Ben Folds, and even after hearing this particular song I still don't, mostly because the rest of his material doesn't compare! I knew of  urlLink The Flaming Lips  via their  urlLink octophonic (yes, 8 speakers are needed) album "Zaireeka" , and I had investigated a few of their other songs on the iTunes Music Store, but other than that I wasn't really interested in them very much. Their music seemed much too experimental for me to enjoy.  That said, when you combine the oddball lyrics of The Flaming Lips with Ben Folds' piano playing, and add a lounge backup band in there, you get laid-back stuff like this that can't really be created any other way I can think of. Now if only Ben Folds did more songs like this...    urlLink "She Don't Use Jelly" - Ben Folds Five    urlLink [ buy  Lounge-A-Palooza  ]     I think that's actually the best song on that particular album... the other ones aren't too bad, but they're not in the same league.  ---  I've added a new link over on the right, over by the link to the songs on the iTunes Music Store - if you're using iTunes, why not check out  urlLink MusicMobs ? You upload your iTunes library to their servers, and it'll chart how many times you've listened to each particular artist and various things like that, but it will also recommend artists to you based on what you tend to listen to the most! It's interesting to check out... you can see  urlLink my profile  on there to see what I've got. Yes, I probably do listen to Vanilla Ice a bit more than I really should.  A similar service is  urlLink Audioscrobbler , where you'd leave a program running in the background and it would report each song you listened to to their servers where it would chart things on the fly. I have a  urlLink profile on there as well , but it's been a while since I've used it... they were having some server problems a few months back and wouldn't give you any recommendations, but I believe they've fixed those now. In any case, both services allow you to browse around and see what else people who have similar taste in music like that you might not regularly listen to.

       We're starting too get too many downloads here, so I'll either be cutting back on how long I leave songs up or looking for a new place to upload to. Or both. Or just post REALLY UNPOPULAR SONGS. Or just not "The Mighty Quinn". It's evidently much too good a song, but not too good for  me .  ------------------  urlLink Spoilt Victorian Child  is my new favorite musicblog. Of my many favorites, even though defeats the purpose of using the phrase "my favorite". I'll come in again.  Amongst  my favorite weaponry... ------------------ I can't remember from what blog I picked up Sondre Lerche's  You Know So Well 	, but whoever it was, thank you. I just bought the album, further proving that musicblogging works! I can be a little dense with music, as much as I like it; it can take a while for a song or artist to really sink their claws in me personally, even though I can pronounce snap judgments with the best of 'em. Sondre Lerche bowled me over and I can't stop listening. I like to play  urlLink  Faces Down   back to back with Jump's  urlLink  Between The Dim and The Dark  . Or my 2002 Dockstreet bootleg of Jump. ------------------  And now, the random song:   Kasahara Hiroko - Sora E (to the Sky)   Offline until Friday, sorry!  I've never actually seen the anime this song is from, Romeo's Blue Skies (or Romeo No Aoi Sora) but I got this song somehow. It's interesting in that it's a waltz and very nearly a polka... not at all your typical anime opening number. But it's sweet and you can dance to it!

       First off, a song that was one of my favorites to listen to for a long time. The other songs on this particular album are pretty catchy to listen to as well, roughly similar in style, and just plain fun to listen to... I think I can pin most of the blame for me liking Brazillian music to this particular album.    urlLink "Homenagem A Mongo" - Som Tres    urlLink [ buy  Samba Soul 70!  ]     I think I'll post a few more songs similar to that over the next few days... I've also been working on the next virtual mix cd to post: "Music To Getaway By". Think of good songs you'd see in movie chase sequences!  ---  The other day I was editing another picture that Megs once drew of me ages ago, and since I was bored I animated the hand so the final result looked like this:       That reminded me more of  urlLink the Batusi  than  urlLink Pulp Fiction  (mostly due to me never seeing Pulp Fiction...). So, when I was originally searching for pages about the Batusi to show a friend of mine, I came across this site:  urlLink Batman & Robin Play Their Favorites  - from the looks of things I think they're a dj duo from the Netherlands. They even have their a  urlLink bat-sampler  on their site!  So, to continue with the bat-songs...    urlLink "Evil Plot to Blow Up Batman" - Neal Hefti    urlLink [ buy  Batman Theme & 19 Other Bat Songs  ]     How can you resist an album with a title like that??     urlLink "I Whupped Batman's Ass" - Wesley Willis    urlLink [ buy  Greatest Hits  ]     I once started singing "I Whupped Batman's Ass" for a friend of mine while he was driving down the road, and he almost had to pull off to the side he was laughing so hard he began to cry! If you don't know who Wesley Willis is or you've never heard one of his songs, then that's probably a good thing. If you still want to know who he is, then imagine a 300 lb schizophrenic man who used to make a living playing songs on street corners with a Casio keyboard's demo mode - about all the songs had the same tune, just different lyrics... most of the time.  urlLink http://www.monzy.org/wesley/  says it better than I can (and also has a Wesley Willis song generator at the bottom of the page), and  urlLink MTV  has a few more details of him as well as the news of his death almost a year ago.

        "I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it. I tell you, those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments, every last man in Shawshank felt free." - Red,  The Shawshank Redemption  That's how this song makes me feel. Since it's a recent release, no full version of this song, just the excerpt off of the  urlLink official webpage...     realaudio excerpt:   urlLink "Pokarekare Ana" - Hayley Westenra    urlLink [ buy  Pure  ]

       A few days back I made a post asking for entries for a listeners' choice post, where you guys out there get to pick what you want to showcase on Radio KRUD - here's the results!    urlLink "Cool Waves" - Spiritualized    urlLink [ buy  Ladies & Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space  ]    Garth writes in: "Spiritualized combines indie-style rock with a bit of gospel. It's a testament to their talent and creativity that they make such a seemingly mismatched combination work, and work well. Like Godspeed You! Black Emperor, they like to build up to a climax over the course of a song. The selection here, "Cool Waves", starts off with a simple tune and a spare arrangement, and builds to a powerful finish backed by a choir. It's from their album "Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space", and all-around excellent album. The title track, a sort of fugue built from interlocking vocal parts, is also highly recommended."  (I agree, the song is like a choir + string / wind ensemble + a hint of rock, and it's very relaxing... the song gradually builds up, and then gently lets you back down.)  ---  Next, three songs from Evelyn:   urlLink "Carolina Girls" - Chairmen Of The Board    urlLink [ buy  Beach Music Anthology  ]    Evelyn is a big fan of  urlLink shag (beach) music , and I can fully imagine myself listening to this while crusing down those straightaway roads to the beach. It's rather peppy. It makes me think of somebody taking only half of the E Street Band (the sound isn't as full as in Springsteen's songs) and giving them some Prozac! Either that, or Boz Scaggs' backup band.    urlLink "Come Undone" - Cravin' Melon    urlLink [ buy  Squeeze Me  ]    Since Evelyn is from the Carolinas, she's also decided to provide us with this rocking song from South Carolina band Cravin' Melon. Not that bad of a tune. You can definitely tell they're a southern band by their style.    urlLink "Teenagers, Kick Our Butts" - Dar Williams    urlLink [ buy  End of the Summer  ]    Finally, we have Dar Williams', Evelyn's favorite singer/songwriter, performing "Teenagers, Kick Our Butts". "She's been compared to Joni Mitchell and the like," says Evelyn - I'll have to take her word for it, as I haven't heard Joni Mitchell, at least not knowingly. :(  ---    urlLink "Sing, Sing, Sing" - Barrage    urlLink [ official site ]    For the final submission, Todd brings us this track by Canadian group Barrage: "I changed my mind at least 3 times about which track to submit.  I love the whole album, and it's difficult to get an idea of Barrage's show from just one track.  But since I was a jazz band member in high school, this song gets a tiny boost over the rest. A violin version of a swing classic? Fantastic."  Oh. My. God. Big band jazz meets string ensemble. My jaw dropped when I started to hear this for the first time - I started listening before really reading the blurb Todd wrote, and when I heard the violins I was spellbound. If they ever come by this way on tour or something, I definitely need to see  urlLink their show  if the rest of their material is anywhere near that. Wow. That makes me think of  urlLink T-Tauri , whose cover of  urlLink The Saber Dance  I downloaded back in the day off of mp3.com before the site changed ownership, except this isn't as rock-oriented as T-Tauri is.  ---  Well, that's that for today - if you've ever got something you just want to share, feel free to  urlLink send it my way  along with a quick blurb about the song if you'd like! Thanks to our submitters for this round - you've all got good taste in music. :D

       Another Krud Cred spotting!    urlLink "Tänne asti lukeneille palkkiona linkki Radio KRUD iin, josta löytyy maailman ehdottomasti ärsyttävin instrumentaalikappale (jos hyviä lottokappaleita ei lasketa) - Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass: "The Spanish Flea". Yeah, baby."    And here I was thinking that I'd be the only one to ever say "yeah baby" to Herb Alpert (besides Mrs. Herb Alpert, of course)! If anyone's able to translate that page, kindly do so in the comments if possible - I'd be interested in hearing what was said! :D  Continuing on with the international flavor brought to us by the last two KRUD Creds, here is some russian techno. I've got no idea about the details, but back in the heyday of Napster and free  love  filesharing, I thought to myself, "Self, you should search for the most random thing you can think of. Now what's the most random thing you can think of? ... I know! Russian techno!" At the very least it gave me some very random songs full of tetris playing and cursing, but this here being a family-oriented musicblog I'm not going to publish them - if you email me nicely then maybe I'll send it to you, haha. After I found these songs, I listened to them a few times, but the novelty soon wore off so I burnt them to a cd and they were forgotten until now!    Russian Techno    Also, I'd like to especially highlight this mashup, it's very addictive to listen to. Picture this:    "Toxic Shack" - Britney Spears + The B 52s    urlLink [ more mashups by the same author ]     ---  Quick linkage before I sign off the air: check out   urlLink Radio CRMW   - they've got a pretty good 3-person musicblog going on over there, much like your favorite Radio KRUD!

        Tommorrow's my birthday, but we're going out and celebrating today, since Saturdays are the funnest. I'm also going to be posting extremely Megsian songs for the next few days. And I'm starting at the beginning.  The reason I love this musicblogging concept is because I like this personal style of music sharing. My friends and I in high school were mix tape fiends, forever making them and passing them around. It made sense, because CDs were expensive and we all loved music. I owe those friends my affection for Frank Zappa, The Who, Peter Gabriel era Genesis, and much much more.  But these mix tapes ended up getting me my first boyfriend. This charming young lad made the grave mistake of putting together a very special mix tape just for me, and put Crosby, Stills & Nash's  Guinnevere  on it. Now, me having green eyes and golden hair, I thought the song was meant for  me . This may have been correct, or I could have just been indulging in typical self-centric teenager behavior. Anyway, the end result was that I thought he liked me, so I liked him, and he ended up liking me. And then dumping me 6 months later for (wait for it) a  man .  First breakups are always harsh, so I'm lucky that I had something so utterly amusing to dwell on to keep me from becoming embittered. (We were still good friends for the rest of high school). My little sister and I even made up alternate words to Dion's  Runaround Sue  to further push the hilarity. Our version is  Runaround STUE , with lines like "He took my love then ran around / with every single guy in town" and "Now people let me put you wise / Stue goes out with other guys!"  I mean, at least it wasn't  urlLink  Teenager in Love  . OOOooh oooh, wah-oooh!    Crosby, Stills & Nash - Guinnevere	4:39     urlLink [buy Crosby, Stills & Nash]      Dion and the Belmonts - Runaround Sue	2:44     urlLink [buy The Best of Dion]

      I just did a quick search on "Radio KRUD" to see where we've been mentioned, and found this:   urlLink  "Radio Krud is een nieuwe mp3blog die goed begint met Frank Zappa en het fantastische Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra."    My best guess at a translation: "Radio Krud is a new mp3blog with good beginnings with Frank Zappa and the fantastic Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra."  That gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling on the inside, hehehe... :D  Ok, I now return you to whatever in the world you were doing before I interrupted...

       Only one submission so far for the  urlLink Radio KRUD public access weekend  - guess nobody has any songs they'd like others to hear (hint: this is a great opportunity for people who have their own bands to promote their own songs!). Don't make me threaten to have a pledge drive! :P  Anyway, here's some songs that my friends would say that I'm famous for, since I seem to play them rather often...  I remember hearing "The Spanish Flea" for the first time when I saw the  urlLink Mr. Nice flash animation  - my dad saw it and said "Oh! That's Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass playing!" I hadn't heard of Herb Alpert before then, and ever since I've been driving my friends nuts with  urlLink different   urlLink versions  of The Spanish Flea...     "The Spanish Flea" - Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass    urlLink [ buy  Definitive Hits  ]     (I have to say, though, that of the 8375+ songs in my iTunes library, the version by  urlLink Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66  is at the very top based on number of times each song has been played. 53 times! Yes, I really think that song is That Catchy.)  Next is a Herb Alpert mashup (if you didn't know, a mashup is when someone takes usually the lyrics from one song and "mashes" it with the tune from another, kind of like DJ Dangermouse's mix of  urlLink The Grey Album ), using "Whipped Cream" by Herb Alpert + "By The Time I Get To Arizona" by Public Enemy. Who knows where I got this one, but after listening to it too many times now, whenever I hear the actual song "Whipped Cream" I start to wonder what happened to the lyrics.    "By The Time I Get To Arizona" (Herb Alpert / Public Enemy mashup)

       What a coincidence! I've been busy and it's MY birthday, too! Actually, mine isn't until this weekend, but Glenn and I do share the  awesomest month to get born in .  So in honor of us both, the ONLY BIRTHDAY SONG I HAVE. GASP. OK, only birthday song I have on CD that I can rip up mp3 style.    The Monkees - Happy Birthday To You    [If your name is Michael, get this ESPECIALLY.]   For  my  birthday, I'm going to be self-indulgent, to contrast with Glenn's hobbit style party. Heh. So I'll be posting ME songs for the next few days. I have quite the collection, oddly enough.

       Been busy the past few days, and still going to be busy for the next few, and yesterday was my birthday (yay 22 years old!), so yeah, it's been busy all around, hahaha...  Don't fear, though, because I'm here to bring you a quick song to liven up this boring period of no updates from me! I originally found this song online and downloaded it on a whim - I'm kind of a sucker for foreign songs (especially ones from Brazil - we'll have more of those later), so when I saw this song I just wanted to hear it. I didn't give it a proper listen until today while cleaning my room it just came up in my playlist. It's not that bad, but I don't know where it's from, haha.    "Diabo No Corpo ("Devil in the Body") (feat Lenine)" - Pedro Abrunhosa    I haven't found anywhere to buy the cd yet, though. Shucks...  ---  As my birthday gift to you, I'm going to have a listeners' choice day here at Radio KRUD! I was thinking of this last week but never got a chance to post it (otherwise listeners' choice day would have been yesterday on my birthday, haha). Here's the details - you've got until this Saturday to  urlLink email  any mp3s you have or song names (and if I can get a hold of the song to post then I'll post it), along with a short blurb about each, and then this Sunday or Monday (depends when I get finished compiling it up) I'm going to be opening up the Radio KRUD station to you! I'll try to fit in as many songs as I can (webspace allowing), and depending how many submissions we get I may only get to do one from each listener, but (space allowing) I'll do as many as I can. Just think of it as getting your own musicblog for a day with none of the commitment, or better yet, public access day at Radio KRUD! :D  So what are you waiting for? Send me your favorites! Depending on response I might even make this some sort of semi-regular occurence.
