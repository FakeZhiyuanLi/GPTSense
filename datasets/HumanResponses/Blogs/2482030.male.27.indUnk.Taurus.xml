      So here I go again,  My second blog, although this one is more about my writing than my other blog  urlLink double chocolate  which is the best 'whats cool' blog you're ever likely to come across, or  urlLink fwbo news  which I occaisionally contribute to.  God knows how you found this thing, but if you did, drop me a comment and watch this space.

      Mairtin became SUKAVI "a good poet" (private preceptor was Surata)  John became SHANTISTHANA (Shaantisthaana) "he who stands firmly in peace or he who builds a place of peace" (private preceptor was Vajragupta)  Mark became CANDRASURYAPRADIPA (Candrasuuryapradiipa) "THE RADIANCE OF THE MOON AND SUN" (private preceptor was Ashvajit) Talk about a long name! Apparantly Ashvajit suggests that Candrasuryapradipa can abbreviate his name to Candrasurya.   Tony became DAYAKA (Dayaaka) "he who has kindness" (private preceptor was Padmavajra)

      Sangharakshita is feeling well enough to work on books which are emerging from editing of his seminars. Two books are in production at the moment. The seminar on the metta sutta, and three seminars on the Songs of Milarepa. Working title for the metta book is "Living with Love", but Pabodhana says they'd like to hear if you have a better one. Windhorse have recently made a £10k donation to the spoken word project.

      A new enhanced cd-rom of almost all of Sangharakshita’s public lectures and selected seminars is available for a limited time for just 40 pounds in British currency. To order online go to  urlLink www.dharmatranscripts.com .  Due to the increased costs of producing transcripts of unedited seminars, vast increases in postage costs, combined with being unable to find sufficient funds to keep the project subsidised, as well as the need to replace a 6,000 UK Pounds photocopier, I have, regretfully decided that the Transcriptions Project will cease the copying and distribution of paper copies of seminars and lecture series by the end of this year and move over to being a totally digital (i.e. computer based) service. If you wish to receive any copies of seminars or lectures on paper please place your order as soon as you can, and by the end of of August at the latest. I will continue to make all of the material available on CD-ROM for you to print out as you wish. Please place your final order before the end of August as I will not have the photocopier after September.  Thank you for reading all of this. I look forward to being of service to you.  With my very best wishes in the Dharma,  Dharmachari Silabhadra.

      I can't believe this, I stumbled upon a Guardian story (from May of this year) which links to FWBO.org, and to LBC.org.uk actually, and this is the amazing part, actually recommending them as places to go and learn meditation! Wonders will never cease.  urlLink Guardian

      Our humble little centre (but with a growing downloads page) was mentioned live on air when I was sourcing music by a wonderful artist called Nina Nastasia whose songs about love and loss resonated particularly with me. Ahh, well, 15 seconds of airtime fame!  from Chris Dooks, Webmaster,  urlLink Edinburgh Buddhist Centre
