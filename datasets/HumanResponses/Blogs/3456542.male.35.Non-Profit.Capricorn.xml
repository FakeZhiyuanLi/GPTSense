      Yesterday, David and I watched some of  TV Revolution  on Bravo.   TV Revolution  is a four part series that shows how the cultural revolution shaped television and how television shaped the cultural revolution.  It was actually quite interesting and I wish that Bravo would take a tip from other networks that will run their specials about 800 times before taking them off the air because I missed some of it and I'm bitter as all hell.  Anyway, we were particularly interested in the episode entitled "Black & White & Living Color," which looks at the history of people of color images on television and the roles that broke the stereotype molds.  Asian Americans are few and far between on television and media visibility for Asian Americans is definitely one of the interests that David and I share in common.  David is Chinese American and sees first hand the challenges of breaking into theater and the limited roles offered to Asian American actors.  I am a media junkie who once worked for a media advocacy organization trying to raise visibility of people of color.    While less than perfect, at least there are shows that cater to both African American and Latino audiences.  For African Americans, television has seen shows as diverse as  The Cosby Show ,  Roc ,  Living Single  and  Soul Food .  Recently, the Latino community has been able to enjoy shows such as  Ressurection Boulevard  and  The George Lopez Show .  But, for Asian Americans, there are no such shows.    Part of this, I think, is the lack of true cohesion as a movement and a  Pan-Asian  community.  Oh, it has gotten better.  We do have Pan-Asian organizations working toward our civil rights and younger Asian Americans understand the importance of claiming both ethnic  and  racial pride, but, at the same time, the history of Asian  America  (with no "ns" at the end) is relatively young.  I'm not denying our rich history.  Asian Americans have made great contributions to our country since the 1700s when Filipinos formed a small settlement in what is now Louisiana.  But, because of arcane laws that prevented and retarded Asian immigration to this country until almost the 1960s, the bulk of the Asian population in this country is still very much immigrant.  To many, including my own parents who have lived here since 1967, their homeland is their home and their ethnic pride is much more important that being a racial community.  Diverse languages and cultural values still impede our cohesion as a community.  This was part of the death of  urlLink Margaret Cho 's  All American Girl  back in the early 90s.  This was the first television sitcom to center around an Asian American family and was, unfortunately, cancelled after a few episodes.  Aside from the fact that the writing was flat and not reflective of Cho's style, the show was just not supported by Asian Americans.  One one hand, you had other ethnic groups that did not relate to a show about a Korean American family.  As one of my relatives put it, "What do I know about Koreans?  I'm Filipino."         On the other hand, you had Korean Americans lambasting the show because it was not Korean enough.  They criticized bringing in Chinese and Japanese American actors to play Korean American parts.  Now, I'm all for cultural sensitivity, but I do think that some things have to be overlooked in order for studio executives to feel comfortable enough to take risks and create visibility.  If a studio exec only gets negative comments, they'll shy away from more projects like that for a long time.   But, the onus should not really be placed on Asian Americans themselves.  Of course, the television networks themselves need to take responsibility.  For the 2003/2004 season, the Asian American Media Coaltion put out a  urlLink report card  of television network diversity for Asian Americans and, not surprisingly, the scores were appalling.  From actors to the executives, four major networks (ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC) failed to make the grade.  Studios and television production companies often lack the imagination on how to cast an Asian American.  Much of this has to do with the fact that society, on the whole, still tends to view us as outsiders...as foreigners.  I don't know how many times people have either asked me where I'm from or where I was born and expect me to say I was born in the middle of the Banaue Rice Terraces in the mountains of Luzon, Philippines.  When I tell them, though, that I was born in Decatur, Illinois, it's always followed with, "No, really" or "I mean 'originally.'"  But, because of this, studios always feel they need to connect every single character of Asian heritage to Asia in some way or there is inevitably some kind of  West Side Story -like Asians and non-Asians don't mix.  A good example of this was last year when ABC's famed soap opera  All My Children  introduced the Chinese American characters of Henry ( urlLink Ivan Shaw ) and Regina (Lynn Chen).  Henry, whose parents, of course, owned or worked in a Chinese restaurant and only spoke Chinese, was in a romantic relationship with a white girl named Maggie.  Regina gave him hell because she felt Asians and white people shouldn't mix and, at the same time, Henry couldn't tell his parents about his relationship because she was not Chinese.  Now that, America, is groundbreaking...NOT!  There is part of me, though, that would watch  All My Children  to the bitter end even if it continued a storyline with Henry, who eventually becomes a math wizard and computer genius (simultaneously), getting involved with a Yakuza clan (because Japanese...Chinese...same thing) and having to rescue Maggie from a band of Ninja on top of the Great Wall of China.  Why would I do this, you ask?  For the same reasons why I voted Jasmine Trias all the way to the bitter end of  American Idol  -- I CRAVE images of Asian Americans, particularly on television.  I was weened on television and, let me tell you, the only Asian Americans I saw were Mrs. Livingston on  The Courtship of Eddie's Father , the Asians on  M*A*S*H*  and the supporting cast of  Hawaii Five-O .  Mrs. Livingston, of course, was the prototypical polite and subservient Asian woman, the Asians on  M*A*S*H*  were either the enemy or the source of humor and the supporting cast of  Hawaii Five-O  were back-up to white heroes in a state where the majority of the people are Asian American.  In all seriousness, though, not being able to see images of myself in the medium that I spent much of my time watching did play a part in my self-esteem and my inability to feel a connection with other Asian Americans.  I never saw us so we couldn't possibly be cool.  So, I spent most of my time trying to be white -- what I thought was normal (because I saw them all the time on television).  So, while I would ultimately love to see Asian Americans be fully woven into the fictional fabric of television land, I know that I'd take anything right now...and that, my friends, is sad.  I even remember watching the 2000 remake of  Satan's School for Girls  and screaming outloud, "Oh, my god!  I see a Filipina!"  Unfortunately, three minutes later, she became the film's first casualty.  But, I constantly find myself looking for our images.  Maybe this is why I tend to watch more "reality" television nowadays.  While fictional shows tend to continue the trend of primarily white casts (although you are seeing more African Americans and Latinos), I have actually seen Asian Americans on reality television.  On  The Real World  on MTV, we've seen Pam (San Francisco), Ruthie (Hawaii), Janet (Seattle), Melissa (New Orleans), Christina (Paris), and Jaimie (San Diego) (although, God, please...let there be an actual Asian American MAN on the seasons to come).  On CBS's  Big Brother , we saw Curtis almost win in season 1 and Jun actually win in season 4.  On the ever popular  Survivor , also on CBS, Dan ( Survivor: Amazon ) breaks stereotypes by showing off his hot bod but revealing not so much upstairs and Shii-Ann tries for a million not once, but twice ( Survivor: Thailand  and  Survivor: All-Stars .  As more and more fictional television is sacrificed to the new reality invaders, maybe this growing number of Asian American reality players is not such a bad thing.  The important thing, though, is that Asian Americans need to continually support Asian American images whether fiction or "reality."  We must let the networks know how we feel about these characters, but offer constructive (and not destructive) criticism.  We need to support the efforts of groups such as  urlLink Media Action Network for Asian Americans ,  urlLink Asian Media Watchdog  and the Asian American Media Coalition who are workng with studio executives to ensure greater visibility.  Maybe then, we'll truly see integrated fully Asian American characters on television.   6 regular Asian American TV Characters I Love       1.  Hikaru Sulu/Mr. Sulu ( Star Trek: The Original Series )    Star Trek  in all its incarnations has always had an Asian American as part of its cast, but it all started out with Hikaru Sulu (played by  urlLink George Takei ).   Star Trek: The Original Series  was groundbreaking in and of itself for including such a diverse cast of regular characters.  The series first aired when the media seemed to be manipulating images of Asians as villains (the country had just be to war with Korea and was set to go to war with Vietnam). Sulu was the anti-villain, coming across as a strong leader and team player.  While other Asian Americans would become part of the  Star Trek  universe -- Keiko O'Brien ( Star Trek: The Next Generation  and  Star Trek: Deep Space 9 ), Harry Kim ( Star Trek: Voyager ) and Hoshi Sato ( Star Trek: Enterprise ) -- we will always remember Mr. Sulu for helping lead the way.    2.  Margaret Kim ( All American Girl )   Based on the comedy act of Margaret Cho,  All American Girl  remains the only sitcom in television history to center around an Asian American family.  Margaret Kim was the character played by Cho and, for once, Asian Americans saw an image of themselves.  Many of us understood what it was like to feel both the generation AND culture gap.  While the show's writing was not on par with Cho's actual stand up act, Margaret Kim and  All American Girl  will always remain an important part in Asian American history on television.    3.  The Souphanousinphones ( King of the Hill )   It's always a mixed bag when you bring in people of Asian descent on to an animated show.  Everything is a little bit more caricatured and they can come up more offensive than not.  But, I have to commend the creative staff of  King of the Hill  for introducing the characters of Kahn, Minh and "Connie" Souphanousinphone, the Lao neighbors of the Hills.  It's impressive to me that the creative team chose Lao above other Asian ethnicities, especially since Texas (where the show is set) has the second largest Lao poulation in the country.  And, rather than just being a source of humor, the Soupanousinphones also expose the reaction by most non-Asians to think Asians are one big groups of the same people.      4.  Trudy Sloane ( The Single Guy )   While  urlLink Ming-Na  is better known for her role as Dr. Jing-Mei "Deb" Chen on  E.R. , I actually liked her character of Trudy Sloane on  The Single Guy .  The show itself was mediocre at best, but it was also the first show (to my knowledge) that cast an Asian American in a role that didn't need to be Asian American.  She was a part of the cast without bringing in flashing references to Asia, Feng-Shui, Martial Arts or Zen.       5.  Vern Limosa ( Some of My Best Friends )    Some of My Best Friends  was based on the popular gay-themed film  Kiss Me, Guido .  When CBS first picked up the option, it originally considered casting a white actor in the role of Vern.  After all, the actors in the movie were pretty much white.  But, after discussion with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, the role was recast for openly gay Filipino American actor Alec Mapa.  Because of this, I love this character.  I remember thinking to myself, "Openly gay and Filipino American? This is about as close to representing me as I've ever come."      6.  Lane Kim ( Gilmore Girls )   Based on  Gilmore Girls  producer Helen Pai, Lane Kim (played by Keiko Agena) is actually wonderfully written.  She is the best friend of main character Rory.  She was specifically written to be Asian American and often has to deal with the cultural gap of living in a small town filled with white people and being responsible to a strict Korean American mother.

         I Netflixed  The Hunchback of Notre Dame  because I had been jonesing for movies with music written by Steven Schwartz.  I always remembered liking this movie and watching it again only reaffirmed my feelings.  The movie actually got good reviews from critics, but audiences were not so warm to the film because it veered so much from the Disney formula that people grew to love.  This film was less about talking mice and princesses and more about a dark and sophisticated tale about inner demons and what makes a monster and what makes a man.  Quasimodo, the story's deformed, hunchbacked hero voiced by Tom Hulce ( Amadeus ), dreams of being able to walk outside of the walls of Notre Dame rather than being trapped amongst its "parapets of stone."  He manages to escape for a little bit and is humiliated by the townsfolk, only to be rescued by the gypsy Esmeralda, voiced by Demi Moore ( G.I. Hane ).  Frollo, the film's villian, masterfully voiced by veteran voice actor Tony Jay, is a man who's let power go to his head.  He has two things on his mind -- the destruction of the gypsies (who he considers as inferior vermin) and the seduction of Esmeralda.  Quasimodo develops a crush on Esmeralda, but it is more out of innocence.  He's touched that she does not cower in fear from his hideous looks.  Frollo, on the other hand, knows he has a sexual attraction for her, but thinks his feelings are sinful.  Since he cannot have Esmeralda, nobody can.  The film was helmed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, the creative team that brought us  Beauty & The Beast .  Like  Beauty , the story is told in grand theatrical style with Broadwayesque songs set against a beautiful French backdrop.  Unlike  Beauty , the use of CGI and special effects animation has been improved tenfold and the feel of the film is ultimately much more geared toward adults.  Quasimodo is much warmer than we have seen him in any other film version of  Hunchback  and is guided by three wisecracking gargoyles named Victor (voiced by  Murphy Brown 's Charles Kimbrough),  Hugo (voiced by  Seinfeld 's Jason Alexander) and Laverne (voiced by veteran character actress Mary Wickes) who provide laughs and gags.  Other than that, the film is a direct departure from classic Disnefication.  Many people criticized  Hunchback  for not having hummable tunes that we want to sing forever.  But, I love the music of the film.  I might go as far as to say that it is my favorite Stephen Schwartz music and, aside from  Pocohontas , the only good music Alan Menken has produced since the unfortunate demise of his writing partner Howard Ashman.  Sure, I doubt we'll be teaching "Hellfire," a dark song about sexual repression, to our children for the school pagent, but the songs are integral to the story and marvelously contstructed, inspired by Latin mass and Gregorian chant.  If you can get over the fact that these aren't classic Disney songs, give it a chance and listen to the lyrics, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Consider these lyrics to "Hellfire:"   Protect me, Maria Don't let this siren cast her spell Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone Destroy Esmeralda And let her taste the fires of hell Or else let her be mine and mine alone   While I was in school, there always seemed to be a discussion about which Disney villain was the most evil.  Many people argued Cruella De Ville ( 101 Dalmatians ) because she wanted to skin dogs so that she could have a coat or Maleficent ( Sleeping Beauty ) because she tried to punish Aurora with death because she was left off an invitation list.  But, franky, I think Frollo is the most evil.  Not only did he kill Quasimodo's mother, but he was going to burn an entire family alive.  Now, that's evil.  Frollo was originally a religious leader in the Victor Hugo novel, but Disney was afraid that by making a religious leader that evil would only enrage the Religious Right.  So, Frollo was made into a judge.  The Deacon was added to point out to the audience that religious leaders are good people.  At the same time, people could understand how a government official could be corrupt.  Literature purists slammed the film for veering so much from Victor Hugo's novel on which the Disney film is based.  But, this should be expected.  Disney has a history of "Disnefying" their adaptations, starting with  Snow White & The Seven Dwarves .  The Grimm Brothers fairytales were always much darker than one would imagine.  Even Hans Christian Andersen's "The Little Mermaid" was changed to accomodate a happy ending -- the original tale ends with the mermaid dying and becoming flotsam in the sea.  So, to criticize a Disney film for being too Disney is a little unfair.  As for the DVD, it is light on extras...not like the two disc sets that have been coming out.  But, if you do rent the DVD, keep it long enough to watch "The Making Of..." featurette and listen to the audio commentary with Kirk, Trousdale and producer Don Hahn.  They delight in telling you some of the inside gags, including a satellite dish in one layout, Belle (from  Beauty ) walking through one scene and the ever popular homage to  The Wizard of Oz .  I give this film  TWO THUMBS UP, FOUR STARS AND A FRESH TOMATO .  But, if you don't like my review, you can go to  urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/TheHunchbackofNotreDame-1073037/ .

       IRAQIS HASH IT OUT OVER PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES  One of the key questions on everybody's minds (at least, those who wonder how we're going to get ourselves out of the nightmare we have come to know and love as the occupation of Iraq) is who will succeed Saddam Hussein as President of Iraq.  Last week, Iyad Allawi (a Shi'ite Muslim with links to the CIA) was named Prime Minister.  Now, the 23 member Iraqi Governing Council are arguing over the Presidential spot.  It boils down to two candidates -- Adnan Pachachi, a political veteran in Iraq, and Ghazi Yawar, a civil engineer and political newbee in Iraq (both Sunni Muslims).  To add to the melee, U.S. administrator Paul Bremer and U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi want to throw in a third candidate to help end the stalemate.  At the same time, the Kurds had hoped to have a Presidential candidate, but it looks like they'll be getting top Cabinet positions instead.  In the meantime, growing violence from guerillas and militia threaten the safety of the elections.    SOURCE:  Reuters, May 30, 2004    Well, after this, I'm thoroughly convinced that we're ready to hand over full sovereignty to the people of Iraq on June 30...NOT.  In my head, I'm imagining a scene from  The Day After Tomorrow  when Dennis Quaid tells the President and his top Cabinet and military advisers that the U.S. is basically screwed.  Oh, how I'd love to be a fly on the windmills of President Bush's mind right now.  Handing Iraq full sovereignty on June 30 will probably be as clever a prospect as when Western Civilization forced waring tribes in the Middle East into imposed borders.  And we wonder why Arabs are so angry with the United States...     MICHIGAN REVISITS ABORTION BAN LEGISLATION  In an effort to define when a person is legally born, Michigan anti-choice groups led by Right to Life of Michigan filed a petition to send abortion ban legislation back to the State Legislature.  The petition defines legally born as the moment "any part of a fetus is expelled from a woman's body."  While the Republican controlled State Legislature passed an abortion ban last year, Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D) vetoed it due to lack of health and life exemptions for women.  In Michigan, 254,206 signatures must be gathered in order for a piece of legislation to be handed back to the Legislature for a vote -- Anti-choice groups gathered 446,500.  The Board of State Canvassers unanimously approved the petitioners and, now, the bill goes to the State Legislature for a vote.  Once the Legislature has voted, it will  not  need the signature of the governor.  If the Legislature chooses not to vote, it goes on the November 2 ballot.    SOURCE:  Associated Press, May 28, 2004    Sadly, anti-choice groups have gotten more sophisticated in their wording.  The latest term -- the so-called "Partial Birth Abortion" -- is a fabricated term meant to make swing voters feel really uncomfortable.  If somebody was to ask you if you were against "partial birth abortion," you'd probably say, "Of course."  But, the truth of the matter is that most Americans have no idea why some women have abortions in their second and third trimester.  Anti-choice groups say they are simply trying to end late term abortions which they describe as unnecessary.  They don't mention that abortion is already illegal in the third trimester unless there are threats to a woman's life and health.  This is part of an orchestrated plan to eliminate  Roe v. Wade , the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that gave women the right to have abortions.  Make no mistake about it.     MTV TO LAUNCH GAY CABLE NETWORK  Cable television behemoth MTV has announced the launch of a gay themed network called LOGO.  Hoping to capitalize off the successes of shows such as  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy ,  Queer As Folk  and  Will & Grace , LOGO will start airing a mixture of acquired and original programming in February 2005.  Said Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Executive Director Joan M. Garry, "This channel has enormous potential -- and who better to make the investment than the network that has brought us  The Real World ?  MTV has the two main ingredients necessary for success:  a solid programming track record and an unwavering commitment to our stories, our issues and our lives." For more information, go to LOGO's Web site at  urlLink http://www.logo-tv.com      SOURCE:   urlLink thecelebritycafe.com , May 29, 2004 GLAAD Press Release, May 25, 2004    I start my commentary with a quote from Jack Klugman, who played the slob sportswriter Oscar Madison in the hit sitcom  The Odd Couple :  "The Network was concerned people thought Oscar and Felix were gay...The irony, of course, is that today you can't have a hit show without a gay character."  I'm very excited about a gay cable network being launched and, if any company were going to do it, I'm glad that it's MTV.  When several networks first bandied about creating a gay network, I cringed at what the gay community would end up looking like.  While Bravo, NBC and Showtime have had successful programming, the diversity of the community is sadly not represented.   Will & Grace  - all white.   Queer As Folk  - all white.   Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  -- all white.  I'm sorry, Jai, you may be Latino, but on the show, you come off as white as they come.  MTV has successfully integrated lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people of color into the fabric of their programming, whether it be Latino Pedro Zamora, the Asian Pacific Islander Ruthie or the African American Aneesa in its  The Real World  series or a gay Filipino American in its  True Life: I'm Coming Out  special.    The big test will be in the programming and if it will attract a larger audience than just the gay community.  Let's cross our fingers that it does.     POLL SHOWS CATHOLICS DISAPPROVE OF DENYING COMMUNION TO POLITICIANS SUPPORTING ABORTION  A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, CT of 1,160 registered voters, including 307 Catholic voters, showed that Americans (65%-21%) disapprove of Catholic Bishops's statements saying they would deny Presidential Candidate John Kerry communion because of his stance on abortion.  Amongst Catholics, the ratio was 65%-26%.  It also shows that Americans (79%-11%) believe that it is wrong that Catholic clergy deny communion for those who support abortion.  Amongst Catholics, the ratio was 80%-12%.  68% of both voters and Catholics believe that a public officials' religious beliefs should be private and not public.    SOURCE:   The Miami Herald , May 30, 2004    I'm mystified by the whole issue of being denied communion if you support abortion rights.  Personally, if somebody said that they were going to deny my communion, I'd say, "Who the fuck cares?"  And, while not a practicing one, I am, for all intents and purposes, still Catholic.  In other words, I was never excommunicated.  Do they still excommunicate people?  It sounds so Salem Witch Trials to me.  But, frankly, my response to being excommunicated would also be 'Who the fuck cares?"  I do not want to begrudge a person's right to practice religion, but there's something creepy about people from a certain religion controlling free will and beliefs.  Oh, well...this stuff is lost on me.

         David and I went to see  The Day After Tomorrow , a summer blockbuster that environmental activists are embracing.  The film involves global warming triggering the second ice age and sends a sobering message that we must learn to love our environment a little more lest we freeze to death, be swept up by a giant tidal wave or get sucked up in a giant tornado. “To have a major studio release of a movie tackling a serious issue is a terrific opportunity for Americans to start talking about the reality of the problem, what can be done about it and the enormous threat that President Bush is not dealing with,Â” said Peter Schurman,  urlLink Moveon.org ’s executive director.  With that kind of endorsement, I couldn't wait to see the film.  I left the theater with mixed emotions, but I think, overall, I enjoyed it.  The special effects were worth the money, plus, who doesn't love to watch Los Angeles and New York destroyed once in awhile.  It took me back to the jolly olde days of  Volcano  where I saw my office in Los Angeles engulfed with lava.  Seeing your workplace engulfed by lava sometimes puts a song in your heart.  It's not that you really want to see that much destruction in reality...only in your wildest fantasies.  And, all kidding aside, I agree with Schurman.  I think people need to think about the environment moreIncludinging myself.  For a liberal, I have to admit that I'm kind of ambivalent to environmental issues.  Oh, I'm against things such as increased logging and destroying the rain forest, but there's part of me that doesn't mind land getting developed so I don't have to drive as far to go to the mall and I would rather die than carpool.  So, in this case, the movie did make me think.  But, a movie wouldn't be a movie and a blockbuster wouldn't be a blockbuster without some kind of cheesiness.  There were some really "roll your eyes" kind of dialogue in the film, including the evepopularlar "Just tell her how you feel" despite the fact that the world is falling apart outside.  Also, the people tended to be so one dimensional -- Dennis Quaid was so heroic that he would brave subarctic temperatures to save his son; Jake Gyllehhaal seemed to know everything, including out running wolves and the ice age (yes, you heard me -- the ice age!); the Vice President was just a jerk and despite tornados destroying Los Angeles and tidal waves destroying New York, he was going to err on the side of risking people's lives just to be a jerk; the list goes on and on.  While Dennis Quaid, who plays a climatologist working for the government, originally predicts this kind of environmental havoc eventually happening in about 100 years,  The Day After Tomorrow  proves him wrong.  Not 100 years...7 days!  In fact, everything happens really fast in this movie.  Part of this is to highlight how the first ice age seemed to sneak up on everybody -- they cut to a scene where some of our heroes are at the Museum of Natural History and see a woomammothoth that wpreservedred.  It still had food in its mouth indicating that it froze to death in seconds.  This, my friends, is called foreshadowing.  What cracked me up the most is that everything seemed to be SO convenient.  The love interest in the film develops blood poisoning and they needpenicillinlin or she'd die.  As luck would have it, just before the snows came, a giant Russian ship ends up floating through the streets of New York and stops right in front of the library that is protecting our heroes.  The Russian ship, of course, has all kinds of medical supplies and food!  Then, when the eye of the storm hits New York and freezes everything in sight, our heroes are so fast that they are actually able to outrun the ice age coming and even stop it by closing a door.  But, it's these dramatic elements that keep you on the edge of your seat and, in the end, you're happy to know that despite the ice age, civilization will still continue to survive.  Whew!  And, can I just say, it was so nice to see Tamlyn Tomita in a big, mainstream movie again.  I can't think of anything she's been in since  The Joy Luck Club  and that's sad.  When she came on screen, I wanted to jump up and scream, "Waverly!  Waverly!  Waverly Chang!"  I just wish they had her do more.  At first, she's an integral part of the team who come to realize the sky is falling then she disappears for pretty much the rest of the movie.   This movie, I give  ONE THUMB UP, TWO AND A HALF STARS AND A RIPENING TOMATO   But, if you don't like my review, then go to  urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/TheDayAfterTomorrow-1132625/ .

         On Tuesday, the 6th (and penultimate) season of  Buffy The Vampire Slayer  was released on DVD.  Also this week,  TV Guide  named  Buffy  as the 3rd most popular cult television show.  So, in honor of this, this post serves as my tribute to one of the greatest shows in history (especially because I didn't get to do this when the show's series finale aired).  It's easy to dismiss  Buffy The Vampire Slayer  as mindless fluff.  The 1992 movie on which is based was enjoyable...but, nonetheless mindless fluff.  I remember when the show first started, I saw billboards all over Los Angeles and I kept thinking to myself, "Oh, god...how much more lame-o can the WB get.  That network is going to go down the drain quickly."  In fact, the first season I resisted entirely.  Then, the WB made one of the smartest moves it could possibly make.  During the summer, it would run all the episodes of  Buffy The Vampire Slayer  back to back.  With little on TV (this was before the advent of easy-to-produce reality television that now invades our summers), I ended up stopping on the channel and became engrossed.  This was no mere copy of the original movie.  This was something entirely new and special.   Joss Whedon, the creator of both the movie and the television show, and his creative team wrote one of the smartest television shows around.    As one of the shows that launched the WB network,  Buffy  became one of the hotest shows to develop a  Star Trek -like devoted fanbase.  The Buffyverse soon became a major staple in america's modern mythology.  Also, aside from the scores of fan clubs, novels, comic books, toys and internet sites,  Buffy  has even spawned serious books of philosophy and scholarly essays, such as  Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale  and  Fighting The Forces:  What's A Stake In Buffy The Vampire Slayer .  As part of this tribute, I will offer my 10 favorite  Buffy  episodes (I emphasize the words  my favorite ):   Hush   Season: 4  By far, this was my favorite episode during the show's entire run.  It exemplified the pure brilliance of Joss Whedon and the peeps down over at Mutant Enemy (for those not in the know, Mutant Enemy is Whedon's production company).  The story revolved around demonic apparitions called "The Gentlemen" who need to steal seven hearts.  The only thing is that they can be killed by a human voice.  So, they end up stealing all the voices in Sunnydale.  Because of this, most of the episode was done with absolutely no talking -- entirely in pantomime.  What made it even more impressive was that there was a great deal of important information that happened during the episode -- Rielly discovers that Buffy was actually the slayer and, more importantly, Willow discovers that she and Tara have some kind of "bond" between them (a bond that would eventually blossom into a loving relationship).  The Gentlemen were, perhaps, the creepiest of all the demons to appear on the show and the episode had a fantastic blend of drama, comedy and action.  If i could only recommend one episode of  Buffy , this would be it.   Once More With Feeling   Season: 6  If "Hush" was my favorite episode, this would be an easy second.  Again, this episode shows the brllliance of Joss Whedon.  I remember seeing the promos for "Buffy, The Musical" and thinking, "Oh, no...he's lost it."  This from a harcore  Buffy  fan.  But, Whedon not only managed to impress me, he blew me away.  Not only did he write all the music and everyone did their own singing (some better than others), Whedon also manages to weave the episode into the fabric of the overall story arc.  It's not only cannonical, major events occured in this episode -- Giles decides that he needs to stop mentoring Buffy because he doesn't have anything else to offer, Tara discovers that Willow deceived her and feels she needs to break up with Willow AND Buffy reveals that she didn't think she was in hell when she died, but in heaven...and, she resented being brought back.  The songs are done in a variety of styles and, if you listen to the songs closely enough, it's basically a  Buffy  script in lyric form.  Brilliant!   The Body   Season: 5  This, by far, was the most hauntingly beautiful episode of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer .  It is the episode in which Buffy's and Dawn's mom, Joyce, dies.  Whedon had audiences stumped as to what evil spell Joyce was under that was causing her illness...but, in the end, Joyce's death was caused by natural and not  super natural causes.  She died from a brain tumor.  It not only showed a vulnerability to both Buffy and Dawn who saw their mother as an anchor in their lives, but showed depth and humanity for Anya, who traditionally was used for one liners and humor.  Anya, who had been a vengence demon for thousands of years and lived immortal, was suddenly faced with mortality and didn't quite understand it.  A wonderful and chilling episode.   Restless   Season: 4  Generally, the seasons of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  end with some apocalyptic fight with the season's "Big Bad," the enemy that had been making Buffy's life a living hell (quite literally).  But, Season 4 ended with the Scoobies having prophetic dreams of the future.  Some of the dreams were humorous, some were dramatic and some were scary.  My favorite was Willow's stage fright dream and seeing Rielly dressed as a cowboy and Buffy as Lulu.  Whedon is known to write with several plot points in mind that he will include at some point.  Some say that Tara's line, "I'll be back before dawn," was a reference to the coming of Buffy's sister Dawn, who mysteriously appeared in the 5th season.  A fun episode!   Becoming - Part 1 & 2   Season: 2  While I've loved all the Big Bads of the Buffyverse, I think that Angelus was my favorite because he was the most difficult one for Buffy to fight.  I'm not talking about in terms of power, but the fact that Buffy and Angelus' souled counterpart Angel were lovers.  Angel, then known as Angelus, was once one of the most feared vampires in the world.  But, gypsies placed a curse on him, restoring his soul.  Angelus could not kill anymore without feeling remorse, guilt and being haunted by those he killed in the past.  The cruel Angelus then became the kind Angel.  The only thing about the curse was that his soul would disappear if Angel experienced a moment of true happiness.  In Season 2, Angel and Buffy make love and Angelus is reborn.  In "Becoming - Part 1 & 2," Buffy has to make the ultimate decision -- kill the man she once loved or allow Hell to open on Earth.  Buffy knew her responsibility and went to slay Angelus.  At the same time, Willow, then a young witch in the making, with the help of the other Scoobies, performed a spell to restore Angel's soul.  The spell works and Angelus becomes Angel once more.  Unfortunately, it's too late.  The Hell dimension has opened and will bleed into our reality unless Angel dies.  Buffy, in tears over what she must do, asks Angel to close his eyes and then plunges the sword into him.  She saves the universe, but is unable to save the man she loves.  This is, perhaps, some of Sarah Michelle Gellar's finest acting work during the run of the show.     Storyteller   Season: 7  Andrew was one of three nerds who tried to be the Big Bads of Season 6.  After the first few episodes of the 7th season, he was also the only surviving nerd, having escaped the wrath of Evil Willow and being used as an unwitting pawn by The First (Evil), the Big Bad of Season 7.  The Scoobies ended up having to take him in to protect him.  The episode starts off as Andrew tries to video document the Scoobies.  Humorous bits, references and flashbacks pepper the bulk of the episode and it is great to see Tom Lenk (the actor who played Andrew) showcase his comedy skills.  But, then, the episode becomes a little darker and Andrew is forced to confront his past crimes and the demons that haunt him.  While most people thought Andrew was annoying, I actually found him funny.  Perhaps it was all the gay innuendo they built into this character that endeared him to me.  So, I loved the fact that they gave him an episode where we got to see more sides of him.       The Wish   Season: 3  "The Wish" is a classic  Buffy  episode that centers around the "What If?"  At the beginning of the episode, Cordelia is bitter about her breakup with Xander.  She befriends a new girl named Anya who seems to constantly pester her about what she's like to see happen to Xander.  After a bunch of failed attempts, Cordelia admits that she wished Buffy had never come to Sunnydale because that's how she ended up going out with Xander in the first place.  Anya then reveals herself to be the Anyanka, a vengence demon and the patron saint of scorned women.  Cordelia is suddenly swept into an alternate reality where vampires have overrun Sunnydale and Buffy is fighting the good fight in Cleveland.  Giles, one of the few people in Sunnydale fighting the vampire invasion, discovers that Cordelia is not from their reality and that she caused the alternate reality by making a wish to Anyanka.  In the nth hour, he is able to restore things to their natural order, but not before seeing a hell of a fight.  The episode not only introduces the character of Anya, who would eventually become a regular in Season 4, but allows us an opportunity to see Xander and Willow, who    are often portrayed as goofy and socially akward, as suave, but evil, vampires.  Vampire Willow was so popular that they brought her back in another episode.   Tabula Rasa   Season: 6  This is another fun episode!  Tara and Willow get into a fight over Willow's abuse of her magical powers.  Willow ends up casting a memory loss spell, but ends up casting it on everybody she knows.  Everybody wakes up and can't figure out who they are.  There are some really funny bits in here where Spike believes himself to be Randy, the son of Giles, and where Buffy decides to name herself Joan.  While the outcome is sad -- Tara breaks up with Willow -- I remember this as one of the funniest episodes of  Buffy .   This Girl's Year/Who Are You?   Season: 4  We can't have a top 10 list without a Faith episode.  Faith is a vampire slayer who emerged in Season 3 after the demise of Kendra, the vampire slayer who emerged after Buffy "died" at the end of Season 1, in Season 2.  Whew...Confused?  Anyway, she was wildly popular because, unlike Buffy and Kendra, who had a distinct sense of honor, Faith was more of a bad girl.  She put on airs of being confident, but was really the most lost of all.  At the end of Season 3, Faith switched sides and went to work for the Mayor, the season's Big Bad, who she viewed as the father she never had.  Buffy was forced to fight her and Faith ended up in a coma.  In "This Girl's Year/Who Are You?," Faith regains conciousness.  She opens the gift the Mayor left for her, a device that would allow her to switch places with Buffy.  Now, Buffy is Faith and Faith is Buffy.  Sarah Michelle Gellar and Eliza Dukshu (the actress who plays Faith) deliver some wonderful performances, picking up on some of the subtlties that make Buffy Buffy and Faith Faith.     Lies My Parents Told Me   Season: 7  I always loved Spike, the vampire modeled after Sid Vicious introduced in Season 2.  Over the course of the series, he went through many changes.  he entered the series as a villain (Season 2), ends up getting a microchip in his head that prevents him from harming humans (Season 4), develops a crush on Buffy (Season 5), ends up being Buffy's sex toy (Season 6) and then gets his soul back and becomes a general for the Scoobies (Season 7).  Throughout Season 7, Spike is tormented as a consequence of getting his soul back.  He starts doing really strange things and we find out that the First is playing around with him in the guise of both Drusilla and Buffy.  When Spike is guarded and continues to lash out, we learn that there's more than just The First haunting him.  Through magic, he is able to go back in time and realize that what is haunting him is the fact that he turned his mother into a vampire so that she could be with him.  She, in turn, ends up taunting him and, in a rage, he kills his mother.  At the same time, Spike learns that Principal Woods is the son of a previous vampire slayer and that Woods wants his revenge.  The two duke it out and Spike eventually ends up killing all his demons, but sparing Woods.  Buffy learns of what Woods tried to do and sides with Spike, a sign that the vampire who has gone through so much transformation, has earned her trust.  She threatens Woods that the next time he does something like that, she will let Spike kill him.  It's a great moment and a wonderful episode for James Marsters (the actor who plays Spike).  After seven seasons, a hearty length for any series,  Buffy The Vampire Slayer  ended production.  Sarah Michelle Gellar's contract was up and she decided to pursue other acting opportunities.  While  Buffy  is no longer on the air, it is not forgotten.  And, I know, once the right vehicle comes along,  Buffy  will be reborn in some way.  Until then, we leave Buffy...She Saved The World Alot.

          Shrek 2  is the continuing story of Shrek, an ogre, and his new bride Fiona, who we discovered in the first film, is also an ogre.  I was actually a little skeptical about a sequel because I felt the first film was complete.  So, why revisit it?  But, being a sucker for advertising (and, believe me, this film is advertised all over the place -- my favorite placement, I think, is on Nick-At-Nite for a Roseanne marathon), I decided to give the film a try.  I thought I'd go to an early show -- 10 am on a Sunday -- because I thought that there wouldn't be that many people there.  Well, I was wrong...the 10 am film screening was sold out so I had to settle for one screening 15 minutes later.  So, everyone who hasn't seen  Shrek 2  has been asking me, "Is it better than the first?"   Honestly, I couldn't tell you because I can't really remember how much I liked the first.  I know I liked the film...enough for me to be curious enough to see its sequel.  But, in all honesty, I can't say which one I liked more.  All I can say is that I loved  Shrek 2 .  Some people have actually criticized the film for its pop culture references that abound throughout the movie.  Said Sean MacCauley from  The London Times , "The first film created its own wonderfully inverted fairytale world and didn’t let the modern references intrude. The second one puts that world up for rent and then hides behind half-hearted satirical flurries."  This, I can say, is probably the big difference between the first and second films.  I don't recall all the pop culture references in the first film.  But, this is not to say that I didn't enjoy them in the second film.  In fact, I loved the pop references.  One of my favorite gags (without giving away the gag) involves a giant gingerbread man and Farbucks ( Shrek 2 's take off of Starbucks).  Other favorite gags include jabs at the Walt Disney Company which, outside of their Pixar films, has fallen from animation glory.  Consider the latest schlock it's put out --  Brother Bear  and  Home on the Range ?  Please.  I was never a fan of Jeffrey Katzenberg (former Disney executive and now co-owner of Dreamworks which distributes  Shrek ), but congrats to him for getting in such clever digs.  This (thirtysomething) Drama Queen always appreciates bitter revenge.  Anyway, the reason why I don't have a problem with the pop references in this film is because I don't think the  Shrek  franchise was ever meant to be a delightfully innocent tale a la  Snow White ,  Dumbo ,  Beauty & The Beast  or even the recent  Finding Nemo .  It is supposed to be a mad-cap romp within an "inverted fairtale world," more akin to  The Simpsons .  Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots is priceless and the best addition to the film.  He plays a Latin style cat with a Napoleon complex with a love/hate relationship with Eddie Murphy's Donkey.  As skeptical as I am about sequels, I'm even more skeptical about adding side-kicks.  But, the two play well off each other.  Banderas has so much fun with his character that you have to love him.  Another great addition was the film's villain -- the Fairy Godmother -- voiced by the talented Jennifer Saunders of  Absolutely Fabulous  fame.  I always thought that she had a voice suitable for animation and she proves me right here.  Also, she does her own singing in the film and does it well.  Who could not love watching a Fairy Godmother belt out "Holding Out For A Hero" (from  Footloose ).  The best part is that this film is as much for adults as it is for children.  This has been my problem with Disney films lately.  They have been marketed pretty much for children only (I can't imagine an adult who didn't fall asleep during  Brother Bear ...SNORE...I want to fall asleep just thinking of it).  There are even gags in  Shrek 2  that surprised me making it into a film that children are going to see -- but, I'm glad they're there.  So, the thirtysomething dramaometer gives this film   TWO THUMBS UP, 4 STARS AND A FRESH TOMATO  .

       SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR APOLOGIZES FOR REMARKS  South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson (D) apologized for remarks made at a campaign rally comparing the Republicans to the Taliban.  Johnson had said, "'And how sweet it's going to be on June 2 when the Taliban wing of the Republican Party finds out what's happened in South Dakota."  Republicans were furious about the remarks, which they called "repulsive" and "an attack on the character of all Republicans in South Dakota."  Johnson quickly apologized, saying that he was addressing an outside group who had referred to Johnson as a "Saddam Hussein or Osama Bin Laden" during the 2002 election.    Source:   Associated Press, May 27, 2004    Now, I don't really think that name calling is ever good form, but I love how the Republicans get so up in arms.  I don't know how many interviews I saw with Republicans commenting on Johnson's remarks as if Democrats were the only ones capable of insensitve comments.       I mean, please, let's forget about top Bush/Chenney '04 adviser Karen Hughes' insensitive and divissive comments likening pro-choice activists to terrorists on CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer."  In the interview, she said, "I think after September 11, the American people are valuing life more...and I think those are the kind of policies the American people can support, particularly at a time when we're facing an enemy, and really, the fundamental difference between us and the terror network we fight is that we value every life."     To date, she has never really offered a meaningful apology.  So, basically...get over yourselves, Republicans, you can't ask for apologies without making sincere ones yourselves.     ASHCROFT CRITICIZED FOR TERROR WARNING  On May 26, Attorney General John Ashcroft made an alarming statement implying that his Department of Justice had received new information about terrorist plots and warning Americans to be prepared for a major terrorist attack being planned by al Qaeda in the next coming months.  Interestingly enough, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge made a statement afterward saying that, despite the alarming news by the Justice Department, the terror level would remain at yellow instead of being raised to orange.  Members of Congress and some members of the Bush Administration criticized Ashcroft's announcement as "overblown and caused unnecessary public concern."  Some criticized the lack of communication between the U.S. Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security.  While the Department of Justice noted that there was  no  new intelligence on terror attacks, it defended its actions.   Said Mark Corallo, a U.S. Justice Department spokesperson, "It's part of our strategy to defeat the bad guys.  It puts them on edge."     Source:  Associated Press, May 27, 2004 -- posted at 6:13 and 6:31 pm EST    I'm sorry?  It's part of our strategy to defeat the bad guys?  Is the strategy to make terrorists believe that our key governmental offices are still lacking the ability to communicate with each other and send a consistent message?  Is the strategy to panic all Americans?  I don't get the strategy...will somebody please explain it to me?     FAMILY OF SLAIN TRANSGENDER TEEN SEEK POSTHUMOUS NAME CHANGE  The family of Gwen Araujo, a Newark California teen who was brutally murdered in October 2002 for being transgender, are seeking to offficially change Gwen's name on her birth certificate.  Gwen was born Eddie Araujo, but the family had known her as Gwen for years.  After her murder, the media had a difficult time grasping how to report the name of a transgender person who hadn't had their name officially changed.  "The courts serve as a voice for the people of California," Transgender Law Center's Christopher Daley said. "By filing this petition, we gave the people an opportunity to explicitly recognize Gwen as Gwen."  Superior Court Commissioner Thomas Surh called the move a "novel idea" and told Gwen's mother that he'd let her know a decision within a month.    Source:  Associated Press, May 27, 2004    There will not be any humorous commentary here.  I included this because I had once helped with media visibility around this case and saw the challenges with name identification.  I applaud the Araujo family for honoring Gwen in this way.     FOX SHELVES HOMOPHOBIC SHOW  FOX cancelled its plans to run a two-hour reality show entitled (and I kid you not)  Seriously, Dude, I'm Gay .  The show revolves around two straight men who have to convince their families and friends (obviously, through use of offensive stereotypes) that they are gay.  Early press materials for the show described it as "a heterosexual male's worst nightmare: turning gay overnight."  Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Executive Director Joan M. Garry and Entertainment Media Director Stephen Macias refered to the show as "an exercise in systematic humiliation, with contestants referring to the experience as their 'worst nightmare' and complaining that they were 'trapped in gay hell.'"  "This should serve as a model for other networks producing gay-themed programming," Garry said.  "Such programming should be done well -- or it shouldn't be done at all."    Source:  GLAAD Press Release, May 27, 2004    It's okay, straight men, it would really be my worst nightmakre turning straight overnight.  Now, that would be hell to me, having to spit in appropriate places, work on cars and play contact sports where you eventually have to slap your male teammate on the ass.........er.......strike that last part as being hellish.

      Okay, this is a little after the point, but I happened to be surfing the 'Net and saw this article written by openly gay Filipino American director  urlLink Q. Allan Brocka  posted on  urlLink The Advocate's  Website.  I thought it was so funny that it almost had me peeing in my pants.  God, I love funny gay Asian Americans (and, remember...I can say this because I AM a funny gay Asian American).    Whitney Houston, we have a problem    It&#146;s music mogul Clive Davis&#146;s week on  American Idol,  which means it&#146;s really Whitney Houston Week. But will all those power ballads work for Fantasia? Can our flower-addicted columnist resist voting for Jasmine? And who is Diana again?    By Q. Allan Brocka &nbsp;   An Advocate.com exclusive posted May 21, 2004 &nbsp;   DISCLAIMER: No actual Whitney Houstons were used in the writing of this article. &nbsp;    THE PERFORMANCES SHOW   It&#146;s once...twice...three times per lady as the holy trinity perform three songs apiece in a fantastic m&eacute;nage of girl-on-girl-on-girl action. In the grand  American Idol  tradition of celebrity judges, I&#146;ve invited a celebrity commentator to watch the show and yell at my TV screen with me. Ladies and gentlemen, please raise your roofs for the triple threat: vocalist, blacktress, and additional-lyrics writer...Whitney Houston!&nbsp;  Whitney arrives just as that transgender CGI doll marches through the field of American flags. &#147;Bobby and the kid are waiting in the car, so I can only stay a couple days.&#148; She kicks off one shoe and flops on my bed. I turn up the television. A foxy, faux-hawked Ryan Seacrest makes a cheerful entrance in a gray-and-white suit that reminds me of----&nbsp;  Whitney interjects, &#147;Who&#146;s that gay dude? He&#146;s dressed like Rain Man&#146;s brother.&#148; That&#146;s what I was gonna say!&nbsp;  &#147;He&#146;s Ryan Seacrest. And like the guy who played Rain Man&#146;s brother, he&#146;s straight,&#148; I explain.&nbsp;  &#147;Yeah, and I&#146;m really sober this time.&#148; She rolls her eyes.&nbsp;  I smile. &#147;Damn, I was just about to offer you some crack.&#148;&nbsp;  She looks up quickly. &#147;Do you----&#148;&nbsp;  I cut her off. &#147;Just kidding.&#148; Now I&#146;m embarrassed.&nbsp;  She forces a laugh. &#147;I knew that. I was kidding too. That&#146;s what they call me. Margot Kidder. No-crack-doing Margot Kidder.&#148; We share an awkward laugh and turn back to the television.&nbsp;  Ryan introduces the judges and the official celebrity guest, the pop of pop, the man with the golden ears, the mastermind behind Milli Vanilli----Clive Davis. His list of music accomplishments is pretty legendary for a white guy. In a navy blazer and a black shirt? Clash of the Titans! Surely he can afford a gay who isn&#146;t colorblind.&nbsp;  Ryan explains that each girl has three songs tonight: one of her choice, one chosen by a judge, and the third picked by Clive. Whitney whoops for her Svengali. Clive says that there hasn&#146;t been any good pop music for 15 years and  American Idol  is bringing it back. &#147;Have I made an album in the past 15 years?&#148; Whitney asks. &#147;That&#146;s funny, I can&#146;t remember.&#148;&nbsp;  First up, more reviled than the not so Private Lynndie England is Jasmine Trias, with &#147;Saving All My Love for You.&#148; She has a big blue lily pad stuck to her neck and moves like an animatronic doll that should be singing &#147;It&#146;s a Small World.&#148; She sounds really nice, but I&#146;ve never been one to settle for &#147;really nice&#148; (unless it was subversive to do so). There&#146;s Jassy&#146;s hot brother! Damn, he&#146;s young. Illegally so.  Bad libido, bad, bad!  The number&#146;s nearly over when Whitney exclaims, &#147;Oh, my God, I totally know this song!&#148;&nbsp;  The audience goes freaky for Jasmine, and she tells them how much she loves them. Randy rolls his eyes: &#147;You got a lotta love out there.&#148; Go figure. The judges give her a resounding thumbs...neither up nor down. Paula says, &#147;You have to sing as good as Whitney.&#148; Whitney throws her other shoe at the TV: &#147;As  well  as Whitney, illiterate ho!&#148; Clive assures us that Whitney is one of a kind. Whitney echoes, &#147;Yeah, there&#146;ll never be another me!&#148; Simon says she&#146;s like dinner with &#147;Poller&#148; Abdul: a Slim-Fast shake and a laxative.&nbsp;  Fantasia&#146;s next with &#147;Chain of Fools.&#148; I hate it when singers tell me to stand up and clap. Whitney gives me permission to remain seated. Fantasia&#146;s sexy black outfit says &#147;Who&#146;s your Mama?&#148; with straps, buckles, the whole 69 yards. She&#146;s damn good. Who was I kidding? I know I&#146;ve wanted her to win all along. Randy silences the crowd with his patented &#147;All right, so check it out.&#148; I liked Simon going first better. The judges love her. Paula thanks her for celebrating each and every week, then claps her hands like a toddler who went doody in the bowl like a big girl.&nbsp;  Diana DeGarmo&#146;s next with &#147;Ain&#146;t No Mountain High Enough.&#148; There&#146;s a genie in a bottle somewhere missing some pants. And her hair! She&#146;s had an extreme Muppet makeover, transforming from Miss Piggy to Janice the groovy rock Muppet with the lips and that yellow mop yarn for hair. The judges don&#146;t really like her. Simon says she shouted the song.  She always shouts the songs!   That&#146;s how she &#147;makes them her own&#148;!  Sorry, am I shouting? I actually kinda like Diana, except for when she&#146;s laughing. Or forcing a connection with the audience like a pushy telemarketer. Or getting votes. After her dismal showing with the judges De-groovy, De-with-it DeGarmo heads backstage to stab Jasmine.&nbsp;  I wish they&#146;d stop calling this &#147;the battle of the divas.&#148; That implies Jennifer Hudson vs. Fantasia or Brad Pitt vs. Eric Bana. Imagine how flawless tonight would be with Jenny the Hud freaking out every time Clive Davis opened his mouth or touched his golden ear.&nbsp;  Flower Power&#146;s back for another dose of weed killer. This time it&#146;s judge&#146;s choice. Paula has picked &#147;Mr. Melody&#148; for Jasmine because it&#146;s up-tempo and because she&#146;s cruel (or maybe because &#147;Inseparable,&#148; another Natalie Cole song, was Jassy&#146;s only great performance so far).&nbsp;  Jasmine sounds good. Just good. Whitney observes, &#147;She&#146;s too nasal. She needs to loosen up her nose holes.&#148; The graphics behind her look like that gross &#147;Kotex fits. Period&#148; commercial. Natalie Cole is suddenly regretting whatever favor she called to get this song on the roster. The judges aren&#146;t too thrilled. Simon says, &#147;Everyone&#146;s thinking the same thing.&#148; Yeah!  Make her cry and I&#146;ll vote for her again! &nbsp;  Simon picks &#147;A Fool in Love&#148; by Ike and Tina Turner for Fantasia, whose family reproduces exponentially each week. While she looks a bit demonic at the beginning and the canned backup singers are awful, her performance is Fantasia-astic! And look at that clever sign: tasia fan. I don&#146;t get the fantasia texas sign, though. I want to see a sign that says macy gray fans for diana.&nbsp;  Randy says she&#146;s got the spirit of Mary J., the spirit of Aretha--in fact, she&#146;s a regular graveyard. Just look at all those crosses on her neck. Clive says if he saw her in a basement in Kansas he would sign her right away. Whitney adds, &#147;If Clive was with a teenage girl in a basement in Kansas----&#148; then she passes out.&nbsp;  Diana, the triplet of Snellville, is next. I wish they were changing outfits between numbers. I&#146;d rather see her whole leg or no leg at all----that slit skirt makes me feel dirty (with one  r ). Randy picks &#147;Because You Loved Me&#148; and hopes she has the pipes to do it. Whitney suddenly snaps to and reaches for her purse. &#147;How many pipes you need, baby?&#148;&nbsp;  Diana&#146;s sitting on the old John Stevens spittoon. She starts out shaky but gets better. I think it was unfair to stick her with C&eacute;line, especially after her stab at &#147;My Heart Will Go On&#148; prompted them to scold her for picking C&eacute;line. Randy says it was &#147;just a&#146;ight,&#148; his exact words for the last C&eacute;line performance (I checked----it&#146;s only fair to mention that they&#146;re his exact words for anything). The rest of the judges find more creative ways to say &#147;just a&#146;ight.&#148;&nbsp;  Three is the magic number, because Clive picked their songs this round. Hit me, Jasmine, one more (and last?) time with &#147;All by Myself.&#148; A wickedly cruel choice. La Toya ruled with this song early in the season. Now that La Toya&#146;s in la toilet, with Jasmine&#146;s guilty hand on the flusher, Clive wants to make us regret our decision.&nbsp;  Of course Jasmine is not amazing. That was never why I liked her. See, maybe this whole thing will wake something up in the media at large: Asian-Americans are hungry for representation! So much so, we&#146;re willing to vote forward less-talented singers just to see somebody, anybody, on TV who resembles us. Besides, we did the producers a huge favor. Had the final two been La Toya and Fantasia, people wouldn&#146;t be energized either way and it&#146;d be a close vote with the &#147;who cares?&#148; factor of last year&#146;s Clay vs. Ruben results. La Toya needed to get interesting and pit herself against Fantasia. As Whitney put it, &#147;La Toya will make a great diva once she develops a crack habit or finds her Ike Turner.&#148;&nbsp;  Simon dashes Jassy&#146;s hopes with his stern commentary, &#147;It has to end tonight.&#148; Oh, come on, she can beat Diana and then lose to Fantasia, right? I&#146;d be cool with that. But what if, horror of horrors, Diana beats Fantasia too? Jassy would take all the blame. Ergo, I must support Fantasia now. Otherwise, Diana could win and her spirited cackle would ring out eternally. Tee hee. Hee hee. Haw haw!&nbsp;  It&#146;s a Fantasia finale with Clive&#146;s pick, &#147;The Greatest Love of All.&#148; Whitney&#146;s face goes white. &#147;But they picked that for me! That&#146;s my song.&#148; Clive says when he discovered Whitney (in a basement in Kansas?) she was singing this. Whitney shrieks, &#147;We discovered each other! I am not a puppet...puppet...puppet...&#148; A brusque thump on the back clears her up. &#147;Thanks, sweetie. Did she just say &#145;I believe the childrens are the future&#146;? That&#146;s not how it goes!&#148;&nbsp;  The judges are blown away. Clive says, &#147;Wow.&#148; Simon tells her to read the sign behind her: &#147;American Idol.&#148; (Get it?) Didn&#146;t he pull something like that on Josh Gracin? And the baggage handler who was related to the dead president? Fantasia bursts into tears, thus cinching my 200 and some-odd votes. What a great show that was! I love  American Idol! &nbsp;  Ryan interrupts: &#147;We&#146;ve still got one more left?&#148; Everyone looks around----who? He isn&#146;t sure, then it comes to him...Diana DeGarmo! America collectively counts up songs during the commercials. What do you know? He&#146;s right! Here&#146;s Diana, yet again, with Clive&#146;s third power-ballad choice, &#147;Don&#146;t Cry Out Loud.&#148; Randy says he thought it was great, but he doesn&#146;t sound so convinced. Simon tells her to write a letter to Clive thanking him for putting her in the final two. It seems Simon&#146;s big on letter writing----he told Jasmine to write all of Hawaii.&nbsp;  Now it&#146;s over for real, and time to vote. Whitney&#146;s passed out again, so I have to make the decision on my own. I decide to cast a single vote for Jasmine. If Jassy wins by one vote, it will be my claim to notoriety. Then I heat up some JasMinute Rice and dedicate the rest of the precious two hours voting for Fantasia. I call from both my home and cell phones: 88 minutes in, I start getting fewer busy signals; 122 minutes in, I&#146;ve gotten through 287 times (out of over 3,000 attempts). I&#146;ve done my part for Fantasia. I wonder if she&#146;ll ever return the favor. Time to push Whitney over and climb into bed.&nbsp;    THE RESULTS SHOW   Whitney&#146;s gone. Bobby and the car are still idling out front. What&#146;s really on my mind is the fate of Fantasia. The show starts with three clowns standing center stage----wait, those aren&#146;t clowns, it&#146;s the girls! Their Telemundo makeovers make them look like Christmas presents. Maybe they&#146;re gonna do that catchy &#147;Wanna Fanta?&#148; song. Ack, too late. Now it&#146;s stuck in my head. Don&#146;tcha wanna?&nbsp;  Ryan asks if they&#146;ve done enough to move on to the finals. What a loaded question. The Jas-master thinks she&#146;s done plenty. Tasey tells us once more how &#147;crai-zy&#148; she is. Diana gave &#147;400%.&#148; I wonder why she stopped there.&nbsp;  Results? Don&#146;t even think about it. First up is Tamyra Gray, with Whitney&#146;s wig, a golden bib, and a forgettable song she wrote called &#147;Star.&#148; Instead of her robotic pole dance we are, mercifully, treated to a montage of the 70,000 auditions. Are there really 69,987 degrees of talent between William Hung and Leah LaBelle? I cheer for my favorite also-rans: the &#147;Big Girls Rock&#148; girl, Mini-She, Muriel (Lisa Leuschner), and my all-time favorite, &#147;Lipstick Les&#148;Briana (she should&#146;ve made it further!).&nbsp;  If Tamyra&#146;s song didn&#146;t bore you to tears, sitting through &#147;Angels Brought Me Here&#148; made you  beg  for her to come back. No, that&#146;s not an albino Shirley Hemphill singing----it&#146;s the Australian Idol, Guy Sebastian. The accent makes it sound like &#147;Angles brought me hay.&#148; We could mate him with the Olsen twins to create the perfect living troll doll. Was this the only World Idol they could dig up? I want Will Young! Or the Garbage Pail Kid from Norway.&nbsp;  Told ya you&#146;d want Tamyra back. Well, here she is in a lovely purple shower curtain. It&#146;s the same song she sang a few weeks ago, &#147;Raindrops Will Fall.&#148; To commemorate her 100-year anniversary of getting kicked off  Idol,  she&#146;ll finally release a CD next week. Plus, she cowrote &#147;I Believe,&#148; which will be performed by Fantasia....er, the winner at next week&#146;s finale. I wonder if she wrote the word  I  or  believe. &nbsp;  Now each girl gets to go home for a day. I love this part! They can go back to their high schools and say &#147;Enjoy insignificance!&#148; to everyone who ever picked on them. &#147;Oh, you wanna kiss my ass now? Now that I&#146;m on TV? Kiss it! Psych! Get out, fool. This is my pep assembly.&#148;&nbsp;  Jasmine goes to Hawaii and the island erupts. The lieutenant governor (when the actual governor is unable to fulfill...) declares May 13 to be Jasmine Trias Day. If she so chooses, she will rule that place until the day she dies. &#147;Senator Trias&#148; has a great ring to it.&nbsp;  Fantasia takes us to the furniture capital of the world. She shows us the elementary school where she got pregnant. A local factory builds her a couch, whereupon she says, &#147;When I&#146;m rich and famous, I&#146;ll let you guys build all the furniture for all my mansions.&#148; Her family looks like, well, a really fun family. The kind of home you always feel welcome in. Fantasia gets the key to the city and a &#147;special declaration.&#148; I wonder what Chicago would&#146;ve done for Jennifer Hudson----&#147;Here&#146;s a free bus pass&#148;?&nbsp;  Diana&#146;s family is smaller. She and her mom are strong, independent women (part I), a lot like my own family. Snellville makes her acting mayor for the day. Man, does she waste it----girl, the first thing you do is declare martial law! Her school awards her with a letterman jacket, and you can see the resentment of other students who actually earned theirs. Diana&#146;s king-size leopard-print waterbed seems like the perfect place to bury your face in a pillow and cry all night after getting dumped (or losing  American Idol ) .  &nbsp;  The girls are center stage again.  (Don&#146;tcha wanna?)  It&#146;s finally time to have one removed. Jasmine&#146;s already nodding: She&#146;s planning to leave whether she loses or not----Senator Trias is so noble. Ryan makes it official: Jasmine&#146;s 16th minute of fame is over. The girls hug her but don&#146;t cry as much as they ought to. &#147;I love you, Jassy! Friends forever and ever!&#148; Jasmine would like to thank us for embracing her talent. Wait, did that sound snobby?&nbsp;  Guess what, Jasmine, we have a surprise for you!  Really? This is so unexpected!  Yes, we want you to toss the coin to decide which of these two vultures goes first next week! Jasmine holds her smile steady, but her eyes say, &#147;What a #@$*!^&amp; lovely surprise.&#148; Fantasia, being &#147;crai-zy,&#148; hollers &#147;Heads!&#148; Diana passive-aggressively grits her teeth: &#147;Well, I guess I&#146;m tails then.&#148; It&#146;s already begun. Maybe Diana will make a good little diva after all.

         I don't know why I received this e-mail, but I'm glad I did.  It was an e-mail for the upcoming Strawberry Shortcake (yes, the sweet scented doll from the 1980s who was also the hated enemy of the Peculiar Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak) convention.  The theme is:    Strawberry for President!  Lookout George W. because here comes Strawberry!     Does this make Strawberry Shortcake a Democrat?  If she were truly running against Bush, I'd vote for the cute little doll with the strawberry smell.  Also, I can only hope that she chooses Huckleberry Pie for her running mate and NOT that stuck up bitch Lemon Chiffon.

         Last night, 65 million votes were cast throughout the United States to name Fantasia Barrino (left, in photo above) from High Point, North Carolina this year's  American Idol , edging out the young Diana DeGarmo (right) from Snellville, Georgia.  65 million votes, peeps!  If you compare this to the 2000 Presidential elections, this number is incredible.  In  American Idol  land, if each viewer (there was an estimated 25 million viewers) was an American citizen, they would have voted an average of 2.6 times each.  In contrast, the actual 2000 Presidential elections only saw less than half of American citizens make one vote.  Of course, voting is different on  American Idol  than it is in a political election.  In a political election, you cannot vote more than once and you cannot vote by phone.  At the same time, we don't subject the Presidential candidates to brutally frank and honest criticism by Simon Cowell on national television.  But, maybe we should.  Personally, I truly believe that voter turnout would increase ten fold if we made all the Presidential Candidates live in a house and have their lives taped to find out what happens when other Presidential Candidates stop posturing and start getting real.  We could put them through various physical, mental and emotional challenge -- and, to make it interesting, we'd go between more political challenges and talent competions such as karaoke contests (I have this vision of Bush singing Kelis' Milkshake) and having to eat pickled cow intestine.  Personally, I think it would be more interesting to watch Bush and Kerry duke it out on a rolling log than in a political debate.  Then, each week, we vote one of them off.  In the end, we'd be left with our choice for President picked!  Now, that would be reality television!  PS - Congratulations, Fantasia Barrino...I text messaged 20 votes for you last night.

      Alright, all...I'm switching sides.  Thanks to  urlLink Mrs. Betty Bowers , America's Best Christian, I have seen the error of my ways.  Mrs. Bowers runs several ministries, including BASH (Baptists Are Saving Homosexuals), BLAME (Baptist Ladies Accusing Media Entertainers), TRASH (Traditional-families Raging Against Sluts & Homos), BITCH (Bringing Integrity To Christian Homemakers), PRUDES (Patriotic Republicans Unctuously Dressing Erotic Statues) and, of course, Mrs. Betty Bowers' Christian Crack Whore Ministry.  It is through her help that I've learned many things.  For example, I must be blind to it all, but did you know that  urlLink George W. Bush is gay ?  If you are unaware, Mrs. Bowers will  urlLink show you the way .  She has proof!  For example, in a Conversation on Health Care Information Technology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Bush admitted that he was a "girl."  He said:   "Karyn is with us. A West Texas girl, just like me"   You can read it directly from the  urlLink official White House transcript  of the conversation.  Shameless!  You can also learn which  urlLink Right Wing group  is the best for you.  Mrs. Bowers told me I should align myself with the Reverend Lou Sheldon because I can't go more than 15 minutes without thinking of naked men licking each other.  I think I will write Reverend Sheldon and let him know that we are one in the same.  And, what's even better is that you can watch, first hand, the  urlLink sequel  to  The Passion of The Christ .  It looks really exciting and I'm glad that Jesus will not be dying in  this  apocalyspe.  So, all, I say -- REPENT!  Go to  urlLink http://www.bettybowers.com  right now and let her save your soul!  I'm off to her  urlLink gift shop  to buy my " urlLink God Told Me To Hate You " bumper sticker and " urlLink BUSH: 4 more years of month-long vacations " t-shirt!  Ta ta!   And remember, God loves you!

      So, I just got an anonymous note from someone about my criticism of Bush's failed foreign policy in Iraq and the sensless war he declared.  This person wrote:    I hope you enjoy your rights as a US citizen, and that is why you can maintain this site. President Bush may have taken us to war, but if not for his stand against terrorism, who knows what would of spilled upon our shores. Terrorism awarness is at highest level, and the thing about terrorist is that they are scared. They hide behind masks and hide behind their god, which is an act of cowardness. OUR TROOPS ARE THERE TO MAINTAIN PEACE, NOT TO ENFORCE THEIR WILL UPON THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ. MIND YOU WE LIBERATED A NATION, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY.     Now, mind you, I probably won't respond to every anonymous note out there, but since this is my first challenging one, I find it special and will answer it publicly.  Let me pull this puppy apart...    I hope you enjoy your rights as a US citizen    Yes, I do.  I enjoy my rights as a US citizen immensely.  And, yes, I enjoy the fact that the First Amendment protects my right to criticize the Bush Administration.    President Bush may have taken us to war, but if not for his stand against terrorism, who knows what would of spilled upon our shores.    I just have one thing to ask.  If President Bush was  really  so concerned about terror spilling on to our shores, why did he cut back on Homeland Security?  Do you know that we have some borders for miles and miles with only one or two people protecting it?  Just recently, we saw a failure to communicate between the Intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security.  Boy, that makes me feel safe.    Terrorism awarness is at highest level, and the thing about terrorist is that they are scared.    And so are we.  The Bush Administration has seen to it that we continue to feel extremely terrified so that we will support his little coup in Iraq.  We are so terrified that we're willing to overlook things and sign away the freedoms you talked about in your first sentence.    They hide behind masks and hide behind their god, which is an act of cowardness.    This is, perhaps, the only sentence I agree with...and, only kinda sorta.  We both agree -- terrorism is a very bad thing and that terrorists are the scourge of the Earth.  Where we part is thinking that terrorism only comes in one color.  Let's just remember that the Muslim God and the Christian God (as well as the Jewish God) are all one in the same.  Like the Extreme Christian Right in this country, there are extremists who use religion and manipulate it to their advantage.  There are terrorists in our own country who blow up abortion clinics, kill doctors who perform abortions, kill gay men and lesbians, and other heinous crimes all in the name of God.  To me, radical Christian terrorists are no better than Islamic militants.  When is the government going to include these terrorists in their war?    OUR TROOPS ARE THERE TO MAINTAIN PEACE, NOT TO ENFORCE THEIR WILL UPON THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ.      I think you're implying that I'm anti-troop.  I have said nothing about the troops.  Who I'm talking about is the Bush Administration here.  I have relatives in the military and, believe me, I support them.  I don't want them to die, especially for a war that I think was senseless.  Again, the question must be asked -- Why Iraq?  Bush says there were weapons of mass destruction.  But, after over a year of bloodshed, they still have to produce them.  Bush says that Saddam Hussein had connections with Al-Qaeda, but everyone knows that Hussein and Bin Laden had conflicting ideologies -- Hussein was secular and Bin Laden is a Islamic militant.  And, again, after a year of bloodshed, where's the link?  And, what happened to the hunt for Bin Laden?  We went to war with Afghanistan and all the time we were chanting for the head of Bin Landen.  Suddenly, we decided to give up looking for him and go to war with Iraq?  What was that all about?  Could it possibly be to protect oil interests because we are an oil dependent nation?  If the intention was to protect us from terrorism, then I would have rather have used the over $600 a year I pay as a taxpayer to fund a boost in homeland security than watch my brothers and sisters in the arm services get blown up because the Department of Defense was not prepared to fight.    MIND YOU WE LIBERATED A NATION, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY.    Do you think that's what we were thinking when the U.S. helped put Saddam Hussein in power and funded Osama Bin Landen in his war against the Russians?  The United States has, and this can be historically proven, supported ruthless regimes to replace ruthless regimes it does not like.  Again, I say...only time will tell on this one.  Alright, and that's it for me...

      I've gotten so serious lately.  Bush needs to go.  And, I cannot rest until he does.   I refused to be the progressive/liberal person who watches documentaries down at the local art house, drinks lattes and listens only to NPR.  But, things are changing and I find myself landing on the station.  I'm watching documentaries.  I'm drinking lattes.  Hell, I'm even listening to NPR.  And, I used to be  so  anti-NPR. What's even worse is that I'm coming to the scary conclusion that I actually  love  NPR.  What's even worse is that I actually have 3 NPR stations programmed into my car radio.  I was having a conversation with a like-minded person who has a relative who is totally conservative that she used to have playful debates with.  But, now, the debates are not so playful.  She's gotten sensitive about this relative's support of Bush.  I know what she means.  I've become the same way.  I do not think its funny or amusing that a person could support Bush.  In fact, when I hear that they are a Bush supporter, my blood boils and steam comes out of my ears.  You see, a vote for Bush, to me, is really like a vote against me as a human being.  My mother says that I take things too personally and it drives me crazy because she doesn't see how I can't  not  take this personally.  I just got an e-mail from the Human Rights Campaign.  There are 2 more weeks before the Senate votes on the Federal Marriage Amendment, a Constitutional Amendment backed by Bush and which writes discrimination into our nation's most prized document.  If it passes and the President signs, the U.S. Constitution will say that I am a second class citizen.  Yes, how could I take that personally?  Like it or not, our country is in the middle of a Culture War and the forces of goodness, tolerance, respect, and fairness   must   win.  Part of that battle is to remove one of the commanders of the forces of darkness, intollerance, and discrimination --   President George W. Bush  .   That's the part where you boo and hiss!   So, folks...this is what I need you to do:  1.  I need you to write a letter to your Senators urging them to vote no on the Federal Marriage Amendment.  Don't wait to do it.  Do it now!  To find your Senator, go here to the Human Rights Campaign's  urlLink Take Action Center .  If you don't have time to formulate your own letter, sign  urlLink this letter  right now!  2.  I need you to be sure you've registered to vote.  If you've moved, will be turning 18 by November 2 or have changed political parties, you  must  re-register.  If you need to register or re-register, you can go to  urlLink Your Vote Matters .  I don't want to hear any excuses about not registering to vote...especially the one about jury duty.  If you own a driver's license, you have just as much of a chance to get jury duty.  3.  I need you to help a progressive minded organization to get out the vote.  Do phone banking, help precinct walk, get people to the polls.  Just do something!   urlLink E-mail me  and I can give you some suggestions!  4.  VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! November 2, 2004.  VOTE!  And, as an individual citizen of this fine country, I say that your vote will matter, especially when cast against Bush.  Alright, I'm going to go calm down and watch  The Daily Show With Jon Stewart .  Okay, maybe not so serious...  Good.

      It sounds so secretive and special operation-like.    This morning in Iraq (which would be in the middle of the night for those of us in the United States), in a small, but heavily guarded, ceremony, the now-former Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority Paul Bremer handed Iraq Supreme Court chief justice Midhat al-Mahmood a leather-bound document.  It read:     As recognized in U.N. Security Council resolution 1546, the Coalition Provisional Authority will cease to exist on June 28th, at which point the occupation will end and the Iraqi interim government will assume and exercise full sovereign authority on behalf of the Iraqi people. I welcome Iraq's steps to take its rightful place of equality and honor among the free nations of the world.   Sincerely, L. Paul Bremer ex-administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority.     Awww...isn't that sweet?  Iraq is, once again, a soverign nation and all this happened 2 days before scheduled.  The occupation is over and much ballyhooing is to be had.  We all marvel at President Bush's words that the "Iraqi people have their country back."  We have won!  That's funny...I seemed to have heard this story...oh...about a year ago when Bush declared that our mission in Iraq was victorious and that, once again, in December of last year when Saddam Hussein was caught.  We keep hearing about these supposed victories and days of celebration, yet, all I see are people...young Americans...young Americans of color...who are dying every day in Iraq.  I mean, I'm happy for the defeat of a ruthless dictator...don't get me wrong.  But, where are there assurances that democracy will reign in Iraq.  Already, I'm hearing news that a potential civil war between Arabians and Khurds could happen.  Already, I'm hearing news that martial law could be declared.  Are we basically re-designing the failed designs of the past?  For the world's sake and the sake of our troops' lives, I hope I am wrong.  History is the only proof I can go by and the United States has a rich history of replacing ruthless dictators with other ruthless dicators who pledge democracy and then later stab us in the back.  And, what was with the surprise early launch of Iraq 2.0?  Many argue that it was done for security sake to thwart any attempts at terrorists targeting a more public ceremony.  Frankly, I think it was done to take the attention off the fact that  Fahrenheit 9/11  did as awesomely as it did in the box office.  The film, in its first weekend, not only beat out the sales for Moore's last film  Bowling for Columbine , but beat out all the other Hollywood movies as the biggest box-office draw this weekend.  It beat out  White Chicks  and  Dodgeball .  It also made history as the first documentary to hit number one in overall box-office.  That's pretty impressive for a film only showing on 868 theaters.  Well, it will be interesting to see what happens in Iraq. I guess only time will tell.

      Today, I was supposed to go to Gay Pride in the city, but the plans all fell through.  By the time that I thought about just driving in myself, I got lazy.  I have been super tired lately and the idea of getting off the couch and turning off TNT's  Salem's Lot  to go deal with massive amounts of people in the city just didn't sound appealing.  I feel like a dork and I feel bad that I let down some people by not going, but, unfortunately, unlike Cher, I cannot turn back time.   It just seemed like a stay-in and veg on the couch day.  I went over to Hollywood Video to partake in their 3 previously used DVDs for $25 sale.  I actually missed  Bowling for Columbine  last year, so my thrill of watching  Farenheit 9/11  yesterday made me crave all things Michael Moore.  So, that made the top of my list.  Then, I decided to buy  Mambo Italiano , just because I haven't seen it before and, finally,  Spellbound  because I had heard so many good things about it.   I ended up watching  Bowling for Columbine  and  Spellbound  today, both of which I loved.    Let's start with  Bowling for Columbine .  Moore deals with the socio-political issues that added to the Columbine tragedy happening in the United States.  Exposing the political power of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and conservative protection of the 2nd Amendment, the role of the media as a business that needs to use sensationalized stories to keep people coming back for more, the role modeling of violence by the government and societal pressures placed on American youth, Moore weaves a very cohesive arguement.     It's amazing to me how the Republicans and right-wing conservatives really hold on to the 2nd Amendment.  I mean, of all the amendments in the Bill of Rights, why that one?  And, it's the most archaic one, I think.  Basically, it gives us the right to bare arms.  But, when the Constitution was written, it was at a time when of revolution.  The intention was so that a dictator would not be able to stock pile weapons and take over the country.  I mean, I'm not for banning the right to bare arms, but I do think it needs to be more difficult to obtain them.  AND, I think there definitely needs to be further precautions to actually having them in the house.  For instance, making them ultra-nonaccessible to young children is a no brainer.   But, Charlton Heston's "from my cold dead hands" speech just makes me sick.  The man makes me sick  period .  I remember sitting next to him while watching the movie  Emma  in a theater in Century City.  As I walked out, I turned to him, made the Nazi salute and said, "NRA forever!"  Then, I bolted out of the theater.  Ugh...hate him.   However, Moore doesn't just pick on the NRA.  He examines all factors that could potentially have led to the Columbine masacre and looks at how gun violence in schools is almost an excusively American phenomenon.  The number of gun deaths in the United States (somewhere over 11,000 a year) is so much greater than gun deaths in other industrialized nations (ranging from 28 to the low 100s a year).  Canada, which is so close to our country, not only in terms of location, but in terms of lifestyle, suddenly seems so much more progressive than we are.  They are more accepting of racial and ethnic minorities, they have socialized healthcare and they feel safe enough to keep their doors unlocked was amazing.  Kinda makes you want to move to Canada (and, when I say this, I'm sure that conservatives will question my patriotism and revert to 3rd grade mentality by saying, "Well, if you hate America that much, why don't you move there?").  What will stick with me is the interviews with younger Canadians and how they see the United States solving its problems with violence rather than negotiations.  Hmmm...who could possibly be role modeling that?    Bowling for Columbine  is a wonderful documentary and I give it   FIVE STARS, TWO THUMBS UP AND A FRESH TOMATO  .   But, if you want to read other reviews, go here -  urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/BowlingforColumbine-1117183/ .   Okay, now on to  Spellbound .    At first, it sounds like the title of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller, but, it's really a documentary about the 1999 National Spelling Bee Competition.  I was actually curious to see this film because of all of the drama from this year's National Spelling Bee Competition -- one guy passes out while the winner almost hyperventilates in the process of spelling the word that gives him his win.  Wooo!  Drama!  And, you know, I loves me the drama...   Anyway, I enjoyed this film as well.  It was interesting to see how people from diverse backgrounds, from a child of immigrant Latino ranch workers in Texas to an upper middle class child from Connecticut to a working class African American Child in DC to a child of upwardly mobile South Asian immigrant parents in the wealthier part of Orange County, California.  I especially related to the South Asian competitors because my parents tried to challenge my sister and me in the same kind of way.  To them, they believed that winning a competition would make me a more solid citizen.  So, they were constantly challenging us.     The only problem is that I developed a fear of competition because I learned that loss is too great.  There would ultimately be great disappointment and shame if I lost.  So, I lost all my confidence in competing.  And, when that happened, my parents lost their confidence in me.  And, thus lays the groundwork for my therapy sessions.    I actually have a problem with the National Spelling Bee.  I just think that we spend way too much time giving the Spelling Bee so much credibility when, in the end, what is learned -- a bunch of kids who care to memorize the dictionary get to challenge themselves annually.  I think it's fascinating when they ask for the root of a word and try to figure things out that way, but, I don't think it's a really useful thing to know how to spell everything.  Seriously, who uses the word "autochthonous" on a regular basis...if at all.  If they really wanted to have a nationally recognized academic comeptition, you'd think they would have developed something a little more useful by now.   Also, it bothers me to see children under so much stress over this.  I mean, it's interesting and fun to watch...but, it bothers me nonetheless.  I don't think any child should need to faint or hyperventilate over spelling the word "hapaxlegomenon."  It only underlines my frustration with the education system to start off with...this need to measure intelligence in easy ways.    Child that knows how to spell "australopithecine" = BRILLIANT!    What about all the children who might not have the time to memorize the dictionary or are not good taking standardized tests, but are intelligent anyway.  How do we challenge these kids and make them feel like they're doing something important and incredible?  Instead, we promote spelling bees and then worship school atheletic programs.   Educators need to get more creative with their teaching and government needs to lay off the need for standardized testing.  Let's make sure everybody not only succeeds, but actually learns something in the process.   The big thing that bothered me about this film was the last half, at the competition itself.  I felt it was basically an edited rehash of the ESPN broadcast with a few interviews here and there.  I don't know if Jeffrey Blitz, the films' producer and director, was trying to be nice, but I felt he was a little too nice.  Watching the kids during the competition, they look intense, but all I got after they spelled the word wrong was, "Oh, it's okay.  I'm a champion anyway."   I mean, yes...I totally believe that.  But, I wanted more about why they were as intense as they were.  What did they feel was at stake?  What were their fears?  What was keeping them focused?  Etc, etc.  Maybe I wanted more of an examination of how or why the National Spelling Bee helps or harms students.  I don't know...all I know is that I just felt more in generally watching the ESPN broadcast of the 2004 National Spelling Bee than I did at the end of this film.     Anyway, I still give this film   TWO THUMBS UP, FOUR STARS AND A FRESH TOMATO  .   If you want more, go to  urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Spellbound-1122382/ .

          Okay...yes, I know...let's get it out of the way.  Corny title.   Now, get over it.  Moving on...   Unless you have been living under a rock, you should have heard about  Farenheit 9/11  by now.  In case you have been living under that rock, it's the new Michael Moore documentary that exposes the truths behind the war with Iraq and the Bush family's connection with the bin Laden family.  I have a love/hate thing with Michael Moore.  On one hand, I commend his kamikaze style documentary style to get his messages out there.  Documentaries can often be dry and boring, but Moore presents his thesis with humor and great accessibility.  On the other hand, I've always felt that Moore was a self promoter.  I'm not a political prude.  I honestly believe that award ceremonies, like the Oscars, are appropriate places to have political messages.  But, at the same time, I think one can go overboard.  Instead of looking rational, you look looney.  And, honestly, the Disney refusal to distribute the film debacle, I'm sure, was just the thing Moore was looking for to promote this film.  Let's not think for one moment that Moore had no control over that situation and that he didn't benefit at all from it.   I've been so tired lately.  In fact, I woke up this morning with the first thought being, "Oh my God!  Monday is the day after tomorrow.  This weekend is over!"  And, believe me, it's really sad when you get to that level.  So, there was a part of me that didn't want to use up precious weekend time to be sitting in a movie theater.  With all the hype, I was almost afraid that I might not even like the film.  But, I'm so angry right now that anybody or anything bashing President George W. Bush, his family and his Administration is okay in my book.  So, off I went with Amy to see the film.   Amy, true to form, showed up in her shirt that says:   WARNING:  PRESIDENT BUSH IS HAZARDOUS TO WOMEN'S HEALTH  .  This is why I love her.  Like her, I'm big on wearing my progressive and liberal side on my sleeve when in the 'burbs.  We got there 30 minutes earlier, not really anticipating too long of a line since we were watching the movie in Dublin, CA...let's just say that the area is not the liberal capital of the world.  But, it was packed.  The line wrapped around one corner and, when it was all said and done, there was not an empty seat in the house.  And, at the end, much applause.  In fact, I almost expected people to do a standing ovation.  I was proud of my little suburbanites.   Moore really out did himself this time.  I'll admit that I am a fan of the documentaries when I think the subject matter is fascinating, but very rarely do I want to actually watch it again immediately after watching it the first time.  At 2 hours and 10 minutes, I really wanted it to go on and on.  I was sad that it was over.   Moore manages to bring humanity to a senseless war.  No longer are we watching sound bytes by the President and his Administration.  Now, we are seeing the cruel fatalities of the war, both Iraqi and American.  At times, I had to shield my eyes because the images of dead children were making me sick.  I wondered for a brief moment if he needed to show the images, but, I quickly reasoned that he did.  All this time, Bush and his cronies have been trying to peddle a message of surgical strikes with great precision and major military victories.  We lament our own brothers and sisters who died in the September 11 tragedy and it's easy to make us feel scared of future attacks and angry at an enemy with different color skin.  But, these fatalities of innocent Iraqi citizens mirror the images of September 11.  In the end, innocent people (including the majority of our troops) are dying in a massive puppet show orchestrated by elite individuals who don't have to pick up a gun ever.   Moore makes a point not to demonize the troops.  In fact, I love his approach.  It is the poor, the people of color and the disenfranchised who end up dying for our country -- not wealthy socialites and progeny of elected officials.  In fact, Moore tries to recruit children of Congress members who have supported the war to go to Iraq.  It's amazing that only one member of Congress has a child in Iraq today.   My cousin ended up joining the military because it was the only option for him.  We, of course, were all proud of him for trying to make things work on his own and use the military as a stepping stone to college and then to a better life.  It pisses me off to no end that the military is often the only resort for many of Americans.   It's so interesting to see how much people bought into the sale of "America" by the Bush Administration.  The neo-patriatism, the terrorism scares, and the message that we must fight to defend "freedom" -- it all makes for a great return to the fun times of World War II when the world was united and we fought against a common enemy.  As a nation, we are arrogant.  Even as all of this new evidence is coming out that supports the argument that the war with Iraq is a senseless war, people still try to hold on to this idea of defending freedom.  Sometimes, I can understand...especially those who have relatives who died in Iraq.  Why would one want to believe that their loved one died for oil rather than freedom?   Anyway, I hope that this film does really well this weekend...I mean,  really  well.  All signs seem to indicate that it will.  While it's in limited release right now...playing in only 868 theaters (which is actually record breaking for a documentary).  But, the Associated Press has reported that just in its first day, it earned $8.2 to $8.4 million.  If the numbers hold up,  Farenheit 9/11  could beat Moore's last film  Bowling for Columbine  in just its first weekend.  Friday's grosses were running $1.5 million ahead of  White Chicks , the Wayan brothers comedy that also opened this weekend.  If this film does do well, it could potentially go to wide release.  Frankly, I want it to succeed in that same kind of grassroots way that Mel Gibson's  Passion of the Christ  (blech!) became successful as it will remind me that there are progressive and liberal minds out there just waiting to help defeat Bush in November.   Anyway, I very much give this film   FIVE STARS, THREE THUMBS UP AND TEN FRESH TOMATOES  .   But, as always...if you don't believe me, see what other reviewers wrote -  urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Fahrenheit911-1133649/ .

      My poor grandmother.   She is one of the most loved women in the world.  All of her children want her to visit or stay with them and all of her grandchildren have tremendous respect and love for her.  BUT, for some reason, we end up forgetting her.  Oh, I'm not talking about birthdays or holidays or in general...no, I'm talking about sometimes we forget that she's with us.   Perhaps the funniest story revolved around my mother and my grandmother returning from the Philippines.  They had a bunch of boxes they had brought back and my mother instructed my grandmother to stay at the curb near the terminal while she went to fetch the car.  My grandmother, not being a very mobile person, agreed.   So, my mother takes the bus to the long-term parking lot, trudges to the car with rolling suitcase, turns on the car, pops in a Beatles CD (in my head, I'm playing "Life Goes On") and then proceeds to drive on.  My mom then proceeds to pass the freeway exit that will take her to my grandmother.  Instead, with Beatles music a blaring, my mom continues to drive on.   As I have a tendency to do, I play out scenarios in my head like a well directed film...er...okay, at least a directed film...complete with editing and music.  So, as the story plays out in the windmills of my mind, I see my mom driving, merrily singing to the Beatles -- "Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da life goes on brah, la-la how the life goes on. "  Then, we cut to my grandmother, sitting alone on the curb, grasshoppers chirping in the background.  We then cut back to my mom, still singing to the Beatles -- "Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da life goes on brah, la-la how the life goes on. "  Back to my grandmother, checking the fictional watch that she has in my mind, but not in reality.  Finally, we cut back to my mother once again... "Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da life...Oh, my god!  I forgot Mama!"   Yes, my friends, my mother made it across the San Mateo Bridge before she realized that my grandmother was not in the car.  For those not familiar with the Bay Area, that's at least a 20 minute drive...35 if you drive as fast as my mom.  So, what should have taken 15 minutes ended up taking over an hour.   But, perhaps the most absurd neglect of my grandmother -- at least, when you say it out loud without giving context -- was when we accidentally left her in a tree.  We were cherry picking and my mother helped my grandmother up a tree so she could enjoy picking.  Then, the family migrated throughout the orchard to get cherries.  The only thing is that we forgot to remind ourselves exactly what part of the orchard we left her in.   Even though we forget her sometimes, she takes it in good humor.  Although, at the same time, she's absolutely terrified when my mom says to her, "Wait here, I'll be back in a minute."  Sometimes, that minute turns into 2-3 hours.    Yesterday, my cousin Eileen, my mom and my grandmother went to Monterey to enjoy the day.  We had a lovely time and were about to go home when tragedy struck in the car.  Eileen got in the car and shut her door.  Suddenly, you heard my grandmother calmly say, "Wait a minute!  Hold on!"   She had a terrified look on her face, but she was so calm that we couldn't figure out what happened.  Then, we realized that my cousin accidentally closed the door on my grandmother's hand.  We scurried through the sleepy hamlet of Carmel in search of ice and bandages.   After we got my grandmother bandaged up, we drove home.  My cousin was feeling guilty, my mom and I were feeling bad.  Then, we suddenly started laughing.  The only thing I could say was, "Well, Lola, look at the bright side.  At least we didn't leave you anywhere this time!"   Today, I was in a funk.     Colleen said, "It's been a weird last couple of days, hasn't it?"   Nancy agreed while I answered with some kind of acknowledging grunt.   Colleen added, "I think Mercury must be in retrograde."    "Could be," I sighed like any good drama queen would, "But, I think Mercury is  always  in retrograde for me."   Nancy laughed to both sympathize with me and, at the same time, say "you're exaggerating."   Later, I was asking Amy about moving this giant cabinet with doors so that we could get into it more easily.   Nancy replied, "That would be a good idea.  But, be careful, because you don't want to smack into one of the doors on the way to the printer."   Then, under her breath, she muttered jokingly, "I can see you doing that."   My eyes popped open in almost a strange delight as I replied, "See!  Mercury  is  always in retrograde for me!"   Maybe thus is the curse of my family.  My grandmother passed it on to me.  Maybe her grandmother passed it on to her.  Oh, well...it's probably better than being werewolves, right?

      I've been so crazed lately trying to update my  urlLink Web site .  It's been almost four years since I last worked on it, so much updating must be done.  But, I'm really enjoying it.  My previous site, I felt, was all over the place.  It was just a bunch of links that lead to more links.  But, this time around, I've been wanting to make it a little more personal by highlighting more of my writing and some of my pictures.  I know that not everybody will want to read or look at them.  It's really for my own personal edification and if somebody else enjoys it, then good for them!  This weekend, I posted a bunch of photos from the late 60s (really, 1969 to be exact because I didn't exist before then) and early 70s.  As I sifted through piles of photos (well, not really piles as my mother had organized the old photos into albums -- but, I think "piles" has a much more visual ring to it), I could feel Barbara invade my head with her soft and sweet, "Memories...from the corners of my mind...misty watercolored memories...of the way we were."  First off, I must say that I was an adorable and even stylish child.  Alright, you might call that an ego trip, but as my therapist likes to say, I like to call it progress.  Actually, everybody seemed so stylish back then.  My mom looked like she could be in an ad for the new Pontiac back in the 1960s.  Even my dad looks stylish...and stylish and my dad are really two words that I rarely put together.  I seemed so happy back then.  It's not that I'm not happy now, but I can definitely feel the weight of the world pressing against my shoulders that my ribs feel like their going to crack.  When I look at the photos, I look like I'm carefree.  I look really happy.  Pictures of me laughing look so genuine.  Most people would say that I seem faily laid back, but I know I am a bundle of stress.  I laugh, but it's to keep me from being on edge all the time.  If only we could bottle the innocence of youth and take it once in awhile just to get away from all our troubles.  Ah, the good old days...

      I am so tired right now.  I feel that my day began 3 am on Wednesday and is still continuing on today (as of this second, it is 10:06 am on Friday).    I have been down in Orange County for a Grassroots Organizing training.  But, it was worth it.  There were many tricks and tips that I can take back to my everyday life.  Before I went on the trip, I was updating  urlLink my Web site  by posting some pictures in my photo gallery.  I posted  urlLink pictures from my trip to Stonewall 25  and the Gay Games IV.  I can't believe that those pictures were taken ten years ago this month.  While it was wonderful taking a trip down memory lane, this event was a pivotal moment in my life.  It was at the Stonewall 25 march that I met the one person who would inspire me to live my life as a grassroots organizer --  urlLink Donna Red Wing .  I remember the moment I met her.  She was a jovial woman who just drew you in.  She had a warmth to her that just made you want to listen to her.  I remember thinking to myself, "God, this woman is charisma incarnate."  All I knew of her was her reputation.  At the time that I met her, she was the National Chapter Coordinator for what was then GLAAD/USA.  This was before GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was a national organization.  Prior to that, she had been a driving force in the battle against Ballot Measure 9 in Oregon which would have turned back the clocks by legalizing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.  When the organization became national, I had more of an opportunity to work with Donna on a regular basis.  I even got to call her a friend.  Donna transitioned into the role of National Field Director for GLAAD.  She was so amazing to me and to hear her stories about her work in Oregon made me realize how people could make a difference.  I'm not one for a lot of pomp and circumstance.  Most of the time, when I hear our community's leaders speak, I feel rather emotionless.  I agree with what they're saying, but I'm not necessarily feeling the battle cry.  However, when I hear Donna speak, I am ready to win the war.    At the 1995 GALA Chorus Conference, she said:     Clearly, a holy war is being waged against us, it is the backlash to our victories. It is not politics as usual ... it is not business as usual ... it is about how, and if, we get to live our lives. We do not have a choice, whether or not we engage, our engagement is defined by who we are. If you are an out and open gay man, lesbian, bisexual man or woman or a transgendered person, it is your struggle.   You cannot fight this battle from the closet. Your voice cannot be heard behind that closet door. I know that being out, especially now, especially in this political climate, is probably the most frightening and most dangerous thing you can do — it is also the most liberating thing you can do — coming out is the most profound political act of your life. If you are not out — you must decide to come out now, while it still matters — while you still can.     I remember her reading me this speech and thining to myself, "If I were in the closet, I'd definitely be ripping the door down about now."  Why did Donna affect me so much where so few can?  It is her tireless energy and her belief that people can make a difference.  To her, it is not the agency that is the power, but the people who drive the movement.  She really talks to people and finds out what their skills are and how to connect them with what is going on out there.  It is more than just the simple theory of "grassroots organizing."  She is a living example of how it works and how it becomes successful.  I'm reminded of the lessons she taught me after coming back from this training.  Grassroots organizing, community, leadership -- they're all fairly lofty terms when you think of them as words.  Sometimes, we tend to get bogged down in theoretics rather than appreciating that we do grassroots organizing everyday of our lives.  The training reminded me of the simple things that Donna leads her life by.  We all take part in something vast, so let's harness and focus that energy.  And, I need to remember this...especially now with this being a critical election year.  The President seeks to turn back time on our civil rights and it is time for us to take back the White House...take back all of the offices and institutions that would rather see us treated as 2nd class citizens.  After Donna left GLAAD, we'd make a point to catch up with each other every year at the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force's (NGLTF) Creating Change conference (the largest gather of LGBT activists in the country).  She was always on the road and everyone wanted to catch up with her.  I felt so honored that she would make every effort to schedule coffee in with me.  But, that's Donna...again, it's about making sure she connects with people.  Now, Donna is runnning for Colorado House District 25.  She has been named one of [Howard]  Dean's Dozen .  Said Dr. Dean:     Several months ago I put out a call to the hundreds of thousands of grassroots activists who had worked on my campaign to run for office themselves. Hundreds of volunteers answered this call. Our new organization - Democracy for America - is dedicated to using its resources to support those candidates in their fight to take our country back from the right-wing conservatives who dominate our government. Today, Democracy for America announces the Dean Dozen - twelve diverse candidates that represent the spirit of grassroots democracy. These will be tough races, and not all of the Dean Dozen may win. However, they will all spread the message that to change America progressives must compete.     Yup, that's Donna.  So, if you happen to live in Colorado House District 25, please vote for Donna Red Wing!  And, Donna, if somehow, you are reading this...thank you for helping make me the activist that I am today.

      On my recent annual review self-evaluation form, I jotted down as one of my goals for the next year would be to "WIN IN 2004!"   Winning, by my definition, means that we will defeat Dubaya, defend Senator Barbara Boxer and ensure fairness rings through the land.  I remember in 1992, there was the same kind of strong commitment to getting President Bush Sr. out of office.   The difference, though, between that election and this election is that we were totally jazzed about the candidate we were backing.  William Jefferson Clinton, then Governor of the state of Arkansas, brought great promise to the Office of the President.  He was young and knew how to market himself.  His appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show and MTV endeared him to younger voters.  He spoke with conviction.  In the news at the time was the very controversial issue of ending discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the military, the nation's largest federal employer.  He was not afraid to talk about this issue and pledged to end the military ban.  With Clinton, he had a very strong wife in Hilary Rodham Clinton.  She was no "just say no to drugs" kind of First Lady.  She was bright and intelligent and as accomplished as her husband.  Clinton chose then Senator Al Gore from the state of Tennessee to be his running mate.  While I'll never deny that Gore is as stiff as a board, his record on the environment was exciting, especially given the anti-environmental Administrations of Reagan and Bush Sr.   Now, we stand watching Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts await the Democratic National Convention where he will surely be named the Democrats candidate for the President of the United States.  Unfortunately, folks, I just can't get excited about the guy.  Kerry has had every opportunity to create a new and exciting platform, but I have only seen him take the safe route on everything.   Early on, the "big" issue that they felt could hurt the Democrats was the gay marriage issue.  Quickly, Kerry denounced any support for gay marriage, but, so as to not piss off liberals and his gay voters, he also announced his support of "civil unions."  While he has fought against a Federal Marriage Amendment, when same-sex marriage started to become very real in his state, he supported a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage as long as language about civil unions was present.   Then, the next "big" issue was the abortion issue.  President Bush signed the first abortion ban into law in over 30 years under the disguise of made-up language meant to disturb swing voters and anti-choice legislators fought long and hard to define the status of a fetus and when life begins.  I felt Kerry came out strong, even defying the Catholic Church, which called to deny communion to any Catholic pro-choice politicians.  But, then, he was asked a question about whether he would support anti-choice judges by nominating them to federal courts.  His answer was yes.  Perhaps Kerry thought that we'd all be lost to the importance of federal court.  What would happen if he appoints an anti-choice judge to the Supreme Court if, God forbid, any of the pro-choice judges retire or pass away?  There is but a paper thin margin that protects  Roe v. Wade .   I'm just sayin' Reagan appointed anti-choice Antonin Scalia to the U.S. Supreme Court and we've all been paying ever since.     Now, the news is reporting that Kerry has had private discussions with Senator John McCain of Arizona.  McCain, mind you, is a Republican.  McCain is also anti-choice and anti-gay.  What the hell is Kerry thinking?   Perhaps Kerry is trying to put forth an Arnold Schwarzenegger kind of thing -- "I play nicely with others.  I'm bi-partisan.  See!  My running mate is Republican."  It seems, though, nowadays, that bi-partisanship is a beautiful thing.  Everybody is everybody's friend.  Sen. McCain is a "good friend" of Kerry's...awww...isn't that nice?  Even President Bush Jr. shared some friendly words about the Clintons as the first African American artist's artwork was hung in the White House today.  They even all went to lunch afterword.  Sweet...   Now, picture me hurling my breakfast, lunch and dinner onto the floor in the form of violent chunky vomit!   Ugh...it's so frustrating.   It's not that I want to promote hatred, but I just can't stand the Republican party, especially those members who have systematically worked to destroy everything I've worked toward.  I just can't even smile or fake applause, let alone call them "my friend."   For example, I was at my parents' Filipino celebration in Tracy this weekend.  Suddenly, the emcee announced that Rep. Richard Pombo (the only man wearing a cowboy hat in the Congressional directory, mind you) had graced us with his presence.     "Everyone, please make him feel welcome with some applause," cheered the emcee.    Hmmm...Rep. Richard Pombo = Anti-gay record + Anti-women record + Anti-anything progressive record   The sound that came wafting out of my mouth was a low, growl sounding "BOOOOOOOO!"  Sadly, I was the only one booing him, so I don't know if it even registered.  There was just NO way in hell that I could clap for him for one instance.  The man is an idiot.  I was so sickened by his presence that I didn't even stay to watch his daughter dance the Tinikling (a Filipino folk dance performed with two bamboo sticks)...and I LOVE the Tinikling.   Despite my non-excitement for Kerry, he still has my support.  If this were  American Idol , he'd be my Jasmine.  You know she's not the greatest, but you have to support her because she represents a part of you that the other people do not.   There's less than five months to the elections...this gives him time to bring us the hope and excitement we felt 12 years ago.  Until then, unfortunately...not so much.

      I just finished watching  The Joe Schmo Show  marathon on Spike TV and I have to say that I actually really loved the show.  When the show first aired, I refused to watch it for several reasons:    1.  It was airing on Spike, which has dubbed itself the first network for men.  This, of course, means just "heterosexual" men. 2.  Because of Spike's pledge to play into "men’s appetites for competition, humor and beautiful women."  3.  One of the stereotypical characters that would surround the unsuspecting "Joe Schmo" as his fake competitors included "The Gay Guy."  4.  The network's larger than life description of the show as being one of the "most daring experiments on television" and that the show "revolutionized reality television."    All these things were the ingredients for one gigantic recipe for disaster for me.  As the show aired and on the eve of the second season of the show, I had heard reports that  The Joe Schmo Show  was actually good.  So, on a Sunday afternoon with nothing else to do, I decided to watch the marathon.   While I still don't think it was one of the most daring experiments and it was hardly revolutionary, the show was fun to watch and wasn't the giant heterosexual bacchanal I thought it would be.  The "Schmo," a 27 year old pizza deliveryman who dropped out of law school named Matt Kennedy Gould, actually turned out to be somebody with quite a bit of heart.   Now, Spike could have easily made it a show about making a fool of a poor schlub amidst an elaborate hoax.  But, they didn't.  They succeeded in showing us that straight men aren't the one dimensional creatures we often make them out to be.  While I credit the show for thankfully not being mean spirited, I give most of the kudos for the show's succeess to  Matt himself.     While decidedly heterosexual -- his lust for the character Molly (aka The Virgin) was quite apparent, Matt was not the pig I was expecting to see.  On many of these reality television shows such as  Survivor , you see these men who are so filled with testosterone, you wonder how it is not seeping out of their eyes.  They generally look at women as the weaker competitors and forge alliances with other men.  When they do form alliances with women, it's hopefully to get a quick roll in the hay.  If a gay character is on the show, you generally see them hanging out with the women because the straight men try to act like it's cool, you know they're uncomfortable.   Not so for our intrepid young hero Matt.  On several occassions, they had one character Hutch (aka The Asshole) tease and taunt Kip (aka The Gay Guy), who was not just a little gay, but flamboyantly gay.  Matt, on every occassion, rose to the defense of Kip, even threatening to kick Hutch's ass if he continued to taunt him.  I nearly cried because he was the straight guy every gay guy wanted in school to be their protector.  When Kip was voted off the show, he called Matt his "knight in shining armor."   Matt was chivalrous, having given up a trip he won to Dr. Pat (aka The Quack) because he felt bad that he almost knocked her unconscious during the sumo game.  And, when Earl (aka The Veteran) was voted off, he shed genuine tears.  He was so upset that the producers didn't know if they would continue the show.   When they revealed that it was all a hoax and Matt was just a part of a giant television experiment, I was so happy for him.  He got it all -- the money and all the little prizes that came with the show.  I felt like something wonderful just happened for a friend.   It'll be interesting to see what they do in the next season.  They, of course, ran ads for it throughtout the marathon and it could be that the tone of the show changes.  I hope they will continue the kind of experiment they did in the first season, but television is fickle and so is its audience.

         Well, it's finally happened.  A summer movie I've totally hated this year.  When I first heard that a remake of  The Stepford Wives  was in the works, I was excited.  I LOVED the original film, its eerie ending still burned in my memory.  Then, when I heard Frank Oz (director of films such as  The Little Shop of Horrors, In & Out  and  Bowfinger  and voice of beloved characters such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and Yoda) was directing and that it would be a dark comedy, I was even more excited.  I've loved Frank Oz's movies and didn't think he could disappoint.  I divide my movies into "opening weekend" and "eh...whenever I get a chance" movies.   The Stepford Wives  definitely fell into the former.  The word "Stepford" has become a part of our culture's vernacular.  Even if we've never seen the movie or read the book before, we know what it means to be a Stepford Wife -- this perfectly beautiful, subservient, man pleasing woman.   While the film claims it adapted the script from Ira Levin's 1972 novel of the same name, it clearly takes from the original movie adaptation made in 1975, starring Katherine Ross, Paula Prentiss and a very young Mary Stuart Masterson.  In fact, the eerie ending of the original that I talked about earlier makes a cameo appearance in this movie.  Unfortunately, it is not the ending of  this  movie.   This  movie forces us to accept the most contrived ending ever...but, I won't discuss it here and give it away.       Like the original, this version has a family moving away from the city to escape the rat race and settle into the idealized version of the American dream.  Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) is now no longer an independent thinking housewife, but the president of a network who was fired after lawsuits created by her television programming almost sink the network.  Her husband Walter (Matthew Broderick), who has the last name of Kresby rather than Eberhart (an updated jab at women who keep their names), is a vice president at the same network who quits his job after Joanna's firing to shuttle his family out to Stepford.  Joanna's new found friend in Stepford is Bobbi Markowitz (Bette Midler), the decidedly Jewish influence in the ever-so WASPy town.  Unlike the original, Tina Louise's Charmaine Wimperis is replaced by the flamboyantly gay Roger Bannister (Roger Bart) -- or, as I like to put it, a gay icon for an actual gay (sorry...couldn't resist!).   The film then follows these three friends as they try to fit into this community of spooky, 1950s styled women led by Claire Wellington (Glenn Close).  There  is  a funny scene in which they attempt to become part of the community by joining the women's book club.  Bobbi bats sarcastic quips about being Jewish and discussing a book about Christmas decoration while Roger explodes with Martha Stewart loving delight.  But, unfortunately, that's what this film is...a series of funny scenes in a really disjointed and not too compelling movie about a book meant to address the backlash of feminism in this country.       Part of this, though, is that Levin's book was written at a time when it was relevant.  Written at the height of the women's movement, Levin addressed men's fear to the more outwardly expressed independence of women.  While men still do try to take control of women's lives today (if you don't believe me, take a look at this  urlLink picture  of the President and a bunch of white men sign the first abortion ban in over 30 years), its hard to believe that they could form a club and easily dupe their wives, all top CEOs, judges and politicians mind you, into trapping themselves within such club and get turned into robotic perfect versions of themselves.  Again, nowadays, sistahs are doin' it for themselves.  I would imagine if they were in this situation, they would get the hell out of dodge quickly.  And, with all the power that the women once had, wouldn't somebody outside of Stepford get really suspicious?  I did like the fact that they had a gay couple in this movie.  To me, it is through these characters that I felt the most relevance.  Roger is clearly a liberal and proud to be out gay architect (read "arty") and his life partner Jerry (David Marshall Grant) is a straight acting Republican.  Why these two people are together, I'll never know, but Roger's transformation into the gay Religious Right as being "perfect" was very real to me.  As the book revealed men feeling threatened by women, this movie reveals conservatives (and, frankly, even moderates and "conservative" liberals) being threatened by out and loud,  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy -styled gay people.    In fact, I almost wish this was the tone the entire movie took.  While the gender war (which make me glad to be gay) still rages on today (hence the vapid popularity of  Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus ), I believe that the real threat to women today is political and religious conservative extremists (who are both men and women).  Issues of threats to women's reproductive rights and the glass ceiling are much more compelling and real arguments to the backlash of feminism today than men being pissed off about women not having dinner on the table when they come home from work.  Unfortunately, I give this film   TWO THUMBS DOWN, ONE AND A HALF STARS AND A ROTTEN TOMATO   .

      I was waiting in the drive thru at Burger King this morning when I spotted an Asian American woman driving a gigantic black truck in front of me.  Immediately, my mind fills with observations such as "how interesting that there are two Asian Americans in the same drive thru..."  Now, this, obviously, would not be as interesting if we were  in  Asia or even an Asian American enclave such as Chinatown, the Sunset or the Richmond.  But, this was the 'burbs where white is still big.    I grew up around here and I remember being able to count the number of Asian Americans in my high school on two hands.  Considering we make up about 1/3 of the world population, that's a small percentage.  It's sad that I get so excited when I see other Asian Americans in the 'burbs.  I wonder...      where do they live?    Are they twinkies (yellow on the outside, white on the inside)?    Do they have Asian American friends?    Do they speak with an accent?    Do they known an Asian language?    Have they lived here for generations?    How many generations have they lived here?    Do they observe many of the traditions that somebody of their ethnicity would observe?     The list goes on and on...  It's like I have to catalog other Asian Americans in the suburbs...like we're rare butterflies.  I HATE the fact that I have such a visceral reaction everytime I see another Asian American because, to me, it only points out that we are grossly underrepresented wherever I go.  I have a similar reaction to seeing an Asian American in the media.  I'm so excited to see Asian Americans on television and I can't help but wonder how they got on the program.  I've seen television shows with lots of white people, African Americans and Latinos.  The shows are heralded as  diverse !  The only thought going through my mind, though, is "where's are my peeps?"  Asian Americans have often been seen as the bastard step child of the "people of color movement."  We're too dark for white people but too "model minority" for people of color.  So, it's not difficult to understand that we're often overlooked in the grand scheme of things.    The whole thing makes me think of Sandra Tsing Loh's novel  Aliens in America  where she recollects her mother's observation that "we are all foreigners in a foreign land."  Now, I'd rather get stabbed in the eye than have somebody refer to me as a foreigner, especially when people do that to me indirectly all the time.      What country are you from?    What does this say?  (pointing to a menu in Chinese)   Oh, you're Filipino?  I simply LOVE lumpia!     You know, those innocent statements and questions people make that seem to sting the most...  Anyway, I'm not saying that I am a foreigner...but, I do sometimes feel like I am a foreigner in a foreign land.  I'm but one stranger in a sea of sameness.

      While in the work room, I was muttering to myself a checklist of things I still have to do.  Honestly, I think I'm slowly losing my mind with my memory to go first.  I feel like I forget things even if I say in my head over and over again, "Don't forget such and such..."  It's frustrating...I think I either have Alzheimer's (which is probably unlikely) or my Adult ADD has gotten worse (which is probably more likely).  Nonetheless, I should probably get it checked (and stop drinking out of aluminum cans).  Anyway, where was I?  (See!)  Ah, yes...muttering to myself...  Margie heard me mumbling and asked, "Are you talking to yourself?"  I replied, "Yes, I'm known to do it.  In fact, I often have complete conversations wih myself.  Sometimes, I say mean things to myself and make me cry.  Other times, I'll get into a heated debate.  And, then, there are the times in which we walk hand-in-hand, singing songs."  Margie laughed and said she'd like to see that.  If only she knew that it really does happen...

      Down the street from the office is a little park that serves as a hot spot for community activity.  Each week, they have a farmer's market and, during the summer, they have concerts.  Oh, we'd never see big music artists there...no Madonna, no Christina, no Britney, no Cher.  No, the summer concert series was reserved for local "artists" who play music ranging from neo-big band swing (meaning, they play big band songs minus the actual big band) to country music outfits that do the local two-step class circuit.  Today, Amy and I crossed through the park to get to Quiznos.  I could hear her form a saracastic quip about the summer concert series when she spied me clapping my hands, stomping my feet and spewing my limited knowledge of the lyrics to "Ghost Riders in the Sky."  Yippee Kay Yay...Yippee Kay Yooo...Ghost Riders in the Sky....  Amy stared at my blankly as I longingly looked out at the sea of suburbanites who have staked their area of the park to sip refreshing iced tea and eat fried chicken or sandwiches (although some have given into the modern diet era by bringing their freshly packed salads).  They all looked so content.  They smiled at each other and laughed as they, too, attempted "Ghost Riders in the Sky."  Some, though, were hardcore.  They got up close to the stage and stomped intently, as if their lives depended on it.  I love things like this...summer concerts, neighborhood fairs and carnivals, the 4th of July parade.  They seem to be this little microcosm of an almost Stepford society.  It's not just contentment that I see, but complacency.  There is nothing better than what is in front of them.  Fair goers are the heralds of status quo.  But things, like the summer concert, remind me of an America I never really knew.  Its infectious laughter and musical beat draw me closer.  Who are these people?  What do they do?  How do they have time to sit in the park in the middle of the day?  I feel I've seen them before, but outside of the confines of this setting, they are strangers to me.  But, yet they call to me...Yippee Kay Yay...Yippee Kay Yooo...Ghost Riders in the Sky....  I mean, I remember growing up in a small town in Minnesota where you'd wait in great anticipation all winter long for the summer to come...because that meant endless block parties!  My friends would go and get our faces painted (see, everybody does it) and then (I kid you not) grab some grasshopper pie and sit down by the creek as we watched tadpoles sprout legs and become frogs (obviously, not all in one afternoon lest there be some kind of mutant frog epidemic happening in Minnesota).  Life was so carefree back then and you felt like you had all the time in the world (considering I had enough time to watch tadpoles grow into frogs).  Now, I feel like I never have time for anything.  Everything requires time.  Sitting in the park is a luxury that I cannot afford.  If I'm not working, then I'm volunteering or I'm writing or working on my Web site.  Hell, sometimes, I get so wrapped up in the business of my day that I find myself looking at the clock after spending an evening on my computer only to find that it is 3:00 am and that I need to get up in a few hours to start my day anew.  Everything has a sense of urgency.  Unfortunately, I find myself in the middle of a "culture war" in which my term of duty has been extended to eternity...and it especially feels like that now with the stranglehold the Religious Right seems to be having over the country right now.  My mother feels like I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders.  She often warns, "You can't worry about things all the time.  It's bad for you."  I know she's right, but I can't help it.  I feel like a character from  The Matrix , recently unplugged from the giant machine that lulled me into a state of complacency.  One day, everything is normal and then I'm offered the option of taking the red pill (and see the reality) or the blue pill (and stay a fair goer).  I took the red pill and, now, I realize that the illusion is what is projected through the Matrix and the reality is that a giant machine has been oppressing us, making us feel like it's nurturing us, but really using us to its advantage.  Don't get me wrong, I serve with great pride.  I do the things I do because I know it will make the world a better place.  But, admittedly, when I walk through the park on summer concert days, I see fleeting visions of a place and time that I've been before but never really got to know.    It calls to me...Yippee Kay Yay...Yippee Kay Yooo...Ghost Riders in the Sky...  I want to go to them, but I know I cannot go back...at least, not until the war is over.  Soon, we cross through the park and the reality of life sets in.  Must grab lunch.  Must go back to office.  Must finish project at the end of the day so I can start a new project tomorrow.

      The other day, the following question was posed to me...  You have the opportunity to meet three celebrities*, living or dead, under the following circumstances:    one, you would meet with a handshake and hello  only ; another, you could have dinner with; and the third, you could have drinks with.   Who would those celebrities* be?  Designed to be a cocktail party ice-breaker, it's always so difficult for me to think of who these people would be since there are a great many celebrities I would like to meet, especially since my stalking days are over by order of a municipal court in Los Angeles.  I still love you, Orlando!**   At first, I threw the first three people that came to my mind out there.  But, after having a few days to think about it, I have come up with the following:    1.  Celebrity I would like to meet with a handshake and hello  - I would like to meet Vern Yip (of  Trading Spaces ).  It's no secret that I think he is the sexiest man alive*** and I have a feeling that if I had too much time with him that I'd just feel...let's just say... overwhelmed .  If I could just shake his hand, I'd be able to spread the love over a series of years.   2.  Celebrity I would like to have dinner with  - I would have dinner with Al Franken, just because I think he's so smart and would bring intelligent dinner conversation.  At the same time, he is more down to earth, so our conversation would not be stuffy, either.  I have a big love for satirists who make discussions about politics more pallatable to the everyperson.  What I'd ask him is how he came up with the greatest chapter name ever in the history of books**** - "Ann Coulter: Nutcase."  For that alone, I'd break bread with Mr. Franken.    3.  Celebrity I would like to have drinks with  - I think this would have to be Amy Sedaris.  I have always been a fan of hers and thought  Strangers Like Candy  was one of the funniest shows on television.  However, after recently listening to a Fresh Air interview of her that I downloaded off of iTunes, I think it would be fascinating to have drinks with her and just listen to her talk.  She's got an almost insane sense of humor, which makes me really want to be a fly on the wall at a Sedaris family reunion.  I would ask her about her drawing humorous inspiration from drama and serious situations AND, once we've had a few drinks, I'd see if I could get her to divulge the secrets of her smokey cheeseballs.  *  NOTE:   celebrity  is defined as a famous person and not your grandmother or old babysitter...that is, unless they themselves are famous...and, if this is so, I want to know you.  **  NOTE:  The above stalking scenario of Orlando Bloom was used for humor purposes only.  I do not have a court order to stop me from stalking him...I'm WAY too stealthy to get caught!  ***  NOTE:  Damn  Trading Spaces  for not showcasing Vern this season!  I'm sorry (and no offense), but I'm sick of watching Edward and Frank.  While we're on it, the new designers suck!  Ok...in with anger, out with love.  ****  NOTE:  I TRULY mean this.

      As you know, I did type my (sorta) tribute to Ronald Reagan, who passed away on June 5.  This may sound callous, but since his death, all I've heard is Reagan, Reagan, Reagan.  Now, I realize that this is the first President who died in my lifetime (at least, that I can remember) and that many people felt he was a great President, but now I feel it's overkill.  I mean, a tribute to Reagan pre-empted a  Family Plots  marathon on A&E and, I don't know if it's me, but the headline tributes on  urlLink cnn.com  keep getting bigger and bigger.  First, it was a normal size "Reagan Passes Away" then it was a slightly larger "Remembering Reagan" and now it's this gigantic "Honoring Reagan."  Again, I don't mean to sound callous, but...hello, he died 2 two days ago.  Let's learn about new things that have happened since then.  So, what's a person to do but write another entry about Ronald Reagan's passing away.  I received this e-mail, actually, from the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force's (NGLTF) list.  It's written by NGLTF's Executive Director Matt Foreman and I thought it was particularly beautiful...enough to devote another entry.  When something big happens, many non-profit organizations send out some kind of statement responding to the event.  Foreman is torn about doing this and writes the most clever observance of Reagan's death possible.  He writes a letter to his best friend who died as a result of Reagan's non-attention to the AIDS crisis...   NATIONAL GAY AND LESBIAN TASK FORCE  MEDIA RELEASE  MEDIA CONTACT: NGLTF Communications Department  urlLink media@TheTaskForce.org  323-857-8751    urlLink http://www.TheTaskForce.org   **************************************************************  Sunday, June 6, 2004  A Letter to My Best Friend, Steven Powsner On the Death of Former President Ronald Reagan   Matt Foreman, Executive Director National Gay and Lesbian Task Force   June 6, 2004   Dear Steven,   I so much wish you were here today to tell me what to do. You would know if it's right to comment on the death of former President Reagan, or if I should just let pass the endless paeans to his greatness. But you're not here. The policies of the Reagan administration saw to that.   Yes, Steven, I do feel for the family and friends of the former President. The death of a loved one is always a profoundly sad occasion, and Mr. Reagan was loved by many. I have tremendous empathy and respect for Mrs. Reagan, who lovingly cared for him through excruciating years of Alzheimer's.   Sorry, Steven, but even on this day I'm not able to set aside the shaking anger I feel over Reagan's non-response to the AIDS epidemic or for the continuing anti-gay legacy of his administration. Is it personal? Of course. AIDS was first reported in 1981, but President Reagan could not bring himself to address the plague until March 31, 1987, at which time there were 60,000 reported cases of full-blown AIDS and 30,000 deaths. I remember that day, Steven - you were staying round-the-clock in Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital caring for your dying partner of over 15 years, Bruce Cooper. It was another 41 days of utter agony for both of you before Bruce died. During those years of White House silence and inaction, how many other dear friends did we see sicken and die hideous deaths?   Is it personal? Yes, Steven. I know for a fact that you would be alive today if the Reagan administration had mounted even a tepid response to the epidemic. If protease inhibitors been available in July of 1995 instead of December, you'd still be here.   I wouldn't feel so angry if the Reagan administration's failing was due to ignorance or bureaucratic ineptitude. No, Steven, we knew then it was deliberate. The government's response was dictated by the grip of evangelical Christian conservatives who saw gay people as sinners and AIDS as God's well-deserved punishment. Remember? The White House Director of Communications, Patrick Buchanan, once argued in print that AIDS is nature's revenge on gay men. Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, and his domestic policy adviser, Gary Bauer, made sure that science (and basic tenets of Christianity, for that matter) never got in the way of politics or what they saw as "God's" work.   Even so, I think I could let go of this anger if this was just another overwhelmingly sad chapter in our nation's past. It is not. Steven, can you believe that the unholy pact President Reagan and the Republican Party entered with the forces of religious intolerance have not weakened, but grown exponentially stronger? Can you believe that the U.S. government is still bowing to right wing extremists and fighting condom distribution and explicit HIV education, even while AIDS is killing millions across the world? Or that "devout" Christians have forced the scrapping of AIDS prevention programs targeted at HIV-negative gay and bisexual men in favor of bullshit "abstinence only until marriage" initiatives? Or the shameless duplicity of these same forces seeking to forever outlaw even the hope of marriage for gay people? Or that Reagan stalwarts like Buchanan, Bennett and Bauer are still grinding their homophobic axes?   No, Steven, I do not presume to judge Ronald Reagan's soul or heart. He may very well have been a nice guy. In fact, I don't think that Reagan hated gay people -- I'm sure some of his and Nancy's best friends were gay. But I do know that the Reagan administration's policies on AIDS and anything gay-related resulted - and continue to result - in despair and death.   Oh, Steven, how much I wish so much you were here.   Matt   (On November 20, 1995, Steven Powsner, died of complications from AIDS at age 40. He had been President of the New York City Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center from 1992-1994.)  ***************************************************************  Founded in 1973, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is the oldest national organization working to eliminate prejudice, violence and injustice against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people at the local, state and national level.

      Lately, I've found myself doing a great deal of writing lately...which is great.  But, in writing, I realize that I've been shirking my New Year's Resolution to read everyday.  In January, I had this lofty goal of at least reading 2 books a month or (as mathematicians would tell me) 24 books a year.  This being June, I have, to date, read 2 books -- far off from the 10 books that I  should  have read by now.  I suppose I shouldn't be too disappointed, though.  My New Year's Resolution last year was to quit smoking, but that didn't happen until this year.  So, maybe, I'm a year behind New Year's Resolutions...  Oh, no.  see, I'm doing it again.  I'm blaming others (or, in this case, other situations) for the paths I take.  Repeat after me, Loren... you are in control of your own destiny.  People and events influence your life, but you make the ultimate decisions...You're good enough, you're smart enough, and, gosh darn it, people like you...Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo...Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo...   hmmmmmm...I feel centered now.  Where was I?  Oh, yes...reading.  Anyway, while I'd like to say that I don't have the time to read, the truth of the matter is that I'm just lazy.  It's way easier for me to plop down in front of the television until I pass out (preferably with a glass of good scotch and two ice cubes).  Actually, the fact that I  don't  read is really odd because I end up spending about half my life in bookstores  buying  books.  Hell, I have a rather sizeable library in my house -- although, ask me how many of these books I've actually read and that would be another thing.  Perhaps I could funnel some of the time I spend in bookstores into time I think I don't have to actually read.  Ultimately, being a person who likes to take personal accountability, I chose 14 books to read for the rest of the year.  These are books that either sounded interesting to me or have been sitting on my shelf for years.  See, while I want to start reading, I highly doubt I'd be one of those  Best Seller/Oprah's Book Club  readers.  Not everything that makes it on to the National Best Seller list interests me.  For example,  Seabiscuit , even to this date of both book and film accolades, still does not interest me in the slightest.  Alright, without further adieu, I give you my reading list for the rest of 2004:      JUNE     Depth Takes A Holiday  by Sandra Tsing Loh (1996) - "All the pieces are terrific: intimate, acerbic...and really, really funny.  Less like...an essay collection and more like...a long, fabulous phone conversation with a witty, insightful pal...A+"  - Entertainment Weekly    Lamb - The Gospel According To Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal  by Christopher Moore (2002) - "A great idea, and a funny story."  - USA Today      JULY     Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister  by Gregory Maguire (2000) - "Bewitching."  - Chicago Tribune    Following Foo - The Electronic Adventures of the Chestnut Man  by B.D. Wong (2003) - "The incredible human spirit has never been more apparent than in this uplifting journey."  - Michelle Kwan      AUGUST     Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations  by Al Franken (1996) - "A laugh-out-loud funny book...[Franken] fights fire with facts...his points are swiftly and deftly made, and his sense of humoar about the current carnival of political grotesques is badly needed."  - Minneapolis Star Tribune    Up From Invisibility - Lesbians, Gay Men, And The Media In America  by Larry Gross (2001) - "This book makes the best case yet to illustrate how intrinsically the mass media and the gay and lesbian civil rights movement are interwined -- and no one can do that with the eloquence and credibility of Larry Gross."  - Joan M. Garry, Executive Director, Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation      SEPTEMBER     Letters To Montgomery Clift  by Noel Alumit (2002) - "Noel Alumit will break your heart and then put it back together again with his absorbing and heartfelt first novel."  - Light At Dusk    Does Anybody Have A Problem With That?  by Bill Maher (1997) - " Politically Incorrect  is almost single-handedly reviving political satire...[It] has pulled off the rare trick of being irreverent without being irreverent."  - The New York Times      OCTOBER     Lost  by Gregory Maguire (2001) - "Reads with the pace and urgency of a thriller...Nothing is quite what it seems, and each surprise deepens the story and makes it even more intriguing."  - The Advocate    Naked Pictures of Famous People  by Jon Stewart (1999) - "Brutally witty... On a par with Woody Allen's Without Feathers and Steve Martin's Cruel Shoes..."  - Entertainment Weekly      NOVEMBER     Me Talk Pretty One Day  by David Sedaris (2000) - "The lunacy of language is Sedaris's chief delight...He is a prime candidate for funniest writer alive."  - Salon.com    Yellow Journalist - Dispatches from Asian America  by William Wong (2001) - "For almost two decades, his columns in the  Oakland Tribune  and other San Francisco bay area newspapers have captured a different kind of reality about some of our most important social, cultural, and political movements.  Wong's readiness to share his family, his community, and his conscience allows readers to cross a bridge into the world of Asian America."  - Angela E. Oh, Lecturer/Former Advisory Member, President's Initiative on Race      DECEMBER     Voices of the Xiled  edited by Michael Wexler and John Hulme (1994) - No editorial comments were provided on book.   I'm The One That I Want  by Margaret Cho (2002) - “[A] beautiful book . . . It is innately empowering, honest, and raw.”  – Rosie O'Donnell     Alright, let me know if you want to read along with me...I mean, not literally...like I'm not going to come to your house, tuck you into bed and read you the books...but, I mean, read the books at the same time but without me being there AND in your own house (or wherever you like to read)...

           Tonight was a big night at the Tony Awards (otherwise known as the 2nd gay Super Bowl -- the first being, of course, the Oscars) when  Avenue Q  stole the show, winning Best Original Score (Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx), Best Book (Jeff Whitty) and the coveted Best Musical.  Most industry observers thought commercial favorite  Wicked  would win.   Wicked  received the most Tony nominations and won three -- Best Leading Actress in a Musical (Idina Menzel), Best Set Design (Eugene Lee) and Best Costumes (Susan Hilferty).       I was rooting for both  Avenue Q  AND  Wicked , although, admittedly, I was tipping more toward  Wicked  because of my love for all things Kristin Chenoweth (who played Glinda the Good and who received a nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Musical).  But, when Nathan Lane and Sarah Jessica Parker announced the winner, I was not disappointed at all.  During the show, they performed the "Sucks To Be Me" song from  Avenue Q .  Up until now, I had only seen snippets of  Avenue Q  on the Internet and, of course, heard all the music.  It was simply magical to see the performance.  Now that  Avenue Q  has won, it has a good chance of touring.  I cannot wait until it stops in San Francisco!   The other big news of the evening was Phylicia Rashad (television's beloved Claire Huxtable from  The Cosby Show ) being the first black actress to win a Best Leading Actress in a Play for  A Raisin in the Sun .  Her co-star Audra McDonald took home the award for Best Featured Actress.  Another African American actress, Anika Noni Rose won Best Featured Actress in a Musical for "Caroline, or Change."      Sexy host Hugh Jackman took home the award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for  The Boy From Oz .  Interestingly enough, he queened it up for his performance from  The Boy From Oz , but was also strangely uncomfortable when being hit on by a male puppet (Rod, the closeted homosexual) from  Avenue Q .  Eh...who cares.  We still love Hugh Jackman.  His dedication to Peter Allen, the flamboyant entertainer that Jackman portrays, was quite kind.  Said Jackman, "Peter, it's an honor to play you and I dedicate this Tony to you."   Other wins included  I Am My Own Wife  winning for best play and Jefferson Mays (also from  I Am My Own Wife ) winning for best Leading Actor in a Play.   Assassins  also won Best Revival of a Musical, Best Director of a Musical (Joe Mantello) and Best Featured Actor (Michael Cerveris).    Now, for the awards that I would have given out for the show itself:     Best "Most Likely To Be Quoted" Line  - "It certainly doesn't suck to be us tonight!" from  Avenue Q  Robyn Goodman, referring to the song "It Sucks To Be Me."    Most Sincere Acceptance Speech  - Anika Noni Rose who pointed out her middle name means "Gift from God" and proceeded to point out all her gifts from God.    Best Pop Version of a Classic Broadway Song  - Mary J. Blige's wonderful version of "What I Did For Love" from  A Chorus Line .  That song is not really one of my favorites, but I forgot about that tonight after watching the delightful Mary J.    Most Awkward Ending of an Acceptance Speech  -  The last producer accepting for  I Am My Own Wife  couldn't spit out what he was going to say.  The music came on and he kept rambling on.  It seemed that he wanted to make a statement about same-sex marriage, but it came off as some kind of odd mumbling about the character marrying himself.  Who knows...    Strangest Realization of the Evening  - Watching Hugh Jackman do high kicks with the Rockettes and realizing, "Hey, that's Wolverine!"    Most Surreal Moment of the Evening  - Carol Channing talking street with LL Cool J and performing a rap version of "Hello, Dolly .    Best Comeback of the Evening  - Sarah Jessica Parker's one word response to Nathan Lane's jibe about doing the lambada with Hugh Jackman.  She simply said, "Jealous?"  The crowd roared, leaving Lane searching for his own response.

      So, I suppose I should recognize the fact that Ronal W. Reagan, 40th President of the United States who served from 1981 to 1989, died from pneumonia as a complication of Alzheimer's disease on June 5, 2004.  I've been reading some of the blogs to see what other liberal bloggers wrote about Reagan.  How does one celebrate the life of a President that was so utterly popular (my mother describes him as the greatest President this nation has ever had) without giving the person too much credit?  I think my favorite entry simply said:    RIP Ronnie   You were better than George W. Bush.   I remember when Strom Thurmond died last year.  I felt really guilty knowing that the only feelings I had were those of great relief that yet another ultra-right wing conservative had left this Earth.  It's terrible, I know.  But, that's what was going through my head.  it's difficult to have compassion for somebody known for making the most vile and biting comments about you and the communities you care for.  When Reagan began office, I was in junior high school and, frankly, didn't care about politics.  My family was living an upper middle class life and, from my recollection, life was very happy for us.  Reagan remained in office through my high school years.  By high school, with great prodding from my parents, I was a young Republican.  Reagan's tax cuts favoring the more wealthy seemed to be great to a young person growing up in a material world.  The extra money afforded us new things like giant screen televisions and even my first car.  So, who could complain?  I lived far away from "the element."  Why would we want to help "them" when we were so happy?  When Reagan left office, I was in college at U.C. Berkeley.  Do you know how odd it was to be a Young Republican at one of the most liberal campuses in America?  But, as college will do, I was introduced to new ideas and new people who would inevitably change my life...and, most importantly, my politics.  Where I grew up in 1980s San Ramon, California, I rarely saw another person of color.  In fact, I could probably have counted the number of people of color at my high school on two hands.  For all intents and purposes, I thought I was white and Reagan helped me believe that.  And, the wrong side of the track for us meant families with $50,000-$100,000 household incomes.  Those anywhere near the federal poverty level were out of visibility.  Growing up, we just didn't think about things like affordable healthcare, foreign affairs, women's right and, gasp, gay rights.  By the time Reagan left office, I was a little wiser and starting to become a Democrat (although, not fast enough because I'll never forgive myself for voting Bush (Senior, that is) in 1988 for my first election).  By the end of Bush's first term, the economy had taken a turn for the worse...or, as many like to call say -- entered the worst Depression since the Great Stockmarket Crash of 1929.  Unfortunately, this was about the time that I was graduating from college and looking for jobs.  The Economic Camelot that Reaganomics had created had taken its toll.  The nation was now in bad financial shape and people in my generation were left out in the cold.  Also around that time, I came out of the closet and would become deeply entrenched in the AIDS generation -- a generation that did not know what life was like without the spectre of HIV and AIDS.  Sadly, several friends that I made early on ended up dying of the dreaded disease.  I learned that the Reagan Administration's ignorance of HIV/AIDS was a leading factor to countless deaths and AIDS being the pandemic it is today.  Why find a cure when it's just a "gay" disease?  So, you'll understand if my recollection of Ronald Reagan is not full of hearts, love and flowery sentiment.  But, because I want to stay positive.  So, two things that I'll remember Reagan for:  1.  While I won't go as far as to say that Reagan ended the Cold War (as many conservatives like to think),  he did play a leading part in it ending.  I remember the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the greatest symbol of the Cold War, and what a great moment this was.  Communism was no longer the nation's enemy.  No longer would we be subjected to movies pitting USA v. USSR and poor, poor Yakov Smirnoff would be left without a comedy act.  2.  I'll also admit that he was "The Great Communicator" that he was known to be.  He was a very charismatic President that was able to sell the nation on what he believed in -- a return to the traditional values and the age of innocence.  And, what a great time to plug this message...we had seen a Civil Rights Movement, Flower Power and the Sexual Revolution. To his credit, not anybody could have pulled this message off.  President Bush, Sr. tried to carry on the traditional values message into his 1992 campaign, but it came across as mean spirited selling out to the Religious Right.  The thing that Reagan was loved for became the thing that Bush was despised for.  I'm not saying that "traditional values" (in the way that the Religious Right defines them, at least) are a good thing (In fact, it's sad that two such powerful words strung together like that now make me think of an empire of evil).  I'm just saying that there is a small part of me that wants to respect him for sticking to what he believed in and making everybody believe in it, too.  Sometimes, I wish certain Democrats would have that kind of conviction.  In the end, though...no matter what I thought of the late President, I do send my deepest and most sincere regrets to the Reagan family and hope that the President Reagan does rest in peace...

         I'm just going to start out by saying it -- I abso-frickin'-lutely LOVED  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .  I went to see it on the IMAX this morning because this is one of those films that you just absolutely need to see in a format that's as gigantic as possible.  I thought I'd go at 10:00 am to avoid the crowd, but I should have learned from trying to do that with  Shrek 2  that people, I guess, just don't sleep in anymore.  The place was packed and the only seats available were in the front row.  That bothers some people, but I actually enjoy sitting up front.  It makes me feel like I'm watching a gigantic movie because, from where you're sitting, the screen looks that much bigger.    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  finds Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his intrepid young friends Ronald (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) returning to Hogwarts School of Witchraft and Wizardry.  Each year, the school finds itself with new teachers.  This time, we have a kooky professor of Divination played by the wonderful Emma Thompson and, of course, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (for those not familiar with the franchise, the change of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is the on-going gag) played by David Thewlis.  This year, Harry learns that a mad criminal named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the Wizard Prison of Azkaban and that he's headed to Hogwarts to kill him as he did Harry's parents.  But, Harry learns that he has close ties to Sirius Black and has an emotional internal struggle before he and his friends solve the Scooby-Doo mystery in the end.        For the third installment of the  Harry Potter  franchise, they brought in Mexican-born director Alfonso Cuarón, best known for his film  Y Tu Mamá También .  At first, I was a little concerned about the choice of directors...you know, because I'm racist against the Latinos and shit.  Just kidding...But seriously, while  Y Tu Mamá También  is a great film, the  Harry Potter  films are quite different in style and tone.  But, Cuarón did not disappoint.  Now, admittedly, I haven't read the  Harry Potter  books, so, I don't know how it compares to its literal form in comparison to the first two books.  But, this film seemed to not focus on  all  the crazy characters that exist within Harry's world.  Part of the fun, but also part of the confusion, of the first two films was that there were so many characters doing so many things.  For example, in  Chamber of Secrets , there was a rather long part with the Weasleys, helping Harry escape from his Muggle family, exploring their cuckoo cotage and then following them into Diagon Alley.  It's fun, but was all of it necessary?  In  Prisoner of Azkaban , you saw just enough of each character that you needed to.  Again, I don't know if this was by the director's design or if it was simply following the book faithfully.  This story, however, is about Harry learning more about his parents and his roots.  For the first time, I got a sense of who Harry was rather than following a character through a mad-cap romp of magic.  In this film, Harry is growing up...which is probably a good thing because the actors playing the characters are getting older, too.  I think it would have been entirely unbelievable to have Harry and friends going through the adventures that they went through in  Sorceror's Stone  if they were the age they were now.  The most wonderful thing about this film, though, is the fact that it made one of my childhood fantasies come true -- to ride on a Hippogriff!  Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) is promoted to professor, this year, and takes the students out to meet a Hippogriff, a mythological creature that is half eagle and half horse.  Along with the half eagle/ half lion Griffin, the Hippogriff was my favorite fantastic beast.  In my wildest imagination, I dreamt of riding a Hippogriff over beautifully landscaped scenery.  So, when Harry gets to ride one, I was no longer looking at CGI.  I felt that I was there, too, riding along with Harry.  That, to me, is better than technological magic any day.      I give this film   TWO THUMBS UP, FOUR STARS AND A RIPE TOMATO  !  But, if you don't like my review, you can always go to  urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/HarryPotterandthePrisonerofAzkaban-1132921/ .

       POPE CHIDES BUSH ON PRISONER ABUSE, BUT PRAISES STANCE ON ABORTION AND GAY MARRIAGE  On the first leg of his European tour, President Bush stopped by the Vatican to visit Pope John Paul II.  The Pope, who opposed the war on Iraq from the beginning, scolded Bush for U.S. occupation in Iraq and the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib.  Said the Pope, "In the past few weeks, other deplorable events have come to light which have troubled the civic and religious conscience of all, and made difficult a serene and resolute commitment to shared human values.  In the absence of such a commitment, neither war nor terrorism will ever be overcome."  At the same time, the Pope praised the President for his stance on abortion and gay marriage, saying that "I also continue to follow with great appreciation your commitment to the promotion of moral values in American society, particularly with regard to respect for life and the family."       No, you're the schmoopy!     Shortly after meeting with Bush, the Pope met with visiting U.S. Bishops and urged the Catholic leaders to continue holding strong positions against issues such as abortion and gay marriage.  Said the Pope, "Rights are at times reduced to self-centered demands: the growth of prostitution and pornography in the name of adult choice, the acceptance of abortion in the name of women's rights, the approval of same sex unions in the name of homosexual rights."  He also encouraged the clergy to stay strong in face of anti-Catholic rhetoric.  "Ambiguous moral positions, the distortion of reason by particular interest groups . . . are just some examples of a perspective of life which fails to seek truth itself and then abandons the search for the ultimate goal and meaning of human existence," he said.     SOURCE:  New York Times , June 4, 2004 365gay.com, June 4, 2004    I'll admit, I'm not a fan of the Pope or the Vatican.  In fact, it's the blind faith of most Catholics in the Pope and the Vatican that make me lose respect for religion in general.  I find it strange that nobody ever questions these institutions.  They have such trust in them and don't think about the fact that humans are capable of abuse of power and corruption.  Regardless, though, the Pope's statements today just seem to be hypocritcal.  On one hand, he's scolding Bush for treating people like subhuman creatures as it will only lead to more violence.  On the other hand, he's telling Bush to continue treating other groups of people (women and gay people) as subhuman creatures and doesn't even think about the fact that his sanctioning discrimination leads to violence everyday.  Finally, why is Bush meeting with the Pope at all?  Well...we  know  why...to impress his Religious Right supporters.  But, to me, Bush's visit only shows me his blatant disregard for the Separation of Church and State that this country is made of.     CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY PROHIBITS NAACP CHAPTER ON CAMPUS  The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC denied student requests to form a chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  While Catholic University did cite the creation of an NAACP chapter on campus would "cause redundancy" amongst the existing African American groups on campus, the other big reason was the nation's oldest Civil Rights organization's support of abortion and choice.  Said Victor Nakas, Catholic University's director of Public Affaris, "It's a factor we don't neglect because we steadfastly uphold the teachings of the Catholic Church and would apply that rule to any student group."  Recently, the NAACP served as a co-sponsor of the historic March for Women's Lives in April.    SOURCE:   The Washington Post , June 4, 2004    I find it reprehensible that students are being denied access to the nation's largest Civil Rights organization because of it's stance on abortion.  This reminds me of the Girl Scout group in Waco, TX that disbanded because they supported Planned Parenthood.  I mean, really...how stupid is that?  Does hatred really run that deep?  Apparently so...     KERRY WOOS ASIAN AMERICAN VOTES  Democratic Presidential hopeful John Kerry met with Asian American & Pacific Islander community leaders at a May 30 meeting of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC).  Kerry criticized Bush's record on immigration, noting the Bush Administration's "failure to address critical immigration issues and the unfair treatment that many minorities of Asian Pacific Islander descent endured under Bush's immigration registration program."  He also criticized Bush's restructuring of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans & Pacfic Islanders to address business issues rather than civil rights.   "This meeting reinforced our belief that John Kerry is the best presidential candidate for the APIA community, and indeed, for all Americans," said Congressman Michael Honda (D-San Jose), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, "He has demonstrated that he understands the needs and concerns of this community,"    SOURCE:   Nichi Bei Times , June 3, 2004    I'm seriously hoping that the Asian American community can come out strong for Kerry.  It's really hard to know as it seems many Asian Americans are Republicans -- much to my chagrin.  I like that Kerry is addressing Bush's evil violation and complication of immigration as a result of the "war on terror."     PHILADELPHIA - THE NEW GAY PLACE TO LIVE  The City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania will be airing a series of 30 second ads throughout the year that target the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  "This is an invitation, that you are welcome here, because of what Philadelphia is and what Philadelphia has to offer, and because we have a strong gay community," said Meryl Levitz, president and chief executive of the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing.  According to GayWired.com:   The commercial begins with a young men dressed in colonial attire writing a letter to his boyfriend asking to meet him as Independence Hall.    As the letter writer awaits his lover, he is approached by a woman who glances at him but he isn't interested. As she passes by the boyfriend arrives and the letter writer hands him a bouquet of flowers.     Set to air on Bravo, MTV, VH1 and Style, this ad campaign is the first in its kind.      SOURCE:  GayWired.com, June 3, 2004    In this day and age where it seems like everybody is against the gay and lesbian community, it's nice to see positive stories of this that give us hope.  This year has really been an interesting one, though -- maybe even a pivotal one for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  I've seen so many elected officials who have been great friends of the community start to water down their language so as to not seem  as  important this election year.  The Religious Right is mobilizing once more in a way that could considerably hurt the community.  But, at the same time, there  have  been so many people who've taken a stand -- from San Francisco's Gavin Newsom to Sandoval County, New Mexico's Victoria Dunlap to the Massachusetts Supreme Court.  I remember all the excitement in 1992 when Bill Clinton made the gays in the miltary issue one of his issues.  While he never fulfilled his promise of ending discrimination in the military, he  did  get people to talk about it and I'll always thank him for that because I do think that it played a big part of how we got where we are today.  No one knows how things will turn out, but it is great to see that we do have friends helping to make some kind of difference.  Hell...I've been wanting to take a trip to Philadelphia someday.  This now gives me added incentive!

      Generally, I agree with Care2, an online advocacy site that started off as an enivronmental site but has since started encompassing other progressive issues.  But, the e-mail that I received today seemed to piss me off a bit.  It said:   Hi Loren,  Here's a sobering fact: more women die every year from lung cancer than from breast cancer - or any other type of cancer. And for every 3 girls who get hooked on smoking, 1 will die prematurely of a tobacco-caused disease. Thank you for receiving North America Alerts from Care2 - please send a quick letter today to stop the promotion of smoking to teen girls. Your action makes a difference!  Send your letter here:  urlLink http://www.care2.com/go/z/14869   Did you know that 21% of high school girls smoke? Knowing all that we do about smoking today, you'd think that smoking would be much lower, right?  Unfortunately for impressionable teens, smoking is still glamorized on the big screen. For example, in Sony Pictures'  Mona Lisa Smile , a recent PG-13 film, every four minutes (on average) a young actress is shown smoking, talking excitedly about smoking, or displaying a pack of Camel or Winston cigarettes.  That's a big deal when you consider that teens are nearly three times more likely to start smoking as a result of high exposure to smoking on the big screen.  It's time to stop the entertainment industry's promotion of smoking to our daughters. Send a letter to Sony Pictures Chairman and CEO Michael Lynton asking him to stop promoting smoking in his youth-rated films!  Send your letter here:  urlLink http://www.care2.com/go/z/14869   Thank you for your time today!   Why does this piss me off, you ask?  First, I highly disagree with censoring the media.  There is this general thought that if youth see it in the media, they'll want to do it themselves.  This is the same argument that I hear abstinence only advocates use -- If we pretend sex doesn't exist, youth won't think it exists.  I mean, I'd like to see scientifically proven studies that showed  Mona Lisa Smile  led to children smoking.  In the case of this movie, I also think that it creates an inaccurate view of what America and American women were like during the 1950s.  Smoking was big back then.  Companies such as Philip Morrison even advertised on beloved television shows such as  I Love Lucy  and  The Flintstones  (Yes, the Flinstones!).  Instead of censoring a film, use it as a teachable moment.  What was going on at the time that made smoking so glamorous?  What factors brought young women to smoke during that era?  What is the difference between the 1950s and now?  Etc, etc.  The second reason why this e-mail pissed me off is because, again, it's another campaign that really doesn't address the root of why people smoke.  It's easier to blame the media than look at what kind of sociological and/or physchological reasons bring people to smoke.  I can say this because I, now, am an ex-smoker.  I didn't start chain smoking because I saw it in a movie.  In fact, there are very few smokers that I know that started because of seeing it in a movie.  Anti-smoking campaigns drive me nuts because they fill their commercials with "sobering" statistics about heart and lung disease in relation to smoking.  These, I would venture to say, are the same people who think they're being helpful when they say "you know those things are bad for you."     "Bad for me?  Whatever do you mean?  I seemed to have missed the GIANT warning label from the Surgeon General on the side of the package and let's not even mention the thousands of anti-smoking campaigns and people like you who point it out every time I have a cigarette.  In fact, this conversation is stressing me out so much that I'm going to have one.  Move now or I'll blow smoke in your face."   Honestly, I think anti-smoking campaigns need to move away from the health talk...or, at least, not make this the central message of everything.    I'll tell you why I started smoking (and, I truly believe that there are many people like me)...   Slow suicide .    Oh, I didn't wake up one morning and say to myself, "I think I want to slowly kill myself."  But, I think stress brings on both conscious and subconscious forms of depression which can put you in to contact with hidden forms of despair.  The anti-smoking commercials about health actually wanted to make me smoke more.  For example, those  urlLink thetruth.com  sports, I think, contributed to the rise in my smoking habbit.  Before they started airing, I smoked maybe half a pack a day.  After they started airing, a pack and half a day.  Sometimes, I tried to smoke 4 cigarettes while the PSA was airing just to spite them.  Maybe that's mean...but, it's the truth.  And, most smokers I know felt the same way about  urlLink thetruth.com .  So, what got me to stop?  Realizing that, for me, my issue...the issue that causes me the most stress is control.  By telling myself that I no longer controlled the cigarettes, but the cigarettes controlled me, I was able to stop...cold turkey, even.  Now, I'm not saying that everybody is the same as me, but what I am saying is that anti-smoking campaigns need to get a grip on what will realistically get people to stop smoking and buying from the corporations they find to be so evil.    Campaigns, such as the e-mail above, only indicate to me that anti-smoking advocates still don't get it.

            In my department at work, whenever it's somebody's birthday, we have this tradition of getting ice cream and then watching a movie.  This being Amy's birthday, we decided to watch  Saved!  because, interestingly enough, everyone in our department is a Mandy Moore fan.  For my birthday in January, we went to see another Mandy Moore film --  Chasing Liberty .  We're considering writing a letter to Ms. Moore and requesting that she release films in January and June to coincide with our birthday celebrations.  I'm not sure why I love Mandy Moore so much.  It's not like she's the greatest singer in the world and, frankly, after  Chasing Liberty , I wanted to say she's definitely not the greatest actress in the world.  But, she's sweet.  And, unlike the other teen pop divas, she did not decide to go the slutty route like Christina and Britney -- not that there's anything wrong with that...I think.  This film was definitely Moore's return to glory (I love to think of her as as an aging film star who's life is all about booze and then gets the part of her lifetime and is taken seriously -- er...maybe  i'm  the one who needs the booze).  One might even say it "saved" her...Get it?  Get the tie in?  Now, picture me drolly laughing like an aristocrat listening to a humorous story about Bitty or Kiki at tea time down at the country club.  Alright, moving on...I loved this film.  The film revolves around a set of friends who go to a Christian High School.  These kids listen to Christian music, have prayer circles and, when they're not busy, protest the local Planned Parenthood. Immediately, you got a sense that the film was going to lampoon religious fundamentalism, which I knew I would enjoy because I love religious fundamentalism as much as I love somebody vomiting in my mouth (in case you're still confused, I'll tell you right now...I would  not  like anybody vomiting in my mouth...ever).    Jena Malone plays Mary who finds out that her boyfriend is gay, tries to convert him by having sex with him and ends up getting pregnant.  I didn't get it until later, but let's just say that her name is  no  coincidence.  Mary's plight, however, creates a crisis of faith and, soon, she's no longer in the religious zealot circle, but hanging out with school outcasts -- Cassandra (the school's only Jewish student played by Susan Sarandon's daughter Eva Amurri), Roland (the kid in the wheelchair played by Macauly "The Comeback Kid" Culkin), and Patrick (the preacher's son played by Patrick Fugit).  Mandy Moore plays Hilary Faye who, up until the time of her crisis of faith, was Mary's best friend.  Because Moore's persona is so sweet and wholesome, she is perfect to play the fantatic Jesus loving popular girl. More importantly, though, Moore looks like she's having such fun...so much so that she convinces me that, if I ever entered an alternate universe where I was offered any role in this movie, I would have easily picked the role of Hilary Faye.  While I still love Moore in  A Walk To Remember  (DON'T LAUGH!), I think she does much better when she plays the...well...for lack of a better description...stuck-up bitch.  She played the same kind of role (minus the Jesus loving) in  The Princess Diaries  and she did well in that movie, too.  While this movie could have just gone all out and attacked religion and the Church, it chooses to expose "religious extremism" instead.  Faith is something that can be a critical part of a person's well-being.  But, when you start using faith to make yourself feel better at the expense of others, it's no longer the beautiful...it's no longer pure.  It becomes zealotry and fundamentalism instead.

      I'm not sure how I get these e-mails, but for some reasons, I receive the  Elder's Meditation of the Day .  I've always respected Native American ways and traditions, but, in this day when it seems all I see are  right wing, ultraconservative religious groups  tearing things down rather than teaching love and respect, I couldn't help but think how true this meditation rang true.   Elder's Meditation of the Day June 3    "IN THE BEGINNING were the Instructions...  The Instructions was to live in a good way and be respectful to everybody and everything."       --Vickie Downey, TEWA/Tesuque Pueblo     A long time ago, in the beginning, the Creator gave to all people and to all things the Wisdom and the knowledge of how to live in harmony.  Some tribes call these teachings the original Instructions, the original teachings, or the Great Laws.  All of Nature still lives and survives according to these teachings.  In modern times, human beings are searching for the Instructions.  Many churches claim they have these Instructions.  Where are these teachings? The Instructions are written in our hearts.        Great Spirit, today, whisper to me the secrets of the original Instructions.

      Today,  urlLink Gay Asian Pacific Islander Men of New York  (GAPIMNY) responded to a May 7  urlLink op-ed  that appeared in the  urlLink New York Blade  and the  urlLink Southern Voice .  The  urlLink op-ed , written by Cyd Zeigler, said that the lesbian and gay community was taking itself too seriously and listed a series of events and issues where Ziegler felt people overreacted.  One of those issues was the furor in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community about an offensive piece that ran in the April 2004  Details  magazine entitled "Gay or Asian?"  The  Details  article played stereotypes of the gay community off stereotypes of Asians.  The result was a terribly racist, homophobic and classist piece.    urlLink     Click on image for larger version      Ziegler wrote:     Gay men have had a very long history of being labeled "drama queens." Now we're putting the limit of that label to the test in public forums. Organizations that represent us to the larger world have perfected the art of taking a non-issue and blowing it out of proportion. I can only imagine that straight people in power have begun to tune us out. Remember the boy who cried wolf?   John Won, co-chair of Gay Asian & Pacific Islander Men of New York, said that his group and others explained to  Details  editors who had originally approved the "Gay or Asian" piece "how the piece made gay APIs feel like they had to choose between the two communities, how it made them feel invisible, and how it exacerbated homophobia in the API community."  But is there any hard evidence that it did any of those things? Sure, it was frat-boy humor. It was offensive - as much as a  South Park  or  Simpsons  episode.   In theory, what he says might make some sense. But did it really throw gay Asian-Americans into personal torment and subject them to mass ridicule?     In response to the op-ed, GAPIMNY Co-Chair Glenn D. Magpantay wrote:     As gay Asians, we deal with anti-gay bigotry in Asian American communities everyday. Young people just coming out deal with homophobic and racist messages from their peers and the media.  This builds a climate of fear, discrimination, and violence and worse, it makes gay Asians invisible and isolated.  If we didn't forcefully respond (as we did with a 200-person protest at  Details  magazine's office), I know one group who would have spoken up - straight Asians who objected to being called gay.  GAPIMNY not only addressed the racism, but also the homophobia coming out as people responded to the feature.  Zeigler takes a narrow, very white, view of our community.  For us, challenging racism, sexism, and classism, is just as important as challenging anti-gay bias.     While I'm all for a good joke myself, I am also appalled by Ziegler's op-ed which not only does very little in understanding the history of racism toward Asian Americans in the country and in the LGBT community but also fails to recognize the inner workings of social activism.  In order to promote change, you have to react in some way.  Now, Ziegler also seems to mainly be talking about media images, but we need to remember that people get most of their stereotypes from what they read in a newspaper or magazine, watch in a movie or on television or hear on the radio.  Reacting to a piece in  Details  magazine might not seem to carry the same weight as passing equal rights legislation for LGBT people, but it really does.  By challenging racism and homophobia in its most visible form, we promote understanding of one another.  GAPIMNY and other organizations raised visibility about the  Details  piece by launching a letter writing campaign, organizing  urlLink direct action protests  and proactive meetings with  Details  editorial staff.  Amongst one of the immediate results was an  urlLink apology  that runs in the June 2004 issue of  Details .   Details  Editor-In-Chief Daniel Peres wrote in his apology:      Sometimes you set out to be funny and simply blow it. There's a line  that should never be crossed in any satire, and Details stepped over  the line. I'm embarrassed that it took thousands of people -- including  members of my own staff -- to point out the hurtful and tasteless  nature of the "Gay or Asian?" piece. I regret not recognizing this  prior to publication. I made a mistake and I apologize, on behalf of  the magazine, to anyone who was offended.    I have since met with many of the people whose letters brought this  matter to my attention. Their determination and passion represent a  lesson I'll never forget.     I would like to clue Ziegler in on the last sentence.  How can you criticize anything that results in a lesson that somebody will "never forget?"  I, for one, am glad that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Asian American groups took themselves seriously and promoted change.  The world  is  a better place because we didn't sit back and laugh at this one...

        I happened to be Web surfing and was reading on  urlLink ASIANGUY  that the McDonald's&reg; Corporation had launched a Web site entitled  urlLink i am asian&trade; .   i am asian&trade;  teaches us that Asian and Pacific Islander Americans are "living on the rim."  What that means, I'm not exactly sure.  I don't know if McDonald's&reg; knows either as they also put "living on the rim" in quotation marks.  What cracked me up the most, though, was this sentence, "Whether we're sipping green tea or enjoying a Big Mac&reg; sandwich, we're helping make the magic mix called America become even richer."  You know, I think that everytime I sip green tea or eating a Big Mac&reg;.  Oh, dear lord, I'm lovin' it!   The site isn't all bad, though.  The site was set up to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and provides lots of nice information about different cultural celebrations with minimal corporate tie-ins.  I kept expecting to read somewhere in the entry on Rizal Day (a Filipino Holiday celebrated on December 30) that "Rizal Day commemorates the death of Jose Mercado Rizal, a Filipino physician, sculptor, poet, painter, and author whose books denounced the Spanish Administration AND who loved to have a Shamrock Shake and some fries after a day of writing."  But, while I want to credit McDonald's&reg; for acknowledging Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, it scares me that the phrase "I am Asian" is now trademarked by the McDonald's&reg; Corporation.  Does this mean I owe them money everytime I answer the question, "What is your racial background?"  Oh, well...it could be worse...it could be creepy like Burger King's  urlLink Subservient Chicken .

       FEDERAL JUDGE RULES ABORTION BAN UNCONSTITUTIONAL  Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the Federal Court of San Francisco ruled that the so-called "partial-birth abortion" ban is unconstitutional.  In the case of  Planned Parenthood Federation of America v. Ashcroft , Hamilton found the ban signed into law by President Bush in November 2003 to be too broad and would put undue burden on women seeking abortion.  She also found that the ban gave no exception for a woman's health or life.  The ban is the first federal abortion ban in over 30 years.  “Today’s ruling is a landmark victory for medical privacy rights and women’s health,” PPFA President Gloria Feldt said. “The Ashcroft Department of Justice can no longer threaten Planned Parenthood doctors with the daunting specter of criminal prosecution for putting their patients first.”    SOURCE:  Associated Press, June 1, 2004 Planned Parenthood press release, June 1, 2004    Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court delivered the 1973 landmark  Roe v. Wade  decision that gave women the legal right to have an abortion, anti-choice hardliners have systematically been trying to find ways to overturn it.  Unfortunately, anti-choice forces have become more sophisticated in their language.  For example, "Partial-birth abortion" is a totally fabricated term to make swing voters feel uncomfortable.  Thankfully, Hamilton saw through all of this and delivered a fair ruling.   To close off my commentary on this piece of news, I leave you with a quote by the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, "While there is much to be praised about our democracy, our country since its founding has recognized that there are certain fundamental liberties that are not to be left to the whims of an election. A woman's right to reproductive choice is one of those fundamental liberties."   It could not be said any better.     PRESIDENT BUSH RENEWS SUPPORT FOR FAITH-BASED INITIATIVES  President Bush is, once again, trying to push forth his initiative to offer government funding to faith-based agencies, organizations and charities.  Critics of this initiative say that this would interfere with one of our nation's founding principles of separation of church and state.  Others say that secular and non-faith based agencies would lose out to the increased funding given to faith based organizations.    SOURCE:  Associated Press, June 1, 2004    This is yet another part of President Bush's scramble to raise his approval rating.  Because of the giant SNAFU known as the occupation of Iraq, the President's approval rating is at an all time low and he knows he has to court his biggest supporters -- the Religious Right.  It's amazing to me because Bush, on one hand, expects me to pay taxes despite trying to ensure my being regarded as a second class citizen and, on the other hand, he wants those taxes to go to initiatives that I do not support.   I really want to be the person that respects people of all faiths, but the truth of the matter is that I have very little respect for them.  Unfortunately, the only time I hear about religion is when people use it to teach hatred, intollerance, disrespect, violence and war...I have seen up close and personal the signs that say "GOD HATES FAGS,"  I have heard as I'm leaving work "You're going to hell if you work here," and I have seen religious leaders take advantage of power by denying tradition because of a person's beliefs.  In my heart of hearts, I know that not every person of faith is like that.  But, I admit that it is sometimes hard to see beyond everything that I have experienced.     GAY CATHOLICS DENIED COMMUNION  In Chicago, IL, the Holy Name Cathedral denied communion to congregants wearing a rainbow sash as part of the growing Rainbow Sash Movement that symbolizes opposition to the Church's doctrine on homosexuality.  In St. Paul, MN, Catholic parishoners blocked other parishoners wearing the sash for communion.  In Colorado, a Bishop added support for same-sex marriages and stem cell research as other reasons to deny communion (previously, U.S. Bishops announced denying the sacrament to pro-choice Catholics).  Said Matthew Gallagher, Executive Director of DignityUSA (a gay Catholic group), "As much as we agree with the ultimate goal of inclusion for gays and lesbians, we do not agree with their tactics of interrupting the Eucharist."    SOURCE:  PlanetOut Network, June 1, 2004    Again, this whole conversation on the importance of communion is lost to me.  Frankly, I could give a damn.  But, I know it means something to some people.  I personally disagree with Gallagher.  If some Catholic leaders are going to exploit the Eucharist, why shouldn't activists seeking equality?  Unfortunately, sometimes moving ahead with equal rights requires challenging traditions and taking people out of their comfort zones.  So, while I have no real voice in the gay Catholic movement, I say, "You go, Rainbow Sash Movement Peeps!"     FEDERAL COURT SAYS 'GAY' NO LONGER DEFAMATION  The Federal Court In Boston ruled that being called 'gay' can no longer be construed as defamation.  James Albright, a former boyfriend of Madonna, sued Madonna's biographer Andrew Morton and St. Martin's Press for defamation, saying that Morton characterized him as 'gay' in his book.  Judge Nancy Gertner wrote in her opinion, "In this day and age, recent rulings by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts undermine any suggestion that a statement implying an individual is homosexual is defamatory."    SOURCE:  PlanetOut Network, June 1, 2004    I have a feeling that this will eventually be seen as a landmark case.  Unfortunately, "gay" is often thought of as something defamatory and it just isn't right.  In fact, I often try to shake it up by ocassionally exclaiming, "That's so gay!"  The immediate response is, "Oh, you're so riddled with internal homophobia!"  I, then, turn around and say, "Why do you assume that my exclamation means something bad?"   TOUCHÉ!

           All American without losing the Asianess...     I've been avoiding the reviews of  Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle  because I didn't want any bad reviews to prevent me from going opening weekend. It's not really the kind of film I prefer to see, but given the fact that you never see two Asian Americans as the main characters (that is, you don't unless they're martial artists or members of the Yakuza or something like that), I felt I had to support the film.  The movie revolves around two friends and roommates -- Harold (played by John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn). Harold is an uptight number cruncher of Korean descent while Kumar is an irresponsible, fun loving person of Indian descent. After smoking some pot and getting the munchies, the two decide to go on what would normally be an easy quest...the quest for the perfect food...in their minds, White Castle burgers. Instead, they end up embarking on a great journey that, by the end, changes their lives.  Now that I've seen the movie, I'm really torn because I both love it and hate it at the same time.  Let me start off with the good points. First of all, I'm always very excited when you see Asian Americans being plain, ordinary Americans. Granted, these are pot-smoking Americans, but Americans nonetheless. At the same time, their Asianess is not taken away from them either. I can relate to Cho's uptight Harold. We are product of the families that bred us to be conservative with our actions and emotions. At the same time, I can understand Kumar's post-graduate rebellion, a statement on the intense pressure sometimes brought on by Asian American families. In many ways, Harold and Kumar are people I know and people I'm related to.  With these characters, the film is able to tackle, in a humorous way, issues of racism and the emasculation of straight Asian American men, who, when they're not martial artists and members of the Yakuza, are often portrayed as weak, unsexy and passive.      Even the short jail scene contained a multitude of anti-gay jokes.    Now, for the bad points. As a gay man, I reviled the heterosexist jokes within the movie. The first one crops up within the first few minutes of the film and then they happen so often that I started to count. Then, as I was counting, I got distracted from the film. Then, I got so angry I lost count. When last I had focus, I was up to 17 heterosexist jokes. It was as if the film's writers and director are so uncomfortable with their own sexuality that they need to constantly remind the audience that straight men get freaky about gay sex or affection. Well, you know what, I find straight sex pretty gross, but you don't hear me going around cutting down straight sex, do you?  Now, I know that heterosexist and sexist humor is staple in the world of stoner films and not unique to  Harold and Kumar , but that doesn't make it right. You can still have a funny, drug induced comedy without constatly dragging gay men and women through the mud.  It's just disappointing that, as a gay Asian American man, I have to choose one part of me to support it and one side of me to criticize it. It's very hard for me to support a film that makes me feel uncomfortable to watch. At the same time, it's hard for me  not  to support a film that adds to the visibility of Asians in America.  And, believe me, I really want to like this film.  Cho and Penn are great in their respective roles, particularly Cho, who I think adds a great likeability to his character. When they find their car stolen, Cho's Harold reaches a breaking point where he screams long and loud. Cho does not just have Harold scream any scream. It is the repressed scream of a thousand years. He longs to flail about, but even in his brief chaotic fit, Harold is still controlled.       Is that really Doogie Howser?     And, admittedly, there were times where I genuinely laughed, including the scream I mentioned above, a cameo by Neil Patrick Harris (which I also found disturbing, but won't describe as it will be a disservice to those who actually want to see the film) and a part involving a Wilson Philipps song.  So, in the meantime, I'm giving  Harold and Kumar  almost the same review I gave  The Manchurian Candidate  -- I'm giving it   ONE THUMB UP, ONE THUMB DOWN, TWO AND A HALF STARS AND ONE RIPE AND ONE GREEN TOMATO  .

      I saw this  urlLink CNN article  posted on  urlLink AmericaBlog.org  and, after reading it, I'm thoroughly convinced that whether Bush is the "war president" (his original stance) or a "peace president" (his flip flopped stance since looking at the polls) is a moot argument. No, my friends, this  urlLink CNN article  proves he is THE DEATH PRESIDENT!   cue ominous music, lightning and thunder   Apparently, researchers will be publishing in the December issue of the journal Psychological Science and the September issue of the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin some scientific proof that Bush's use of fear tactics is making people want to vote for them. Bush? Trying to be underhanded in getting votes by playing into people's base fears? Perish the thought!  But, the most hilarious part of it all is that all this research indicates that Bush is a death president:       The volunteers were aged from 18 into their 50s and described themselves as ranging from liberal to deeply conservative. No matter what a person's political conviction, thinking about death made them tend to favor Bush, Solomon said. Otherwise, they preferred Kerry.  "I think this should concern anybody," [Sheldon] Solomon [of Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, who worked on the study,] said. "If I was speaking lightly, I would say that people in their, quote, right minds, unquote, don't care much for President Bush and his policies in Iraq."  He wants voters to be aware of psychological pressures and how they are used.  "If people are aware that thinking about death makes them act differently, then they don't act differently," Solomon said. Solomon says he personally opposes Bush but describes himself as a political independent who could vote Republican.      Thank goodness I'm aware. Oh, Mr. Bush, these tactics might be working for you somewhere, but you should remember the immortal words of Grand Jedi Master Yoda, "Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering."  And, we all know what happened to the guy who  didn't  listen to Yoda, don't we?    I'll stick with hope and the promise of peace and prosperity that John Kerry and John Edwards will be bringing us, thank you very much.   Hope is on the way!

           Margaret Cho rocks our world in her personal evolution    The evolution of Margaret Cho has been a fascinating one to watch. I remember seeing her at Luna Park in West Hollywood back in the early 1990s and thinking that she was definitely going to be one to watch out for. Her comedy, back then, was primarily biographical...about growing up as an Asian American, her family's book store on Polk and her mother. While she did celebrate the gay community, her comedy was not necessarily political.  Then,  All American Girl , her failed television show, happened and changed her life. She got hooked on drugs, but found her way back. Since her comeback, she has become increasingly more outspoken, particularly around politics. While you get a little of it in  Notorious C.H.O. , you get a lot of it in  Revolution .  Apparently, her new show  State of Emergency  is a deeply pointed look at politics from a decidedly liberal point of view. It's apparently so "controversial" that it caused her to be "disinvited" from an LGBT event held during the Democratic National Convention.  When I watched  Revolution , I wondered if it was a stand-up comedy act or something else.  As a comedy act, admittedly,  Revolution  is not a laugh riot. But, I realized that she's transcended beyond the stand-up act. She has now amassed quite a faithful following of both Asian Americans and gays (or, in my case, gay Asian Americans).  Revolution  showed me that, yes, she can be irreverantly humorous, but, for the most part, she's a preacher, preaching to her congregation.  I bring all this up because I just read...or really heard...her  urlLink last blog entry . Cho has lately been posting MP3 files of her commenting about recent events. Amongst the stories in week's "fireside chat" (if you will) are the Democratic National Convention, the murder of Scottie Weaver, and Pat Buchanan's comments about Teresa's "Shove It" versus Cheney's "Go fuck yourself." No, her audio commentary is not polished nor is it terribly funny, but, I don't think that's the way she intended them to be. Again, she is speaking to her fans about issues she cares about. I think about the number of people who read her blog and who might download the file. We live in a world where most youth are getting their news from more entertainment like sources, such as  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . Cho understands this and, in her own way, delivers. Like Ben Affleck, people look up to her and want to know what she thinks. She's become a role model with something to say. We need more people like that.  In addition to her blog, she's also been a constant presence at progressive events, supporting LGBT, women's and Asian American rights. Personally, I'd love to see her expand her repertoire and find a more permanent home. I know the LOGO-TV has been in talks with her about developing a show. Personally, I'd love to hear her on  urlLink Air America .  I think it's wonderful, this evolution of Margaret Cho. In a world where stand-up comics are really a dime-a-dozen, Margaret is constantly finding ways to reinvent herself so she stays relevant and true to her beliefs.

      Okay, you want to know one of the many reasons why I've given up on the Catholic Church, the Vatican has just released a document entitled  urlLink "On the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World,"  which basically says three things:   1.  Feminists are bad and are contributing to the destruction of family. 2.  Gay people are bad and are contributing to the destruction of family. 3.  Women should forget about careers, stay at home and be mothers. Now, granted, I do believe that if you're going to have children, there needs to be more emphasis placed on the children. But, I don't necessarily believe that the burden needs to be placed on the woman. The responsibility should be equal amongst the parents.  And, that's only if we're talking about two parent situations. The Vatican, of course, does not say anything about how single mothers should obey their doctrine, especially in a country where the bulk of the population is still trying to find ways to make ends meet. Of course not. Perish the thought. That would mean that either sex before marriage took place or a divorce happened, both of which are condemned by the Vatican.  It's amazing to me how out of touch the Vatican is with reality, yet Catholics follow its leadership with blind devotion.

           Dropping   Doonesbury  Another reason why conservatives are nitwits   I can't believe I missed this. In yet another right wing conservative attack on freedom of speech, the famous political cartoon  urlLink  Doonesbury   has been silenced in 38 newspapers primarily through the South.  Continental Features, a Sunday-comics consortium,  urlLink polled its clients after receiving complaints  about the comic strip and its criticism of the Bush Administration and the war on Iraq. One of the strip's regular characters, the football helmet wearing B.D., lost his leg fighting in the war.       Wilkerson said he conducted the survey because Garry Trudeau's comic "created more controversy than other strips." In the poll e-mail he sent Continental's newspaper clients this spring, Wilkerson wrote: "(I)t is my feeling that a change in one of the features is required. I have fielded numerous complaints about 'Doonesbury' in the past and feel it is time to drop this feature and add another in its place. ... If the majority of the group favors a replacement, you will be expected to accept that change."       The consortium voted 21-15 to remove the strip.  Of the 15, only  The Anniston  (Alabama)  Star  expressed its outrage at the decision.        As previously reported,  Star  Publisher H. Brandt Ayers e-mailed Wilkerson to say he and his paper's editors "strongly object to an obviously political effort to silence a minority point of view. For years, my New Deal father bore the opposition views of Orphan Annie and Daddy Warbucks, and I believe he would have fought an effort to silence them a by a simple majority vote. This is wrong, offensive to First Amendment freedoms."      The newspaper has also said that they will find a way to run the strip.  Good for  urlLink  The Anniston Star  .  If anybody in Alabama reads this, support the  Star  for sticking up for what is right and fair.  Also, understandably, strip creator Garry Trudeau decried the dropping of  Doonesbury  as an  urlLink "unfair process."         "The popularity of individual comic strips naturally waxes and wanes, and newspaper lineups will naturally reflect the evolving preferences of editors and readers," said Trudeau, in an e-mail response to an E&P request for comment. "Moreover, a consortium of papers will reflect those tastes imperfectly, a price the individual papers pay for joining it. However, in this case, 'Doonesbury' was singled out for internal polling because of the views of a single individual; other competing strips were not put to the same test. In this way, one opinion drove a process that eliminated the strip from 38 newspapers across the entire region, including 15 papers that wanted to keep it."      Granted, this is only 38 newspapers amongst roughly 1,400 which run  Doonesbury , but it highlights a  urlLink disturbing trend amongst conservatives to silence liberal voices .  Why is it that they hold in such esteem the right to bare arms, yet constantly fight against the freedom of speech?  You know, I can't stand the sight of right wing personalities such as Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Rielly and Sean Hannity, but I'm not fighting their right to use the media to speak their mind. That's what freedom of speech is all about. I can hate what they have to say, but I also have the right to turn it off, change the channel or flip the page. Let me tell you...that's what I do whenever I see George W. Bush's idiot smirk on television.  It reminds me of when Republicans tried to get the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) to make it illegal for organizations to use Bush's record or speak out against Bush during this year's elections. What if the Democrats tried to do the same, only about Kerry's record? The Bush campaign would have no Web site...that's what would happen. Check it out. While on  urlLink johnkerry.com , you have the majority of the Web site talking about Kerry/Edwards strategy and plans, on  urlLink georgewbush.com , the bulk of it is about trashing Kerry with little to no information about Bush himself. I find this ironic considering that the Republicans kept sending out press release after press release during the Democratic National Convention about how the Democrats kept attacking Bush. Again, I ask you -- what is this about flip flops?

          Denzel Washington : A Man With A Dream   My mind is still reeling from watching  The Manchurian Candidate  this evening, but I'm not quite sure which way it's reeling yet. The film is a remake of the classic 1962 film that has set the bar for all other political movie commentary. The original film, starring Frank Sinatra and Angela Landsbury, commented on the Cold War and the communist threat. To make the film more relevant to today's audience, director Jonathan Demme ( Silence of the Lambs     Liev Schreiber : Mama's Boy?   Unfortunately, I felt like the film spent too much time in either the bleakness of the world being painted -- long, pained looks from Marco or Shaw, inordinately long scenes of phones ringing as the characters do nothing, time spent panning through lonely apartments -- or artfully trying to show us surreal images of the soldier's dreams. For example, what did the Arab women have to do with the dream? It just seemed like so much was going on that it took away from the statement on the American political scene.  But, just as I commend the movie for its reflections on current day politics, it's not enough. I felt like, while the themes were there, this was a presidential campaign that just couldn't happen. For example, the last minute Vice President swap at the convention? We live in a world where we think the presidential candidate is NUTS if they haven't announced a running mate going into the conventions. Then, I thought it weird that these two diametrically opposed politicians (Voigt's liberal Jordan and Streep's ultra-conservative Prentiss Shaw) were from the same party. We live in a world of extremely polarized politics. While there are moderate politicans in the party, you never see people of two extremes. Finally, the politicans themselves did not seem like people Americans would actually elect. In this election season, where Americans were clamoring to know more about John Kerry and are criticizing the opinions of Teresa Heinz Kerry, why would people be thrilled about a plastic presidential candidate, a cardboard vice presidential candidate and a dragon lady like Senator?      Meryl Streep:  Cartoon Extravaganza   A note on Meryl Streep's performance which some have called brilliant and other's have called strangely distracting. I liked Meryl Streep's performance. What's funny is that many newspapers have drawn comparissons to her and Hillary Clinton. While, yes, the two are the junior Senators from New York, Streep has said that she drew more inspiration from the likes of Karen Hughes, the heinous campaign adviser for Bush/Cheney 2004. I believe the latter. Meryl did not go for the intense creepiness of Landsbury, but, instead, gave us an almost cartoony and completely  over-the-top performance. She's more  Death Becomes Her  than  Sophie's Choice  in this film.  And, that's okay.  And, finally, the best thing to me was the cameo by Mr. Al Franken as, of all things, an objective journalist.  We love you, Al!  So, I give  Manchurian Candidate    ONE THUMB UP, ONE THUMB DOWN, TWO AND A HALF STARS AND ONE RIPE AND ONE GREEN TOMATO  .

      "Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy -- or go on Prozac?"  This, apparently, is the  urlLink Bush campaign's solution  to Americans who are unhappy with low-quality jobs.  Or, at least, these are the words of Susan Sheybani, an assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt.  She later said she was "just kidding."  Phew...thank, God.  God forbid the Bush campaign suggest Americans taking a drug that is not available on many health insurance plans and unaccessible to those without insurance all together.  That might be considered...oh...extremely insensitive.    Of course, in all seriousness, Sheybani would have  really  prescribed Paxil or Zoloft rather than Prozac.

      No matter what people might say about it being boring and not having enough "red meat" or being too scripted, I'm really jazzed by the Democratic National Convention. Really jazzed.  But, I'm trying to watch myself. I'm so excited that I wonder if things don't go the way I want to them -- basically, the complete and utter anhihilation of George W. Bush at the polls -- I might get depressed later on. So, when I read on  urlLink AmericaBlog.org  that  urlLink some Republicans have been defecting to Kerry's camp  or when I read on  urlLink Atrios' Blog  that  urlLink a post-convention Zogby poll shows Bush's numbers falling , I almost have to sit down, breathe and put some perspective into it.  There is always a bounce after the conventions.  At the same time, it would be so lovely if Bush's numbers just continued to fall. Speaking of the Zogby poll, it's heartening to read that "...among young voters – 18-29 year olds – a group Al Gore only won by 2 points in 2000, Kerry is winning in a landslide, 53% to 33%." I was reading an early poll that revealed youth support for Bush much higher, which was really surprising to me. In fact, even knowing that Al Gore won amongst youth by 2 points is astounding.  Another heartening stat is Kerry's numbers amongst the Latino population -- "Mr. Bush is also running far behind his 2000 Hispanic total, with only 19% of the Hispanic voters supporting him, while Mr. Kerry is beating Mr. Gore’s total with 69%." In 2000, it seemed that Bush had a substantial Latino vote, particularly amongst Cubans who lived in Florida. That is a giant difference in favor of Kerry.  But, the most interesting number is probably amongst those who didn't vote in 2000 or wasted their vote voting for Nader -- "Mr. Kerry is showing a 2-to-1 lead (50% to 25%) amongst voters who didn’t vote in 2000, while winning three-quarters (75%) of Ralph Nader’s voters and stealing twice as many (8% to 4%) of Mr. Bush voters in 2000 than Bush is stealing of Gore voters in 2000." Hopefully, this means that we will have a larger turnout of unlikely voters participating this year and helping vote Kerry into office.  So, I will be optimistic, but realistically optimistic.

           We love you, Ben!    It's interesting to me that people are trying to discredit Ben Affleck for his constant appearance at the Democratic National Convention. It seemed like every time you turned on the television,  urlLink Ben Affleck was there .  Some have even accused him of  urlLink setting his eye on something higher , such as a political office or a future presidency himself (why not?  Reagan did it).  Personally, I commend him...and, no, not (just) because he's cute. His being an actor doesn't mean that he's not also an American willing to participate in the process. He's obviously one of the bright, young actors would could be spending his time living a life in excess in Hollywood. But, he's decided to spend his time helping the Democrats win in 2004. And, not only that, apparently, he'll also be going on  urlLink tour with John Kerry and John Edwards  and campaigning for them.  Young people look up to Ben Affleck and, if he uses his star power to help out, why not? Why complain? I applaud the fact that he's not just trying to be a face, but actually trying to do something.  FURTHERMORE, I have even more respect for  urlLink Affleck having spoken at the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Caucus  at the DNC. He told the crowd, "Gay and lesbian and transgender Americans are exactly that -- Americans. They're entitled to the same goddamned right as any other American, and to say otherwise is outrageous and offensive."  Sigh...we love you, Ben!

      I'm seriously annoyed with how everyone keeps  urlLink picking on Teresa Heinz Kerry .  It just reminds me how sexist the Republicans are.  They believe that women should be barefoot and pregnant or, at least, stay at home and stand by their man.    No, she doesn't hide her emotion well and that she mystifies people with her accent, but we know what we're getting with Mrs. Heinz Kerry.  We're definitely not getting the kind of Stepford Wife type personality that the Republican party loves so much.  I mean, what do we really know about Laura Bush?  Nothing.  I've loved the fact that the women in John Kerry's family have been able to speak their mind, from Teresa's "shove it" to Vanessa's being outspoken about her support of same-sex marriage.  Those are the kind of role models I would like the young women of our nation to have.

          It's privacy rights, stupid!    I was watching President Bush on CNN this morning right before I went into work.  He was in Missouri, launching his "Heart and Soul Tour: Moving America Forward."  My immediate thought is, that's nice...at least he's thinking about moving forward rather than the backward motion in which we have been moving for the last four years.  But, hey...isn't it too little, too late?  Anyway, one of the ways in which he is moving forward is...and I wish I had the transcript of this, but I remember the words quite well...that he believes medical decisions "should be made by the patient and their doctors -- not Washington Bureaucrats."  (That's not paraphrasing.  I was so shocked when he said this, I had to actually write it down).    Yes, folks!  This from the president who wrote the first abortion ban into law in over 30 years...one that clearly places decisions in the hands of the government rather than the woman, her doctor and her family.   WHO IS THE ULTIMATE FLIP FLOPPER NOW?   President Bush, if you truly believe what you say, then don't sign legislation that disregards people's health and lives while supporting government intrusion into personal and private decision making.

      I love the fact that CNN takes  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart  so seriously.  Actually, the should given that the media loves to bring up the fact that many young people get their news first hand from  The Daily Show .  Anyway, the reason why I bring this up is because Daryn Kagan was interviewing  The Daily Show 's Samantha Bee (easily my favorite "commentator" on the show).  Kagan was asking Bee (who is Canadian) what she thought of the Convention.    KAGAN:  But as a Canadian, what do you think of this whole American political scene really?   BEE:  Well, it's so different from our scene up in Canada. It's the pageantry. My God, the megawatt star-power here -- it's something that I never knew was possible. It's wonderful.    KAGAN:  The Canadian...   BEE:  Very exciting for me.   KAGAN:  The Canadian folks a little bit more reserved?   BEE:  A little bit more reserved. Yes, not so much with the P. Diddy and the Black Eyed Peas. We're more about Celtic rock, things you never heard of -- French-Canadian rock. It's not pleasant. It's not pretty. Anyway, probably only I find this amusing, but I was listening to convention coverage on the way home from work on NPR.  When they went for a short break, what kind of music did they decide to play?  Celtic music.  Okay...I thought it was funny...So, leave me alone.

      Ah, the final night of the Democratic National Convention 2004! It was a night of stories of Vietnam, reviving hamsters, magical balloon madness...oh, and, yes, a great convention speech by the future President of the United States.  As the media keeps talking about, this was a night where John Kerry had to let the public know more about him. For tonight's line-up of speakers, I felt that Kerry focused primarily on his heroism in Vietnam and his love for his family, two things that the Republican Party cannot dispute.            Under John Kerry we will attack and destroy the terrorist threats to America. He'll join the pantheon of great wartime Democrats.           WESLEY CLARK   Former presidential candidate General  urlLink Wesley Clark  was meant to bring credibility to John Kerry as the Commander and Chief of this great nation. Clark is very well respected in the military and it would be hard to find somebody who would dispute his credentials.  First, Clark spoke to those beyond the base, specifically to the enlisted. There has long been misconception that Republicans are the backers of a strong military. The Republicans love to bring back images of the Vietnam war protests...and, why not? Iraq is our generation's Vietnam. Anyway, it's their opportunity to say anti-war=communist=Democrat.    CLARK:  War. I've been there. Heard the thump of enemy mortars. Seen the tracers fly. Bled on the battlefield. Recovered in hospitals. Received and obeyed orders. Sent men and women into battle. Awarded medals, comforted families, attended funerals. And this soldier has news for you: Anyone who tells you that one political party has a monopoly on the defense of our nation is committing a fraud on the American people. Franklin Roosevelt said it best: "Repetition does not transform a lie into the truth." Then, General Clark lays out a credible plan that the Democrats are moving forward with. He reinforces that this is not about destroying the military, but, as many during the convention have implied, that strength and wisdom are not opposites. The Democrats believe in being "smarter."    CLARK:  The safety of our country demands urgent and innovative measures to strengthen our armed forces. The safety of our country demands credible intelligence. The safety of our country demands cooperation with our allies. The safety of our country demands making more friends and fewer enemies. The safety of our country demands an end to the doctrinaire, ineffective policies that currently grip Washington. Finally, Clark makes the very clear point that Democrats make good leaders, particularly John Kerry...a war hero.  Under John Kerry we will attack and destroy the terrorist threats to America. He'll join the pantheon of great wartime Democrats.  Great Democrats like Woodrow Wilson, who led us to victory in World War 1. Great Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, who turned back the tide of fascism to win World War II. Great Democrats like John Kennedy, who stood firm and steered us safely through the Cuban Missile Crisis. And great Democrats like Bill Clinton (news - web sites), who confronted ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia, and with diplomacy — backed by force — brought peace to a shattered land.  My fellow Americans, Democrats are leaders. Democrats are fighters. John Kerry is a leader and fighter and he will be a great Commander in Chief.Well done, General Clark.              Vanessa: We are in a season of great possibility and great hope. And for me that possibility is marked by a tree now on my father's desk. The leaves are a little worn but the message is still strong. It is one of promise, and hope, of a willing ear and unconditional love, of unwavering respect, and the most important quality which makes all else possible (and I assure you is in his gut) — integrity.  Alexandra: And if we want our children to breathe clean air and drink clean water, if we want them to control their own bodies, if we want them to protect the liberties and opportunities that are our birthrights, we must he involved in the struggle. Because on that day, my father was right, we are the luckiest people in the world. We walk on this soil. We feel this sun. And we are Americans.           VANESSA AND ALEXANDRA KERRY   During this campaign, I feel like I've gotten to know Vanessa a little better than Alexandra.   urlLink ">Vanessa Kerry , the younger one, has actually been rather outspoken about same-sex marriage. She outright supports it and has even written an  urlLink opinion piece  for  urlLink  The Advocate  Magazine .  She is a  urlLink true advocate  for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, earning my deepest gratitude and respect. Vanessa was the first to go up and speak about her father. She chose to speak of integrity:    V. KERRY:  I would like to give you all an inside scoop on this past December. I traveled with my father almost every day of that long, cold month. And I promise you there was not one moment where he doubted his ability to win. Not one week when he lost his fight. He was convinced when others were not. He had the courage to take risks and to fight for his beliefs when others may have given up. He never wavered, he never faltered and he stayed the course.  In that snowy month at a Derry, N.H., chili feed, my father looked to the packed crowd and said, "I want you to look at my heart, my mind and my gut and ask yourself, what kind of president will I be?" It is an important question. What will guide the conscience of a man in his toughest hours, amid the hardest decisions?  Here's my answer. My father loves this country and is ready to lead it. He believes in challenging oneself to dream and to follow. He believes that fear is limiting, while determination, innovation and optimism will allow us to surpass our own best hopes. And at my father's core is integrity. Vanessa's statements remind me of the famed Jenna and Barb Bush chat, but not because I think they're similar. I've never felt Jenna and Barb being part of the Bush/Chenney Campaign, despite the First Daughters protests that they were not asked to be brought on. Vanessa has been there since the beginning. Her example reminds me how visible she's been since the start. And, the story she tells is so much more telling and loving than any of the canned answers that Jenna and Barb supposedly gave. Vanessa then concludes with a look to the future...    V. KERRY:  We are in a season of great possibility and great hope. And for me that possibility is marked by a tree now on my father's desk. The leaves are a little worn but the message is still strong. It is one of promise, and hope, of a willing ear and unconditional love, of unwavering respect, and the most important quality which makes all else possible (and I assure you is in his gut) — integrity.  Vanessa than introduced her sister  urlLink Alexandra Kerry , who has not been as out front as her younger sister. But, Alexandra is still a very smart young woman who obviously loves her father. Alexandra takes a more personal anecdotal approach, telling a story about how her father rescued her sister's drowning hamster. Then, she told a story that made you realize what a great role model her father has been:    A. KERRY:  Years later, when I was driving back to college with him, brooding as only a nineteen-year-old can, my father told me to look outside. He said, "Ali, this is a beautiful day. Feel the sun. Look at the country you live in." The passion of his words makes me remember them, still, ten years later. He said: "I know men your exact age, who thought they had the same future you have. Whose families were never born, who never again walked on American soil. They don't feel this sun. Ali," he said. "If there's something you don't like, something that needs to be changed, change it. But never, ever give up. Remember that you are alive. And that you are an American. Those two things make you the luckiest girl in the world." She concludes her introduction by speaking to the crowd about the lessons she's learned. To youth everywhere, she reaches out and says the future is in our hands.   And if we want our children to breathe clean air and drink clean water, if we want them to control their own bodies, if we want them to protect the liberties and opportunities that are our birthrights, we must he involved in the struggle. Because on that day, my father was right, we are the luckiest people in the world. We walk on this soil. We feel this sun. And we are Americans. I'm very impressed with John Kerry's daughters.  They're smart, savvy and beautiful!              Tonight, I'd like to let you know, that even before I met John Kerry, he was my brother. Even before I knew John Kerry, he was my friend. Even before I spoke with John Kerry, he gave me hope.           MAX CLELAND   The former Senator from Georgia and Vietnam War hero  urlLink Max Cleland  was the man charged with introducing John Kerry. The Convention had just brought out all the men who had served with John Kerry in Vietnam and Max Cleland was to drive the message home that John Kerry was a decisive war hero who is able to make a distinction for when war is necessary. Actually, I was quite touched by the fact that Kerry's "band of brothers," as they called themselves, came to support him. I remember listening to Air America the other day and one of these men challenging the Republicans who challenge Kerry's service in Vietnam. The man asked why, if the Republicans contend that Bush was such a big time servicemember, there are no men out there coming forward and telling stories of heroism about Bush. Why is that? Could it be because the only other person we know in connection of Bush's supposed enlisted services was James R. Bath, financial adviser to the Bin Ladens?  Anyway, I'm really talking about Cleland here. Cleland did not serve directly with Kerry, but, he speaks to the countless enlisted who needed a hero, particularly in a war like the Vietnam War...or, even the War on Iraq. Cleland told a very personal story about how Kerry affected his life:    CLELAND:  While John Kerry was earning a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts, I was being treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. I was 25 years old. My body was broken and my faith was shattered. One day, on leave from the hospital, a friend was pushing me around the city, in my new wheelchair. In front of the White House, it hit a curb. I fell forward out of the wheelchair. There were cigarette butts and trash all around me. I remember trying to lift myself up off the street. I was angry at the war. Saddened that veterans weren't getting good care. And frustrated that people in power weren't listening. Those were difficult days for me.  But, I ultimately realized that although I had lost a lot, I still had a lot left, and I resolved to make something of my life. I decided to run for the State Senate in Georgia. I won, but when I got there, in 1971, I was a lone voice.  Then I heard this young veteran on TV speaking about the war. It was John Kerry. He put everything I was feeling into words.  Tonight, I'd like to let you know, that even before I met John Kerry, he was my brother. Even before I knew John Kerry, he was my friend. Even before I spoke with John Kerry, he gave me hope.               I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.           JOHN KERRY   Finally,  urlLink John Kerry  came in to accept his nomination from the Democratic Party. All week long, the media has been speculating about what he will be saying and that he must give voters an idea of what he's all about. When Cleland introduced him, Kerry strolled down a red carpet to the podium as if he were some kind of rock star and then gave hugs and handshakes to his "band of brothers." It was clear that these men thought highly of John Kerry.  Then, with a salute, Kerry gave a salute and said, "I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty."  The crowd, of course, went wild.  Kerry started his almost hour long speech with stories of his growing up and how his parents influenced his life. Admittedly, this was the most boring part of the speech for me. I never really understood when the media kept saying that Kerry needs to give voters an idea of who he is. I already feel like I know who he is. I don't need to know about his background. I want to know how he's moving forward.  That, my friends, is when Kerry really gets into it. And, he says it with such passion that even his staunchest critics about Kerry being stiff had to admit that there was a fire going there. And, despite reports that Kerry would not make pointed remarks about the Bush Administration, he did. And, it was wonderful. At first, he caught us off guard when he said:    KERRY:  We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil. What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?  I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation -- not the Saudi royal family. Hmmm...who's he talking about when he says the Saudi royal family. Oh, that's right. President Bush because...see...his family has a strong connection with the Saudi royal family. See? Get it?  But, then, I literally jumped to my feet and screamed myself hoarse when Kerry said:    KERRY:  I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States. No, he didn't say the "gay" word.  But, you'd have to be an idiot not to know what Kerry was referring to.  And, finally, Kerry spoke to the Republican Party's hijacking of religion. Republicans like to portray us as godless heathens. And, yes, some of us are. But, there are just as many Democratic people of faith. The difference between Republicans and Democrats about religion are clearly summed up in Kerry's remarks:    KERRY:  And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country. God, I can't wait for Kerry to take the Presidency. I'm bummed, though, that the convention is over. I've gotten totally jazzed up during the last four days. I'm hoping that Kerry gets the giant bounce he deserves coming out of the convention. Whatever the case might be, I'm ready to do my work and get Kerry into the White House!

      Okay...this is the strangest little story ever.  Apparently, there is a road in Texas called  urlLink JAP ROAD .       And, yes...it's what you're thinking.  JAP is the same Jap used as a deragatory term to describe people of Japanese (and sometimes Asian in general) descent.    Of course, the name has been the subject of protest.  So, why is this road named JAP ROAD?       Those who wanted to keep the name said it honored Yasuo Mayumi, the Japanese rice farmer who lived there and whose ancestry gave the road its name in 1905.       1905?  This fight has been going on for 101 years?  And, what do you do when people are offended by the name of a road with a sentimental honor?  Apparently, you don't try to just name it after the Japanese rice farmer.  You just forget about the Japanese rice farmer all together and called it Boondock Road.    Interesting enough, Boondock is the only English word that comes from Tagalog, the language of the Philippines.  It comes from the word Bundok, which means mountain.    So, a road meant to honor a Japanese farmer is given an offensive name and is ultimately changed to a name whose root comes from the Philippines.  That's AMERICA!

      I've been a little crazed the last few days that I haven't had time to comment on the fact that the  urlLink Democratic Platform  has added language about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights.  According to  urlLink PlanetOut :       The DNC's Platform Committee finished the platform on Saturday. Among the issues included are:    Protections for GLBT families;   Legislation barring workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation;   Opening the armed services to all Americans;   Fighting HIV/AIDS with community-based prevention programs that President Bush has cut;   Protecting GLBT Americans from hate crimes; and,   Defeating the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA), the proposed constitutional amendment aimed at outlawing same-sex marriage across the country.  DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe claimed the platform proves the Democratic Party and the presidential ticket of Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and John Edwards, D-N.C., are committed to protecting GLBT Americans.  The DNC also named Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., as convention vice chair, making her the first openly gay vice chair of a national political convention.       This historic inclusion is seen by some as a giant step forward while others are decrying that it isn't enough.  The biggest specific argument is that the platform does not outright support same-sex marriage.  Located in the "A Strong American Community" section of the platform, the passage in question reads:   We support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibilities, benefits, and protections for these families.  In our country, marriage has been defined at the state level for 200 years, and we believe it should continue to be defined there.  We repudiate President Bush's divisive effort to politicize the Constitution by pursuing a "Federal Marriage Amendment."  Our goal is to bring Americans together, not drive them apart.   Now, maybe it's me talking from the perspective of a person who's watched the same-sex marriage issue for the last 12 years, but I think that this is a giant step forward.  Again, I think back to the days of the 1992 election when "gays in the military" was the first gay anything talked about in mainstream politics.  It seems to me that a passage that supports gay and lesbian families and equal protections is an incredible leap forward.  No, it's not everything that we want and, of course, I would love to see the platform say that the Democrats support same-sex marriage.  We want for John Kerry to say that he is going to champion this cause.    But, again, the political reality is that this issue could easily polarize the Democratic party itself.  Democrats are experiencing a great unity this year that it hasn't experienced in a long time.  This is a good thing.  The party does not need to be divided -- especially, now when it is critical to get Bush out of office.  That said, the voices that challenge the Democratic Party are going to be very important.  Once Kerry is in office, let these voices be heard to both educate and promote change.    But, for now, I join the  urlLink multitude of other lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Democrats  in fully supporting the platform and John Kerry and John Edwards in 2004.

      Unfortunately, I didn't get to catch a great deal of the Democratic National Convention on its third night because I was at a meeting.  But, I wanted to comment on those speeches I did get to see...            I suggest to you tonight that if George Bush had selected the court in '54, Clarence Thomas would have never got to law school.           AL SHARPTON   Okay, I remember the race for the primaries and  urlLink Al Sharpton  was still running for presidency.  I think everybody dismissed him as the guy with the crazy hair running just for the hell of it.  But, as I got to listen to Al Sharpton since he decided to endorse the Kerry/Edwards ticket and his subsequent interviews afterward, I developed a respect for him.  He is a man that is trying to get a message across by trying to engage the African American community in the election process and increase its voter participation.  That, my friends, is a wonderful thing.  From what I understand, Sharpton was only supposed to speak for six minutes.  But, Sharpton asked the Kerry/Edwards campaign if he could address the questions that Bush raised at the Urban League national convention earlier this month.  When Kerry gave the go ahead, Sharpton spoke beyond his prepared speech for 20 minutes that really energized the crowd.  He was definitely being the revered speaking to his congregation.    SHARPTON:  Mr. President, as I close, Mr. President, I heard you say Friday that you had questions for voters, particularly African- American voters. And you asked the question: Did the Democratic Party take us for granted? Well, I have raised questions. But let me answer your question.  You said the Republican Party was the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. It is true that Mr. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, after which there was a commitment to give 40 acres and a mule.  That's where the argument, to this day, of reparations starts. We never got the 40 acres. We went all the way to Herbert Hoover, and we never got the 40 acres.  We didn't get the mule. So we decided we'd ride this donkey as far as it would take us.  Mr. President, you said would we have more leverage if both parties got our votes, but we didn't come this far playing political games. It was those that earned our vote that got our vote. We got the Civil Rights Act under a Democrat. We got the Voting Rights Act under a Democrat. We got the right to organize under Democrats.  Mr. President, the reason we are fighting so hard, the reason we took Florida so seriously, is our right to vote wasn't gained because of our age. Our vote was soaked in the blood of martyrs, soaked in the blood of good men (inaudible) soaked in the blood of four little girls in Birmingham. This vote is sacred to us.  This vote can't be bargained away.  This vote can't be given away.  Mr. President, in all due respect, Mr. President, read my lips: Our vote is not for sale.  The media keep remarking how much he went off message and that the Kerry campaign must be upset for his continuous attacks on Bush.  My personal favorite, and one that drew much applause, was when Sharpton said:   This court has voted five to four on critical issues of women's rights and civil rights. It is frightening to think that the gains of civil and women rights and those movements in the last century could be reversed if this administration is in the White House in these next four years.  I suggest to you tonight that if George Bush had selected the court in '54, Clarence Thomas would have never got to law school. I'm sorry.  That was brilliant and needed to be said.  As a gay man working for a women's rights organization, I understand what Sharpton is saying all too well.  I applaud Sharpton.  Bush had the audacity to question the African American community by making it sound like the Republicans have done more for the community without anything to show for it.  Sharpton needed to strike back for the African American community.  The Democrats have always gotten the lion's share of the African American vote.  So, nobody should be upset by this.  In fact, the Democrats should be grateful at the resounding endorsement of the party Sharpton gave.              Hope is on the way!           JOHN EDWARDS   You know, when  urlLink John Edwards  was running for the primary, I remember hearing him talk about the same-sex marriage issue.  And, to tell you the truth, he seemed the most disconnected from it.  But, since he became John Kerry's running mate and I got to get to watch him a little bit more in action, I've come to love him.    Edwards got, perhaps, the most rousing greeting from the convention so far.  And, rightfully so.  We've all put our hopes and dreams into him and John Kerry.  Edwards, of course, is supposed to contrast Kerry's New England riche personality and represent the everyday person.    EDWARDS:   I grew up in a small town in rural North Carolina. My father worked in a mill all his life, and I will never forget the men and women who worked with him. They had lint in their hair and grease on their faces. They worked hard and tried to put a little something away every week so their kids and their grandkids could have a better life. They are just like the auto workers, office workers, teachers, and shop keepers on Main Streets all across America.  My mother had a number of jobs. Her last job was working at the post office so my parents could have health care. And she owned her own small business — refinishing furniture to help pay for me to go to college.  I have had such incredible opportunities in my life, and I was blessed to be the first person in my family to go to college. I worked my way through, and I have had opportunities way beyond what I could have ever imagined. In other words...  I come from you.  I am you.  And, with the hope that John Kerry and I will restore to the nation, we can be one.  It's a good message.  Then, he addressed Republican attacks on him being a trial lawyer and taking the big scary out of it for the everyday person (of which, he represents):    EDWARDS:   I have spent my life fighting for the kind of people I grew up with. For two decades, I stood with families and children against big HMOs and big insurance companies. And as a Senator, I fought those same fights against the Washington lobbyists and for causes like the Patients' Bill of Rights. Then, Edwards told us that there is a plan, but before telling us what the plan was, he addressed  me .  No, not me specifically, but me, the everyday person that he represents:    EDWARDS:   We shouldn't have two different economies in America: one for people who are set for life, their kids and grandkids will be just fine, and then one for most Americans who live paycheck to paycheck.  And you know what I'm saying. You don't need me to explain it to you, you know — you can't save any money, can you? Takes every dime you make just to pay your bills, and you know what happens if something goes wrong — a child gets sick, somebody gets laid off, or there's a financial problem, you go right off the cliff.  And what's the first thing to go. Your dreams. It doesn't have to be that way. Edwards speaks of the "Two Americas" that we have heard the Kerry/Edwards campaign speak of.  As a person who still does live almost paycheck to paycheck, I know these two Americas.  I am not in Bush's "haves and have mores," I am in Edwards' America -- the land of the everyday people.  He has me at the edge of my seat and then tells me what I want to hear -- a definite plan and one that I can truly get behind:    EDWARDS:   To help you pay for health care, a tax break and health care reform to lower your premiums up to $1,000. To help you cover the rising costs of child care, a tax credit up to $1,000 to cover those costs so your kids have a safe place to go while you work. And to help your child have the same chance I had and be the first person in your family to go to college, a tax break on up to $4,000 in tuition.  So now you ask how are we going to pay for this? Well, here's how we're going to pay for it. Let me be very clear, for 98 percent of Americans, you will keep your tax cut-that's 98 percent. But we'll roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, close corporate loopholes, and cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move our country forward without passing the bill and the burden on to our children and grandchildren.  We can also do something about 35 million Americans who live in poverty every day. Here's the reason we should not just talk about it, but do something about millions of Americans who still live in poverty, because it is wrong. We have a moral responsibility to lift those families up. Thank you, Mr. Edwards.  I look forward to your solution to making America one again.  Edwards also spent some time building up John Kerry, talking about his military record and his heroism.  But, then, he said some very definitive words that the Democrats have not said yet.  These are words that evoke the kind of strength that even conservatives want to hear:    EDWARDS:   And we will have one clear unmistakable message for al Qaida and the rest of these terrorists. You cannot run. You cannot hide. And we will destroy you. But, finally, he left us with words of optimism with the catch phrase that will define his convention speech:    EDWARDS:   Hope is on the way. Again, I look forward to Kerry/Edwards ONE AMERICA.

      I actually had a chance of watching the really akward moment between Michael Moore and Bill Hemmer on  American Morning  on Monday morning.      HEMMER:  Let's move away from that. I've heard people say Michael Moore is the greatest living American.   MOORE:  Oh, who are those people?   HEMMER:  I've heard people say they wish Michael Moore were dead.   MOORE:  Oh, well. Jeez, who would say that?   HEMMER:  How do you take in the reaction that you are getting? And there is no one who is neutral after they see your film.   MOORE:  Well, there's a -- there's that minority of Republicans and right-wingers who are upset, because they know their days of numbered. I'd be upset, too, if I were them. You know, they've only got a few more months left in charge. And so they're all running around, all saying crazy things like that.   HEMMER:  The DNC did not invite you here, is that right?   MOORE:  The Congressional Black Caucus invited me here, yes. Yes.   HEMMER:  Enjoy your week. Actually, reading the transcript doesn't really reflect the akwardness. Moore was obviously shook up by Hemmer's telling Moore that "I've heard people say they wish Michael Moore were dead." Also, I'm not sure why, but the transcript doesn't reflect that Hemmer cut off Moore while he was answering the question about the DNC not inviting him. Well, apparently, there was a part that I, as a TV viewer, did not get to see, reported CNN.com Producer Susan Pettit in CNN's  urlLink blog entry  of the first day of the convention.       Michael Moore was not happy. In fact, he was very angry.  " 'Some people want you dead?' " the "Fahrenheit 9/11" filmmaker said to CNN's Bill Hemmer Monday morning on the floor of FleetCenter. " 'Some people want you dead,' Bill? Why would you say that on live TV? Would you say that to Bush or Kerry?"  Hemmer was on a platform set talking with a producer when Moore approached, a gaggle of cameras, boom mikes and reporters in tow. "I'll be with you in a second, Michael," Hemmer said. Moore turned and walked away, the clot of reporters turning in unison.  "What was that about?" someone shouted.  "You'll have to watch CNN," Moore muttered and disappeared into the clutch of reporters.      Now, I don't think that Hemmer was trying to challenge Moore and I'll admit that Moore can have the flair for the dramatics, but it bothered me how Pettit left her entry:       The thing is, you'd think Moore would be in a good mood. "Fahrenheit" recently passed $100 million at the box office -- a key tally for any film, and particularly for a politically charged documentary that cost a fraction of that amount to make.  CNN's Kelly Wallace adds that Moore stayed with reporters for 2 1/2 hours after the interview. As some reporters left, others took their place. "This as other newsmakers were walking around the floor ... and no one seemed to pay them any attention ... such as former Secy. of State Madeleine Albright."      First of all, it is kinda tasteless to tell somebody that people wanted him dead on national television in the kind of weird, upbeat way that Hemmer asked the question. I actually like Bill Hemmer, but I have to admit that his constant smile makes you wonder what he's thinking.  But, I think it's extremely dopey of Pettit to imply that death threats are okay if you make over $100 million on a documentary. You know what? Why not do some kind of expose on how it seems that it's right wing nuts that are always dangerously violent? You never see "lefties" doing this. But, with the conservative weirdos, they're always bombing women's health centers, killing abortion providers, bashing gay people and making death threats to liberals.   Pettit, you're an idiot.

      Traditionally, the second night in the Democratic Convention is the least important. It's generally sandwiched between the heavy hitters (such as Bill Clinton last night) and the presumptive Vice Presidential Candidate (such as John Edwards tomorrow night). Then, of course, the last night is all about giving the all important nomination to the candidate everybody knows is going to be nominated (such as John Kerry this Thursday night). But, tonight's lineup was just as electrifying, if not more, than the first...this due, in large part, to the U.S. Senatorial hopeful from Illinois and "rising star of the Democrats" Barack Obama, who many say (including yours truly) has given the best speech of the convention so far. And, that's hard for me to say because I thought Clinton's speech was the greatest thing since sliced bread so far. But, I'll get to Obama in a minute.  Let's go over the major speaker highlights starting with...          In the depths of the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt inspired the nation when he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Today, we say the only thing we have to fear is four more years of George Bush.         EDWARD KENNEDY    urlLink Senator Edward Kennedy  (D-MA) represents the party's history. His famous family, known as American royalty, has been deeply entrenched in the Democratic Party for years. Kennedy, for the most part, addressed the base tonight. Like Carter, Kennedy took some very pointed shots at President Bush and his Administration. Some may admonish him for these comments in a convention where the sad little Republicans keep crying foul on Kerry's pledge to keep this a positive convention. But, I believe that people need this kind of "red meat" (as they're calling it) interspersed amongst the more carefully crafted speeches. I, personally, welcomed it.  And, my favorite lines were:    KENNEDY:  In the depths of the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt inspired the nation when he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Today, we say the only thing we have to fear is four more years of George Bush. and    KENNEDY:  Now it is our turn to take up the cause. Our struggle is not with some monarch named George who inherited the crown. You can't get any more pointed than that! I know not how much it will ultimately hurt the party, but somebody had to say the things we were all thinking. And, why not Kennedy?  The one thing about Senator Kennedy is that, while he did address the base, it was almost the old school base that he spoke to. I know little about New England life and was lost at the walk through memory lane. But, as one of the most fair minded members of the Senate, he does have the respect of the party.            Never again will we be ashamed to call ourselves Democrats. Never. Never. Never. We're not just going to change presidents, we're going to change this country and reclaim the American dream.         HOWARD DEAN   I LOVE Howard Dean. Admittedly, I still wish that he were the one being nominated on Thursday evening. Dean represents the more liberal side of the party that I feel I'm part of. In fact, he made reference to it in his speech:    DEAN:  I may not be the nominee, but I can tell you this: For the next hundred days, I'll be doing everything I can to make sure that John Kerry and John Edwards take our country back for the people who built it. Because tonight, we're all here to represent  the Democratic wing of the Democratic party.  Actually, that's the way the pundits are taking that statement. But, I think he was talking about the part of the party that Dean helped electrify...those who aren't part of the main structure...the everyday people who, through grassroots efforts, both online and offline, are working to make a difference.  This is Dean's legacy. It was his presidential campaign that reintroduced the grassroots base to a process that, for the longest time, has been seen as inaccessible. When Dean says "I'm Howard Dean. And I'm voting for John Kerry," it's not just a statement of intent, but a battlecry that reaches out to the masses he's reached out to so well.    DEAN:  Never again will we be ashamed to call ourselves Democrats. Never. Never. Never. We're not just going to change presidents, we're going to change this country and reclaim the American dream.  To everyone who supported me -- you've given me so much, and I can't thank you enough. But this was never about me. It was about us. It was about giving new life to our party, new energy to our democracy, and providing hope again for the greatest nation on earth. Again, Dean leaves us with hope and the power in our hands.  Did I tell you I loved this guy?              Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there's the United States of America. There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America.         BARACK OBAMA   Admittedly, for the last few days, I knew very little about  urlLink Barack Obama , other than he was the "rising star" in the Democratic Party, he had "rock star"/icon-like status at the convention, that he was from Illinois running for a seat that was virtually unchallenged and that he would be the first black Democrat male in the U.S. Senate. After watching him tonight, now I know why they say he could be the first black Presidential hopeful. Obama was not only magnetic and electrifying, but, he was the first one that I felt really and truly spoke to  me  as the gay son of two immigrants.    OBAMA:  I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. When Obama said this, I remember a light bulb flashing in my head and mentally exclaiming, "That's me!" And, of course, CNN flashed to all the people in the color in the audience who were nodding their heads with me. We all knew that Obama spoke the truth.  But, the most powerful part of his speech was his much more colorful and amazingly descriptive variation of the party message -- Democrats are uniters, Republicans are dividers.    OBAMA:  Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there's the United States of America. There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats.  But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.  In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here -- the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it.  No, I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope! It was the most beautiful things I've ever heard. What's hilarious is that the Democrats are calling this a Clintonian vision while Republicans found him to be ironically conjuring up Reagan. Whatever the case might be, Obama is very much the rising star that everyone is saying that he is.            In a few months, we will face a choice. Yes, between two candidates and two parties, but more than that. We have a chance to take a giant stride forward for the good of all humanity. We can choose between the future and the past, between reason and ignorance, between true compassion and mere ideology. This is our moment, and we must not falter.         RON REAGAN, JR.   As I mentioned in a  urlLink previous entry , after hearing  urlLink Ron Reagan, Jr.  on NPR's  Fresh Air with Terry Gross , my respect points for him have gone way up.  Tonight did not change that.  Reagan, as he mentioned on  Fresh Air , was invited by the Democratic National Convention to speak about embryonic stem cell research, an issue very close to his heart. Now, as much of a supporter as I am of the Democratic Party, I know that the reasoning for inviting him was not so much about the topic, but that the son of the patron saint of Republicans would be speaking about an issue that easily can be used to sway swing voters. But, I feel, Reagan went into it knowing this. And, while he says, "Let me assure you, I am not here to make a political speech, and the topic at hand should not -- must not -- have anything to do with partisanship," he was very clearly making a political speech against Bush.  Reagan was very good at breaking down the issue so that people could more easily understand an issue that is already confusing. In fact, he acknowledges this:    REAGAN:  Some of you already know what I'm talking about when I say "embryonic stem cell research." Others of you are probably thinking, hmm, that's quite a mouthful, what is this all about?  Let me try and paint as simple a picture as I can while still doing justice to the incredible science involved. Let's say that ten or so years from now you are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. There is currently no cure, and drug therapy, with its attendant side-effects, can only temporarily relieve the symptoms.  Now, imagine going to a doctor who, instead of prescribing drugs, takes a few skin cells from your arm. The nucleus of one of your cells is placed into a donor egg whose own nucleus has been removed. A bit of chemical or electrical stimulation will encourage your cell's nucleus to begin dividing, creating new cells which will then be placed into a tissue culture.  Those cells will generate embryonic stem cells containing only your DNA, thereby eliminating the risk of tissue rejection. These stem cells are then driven to become the very neural cells that are defective in Parkinson's patients. And finally, those cells -- with your DNA -- are injected into your brain where they will replace the faulty cells whose failure to produce adequate dopamine led to the Parkinson's disease in the first place.  In other words, you're cured. But, Reagan doesn't just give a layman's discertation on embryonic stem cell research, he gives a personal example that some say harkens to his own father.    REAGAN:  I know a child -- well, she must be 13 now -- I'd better call her a young woman. She has fingers and toes. She has a mind. She has memories. She has hopes. And she has juvenile diabetes.  Like so many kids with this disease, she has adjusted amazingly well. The insulin pump she wears -- she's decorated hers with rhinestones. She can insert her own catheter needle. She has learned to sleep through the blood drawings in the wee hours of the morning. She's very brave. She is also quite bright and understands full well the progress of her disease and what that might ultimately mean: blindness, amputation, diabetic coma. Every day, she fights to have a future.  What excuse will we offer this young woman should we fail her now? What might we tell her children? Or the millions of others who suffer? That when given an opportunity to help, we turned away? That facing political opposition, we lost our nerve? That even though we knew better, we did nothing? What Reagan has done here is admonished those who use this issue as an ideological wedge issue. But, what's interesting is that, while Reagan doesn't come out and say vote for Kerry, his speech does turn political in the end and, like in his eulogy to his father, he indirectly attacks Bush.    REAGAN:  In a few months, we will face a choice. Yes, between two candidates and two parties, but more than that. We have a chance to take a giant stride forward for the good of all humanity. We can choose between the future and the past, between reason and ignorance, between true compassion and mere ideology. This is our moment, and we must not falter.  Whatever else you do come November 2nd, I urge you, please, cast a vote for embryonic stem cell research. Thank you for your time. Mr. Reagan, I think your mission was accomplished, and so was the Democrats'.            My only hope is that, one day soon, women — who have all earned the right to their opinions — instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are.         TERESA HEINZ KERRY   So,  urlLink Teresa Heinz Kerry  has been making a lot of news about her now infamous "shove it!" remark. Traditionally, the wife of the Presidential candidate speech is supposed to allow voters a chance to get to know the prospective First Lady. So, how would Heinz Kerry address the remark heard 'round the world without sounding defensive? I'll tell you how. By using it as an opportunity to relate to women and the frustration about double standards. In other words, she did so beautifully.    HEINZ KERRY:  I have a very personal feeling about how special America is, and I know how precious freedom is. It is a sacred gift, sanctified by those who have lived it and those who have died defending it. My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called "opinionated," is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish. My only hope is that, one day soon, women — who have all earned the right to their opinions — instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are.  Tonight I want to remember my mother's warmth, generosity, wisdom, and hopefulness, and thank her for all the sacrifices she made on our behalf, like so many other mothers.  This evening, I want to acknowledge and honor the women of this world, whose wise voices for much too long have been excluded and discounted. It is time for the world to hear women's voices, in full and at last. If I had questions about Mrs. Heinz Kerry before, I don't anymore.  I like this woman!

      While I wildly support the Democrats this year, I feel it's mostly because of my deep want to get Bush out of office.  The Democratic Party is the most viable party closest to my beliefs.  That's the reality of American politics today.  But, I also don't want to be too disparaging about the Democrats either.  Yes, I think the Democrats are not particularly the strongest on the gay and lesbian issue, but they are the ones who are willing to bring the issue to the national table.    This is what I was  urlLink saying about Clinton yesterday .  Did he accomplish everything he said he would?  No.  But, Clinton got people talking about the issue.  My guess is that if Clinton were never elected, we'd not be in a place where we'd even think same-sex marriage was even an issue we could dream about.  And, as Angela Oh suggested about the Asian American community in an  urlLink article I posted yesterday , I think the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has gotten more sophisticated since Clinton.  We support the Democrats, but we want to be assured that the Democrats move forward (and not backward) with our issues.  Personally, I think that this  urlLink Associated Press article  demonstrates a movement forward, even though it's not exactly what we want to hear.         Democrats are doing a delicate dance as they attempt to embrace gay rights but not necessarily gay marriage. Nearly 42 percent of Democratic convention delegates interviewed by The Associated Press said they support gay marriage. But 21 percent are against it and around 38 percent said their feelings either didn't fit into a "for" or an "against" category or they declined to answer the question.       Obviously, we want to hear that the Democrats will take on the whole kitten-kaboodle and herald same-sex marriage.  But, I think that you can ask even the most staunch, but realistic, gay rights activist -- not even we thought we'd get this far this soon.  I think that 42% of convention delegates that support gay marriage is pretty darn good.  And, the fact that they're actually drafting supportive gay language into the platform is incredible:       Draft language in the Democratic platform being considered Monday stopped short of endorsing gay marriage but supported "equal responsibilities, benefits and protections" for gay and lesbian families.       I defy any Log Cabin Republican Club member to show us how the Republican Party is working in that way?  And, while I respect Ralph Nader and his quest to continue the national conversation about multi-party systems, we all know the realism.  And, I do believe that voting outside of the bipartisan line is throwing my vote away.  Last night, there were protestors in Boston calling Kerry and Edwards "antigay," according to a  urlLink advocate.com article .       The protesters, who numbered 18, were also angry over the decision of the gay group Human Rights Campaign and other sponsors to disinvite comedian and headliner Margaret Cho from the party for fear she would say something inflammatory during her act. In light of the criticism that the Kerry campaign weathered after comedian Whoopi Goldberg's high-profile comments during a New York fund-raiser, organizers of "Unity '04" decided that rather than censor Cho's act, it was better for her not to perform. The National Lesbian and Gay Task Force subsequently pulled its support of the event.  Although the protesters outside Avalon referred to the decision regarding Cho as "shameful," their sharpest criticism was clearly aimed at Kerry, Edwards, and those community organizations, such as HRC, that endorsed the Democratic ticket without demanding more of the candidates. "As long as the community doesn't make demands of candidates, we are going to get squat," said Andy Thayer, national action coordinator for DontAmend.com, the organization that spearheaded the protest. "It is shameful that our national organizations would endorse anyone who is not for our simple legal equality."       Sadly, I'm pulled in two by this news.  There's part of me that really wants to applaud those who will not compromise the demands that they are seeking.  In every cultural revolution, this voice must be heard.  But, on the other hand, the bigger part of me rolls my eyes at the naivite of these actions.  Are these activists suggesting we vote for Nader?  And, for those who voted for Nader in 2000 where the vote was split between him and Gore, do you think we're in a better place now than we were with Bush?  I'll tell you now, Gore would not have backed a Constitutional Amendment even if he might say, like his other fellow Democrats, that he is "against gay marriage."  Yes, a strong voice is needed, but compromises sometimes have to be made.    John Aravosis from  urlLink AmericaBlog.org  wrote  urlLink an entry  about meeting the Kerry/Edwards Campaign Deputy Director Steve Elmendorf...       I think the most interesting comment I had today came from Elmendorf. Steve admitted that Kerry is at 95% in terms of his support for the gay community, he's not at 100% yet and they fully admit that. But Elmendorf, like most of the pro-Kerry folks you speak to at the convention, point out that Kerry is still the most pro-gay candidate to ever get the Dem or Republican nomination. And, Kerry is in favor of civil unions - Clinton never voiced such support. So, they argue, and I don't disagree, that while Kerry might tick us off about gay marriage, he's still better than Clinton, and in general, we loved Clinton.

      A Chinese-American Trade Group called Preparatory Committee of the Commission for the Promotion of U.S.-China Free Trade  urlLink filed a complaint  with the U.S Government today over the Chinese woman who was beaten down by a Homeland Security officer.       The group...said in a statement the U.S. Government bore unshirkable responsibility for the serious human rights violation on the U.S. soil, a country that claims to be the model of the free world.      While maybe a little overly dramatic, I think it's fair to call the U.S. on such a heinous crime. Again, while I might not have all the facts -- she said it happened before she had time to react, he said that they tried to run and she swung at him -- it's clear to me that this woman shouldn't have been as badly beaten as she was.        The statement said it was understandable that the United States had beefed up security to safeguard the country after the Sept. 11 terror attack, but the U.S. immigration officers had no right to assault businesspeople from other countries without bothering to find out the basic facts, the statement said.  The statement urged the U.S. authorities to take the incident seriously.  Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell had a telephone conversation Monday morning, in which the United States was urged to carry out a serious and thorough investigation of the incident.      Rightfully so...rightfully so.  It'll be interesting to see how this plays out.

      In the continuing conversation of Asian American visibility in this year's election,  AsianWeek  has printed an  urlLink article  in this week's issue about how Asian Americans are raising money for Kerry, but want to see more.         “Sen. Kerry needs to have a better analysis of our population,” said Angela Oh, a Los Angeles, Calif., attorney and former board member of President Clinton’s Initiative on Race. “Since the Clinton administration, you’ve got a fairly sophisticated [APA] population. We care about a more refined analysis of affirmative action in this country. We care about international relations because technology has pushed us [beyond borders]. Immigration reform is far more complex than the reunification of families. It is about global capital, globalization of justice movements and globalization of human rights concerns.”       Oh, who has always been a hero of mine, is right on the money. While we are still growing, we have become more sophisticated. And, I think that's why you're seeing more articles about the Asian American community lately. It's good we're fighting back and speaking up. From conversations such as these in  AsianWeek  to the grassroots effort around "The Alp Song," I'm quite heartened to see that maybe, just maybe, we're  really  getting our act together.

      Oh, God...I had heard Ann Coulter whinning about some column that didn't get printed in  USA Today  and how there is some left-wing conspiracy going on that's keeping her out of the newspapers. She and Sean Hannity were commiserating about it on the radio and I was actually dying to read what she had written without actually going to her Web site. So, thankfully, the first paragraph was posted on  urlLink The Daily Kos  with a link to the text in full (although, unfortunately, to a right wing, conservative e-rag).  Okay...so, I always knew she was, as Al Franken has described her, a "nutcase," but she's got to be an idiot not to know how  why  it wasn't printed.  Here's the first paragraph:       Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston, conservatives are deploying a series of covert signals to identify one another, much like gay men do. My allies are the ones wearing crosses or American flags. The people sporting shirts emblazoned with the "F-word" are my opponents. Also, as always, the pretty girls and cops are on my side, most of them barely able to conceal their eye-rolling.      If you want to read the rest (with notes from  USA Today ), you can click  urlLink here .  But, I warn you, it's pretty much the same thing and left me trying to figure out what she was trying to say.  Now, I know that I've been writing with a lot of vitriol and expletives.  But, I also know I'm not writing for  USA Today . I think there is "conservative" writing and then there's "insanely right wing" writing. As much as I hate writers like Mona Charen and even Jonah Goldberg (who is replacing Coulter as the "conservative" commentator at the DNC for  USA Today ), at least they write in complete sentences where they're writing is not reminiscent of taking a religious right drug trip through hell (as most of Coulter's writing is like).  The other funny thing is that Coulter compares her work to Michael Moore (only at the other side of the spectrum). I think it's petty and stupid to constantly harp on Michael Moore. First of all, he can write circles around Coulter. Also, if I were in the muddled middle, I know that Moore is intelligent and doesn't reduce himself to name calling. It's quite apparent that Coulter is so jealous that she could never be as cleverly satirical as Michael Moore.  Seriously, I hope Coulter continues to move forward with her case against  USA Today . My guess and my hope upon hope is that this will reveal Coulter for the "nutcase" she truly is and, hopefully, she's fade into obscurity. And, if she could take the likes of Sean Hannity, Bill O'Rielly and pill-poppin' Rush Limbaugh with her...all the better.

      You know you're a political nerd when, all day long, all you could think about was the line-up at the Democratic National Convention.  And, oh, what a night it's been!  It's one of those moments where you really wished you could be there and part of the incredible energy that you can almost feel seeping through the television.  Tonight was a giant night with the biggies of the Democratic Party and each person had his or her own unique message.  Let's look at each one.         AL GORE    urlLink Al Gore , I believe, summed up his message to the Democratic National Convention when he said:    GORE:  Take it from me -- every vote counts.  In our democracy, every vote has power. And never forget: that power is yours. Don't let anyone take it away or talk you into throwing it away. As we all know, Gore won the election in 2000, but, due to shady practice in Florida, that win was thrown into question (at minimum, 537 votes that were in question) and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately decided in favor of George W. Bush, disenfranchising people of color and older people from the political process.    Many of us are still bitter about that.  So, Mr. Gore's message was a battlecry that we MUST feel empowered, we must get out and vote.  Per the Kerry/Edwards campaign, Al Gore toned down the vitriol toward the Bush/Cheney campaign and, instead, asked, in a very dignified manner, a series of questions aimed at the Independents, moderates and swing voters:    GORE:  It is in that spirit, that I sincerely ask those watching at home who supported President Bush four years ago: did you really get what you expected from the candidate you voted for?  Is our country more united today?  Or more divided?  Has the promise of compassionate conservatism been fulfilled?  Or do those words now ring hollow?  For that matter, are the economic policies really conservative at all?  Did you expect, for example, the largest deficits in history? One after another? And the loss of more than a million jobs? CNN was reporting that Gore got, with the exception of his "every vote counts" message, a very tepid response.  Watching from home, I was inspired.  I thought he did wonderfully.           JIMMY CARTER   From what I understand,  urlLink Jimmy Carter 's purpose at the convention was to address foreign policy.  In years past, Carter was seen as the man who handed the presidency to the Republicans for twelve years.  But, nowadays, we view him as, as one delegate was quoted as saying, the "elder statesman of the Democratic Party."  Carter is seen as a foreign policy expert and has even won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.  He is now very respected.    CARTER:  Today, our dominant international challenge is to restore the greatness of America - based on telling the truth, a commitment to peace, and respect for civil liberties at home and basic human rights around the world. Truth is the foundation of our global leadership, but our credibility has been shattered and we are left increasingly isolated and vulnerable in a hostile world. Without truth - without trust - America cannot flourish. Trust is at the very heart of our democracy, the sacred covenant between the president and the people. Unlike other speakers at the convention, the Kerry/Edwards campaign decided not to vet Carter's speech for direct attacks against the Bush Administration because he is seen, again, as the "elder statesman."  And, Carter did use the opportunity to speak out against the Bush Administration.    CARTER:  When that trust is violated, the bonds that hold our republic together begin to weaken. After 9/11, America stood proud, wounded but determined and united. A cowardly attack on innocent civilians brought us an unprecedented level of cooperation and understanding around the world. But in just 34 months, we have watched with deep concern as all this goodwill has been squandered by a virtually unbroken series of mistakes and miscalculations. Unilateral acts and demands have isolated the United States from the very nations we need to join us in combatting terrorism. The media, of course, has been all over the comments, particularly the ones above where Carter specifically says "virtually unbroken series of mistakes and miscalculations."  I think Mr. Carter was wonderful.  To me, this is the kind of speech that we need to be hearing rather than shying away from.  I don't know if it will hurt the campaign, but I'm glad Mr. Carter was allowed to make his comments freely.           HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON   There was some controversy about  urlLink Hillary Clinton  speaking at the Democratic National Convention.  Some of her supporters were very vocally angry about it.  Ultimately, it was decided that she would introduce her husband, but that she would also give a supportive rallying cry for John Kerry and John Edwards.  Mrs. Clinton is seen as a possible presidential candidate down the line.  Personally, I would welcome her.  I think that she's an incredible woman given a bum wrap in a nation that likes to shy away from the fact that its still inherently sexist.  While some would argue that her purpose there was to appease her supporters, I think she was there to humanize things.  To me, the most telling part of her speech was this:    CLINTON:   We've been through our share of challenges as Americans, from a Civil War to a Great Depression to world wars and more. Today we face a new threat. Being a senator from New York, I saw firsthand the devastation of 9-11. I visited Ground Zero right after we were attacked. I felt like I was standing at the gates of hell. I hope no American ever has to witness a sight like that again. That tragedy changed all of us. I know it changed me. And every day now, as a mother, as a senator, and as an American, I worry about whether we are acting as wisely as we can to protect our country and our people. In this paragraph, she related to viewers not only as a Senator representing a state, but as a mother as well.           BILL CLINTON    urlLink Bill Clinton  is the hero of the Democratic Party.  Some say it's because he was the only Democratic president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt to be voted for more than one term.  But, watching him tonight, it only reminded me of why he was so great.  He's a charming man who just sucks you in.  He doesn't talk in broad erudite terms.  Instead, you feel like you're having a conversation with him.  Clinton is a powerful speaker and leader.    Actually, Amy asked me who I thought my favorite president was.  And, I have to say it was Bill Clinton.  Was he perfect?  No.  But, he brought the conversation about gays in the military into people's homes.  Gay was, for the first time in history, a household word.  Because of that, I felt not only safer to come out of the closet, but it also galvanized me as an activist.  So, I can appreciate some of the "greats" such as the Roosevelts, the Kennedys and the Lincolns, but Clinton's decision to take up the gays in the military issue resonate much more with me emotionally and personally.  Anyway, one can see why they wanted to have him speak three days before Kerry himself.  While I've actually become impressed with Kerry's speaking abilities, I have to admit that he's no Clinton.  Clinton's purpose at the Convention was to give people hope and remind us of the peace and prosperity we all felt during the Clinton years.  Clinton spoke very optimistically, too.  Instead of outright attacking, he spoke of "choices:"    CLINTON:  To build that kind of world, we must make the right choices. And we must have a president who will lead the way. Democrats and Republicans have very different and deeply felt ideas about what choices we should make. They're rooted in fundamentally different views of how we should meet our common challenges at home, and how we should play our role in the world. He then gave a series of examples of how the two parties differed and would end each sentence with a phrase like:    CLINTON:  Now, if you like these choices and you agree with them, you should vote to return them to the White House and the Congress. If not, take a look at John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democrats. We've got a different economic policy. It was incredible and compelling stuff.  Clinton got some great response when he said:    CLINTON:  Now, since most Americans aren't that far to the right, our friends have to portray us Democrats as simply unacceptable, lacking in strength and values. In other words, they need a divided America.  But we don't.  Americans long to be united. After 9/11, we all just wanted to be one nation. Not a single American on September the 12th, 2001, cared who won the next presidential election.  All we wanted to do was to be one country, strong in the fight against terror, helping to heal those who were wounded and the families of those who lost their loved ones, reaching out to the rest of the world so we could meet these new challenges and go on with our democratic way of life.  The president had an amazing opportunity to bring the country together under his slogan of compassionate conservatism and to unite the world in the struggle against terror.  Instead, he and his congressional allies made a very different choice. This statement, I believe, expresses the frustrations the Democrats have at the continuous slandering done by the Republicans.  Clinton said the one thing we know -- Democrats are the uniters, Republicans are the dividers.  The Republicans just love to make us seem creepy and uncomfortable to the midline voters.  But, I think Clinton got the most cheers when he said:    CLINTON:  But the important thing is not what talents he has, but how he has used them. He chose - he chose to use his talents to improve the lives of people like him who had to work for everything they've got and to help people too often left out and left behind. And that's what he'll do as our vice president.  Now their opponents will tell you...  Their opponents will tell you we should be afraid of John Kerry and John Edwards, because they won't stand up to the terrorists. Don't you believe it. Strength and wisdom are not opposing values.  They go hand in hand.  They go hand in hand, and John Kerry has both. His first priority will be to keep America safe. The problem with most Republicans is that they love to flair their peacock feathers.  Their brand of reckless patriotism is dangerous and, as Jimmy Carter suggested, has wrecked our reputation in the global community.  All in all, it was a wonderful evening to watch.  I jumped up in the air and gave Bill Clinton a standing ovation.  I'm very excited to see what more the convention has to offer.  Although, I'm going to find it hard to believe that there will be a line-up more electrifying than tonight.  That is, of course, with the exception of Thursday when we all welcome John Kerry officially as the man who will represent us in the battle for the White House.

         Could this be the next Asian American White House Cabinet member?   Rep. Mike Honda (D-San Jose) is not only one of the few Bay Area representatives to speak at the Democratic National Convention, but one of the only, if not the only, Asian American to do so.  This  urlLink  San Jose Mercury News  article  reports:       He believes the party's desire to highlight diversity, as well as his own life story of having been in a World War II Japanese internment camp as a child are the reasons he will get to address the convention Tuesday.  "The Democratic Party is always looking at diversity and presenting a face to the country, having a message, and my own personal life is a good message," said Honda, who is in his second term in the House of Representatives.  Honda said he plans to speak about "service, courageous leadership and doing the right thing."  At the 2000 Democratic convention in Los Angeles, former San Jose mayor and congressman Norm Mineta, then serving as commerce secretary, highlighted the party's diversity. "I am not from central casting," he said, referring to what Democrats said was a false show of diversity by the Republicans at their 2000 convention. "I am part of the real diversity and the real difference of the Democratic Party."  But today Mineta is President Bush's transportation secretary -- the only Democrat in the Cabinet. Honda, who is good friends with Mineta, now is one of the leading Asian-Americans in the party as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee. A convention official said diversity played a role in the choice of Honda as a speaker, but the main reason was his party title.       An important thing to note here is that Honda also serves as an adviser to John Kerry and could conceivably be offered a Cabinet seat if (or, as I like to say,  when ) elected.

      In an  urlLink amazing grassroots effort , Asian American youth from around the country are trying to push "The Apl Song" by Black Eyed Peas to the top of MTV's  Total Request Live  ( TRL ) video charts.  Both direct action visibility in time quare and online lobbying will be part of this effort.  So, why "The Apl Song?"  Because the song is the first U.S. pop single with a chorus sung in Tagalog and because the  urlLink video for the song  is a "a low-budget but remarkably polished work by a young Filipino American indie filmmaker."            The date is significant: It's the anniversary of President Roosevelt's decision to induct the Filipino military to fight for the United States during World War II. Although going into combat on behalf of America should have entitled these soldiers to full veterans' benefits, many of them have remained uncompensated, ignored by the nation for which they shed blood and risked lives. The video, about one such "forgotten soldier," hopes to bring exposure to this issue while also showcasing the burgeoning talent of the Filipino American community through cameos by numerous well-known Pinoy (Filipino) performers -- and, of course, through Apl himself, a biracial Filipino born and raised in a province south of Manila.       Alright!  This is what I like to hear.  So, all of y'all, let's make sure that this song soars.    urlLink Click here to join the grassroots effort!

      I saw  urlLink this  Newsday  article  on  urlLink Angry Asian Man .  It's absolutely nuts.  Apparently, a Homeland Security agent knocked the shit out of a Chinese woman who he thought was involved in with a pedestrian he was trying to bust for marijuana.       Officer Robert Rhodes, mistakenly believing the Chinese woman standing nearby was involved, allegedly sprayed her with pepper spray, threw her against a wall, kneed her in the head as she knelt on the ground and struck her head on the ground while holding her hair, according to witnesses.td>      WTF?  Even if this woman was involved, did he need to use that amount of force?  Is it me or does that seem  really  excessive?

          Howard Dean rocks the vote at an event aimed at youth    Okay, I feel like the pieces of the convention that I've heard about the convention have been rather negative.  So, I want to be sure to move on to something positive.  Let's talk about the tremendous youth outreach that has been going on around the Democratic National Convention.  On Sunday night, Comcast hosted and event entitled "The Power of 1: Decision 2008" and was geared toward reaching out to youth who will be elligible to vote in the year 2008...yes, as this  urlLink Philadelphia Inquirer story  reaffirms, 2008.       Its aim is to get young teens engaged in the political process now.        urlLink AlterNet  reported:       The panel also included MTV's Gideon Yago, Amber Tamblyn of  Joan of Arcadia , and the vice mayor of Cambridge, Mass., Marjorie Decker, all of whom had interesting things to say, though the real wisdom came from the young people in the audience. They asked tough questions about the failed Leave No Child Behind Act, and how oppressive mandated testing was discouraging students. Another 16-year-old described how a local restaurant owner was harassing students, calling them Osama bin Laden's daughters, and asked them, "Why do you look so sad? Was it because Saddam Hussein was captured?"       I would have loved to have been at this event.  I think we, as a nation, tend to discount what youth have to say.  I, personally, believe that youth have a lot to offer as they have a perspective that I can't really see.  I think it's fantastic that we're already reaching out to these youth!  Also on Sunday night,  urlLink Rock The Vote , which "engages youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities," hosted a  urlLink star-studded extravaganza aimed at the 18-36 set .       About 30 percent of that cohort voted in the 2000 presidential election, compared to about 50 percent of the general public. This was an MTV gig. And it had celebrities from across the spectrum.       Celebrities included Natalie Portman, Lauryn Hill, Howard Dean, Al Sharpton and Jerry Springer...yes, Jerry Springer.     Jerry Springer gets cheers from crowd        "No group in America is so affected by the policies of this administration than young people because it's young people who are fighting and dying overseas in the war in Iraq," said Jerry Springer, jumping onstage and taking over the rhetorical reins as Dean wrapped up his speech.       Good for you, Jerry!  Sunday night sounded like it was a great night for youth outreach.  Let's just hope that people go to the polls this year!

      I was directed to this  urlLink  Washington Post  Op-Ed  declaring "gay marriage as 'the new abortion'" by  urlLink Beaverhausen Blog .         A little more than a year ago, each side had a handful of little-known activists. Now mighty coalitions pour millions of dollars into advertising and lobbying. Activists on both sides have begun to speak of the issue as "the new abortion" -- a passionate and uncompromising struggle that will be fought in Congress, the courts and state legislatures, and through referendums for at least a decade to come.       While I understand what people are  trying  to say about the same-sex marriage issue, I agree with  urlLink Beaverhausen Blog  that this is a comparisson that people should be very careful with.  Beaverhausen, however,  urlLink believes :       Whatever skirmishes remain ahead of us over gay marriage, I refuse to accept that Americans will ultimately equate something as awful and unfortunate as abortion (even the NARAL's of the world don't promote the practice) with the loving commitment of two adults in a lifelong bond.       Working for a pro-choice, family planning organization, I would agree with Beaverhausen on the issue of abortion (although, I probably wouldn't put it in those particular words).  The goal of every pro-choice advocacy organization is not to promote abortion, but to to promote a full breadth of options with abortion hopefully being a last option.  But, Beaverhausen's statement also reflects the bigger reason why I am against the comparisson.  The statement somehow says that one is better than the other.  Democrats, progressives and the liberal minded  must  stay united.  By calling same-sex marriage the "new abortion," both sides could start to question the validity of the other.  This is not a time to be divissive.  Both the gay civil rights and pro-choice issues are equally important and both are unique in their own ways.  Both speak to the need to ensuring human beings maintain fundamental civil rights.

         Do we really care what this man has to say?   I was at  urlLink AmericaBlog.org  and saw  urlLink this AlterNet story  reporting on the convention.       To attract a crowd of TV cameras in Boston, celebrities make a big difference. In fact some are suggesting that celebrities have taken over the Democratic Party, and are using up the oxygen of elected officials. This was certainly the case on Sunday, when Comcast sponsored a panel aimed at young people. The event took place at the tony Charles Hotel, which is where the Clintons are staying. The guests included Danny Glover and Ben Affleck, two of the smartest celebrity progressives, along with a somewhat reactionary comedian, D.L. Hughley (Soul Plane), who went out of his way to buy into the terrorist fears, and also wanted the audience to be clear that whatever the gays is fighting for, it is not civil rights, and that civil rights are the province of blacks.  Fortunately, Danny Glover fired back. He responded that whoever's rights are being abused, be they gay or black or women, that it is a civil rights issue. Affleck, drawing laughs from the crowd, said that even though he recently decided not to get married, he believed that gay people should have the right if they wanted to.        urlLink AmericaBlog.org  has already reported on the audacity of D.L. Hughley's statement, so I won't necessarily express my outright indignation.  Instead, I want to thank Mr. Glover, of whom I am a big fan, and Mr. Affleck for their statements balancing Mr. Hughley's.    I will agree with Hughley that the African American civil rights movement in the 1960s and the gay civil rights movement of the 2000s are not the same, but Mr. Glover is more accurate in saying that civil rights, in its truest meanings, are rights granted to all citizens and that the taking of those rights is a civil rights issue.

         Leave This Woman Alone!   I swear I'm going to slap somebody around if I hear another story about  urlLink Teresa Heinz Kerry's "shove it" remark .  For those who haven't heard, Mrs. Kerry's remarks came after a reporter pressed her about what she meant by "un-American" in a speech she gave at a reception last night.  She had denied the claim and asked him if he was from a conservative newspaper that has been tearing her family down.  When he affirmed her question, she told him, "You said something I didn't say, now shove it."   Now, unfortunately, Mrs. Kerry  did  use the term "un-American."  In urging supporters to return some dignity to politics, she said, "We have to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics."  BUT, this was a newspaper that had repeatedly attacked the Kerry family and, so, it's understandable that she was a little suspicious of the reporter's questioning.  It was clear Mrs. Kerry's speech at the reception was not a rehearsed speech, so she might have forgotten what she said.  The message was about restoring civility and a reporter hawking around one particular word could easily manipulate the message.         Asked about Mrs. Heinz Kerry's comments, the Kerry campaign said in a statement: "It was a moment of extreme frustration aimed at a right wing rag that has consistently and almost purposefully misrepresented the facts when reporting on Mrs. Heinz Kerry."       My personal frustrations with this story is in a similar vein to the Martha Stewart extravaganza.  I find it hilarious that people love it when Bill O'Rielly says "shut up" on his show and when the Vice President of the United States can say "Go fuck yourself" or when the Governor of the state of California calls Democrats "girlie-men," but, for a strong woman to say, "shove it," the media has to analyze every moment and her being a possible liability.  Democrats are constantly berrated by conservative punditry all the time.  It's time we fight back.  Frankly, that one comment has now earned my respect for Mrs. Kerry.    As Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said on CNN's  urlLink  American Morning  :    CLINTON:  I think a lot of Americans are going to say, "Good for you. You go, girl." And that certainly is how I feel about it.   You know, I think that what we're living in our political, you know, history at this moment is extremely polarized. There's a lot of, you know, strong emotions. And that's perfectly appropriate. But then there are people who are, frankly, out to score political points, or to put words in people's mouths. And that's not appropriate. And they have to be called on it.   Teresa Heinz Kerry... Good for you.  You go, girl.

      So, I was just checking out  urlLink Michael Moore 's Web site and saw that he posted  urlLink this article  from my local paper -- the  Contra Costa Times . First of all, I'd like to say -- DAMN! I wish I had known that Ms. Ronstadt was playing at the Wente Vinyard because I would have gone to support her.  So, it turns out that Ms. Ronstadt once again dedicated "Desperado" to Michael Moore and, true to form for the many right wing nuts that live in Contra Costa and East Alamenda, some people stormed out when she did this.       "She just had to do it," one fan steamed as he headed for the parking lot. "It was good until the end," another yelled to TV crews waiting outside the concert.  "She's getting out of line; it's ridiculous," said Cindy Williams of Livermore, as she left during the last song of the evening.      She's getting out of line? Getting out of line of what? Exercising her freedom of speech is "getting out of line" all of the sudden? I'd hate to live in Cindy Williams of Livermore's sad and bleak little version of America.  But, luckily, the Wente Vinyard didn't react in the same way as the Aladdin Casinos.       The controversy created a sellout, said Wente president Carolyn Wente.  About 20 people angered by Ronstadt's comments dropped plans to attend, but their traded-in tickets were snatched up and the show was sold out Wednesday.  "It was just a handful (turning in tickets) when you consider there are 1,700 folks coming," Wente said before the show.  Wente said she did not ask Ronstadt to refrain from any political comments.  "We don't take any position on any of our artists' political thoughts or perceptions," she said.      Another thing that I learned from this article is that not all people in Livermore are right wing assholes...       Corey and Susan Tate of Livermore came to the concert with a gift for Ronstadt -- an American flag, with a note on its paper wrapper: "To Linda, a patriot. Bless you."  "I've been listening to Linda since 1967. She has been a standard-bearer for liberal causes, and I'm glad she spoke up ... People like her represent America; it's not just people with conservative views," Corey Tate said.       Sigh...  To the Tates, patriots.  Bless you.  Thanks for conveying the message I would have liked to have given Ms. Ronstadt.

           Under the Breath:   Why are you picking on me?  I'm just trying to fuck over my people!  That's all!   John Aravosis'  urlLink AmericaBlog.com  directed me to a  urlLink  New York Times  article  on the recent "outing" campaign. Actually, as John points out, this is not really an "outing" campaign than a "hypocrisy" campaign since all of these people are already out. They're just trying to fuck over gay and lesbian Americans. Nonetheless, even if this were an "outing" campaign, I'd still support it.  What I find amazing is the pompous audacity of those being exposed.       In recent weeks Lynden C. Armstrong, administrative director for Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, an opponent of gay marriage, has been called "a Jew working for Nazis," and "a gay Uncle Tom." During a recent dinner at a Washington restaurant, a friend loudly berated Mr. Armstrong in front of other patrons. He was even confronted about his political allegiance during a weekend getaway in Rehoboth Beach, Del., again, by people he considered friends.  "I don't feel like I'm being attacked by anyone in my office," said Mr. Armstrong, 33, who is also co-chairman of the Gay, Lesbian and Allies Senate Staff Caucus. "The attacks have come from other gays and lesbians, and that's hard. It's very hard for me to understand how they can do that. Most people know how difficult this all is for all of us."      The one thing I'll give Armstrong is that it is wrong to call him "a Jew working for Nazis." To me, using this language is like equally comparing the civil rights movement with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights movement. Once could see the parallels, but it is still inaccurate. Also, as much as I hate Senator Domenici, to compare him to Hitler only makes us look crazy. BUT, Armstong, no matter what, deserves to be called on his hypocrisy. He's an idiot if he thinks people should feel sorry for him.        A gay press secretary for a House Republican who refused to be named because his boss asked him not to speak publicly on the marriage debate said that the "barbaric tactics" of gays attacking other gays had reinforced his partisan commitment. He felt the pull most recently, he said, during the emotional June weekend marked by both President Ronald Reagan's funeral and Washington's annual gay pride parade - a parade, he said, that seemed less about pride and more about polarizing politics.  "It put it into focus," said the aide, whose name and telephone number have been posted on Mr. Rogers's Web site. "If there is a spectrum of things that make up who I am, the things that draw me to work for Republicans are more important than [sic] anything related to my sexual orientation."      That's all well and good, but it takes a mighty creepy person with low self-esteem to actively work to make himself a second-class citizen. And, if this person were to run for public office, I would think twice about voting for them because it seems to demonstrate a lack of integrity.

      Speaking of the Asian American vote this year, check out  urlLink Emil Guillermo's column  in this week's issue of  urlLink  AsianWeek  .  I'll give you a hint about what his column is about.  The title is "APAs Go for Kerry, Not Bush and Nader."    I am proud of my peeps!

      While this  urlLink article  is critical of both the Bush/Cheney and the Kerry/Edwards campaigns, I'm glad that media is starting to cover it. Turns out that both campaigns have been slow to advertise in Asian American press.  Unfortunately, people tend to forget Asian Americans. You hear both campaigns targeting the African American and Latino communities. For example, Bush's snubbing the NAACP is a prime example. But, where is the outreach to the Asian American community?  What many people don't realize is that the Asian American community is rapidly growing and will continue to grow...         Nationwide, the Asian-American community grew 42 percent from 1990 to 2000, and the U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2050 it will account for 8 percent of the population. A 2002 report showed 2.5 million registered Asian-American voters out of 4.7 million eligible.  Nearly four out of every 10 Asian-Americans live in California, according to the 2000 census. That's one explanation for the lack of urgency in getting the campaign message out: California is solidly Democratic and not in play in the Electoral College contest that will decide the winner in November. But Honda said significant pockets of voters could make a difference in swing states, such as the Chinese in Washington state, Filipinos in New Jersey and even the Hmong in Minnesota.      But, the lack of outreach to the Asian American community is really a bigger problem than this year's presidential election. Outside of the Asian American being a very diverse racial group with extremely varying languages, cultures, customs, and ethnicities, the Asian American community, as we know it, is relatively new. Third and fourth generation Asian Americans are rarer than in the Latino and African American communities. Organizations are dealing with unifying such diversity and displaying its political power. Groups such as  urlLink Asian Pacific Americans for Progress  and  urlLink APIA Vote 2004  are working to get Asian Americans involved in the political process.         Feelings of political exclusion are acute in the Chinese-American community, which represents one-quarter of all Asian-Americans. The Committee of 100, an organization of high-profile Chinese-Americans, has raised the question of racial bias among the general public as one reason for Asians' disproportionate representation at the national level. Only seven of 535 members of Congress have Asian ancestry.  "Asian-Americans feel they face a glass ceiling, and that's true in politics as well as in corporate life," said John Chiang, a member of the Committee of 100 who serves on California's State Board of Equalization. "I don't think we're being taken for granted in the presidential election, but we're not very high in the queue."      While I'm not excusing the Kerry/Edwards campaign from a responsibility to the Asian American community, when it boils down to it, as an Asian American, I have much more hope with these two men than I do with George W. Bush. For example, while Bush continued Clinton's  urlLink White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders , he basically ignored and de-funded it.  I have faith that John Kerry will restore the initiative to its former glory.  For more information on the Asian American vote, I recommend reading this  urlLink July 19 Associated Press article  entitled "Asian Population Lacks Political Clout" that spells out some of the challenges in organizing the community as a political force.

       urlLink Republicans at the Democratic National Convention ?    Worried much, GOP?       About 30 staff members from the Republican committee and the president's re-election campaign are in town as well as Congressional staff members who have decided to spend some vacation time in Boston. The Republicans are planning a daily press briefing and will be readily available for comment.       It's amazing to me how transparent they are.  They're not even smart.  But, whatever.  To me, and I know a lot of swing voters I know, their constant "coincidental" moves are only a clear admission of guilt.  They've fucked up so much their only course of action is to try to cut down everything Democrats say, even at the sacred convention.    Fucking morons.  Oops...there's that language again.

      The August 2 issue of  U.S. News &amp; World Report  describes " urlLink the new democrats ."       From one end of the party to the other--liberals, moderates, progressives, New Dems, "blue dogs," women, blacks, Hispanics, gays--a kind of fever has taken hold to drive President Bush from office. Democrats more accustomed to fighting among themselves are coming together to raise money, register voters, buy ads, write books, make movies, and try to get Ralph Nader out of the race. "The old line about the Democratic firing squad being a circle does not apply in 2004," exults Democratic strategist and pollster Peter Fenn. Were the Democrats not so open about it, one might be tempted to label it a "vast left-wing conspiracy."      It's amazing how many people are  really  angry this year. I remember writing in my blog how boring this election felt and how, a couple months later, I'm feeling like the Kerry-Edwards ticket is the best thing since sliced bread. Why? Because, like many of my colleagues, my mind is focused on one thing -- winning on November 2 and getting rid of one of the worst presidents this nation has ever seen. But, those of us who want to see Bush go have bonded in such an almost Kumbaya kind of way. We love to hear people tear him down and we're all talking about the latest action at  urlLink MoveOn.org  or other progressive Internet communities that will allow us to take action.  On Saturday, I organized our local  urlLink Planned Parenthood Action Fund  Day of Action. Basically, all of the action funds were doing action on that day. It was work for me, but, I thought to myself that there was nowhere else I'd rather be. My goal means that much to me. And, for the people who participated in the Day of Action, it was equally important.  But, admittedly, sometimes I wonder if I'm too angry, sometimes. I was watching on the news how the Democratic leadership is wanting the speakers to tone down the language at the Democratic National Convention. Part of me thinks this is ridiculous. There are so many people who are angry. Why not let them speak out. But, then I remember the political reality. We've already seen how the public reacted to strong language a la Whoopi Goldberg. So, I'd rather people speak calmly and help provide a win than to mouth off and turn people off.  Actually, I just had a long conversation with my mother about vitriol. She thinks I'm taking this election too personally and can't understand why I would get so worked up about the President. Again, I've mentioned that my mom is very much into pomp and circumstance. There's just certain language that you use when talking about authority figures such as the President of the United States and "fucking moron" and "stupid idiot" are not part of that vernacular.   The other day, I was reading my blog and noticed that my language has become really strong. It's quite clear the level of disdain I have for President Bush. And, for a brief moment, I thought about toning it down. Part of the exercise for me in starting this blog was to try to hone in my commentary skills. I do know the power of a well reasoned argument. But, ultimately, I've decided to move forward with my more colorful blogging language. I already have a job where I write in neutral tones. My blog, however, is my own personal voice. And, I am angry and energized. This is my outlet for that part of me to express those emotions. At least, for now.

         NASA scientists prepare the Messenger  Emboldened by the recent success of both Mars and Saturn missions, NASA is preparing to  urlLink send a probe to Mercury , the 1st rock from the sun. The Messenger spacecraft will begin its seven-year mission on August 2 and will begin its main mission in 2011 of looking for frozen water that might exist on the planet. This is the first time NASA has attempted a mission to Mercury in about 30 years.  Now, as you know, I'm a big supporter of the space program, but, I wonder with all of these spacecraft we've sent into space if we're diverting our attention all over the place. I'm wondering if NASA should be focusing on one planet and really using all of its resources to explore that planet...even sending humans one day.  Regardless, even while I wonder this, I can't help but be excited by more photos and research of these worlds, bringing back images that have really only existed in our imaginations.

           Under The Breath:   Bling, bling, baby...bling, bling   As predicted last week,  Fahrenheit 9/11  has made  urlLink documentary history and surpassed the magic $100 million mark . Now, this $100 million mark is a landmark not just for documentaries, but films in general. A mid-sized budgeted film that makes this much money is considered a box office triumph. So, imagine what this means for a low budget documentary.   Fahrenheit 9/11  made $5 million this weekend, bringing it to a total of $103.35 million.        Democrats have embraced  Fahrenheit 9/11 , though Moore said his main goal was to create good entertainment, not dabble in politics. Moore said he has not been contacted by the campaign of Democratic candidate John Kerry and that he did not make the movie to boost Democrats' prospects of winning the White House.  The real effect of  Fahrenheit 9/11  will be to encourage Americans normally disinterested in politics to participate this fall, Moore said.  "I believe the film is going to bring hundreds of thousands of people to the polls who otherwise were not going to vote," Moore said. "I think it's going to have a tremendous impact in that way."       Whatever the case might be, I'm glad you're on our side, Mr. Moore.  Congrats on making history!

      I just saw this post on  urlLink Wonkette 's blog that discusses the possibility that...gasp!...the  urlLink Jenna and Barb Bush chat held on the Bush/Chenney '04 site might have fake ...and that it might have been the handiwork of "Ken Mehlman and Karl Rove, who may have been dressed like Jenna and Barb."  I read the transcript and it is pretty fishy that two 22 year olds could speak in such a strangely stodgy manner. But, regardless of who typed this little piece of exploitation, stupid is as stupid does. Honestly, the chat was a lovefest for moronic assholes who feel they need to hear the First Twins talk about things they have absolutely no idea about.       Little Jenna showing her respect for the nation    Here are some examples...    Dee Meadows from Waycross GA wrote:  With your dad being the President what moment has made you the proudest?    Barbara and Jenna Bush answered:  Hello, Dee. It is almost impossible for us to choose just one moment that has made us proud. There are so many times we are proud of our dad--we constantly meet people that have benefited from him as a person and as a President and we couldn't feel prouder. Yet, there is no doubt that after September 11, we couldn't have been prouder of our father. It was so moving for us to see our Dad, and the entire American people, handle such an unbelievable tragedy with such strength and courage. We knew that with our Dad as President, he would do everything he could to make sure that the American people were safe and that those that lost friends and family members would feel comforted.   My follow up question:   How he handled such an unbelieveable tragedy with such strength and courage?  Is that how your dad sat for 7 minutes reading  My Pet Goat  while he knew that the nation was under siege? Was it strength or courage when your dad went on vacation 42% of the time when he should have been meeting about al-Qaeda threats to the country? And, you're particularly proud of the fact that your father's handling of the situtation was to exploit the tragedy by lying to the country and sending us into a senseless war for oil interest? Yes, that's a lot to be proud of.  Alright, moving on:    Lino Nicole from Humble TX wrote:  What character trait - as a father - do you appreciate most about your Dad and how do you see that trait manifest itself in him as President?    Barbara and Jenna Bush answered:  Hey there. It is really difficult to choose only one characteristic about our father because we think he has many incredible qualities. One thing that we love about him is his open-mindedness. When we were growing up, he always encouraged us to make our own decisions. He has always listened to our ideas and thoughts and treated our opinions with absolute respect and importance. As a President, our father has encountered tons of people with varying beliefs and there is no doubt that he treats each and every person with the utmost respect.    My follow up question:  Um...Jenna and Barb, which of you carries the half brain that seems to exist between the two of you? Open-mindedness? Is that why your father decided to be the first U.S. President to openly seek a Constitutional Amendment that would discriminate rather than protect? Is that why he signed into law the first abortion ban in over 30 years that clearly has no regard for women's health and lives? What friggin' planet do you two live on?  And then there's this...    Wesley Roth from Rapid City SD wrote:  Is there anything you miss since your dad has been elected President?   Barbara and Jenna Bush answered:  Hi, Wesley. It seems like people ask us this question all of the time. Honestly, we have not missed anything since our dad has been elected President. He is definitely an extremely busy man, but he still finds plenty of time to devote to us. Two months after September 11, when our father and our country were dealing with a huge national tragedy, he still found time to throw us a party for our 20th birthday. We invited 20 of our friends down to Camp David for the weekend, and although our Dad had a lot on his mind, he still spent plenty of time with us and our friends, making sure everyone felt welcome.   My follow up question:  Girls, girls, girls...could the reason why he was able to make time for you is because he goes on vacation more than anybody on the face of the planet? Remember, 4 more years of Bush is 4 more years of vacation at Camp David and Kennebunkport! Woo hoo!  So, again, while the chat might have been fake, the answers were just as stupid as you'd expect.

      John Kerry, who was targeted by activist Catholic officials to be denied communion because of his stance on abortion, has said that he is  urlLink against abortion but pro-choice .  Mr. Kerry actually is not unlike many pro-choice activists, including yours truly.  I don't think I could get an abortion if faced with that option and I do think that life (as defined as a spark of electricity that jump starts your brain) begins at conception.  BUT, that doesn't mean that I think abortion should be illegal.  Just because I believe one thing should not be imposed on others.  Also, it should be clear that my definition of "life" and my definition of the "journey of life" are two different things.  I believe that by brining a baby into this world when it or the parents aren't ready messes greatly with karma and can fuck up a person's life journey before they even get a chance to truly experience it.  To me, that is worse than abortion.  And, I do believe that, before a child's journey begins, its life is intrinsically tied with that of the mother's.  To me, that means that the mother is the sole person that can make decisions about what's going on with the child within her.    Personally, what I think, as a man, is moot since, unless technology and science changes, I will never be pregnant.  On some levels, I don't even think I should be engaged in this conversation to start off with.  Only people who can truly be pregnant should be discussing this issue.     But, as all stories go, the reality is, in this world where abortion  is  a politically charged issue, women cannot, unfortunately, stand alone in this battle to stand up for choice.   As a gay man who's seeing his rights be discussed by people who have absolutely no concept of what it's like to be a gay person in this country today, I am all for ensuring everyone maintains fundamental human rights.   So, like Mr. Kerry, it is my honor to be part of the efforts to ensure that the full breadth of reproductive rights and services are made available to women.

      It always warms the cockles of my heart when I read how Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  is  urlLink playing well with swing voters .  Swing voters are those ellusive, but valuable, voters who have little passion for partisan politics, but do end up going to the polls voting for the candidate that seems to appealed to them the most.  Both parties actively seek to sway swing voters to their side.  The most amazing statistics that came out of the poll:        The online poll of 2,242 adults conducted earlier this month also found a sizable Republican minority rated the movie as positive (44%), while about a third felt it even gave the president a fair crack of the whip.

      So, wow...it looks like the  urlLink GLAAD  Media Awards will finally be televised in 2005. That's exciting stuff, considering that it's been years in the making. I had the privilege of being able to attend the GLAAD Media Awards for 10 years. They are exciting events akin to the gay Oscars. I remember seeing Mitchell Anderson ( Party of Five ) come out of the closet publicly. I remember Ellen DeGeneres making a heartfelt speech the year she came out of the closet. The last one I went to in 2003, I saw a fabulous accapela performance of "Beautiful" by Christina Aguilera. So, it'll be great that the rest of America will be able to experience the wonderfulness of these shows. The staff and volunteers that put the shows together do a fantastic job.  So, how's this happening?  GLAAD has posted a  urlLink press release  announcing a partnership with  urlLink LOGO , MTV's soon-to-be-launched gay cable network:       MTV Networks announced today that they will partner with the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) to begin airing the annual GLAAD Media Awards on LOGO, MTV's new network targeted primarily at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) viewers. The 16th annual GLAAD Media Awards will be televised in spring 2005. The announcement was made at the summer 2004 Television Critics Association meeting in Los Angeles.       LOGO has also  urlLink announced some of the first programming  on their network.       LOGO, the new digital television network targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) viewers, announced today the programming plans being readied for its Feb. 17, 2005, launch, including details of its first-ever development slate. Marshaling the creative resources of Viacom and MTV Networks, LOGO has amassed a premier library of more than 150 movie and documentary acquisitions and is currently in active development with more than 20 projects with marquee names attached like Cher and Chastity Bono, Alan Cumming and Margaret Cho, among others. The announcement was made today by Brian Graden, President, MTV/VH1Entertainment; and Matt Farber, executive consultant who brought the concept to MTV Networks and is spearheading the launch of LOGO.                       Some of the early programming for LOGO!

           Under The Breath:   I can't believe you brought your racist-ass self here today, Mr. Prsident   Well, after snubbing the NAACP and then making it seem like it was their fault, President Bush decided that he better make some kind of effort to appeal to black voters and accepted an invitation to the Urban League's national conference in Detroit.  Reported the  urlLink  Atlanta Constitution-Journal  :       Friday's speech was the latest effort by an administration frustrated by its inability to gain traction among black voters. Bush got 8 percent of the black vote in 2000, and recent polls show his support at about the same level this year.      Hmmmm...Could this possibly be because Bush has done absolutely NOTHING for the African American community in the four years he's been in office? I'm still mystified by the Bush Administration's strategy to address the NAACP debacle by making it look like the NAACP leadership is a bunch of "lefties" rather than sucking it up and taking responsibility.  But, what's interesting is that Bush did suck it up today...a bit. He acknowledged the fact that the Republican party has a long way to go and said, "You see...I believe in my heart the Republican Party, the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, is not complete without the perspective and support and contribution of African-Americans."  The problem is that Republicans have done very litte for African Americans  since  the days of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. How can one invoke a Republican Party that clearly hasn't existed in over 100 years?  But, the thing that pissed me off the most was this from the  urlLink Associated Press ...       Bush pointed to the fact that blacks such as national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of State Colin Powell are key members of his administration.      I would be totally offended if I were African American. I mean, he might have well just said, "I'm proud to have two or three token black people in my cabinet, including Condi Rice and Colin Powell. Black people are neat."  But, admittedly, Bush made some good points during his speech...   yes, I am once again vomiting in my mouth from saying this        "I'm going to ask African-American voters to consider some questions," he said. "Does the Democrat Party take African-American voters for granted?"  That drew scattered applause, as did some of his follow-up questions:    "Is it a good thing for the African-American community to be represented mainly by one political party? It's a legitimate question. How is it possible to gain political leverage if the party is never forced to compete?"   "Have the traditional solutions of the Democrat Party truly served the African-American community?"   "Does blocking the faith-based initiative help neighborhoods where the only social service provider could be a church?"    Are blacks "satisfied with the same answers on crime, excuses for drugs and blindness to the problem of the family?"   "I'd like to hear these questions debated on talk radio and in community centers and the coffee shops," Bush said.      And, then, I'm snapped back into reality. Admittedly, he had me for a moment, but Bush's last statement makes me remember that Bush has absolutely no concept of the African American community. It's pompous to assume that these conversations are not already happening.  There's a similar argument going on in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. We all know that the Democrats know that they have us by the balls. Do I like it? No. But, the political realities are to try to work with the Party that will not outright fuck us over. While Kerry might say he's against gay marriage, he also says he is for civil unions and, unlike Bush, is not seeking to write discrimination against LGBT people into the Constititution.  It's not ideal, but it's the reality.  So, for African Americans, what does Bush have to offer? Pretty much nothing. He's fought against affirmative action. He's done nothing to address the disenfranchisement of African Americans during the 2000 election. He was unsympathetic to a brutal hate crime against an African American in the state that he served as Governor. He's sent African American kids in lower economic centers to Iraq and lied about it.  The other thing about Bush is that he did little to directly address the Urban League's agenda as he did more to defend his own pathetic record.  urlLink Kerry, on the other hand, did address the Urban League's specific concerns when he spoke on Thursday .       "We have an obligation to stop being a country that's content to spend $50,000 a year to house young people in prison for the rest of their life, rather than spend $10,000 a year to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start - early childhood education," Kerry said to a standing ovation during a speech at Detroit's Cobo Center.  The Democrat's remarks hit on many of the issues raised by National Urban League president Marc Morial as he opened the convention a day earlier.  "I was happy to hear him respond to key points of the National Urban League's agenda," said Walter Brame, president of the Grand Rapids Urban League. Brame cited Kerry's statements about the need for adequate funding for education programs and about ending racial profiling.      At least people have a chance with Kerry. He might not deliver everything, but he will at least try to deliver something, which is much unlike Bush.  In related news, the Congressional Black Caucus  urlLink doesn't know what to do  about their own annual conference in September:        You're invited, but please don't come:  I hear that members of the Congressional Black Caucus are wringing their hands over whether to ask President Bush to address their annual conference in early September. Democratic nominee-designate John Kerry and running mate John Edwards have already accepted invitations - and the liberal caucus is eager to hear them. But at Tuesday's caucus staff meeting, I'm told, the consensus was that the polite thing to do would be to invite the President - who dissed last week's NAACP conclave - and just hope that he sends his regrets.

      Ron Reagan, Jr. was on NPR's  urlLink  Fresh Air with Terry Gross   tonight. Reagan has, of course, been asked by the Democratic National Convention to speak about stem cell research. In the meantime, Reagan will NOT be speaking at the Republican National Convention (although, according to him, he will be there covering it for MSNBC).   It's strange because I've known of Ron Reagan, Jr. for a long time, but I knew very little about him. I knew that he marched to the beat of his own drum (meaning that his beliefs often didn't coincide with his father's beliefs) and that there were rumors that he was a big closet case and, in my own mind, I developed this view of him that he was one of  those Reagans .  So, it was really refreshing hearing him being interviewed.       Ron Reagan, Jr. to speak at DNC on stem cell research    I found him to be a very intelligent person whose viewpoints were very similar to mine, from stem cell research to same-sex marriage to religion. Actually, I feel this closeness to him as also being the reverse Alex P. Keaton (a liberal living in a conservative family). It's interesting listening him talk about his father. He had a lot of love for his dad, but it sounded like he was not scared to speak his mind.  Case in point, Ron Reagan Jr., has been highly critical of the President George W. Bush, despite, or maybe because, of Bush's and the Republican's constant invocation of Ronald Reagan (Sr.). In an interview with  urlLink  Salon  , the junior Reagan had even said, "My father was a  man  -- that's the difference between him and Bush."      I thoroughly enjoyed his viewpoints.  My favorite question that Terry Gross asked:    GROSS:  You said that you think embryonic stem cell research is being politicized.  Um...How do you think it's being politicized?   REAGAN:  Well, I don't know what President Bush personally feels about embryonic stem cell research and I'll take him at his word that he thinks that destroying these very early stage embryos -- we're really taking about the cellular level here, we're not talking about a fetus, we're not talking about something with fingers and toes -- uh...I take him at his word that he feels that is tantamount to murder. Uh...that you're taking a life of a human being essentially when you do that. I would disagree. I think you can make a distinction. But, if he's going to make that argument...and, it is a moral argument...then you have to be, it seems to me, morally and intellectually consistent. Um...now, I haven't heard this administration call for the shutting down of in vitro fertilization clinics, for instance, where thousands of embryos are discarded every year. Um...Those embyros are the same sort of embryo that one would be using in embryonic stem cell research. So, if the embryonic stem cell research embryos are human beings deserving of legal protection, let's say, well...so, are the embryos in the in virtro fertilization clinics. Now, nobody is going after the IVF clinics because that would be political suicide. A lot of people of all political stripes, y'know, trying to get pregnant, avail themselves of those technologies in the IVF clinics. So, instead, we're going to pick on embryonic stem cell research, in an effort, I suspect, to appeal to what people refer to as "the base." The Republican base which are made up, in large part, of Evangelical Christians who have very strong feelings about life beginning at the moment of conception.   This is the fundamental flaw in a lot of right-wing logic (or illogic). Right-wingers look at a skewed and inconsistent world to support highly ideological notions. It kind of reminds me of the arguments wiht the Federal Marriage Amendment. It's okay to write discrination into the U.S. Constitution this one time for this one group of people. But, we can't do it to anybody else.  The junior Reagan's love for his father, though, does not diminish my disdain for his the senior Reagan. But, I think that even Ron Reagan Jr. would understand this. At one point in the interview, he even contends that in order for him to write something about his father, he'd either have to be critical of him (which he wouldn't do out of love and loyalty) or write a pointless cheerleader piece that we've all seen family members write for their relative and laugh at how cheesy it really is:     REAGAN:  I've was asked by many people who I've worked for...y'know, would you be willing to interview your father. And, uh...inevitably I would say "no." It doesn't make any sense. For me to actually interview my father in a professional capacity...or a journalistic capacity...on the other hand...y'know, I'd either be ambushing him...which I wouldn't do...or I would be doing a puff piece which is pointless. So, there would just be no reason for me to interview him in that way. If I want to talk to my father...If I wanted to talk with my father...I could just go in and talk to him. But, it would always be father to son.   Anyway, it was good to hear Ron Reagan, Jr. talk. I look forward to hearing what he has to say at the Democratic National Convention.

      Atrios' blog pointed out that one of the funniest, yet most poignant, clips from  urlLink  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart   has been posted to the Web.  The piece is actually a perfect example of what makes  The Daily Show  great as it points out some of the most obvious flaws of the media.        urlLink      urlLink  Conventional Wisdom   "Talking points -- they're true...because they're said a lot."      Having worked in non-profit for so long, I do know the importance of soundbytes, talking points and terminology. Every side develops them -- both conservative and liberal -- that's no big secret. There is power to language. However, right wing spin meisters tend to be more flamboyant in their language. Their talking points are much more colorful that even the most liberal person can't help feel sucked into the terminology.  Anyway, enjoy!

      So, I was reading  urlLink Margaret Cho's blog  and saw her brief statement about the hullaballoo surounding HRC's disinviting her to Unity 2004. I felt she was very mature in her statement. This is part of what she said:   Although I don't believe it was the right decision, I am not angry with the HRC for withdrawing their invitation for me to perform. I will continue to support them, for we must remain united. Divided, we are of little use to each other. Unfortunately, I hear they have felt the destructive power of division as a result of their actions. I regret any harm that may have been done to them, and to the important cause of democracy.  And, who said you weren't role model material?  We could only hope to be that eloquent.

      So, on this day that has been crappy for the gay community, I want to direct you to John Aravosis'  urlLink AmericaBlog.org  where he discusses recent  urlLink outings of right wing staffers and other conservative crazies .  I'm not going to even attempt to comment on what John has already done.  I'll just list their names right here:     Kirk Fordham , Finance Chair for anti-gay, right wing Senate candidate Mel Martinez (R-FL);    John Dowless , former Florida Christian Coalition head and adviser to anti-gay, right wing Senate candidate Mel Martinez (R-FL);    Jay Timmons , head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, run by anti-gay Senator George Allen (R-VA);    You can read more at John's  urlLink blog  about the evil that these men have perpetrated against their own community. May they burn and burn badly. I hope that others of these people's ilk can be exposed for the hateful hypocrites that they are.  I have to say that my support of outing has strengthened after watching  The O'Rielly Factor  and seeing that arrogant bastard Bill O'Rielly try to take on Michael Rogers of  urlLink BlogActive , one of the people that have been closely tied with a new campaign of outing. O'Rielly was in such disbelief that people could have such blatant disregard for a personal's private and personal right and threatened to bleep out any names should they be mentioned on the show (which they were). Yes, this is the same man who doesn't seem to have a problem with the indiscretions of Bill Clinton and dragging a private and personal affair. In fact, dragging Clinton's affair, to me, is worse than outing somebody because, in the end, there's nothing wrong with being gay. There's only something wrong with being gay and acting against the community.

      Today has been a bad day for the LGBT community. First, the United State House of Representatives passes the hate-filled and unconstitutional so-called "Marriage Protection Act," which strips the court of their power in cases protecting the so-called "Defense of Marriage Act" or DOMA. Now, in Florida, we're seeing the direct result of President Bush's right-wing actions when the  urlLink 11th Circuit Court of Appeals passed on hearing a case  challenging the state's discriminatory adoption ban law. The deciding vote in the case was none other than Bush's congressional recess appointment William H. Pryor, one of the most anti-gay and anti-choice judges in the federal court system.   Says  urlLink Human Rights Campaign  (HRC) President Cheryl Jacques, “Judge Pryor has a dismal record when it comes to our families and his vote made the difference in this case. This proves the importance of electing a president who will appoint fair-minded judges. If we defeat President Bush, Judge Pryor won’t be reappointed after his term expires this year.”  Some have asked me why courts matter. This is why courts matter. Federal courts are the final line in interpreting the law. If you have unbiased, right-wing judges in these courts, chances are, decisions in anti-discrimination or pro-human rights cases will be cut down.     urlLink      For more information about the importance of courts, check out these pages:     urlLink HRC's Judicial Nominations Issues Page    urlLink SaveRoe.Com's Why Courts Matter    urlLink SaveOurCourts.org

          Doesn't Bush have a good pro-gay record? Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA): Oh, no, that's nonsense. People who say that don't know what they're talking about.    A July 21 piece on the  Newsweek  Web site features  urlLink an interview  with Rep. Barney Frank, the openly gay Democratic Congressman from Massachussets.  Frank is like the elder statesman of the gay community who has survived controversy and scandal and is now the subject of a documentary called  Let's Get Frank .    At one point,  Newsweek  asks:   Some people think that except for President Bush's position on gay marriage, he has a good pro-gay record. Do you agree?   After which, I spit out what I was drinking, wondering what kind of insane, alternate reality  Newsweek  lived in to answer this question.  As one of the most right-wing Presidents to ever walk this planet, where did that question come from?  It only makes me think that the interviewer and those people who actually believe this are in some perpetual, drug-induced la-la world.  By the way, Frank's response to the question:       Oh, no, that's nonsense. People who say that don't know what they're talking about. He did one thing that was supportive of gay people and that was when a man  who was a professional foreign service officer got to the point where he either had to be made ambassador or fired. Bush agreed with Colin Powell to name him as an ambassador. He has literally done not one other good thing for gay people.Saying that Bush has been supportive except for gay marriage is a little bit like saying he's a very nice man except for the time he murdered somebody. This constitutional amendment is a pretty grievous assault.

      In another effort to fuck with the U.S. Constitution and legislate discrimination, Republicans, this time in the U.S. House of Representatives, has  urlLink passed legislation  that prevents federal courts from compelling states to recognize same-sex marriage performed in other states.  So, in other words, Republicans think that it's okay to slowly chip away at the checks and balances system that has been a cornerstone of this nation just to suit their own hateful needs.  Their reason for this legislation.  They believe that the courts shouldn't be able to change that which has been tradition for centuries.  I'm sure that, if they could, would return to the days of segregation, slavery and no women's rights, too, I bet.  What's worse is that the Congressman who supposedly represents me -- Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Tracy) -- is one of the assholes who helped this lovely piece of legislation, entitled the Marriage Protection Act (H.R. 3313).  Can we please now see if we can get this moron out of Congress?

      That wacky  urlLink Michael Moore  is shaking up America!  According to the  urlLink Associated Press , the GOP is shaking in their boots about the unprecedented success of Moore's film  Fahrenheit 9/11 .       Republicans initially dismissed "Fahrenheit 9/11" as a cinematic screed that would play mostly to inveterate Bush bashers. Four weeks and $94 million later, the film is still pulling in moviegoers at 2,000 theaters around the country, making Republicans nervous as it settles into the American mainstream.       And, they should.  I know that my own mother, who traditionally votes Republican, will probably not be voting Republican this November and I can almost say with 100% confidence that she won't be voting for Bush.  And, I have to say that I  Fahrenheit 9/11  played a part in this.  In all honesty, Michael Moore got on my nerves before, but, now, he has my utmost respect.  He had the guts to try to change the world and, as I am seeing in my own family, he is doing it.  In related news,  urlLink Billboard Magazine  reports that Ms. Linda Ronstadt might not have seen her last days at the Aladdin Casinos.  Apparently, Planet Hollywood is in the process of buying Aladdin which will probably take effect on September 1, 2004.  Said Robert Earl, President and CEO of Planet Hollywood International:       "Upon the assumption of ownership, and with a new management team in place, we would like to offer the use of the Theatre of Performing Arts to Linda Ronstadt for a second concert and further to take  urlLink Michael Moore up on his offer to join her on stage  to introduce her and sing a song."   "We respect artists' creativity and support their rights to express themselves," said Earl. "We were very sorry to hear about the unfortunate circumstances of this past Saturday night and want to make it clear that Planet Hollywood has never, in our 13 year history, restricted any artists' right to free speech and we will continue with that policy once we take ownership."       Viva Las Vegas, Baby!

      I've always had a great respect for the  urlLink National Gay & Lesbian Task Force  (NGLTF).  I have to commend the organization for backing out of Unity 2004 (an LGBT coalition event coinciding with the Democratic National Convention in Boston) after hearing that Margaret Cho had been "uninvited."  It might not win NGLTF popularity points in the world of LGBT organizations, but it's good to hear that somebody is standing up for a woman who has been such a public supporter of the LGBT community.  In his  urlLink statement , NGLTF Executive Director Matt Foreman said:       "We are dismayed that Margaret Cho has been disinvited to perform at the LGBT Unity 2004 event scheduled for Monday, July 26 in Boston. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force had been a co-sponsor of this event.   Throughout her career, Ms. Cho has been a staunch supporter of equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)Americans, has contributed her time and talent to dozens of LGBT fundraising events, and is much loved by our community. We were proud to recently give her a Task Force Leadership Award. Ms. Cho has said, 'I'm more than bi(sexual).' She is, indeed, one of us.   Under these circumstances, we must regretfully withdraw our support for this event."

       urlLink Farai Chideya  posted on her blog an interesting question. Since I haven't really written about Angelo de la Cruz, the Filipino truck driver that was taken hostage and recently released, I thought I'd post her comments:        Final Thoughts: What would you do?   A group of men is threatening to behead one of your citizens. They’ll let him go—if only you pull your troops out of their country. What would you do?  For Phillipine President Gloria Arroyo, the choice was clear. She met the kidnapper’s demands and pulled Phillipine troops out of Iraq a month early. This both allowed hostage Angelo de la Cruz, a driver and father of eight, to go free—and angered American forces. “I do not regret that decision,” said Arroyo. But General John Abizaid, commander of US troops in the region, called her choice “regrettable.”  So, who’s the winner and loser in all this? One winner, obviously, is de la Cruz, a man who can go home to his wife and children. But was President Arroyo’s decision a move that will encourage terrorism—or a humanitarian gesture from the highest levels?  The ability of terrorists to pressure coalition forces could swing the outcome of the conflict in Iraq. The strategy of kidnappings and beheadings doesn’t show any sign of abating. In fact, six foreign workers were just kidnapped and threatened with beheading in Iraq today. The question for America now is how it can keep international troops engaged—and make their lives safe enough to brave Iraq.       I, personally, commend the Philippines for sending their 51 troops home a little earlier to save the life of one of its citizens. Perhaps if it were under other circumstances, such as the Philippines were in there with thousands of troops for the duration, that I might think differently. Unlike the Bush Administration, though, the Philippine Government has regard for its people.  But, I honestly don't think that this issue is about backing down and showing terrorists weakness as much as it is about the Bush Adminstration fearing the dissolving coalition of the willing. If the Philippines does it, how will other nation's respond to terrorist attacks. Bush's little crusade against Iraq is failing in front of his eyes, but he can't have his little self-made world community turn their backs on him, too.

      While we were travelling to Los Angeles today, I had to ask...do the Republicans know they are really transparent or are they just plain stupid?  Or both?   I wonder what it's like to be part of the Bush spin team...    Hmmm...the 9/11 Commission is going to come out with a report that will be critical of the Bush Administration and its handling of terrorist attacks on the country.  What can we do?  What can we do?  Ah, it seems like Clinton's former national security adviser and Kerry adviser Sandy Berger had taken some documents from the National Archives.  Let's make it seem like he stuffed it down his pants or in his socks or something.  Nobody will question the fact that these documents can actually be found elsewhere.  Let's just make it look like Kerry has benefited and get Berger to resign.    What a bunch of fucking assholes.   Anyway, I don't think I could have written about this more eloquently than the  urlLink Center for American Progress .  See their  urlLink Progress Report  for more details.

      Flying back from Los Angeles this evening, I found the  USA Today  Life Section in the magazine pouch in front of me.  It featured an article entitled " urlLink Celebrities declare own war — on Bush " and tries to answer the question "Why are there so many new 'Jane Fondas?'"  It cites recent comments made by Whoopi Goldberg, a projection of Bush and Adolph Hitler side-by-side at an Ozzy Ozbourne concert, the lyric in Jadikiss' song "Why?" and Linda Ronstadt's dedication of "Desperado" to Michael Moore. In each of these cases, the celebrity was punished in some way.   Claims the article:       But unsolicited anti-Bush rhetoric, which appears to be spinning out of control, is alienating both Republicans and Democrats.      Bad, bad, liberal celebrities.  But, of course, it's okay for Dennis Miller to make disparaging remarks about prominent Democrats and make homophobic remarks about Kerry's and Edward's close relationship. And, it's so sweet that everybody wants to cut Governor Schwarzenegger some slack for some misogynistic and homophobic remarks about Democrats in the State Legislature.       "The hate and vitriol that has surrounded Kerry's campaign has existed for months," Bush campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt says. Democrats are distancing themselves from offending celebs. Kerry spokeswoman Allison Dobson says: "A lot of these things we don't have anything to do with. These folks don't speak for (us)."      Whatever. I expect it from Bush's camp, but, frankly, Allison Dobson, the Democrats need to be embracing the highly public celebrities that support you.  And, by the way Steve Schmidt, you want to take about hate and virtiol in the Republican party, take a vacation because it'll take a week to at cite only the most minor forms of it. Take a month and we might get through it all.  Anyway, what's even sadder is that Margaret Cho has been  urlLink "unvited"  to perform at an upcoming lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender event called  urlLink Unity 2004  to conicide with the Democratic National Convention.  According to Cho's  urlLink press release , she was uninvited by a  urlLink Human Rights Campaign  (HRC) spokesperon concerned with "a potential media  firestorm" from her using material from her new show  State of Emergency  which is (as Cho puts it) "a raw interpretation of what's happening daily in our ever-evolving or devolving state of the union."       Cho is the latest in a long line of   celebrities taking aim at President Bush         "I am not surprised at the reversal in light of how the Kerry campaign distanced itself from Whoopi's routine in response to the unrelenting media hype and Republican criticism," said Margaret's manager, Karen Taussig. "It's Whoopi's job as a comedian to say things that are sometimes shocking. I wish they could have backed her up. Dennis Miller can make gay jokes about Senators Kerry and Edwards at a recent Bush rally in Wisconsin to a complete absence of media scrutiny. No one demanded a tape of that event or alleged that his comments as a comedian might reflect poorly on Bush."      In May, Cho's mic was  urlLink turned off for 10 minutes  because of jokes made that some felt were in bad taste toward the Bush Administration. Even worse, the Omni Hotels, where Cho was performing,  urlLink stopped her check .  Again, it baffles me how Republican hatred can just be passed off as good ol' American fun, yet Democrat attacks on the Bush Administration are considered punishable offenses.  The good part in all this is that the  urlLink ACLU  will be honoring Margaret Cho.       This September the ACLU is set to honor her with their First Amendment Award. Ramona Ripston, Executive Director of ACLU states "In these very troubled times, when the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution are in jeopardy, we applaud Margaret's courage to speak out about the dangerous policies of the Bush administration and her commitment to organizing others to do the same. More than ever before, this country needs activists and artists like Margaret to stand up and let their voices be heard."

      God! I almost forgot. Today, July 20, 2004, is the  urlLink 35th Anniversary  of the historic moment when the Apollo 11 landed on the surface of the moon and when astronaut Neil Armstrong proclaimed, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."       To date, while explorers roam Mars and a satellite wanders around Saturn, the moon has been the only extraterrestrial world that humankind has explored.        NASA's human space flight program has been grounded since shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas on February 1, 2003, killing all seven astronauts aboard. Investigators found a "broken safety culture" at NASA and recommended upgrades that the space agency has said will cost $750 million more than first estimated.  Getting the three remaining shuttles flying again is only the beginning of the "vision for space exploration" that Bush unveiled on January 14.       While saying these words are like choking on my own vomit, advancing the space program significantly is probably the  only  thing that I agree with Bush on.  feh...  Sorry...writing that seriously did make me vomit in my own mouth.  As I wrote before, I'm very much a supporter of building our space program. It behooves us as a nation to expand our horizons and learn what's out there. We fight about space here on Earth so much. Wouldn't it be nice to see how we might be able to colonize the infinite cosmos where border disputes will become a thing of the past.   Where I disagree with Bush is trying to build a space program in an economy totally decimated by war. We must take care of things here on Earth first. This is why we need somebody like John Kerry to fix the damage that Bush and rebuild the surplusses we once had in the Clinton era so that we can look to space effectively and without screwing over people.  But, I do think we continuously need to invest in the space program and, hopefully, I'll get to see sometime before I die a human being stepping on to a planet beyond our moon.

      Well, it's been a battle between two arch-enemies -- my hero Al Franken, celebrated author, savvy political commentator and hilarious radio host, and the hated Bill O'Rielly, rude, abusive, lying prick who poses as a "news" talkshow host -- with Mr. Franken  urlLink coming out on top .*       "The Al Franken Show," airing weekdays on WLIB-AM, more than doubled O'Reilly's "The Radio Factor" on WOR-AM among listeners aged 25 to 54 -- the group advertisers prize most -- during the only hour when the two go head to head in New York, Arbitron Inc. reported on Tuesday.  According to its April-to-June survey, the first since Air America's debut, Franken posted a 2.6 share from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., compared with a 1.1 share for O'Reilly in the 25-54 demographic.  An Arbitron share is an average quarter-hour measure of listenership that combines audience size with the amount of time people are tuned in.  O'Reilly did slightly better than Franken in the broader demographic of all listeners aged 12 and up. But they were each eclipsed by Limbaugh in both demographics.       It's only a matter of time, Mr. Limbaugh...  *  Note:  Unlike O'Rielly and the FOX Network, I do not pretend to be unbiased.

      Well, as expected, and rightfully so, there has been a lot of  urlLink furor over Governor Schwarzenegger's "girlie-men" comments  made over the weekend.  The term aimed toward Democrats has brought out every gay group and leader in the state to express their outrage.  That is...with the exception of the  urlLink Log Cabin Republicans .      The Log Cabin Republicans (LCR), the largest U.S. gay GOP group, dismissed the 'girlie-men' remark as "harmless."  "The governor is one of the most inclusive governors in the nation, regardless of party affiliation," Patrick Guerriero, executive director of LCR, said in a statement. "This is a time when the gay and lesbian community should be uniting to fight anti-gay legislation and reaching out to our allies in both parties. This is not the time for baseless partisan attacks and mind-numbing political correctness."      Mmmm...wait a minute.  I seem to recall sometime around the year 2000 this same group saying something very similar about an ex-Texas governor running for President.  I'm just saying.  The most poignant statement, though, comes from Shannon Minter from the  urlLink National Center for Lesbian Rights :      "I believe that Gov. Schwarzenegger intended his remark to be tongue-in-cheek and did not intend any harm," said Shannon Minter, director of the Transgender Law Project at the San Fransico-based National Center for Lesbian Rights. "Nonetheless, the painful reality is that terms that disparage people based on gender stereotypes have been used to dehumanize and demean women, gay people and transgender people."  Minter told the PlanetOut Network that such terms can be particularly harmful to GLBT youth, many of whom struggle against gender stereotypes.  "As we have seen here in California -- especially with the recent  urlLink murder of transgender youth Gwen Araujo  -- bias and hostility toward people who are seen as violating gender norms can be deadly."      The example of a good leader is somebody who is able to say admit when they are wrong and be able to make amends.  I'm just saying.

           I just read at  urlLink Keith Boykin's  Web site that they have their campaign ads for the upcoming  urlLink  American Candidate   show up on Showtime's Web site.  At the Web site, visit  urlLink Keith's candidate profile  where you can watch the campaign ad.  It's a hoot!  The show starts on August 1, so keep an eye out for it!  I'm telling you, I'd vote for Keith if he were truly running for President!

      For those of you who would like to read Michael Moore's letter to the Aladdin Casinos in defense of Linda Ronstadt, click  urlLink here .  It was very sweet that he has on his homepage a picture of one of her record albums with the simple message, "Thank you, Linda Ronstadt."  He also posted the  urlLink Associated Press  article which had more information than the Reuters story CNN posted on their Web site.      Before singing "Desperado" for an encore Saturday night, the 58-year-old rocker called Moore a "great American patriot" and "someone who is spreading the truth." She also encouraged everybody to see the documentary about President Bush.      I've always liked Linda Ronstadt, but now I like her even more.  But, I love the Aladdin Casino President's reaction to the insanity that ensued:      "It was a very ugly scene," Aladdin President Bill Timmins told The Associated Press. "She praised him and all of a sudden all bedlam broke loose."      Oh, no!  She dedicated a song to Michael Moore!  It's the apocalypse!  Ugh...cranky!  But, thank you, Mr. Moore, for providing the address I was looking for.

           Well, it looks like the Aladdin casino will be the last place I go to while in Las Vegas.  Apparently, the casino  urlLink "removed" Linda Ronstadt  after she dedicated "Desperado" to  Fahrenheit 9/11  and filmmaker Michael Moore, saying that he  urlLink "is someone who cares about this country deeply and is trying to help."   Apparently, this one little dedication made a bunch of people flip out and cause mayhem at the box-office which pissed off hotel officials.       "To be clear, the Aladdin does not condone the comments made by Ms. Ronstadt," Squyres said by e-mail. "Ms. Ronstadt was hired to entertain the guests of the Aladdin, not to espouse her political views. Following her performance she was escorted out of the hotel and immediately checked out of her room. And she will not be welcomed back."      What's hilarious is that she was escorted out of the hotel.  Like, what did they think she was going to do?  Get up on a speaker, flip off the crowd and scream, "Down with the establishment!"  For somebody who has been a frequent performer, this is a lousy way to treat somebody.  But, ironically, shortly before the show, she told the  Las Vegas Review-Journal  that she hoped this would be her last show, saying, ""I keep hoping that if I'm annoying enough to them, they won't hire me back."  Well, you got your wish, Ms. Ronstadt.  And, I hope you're saying to yourself, "Good ridance to bad rubbish."  You deserve a whole lot better.  Now, I need to find the address for the Aladdin Casinos so I can rip them a new asshole.

           So, it appears that one of the most outspoken supporters of the Federal Marriage Amendment to the U.S. Constitution now says that he is in favor of state's rights to grant same-sex Civil Unions.  According to  urlLink PlanetOut.Com , Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) thinks that states should be able to "determine whether or not civil unions are appropriate for that state."  Yes, this from the man who thinks same-sex marriage is an "untested social experiment on children" and that "activist judges" are trying to "destroy the institution of marriage."      "His voting record shows one thing, and now he's trying to appeal to fair-minded conservatives, moderates and liberals with rhetoric," said Steven Fisher, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a national GLBT rights group. "He voted with the extremists and perhaps he doesn't want to associated with them, but his record fits firmly in their camp."      Isn't that sweet?  Personally, I think he wants to be the ultimate flip flopper.  Actually, it's interesting because I remember reading an article awhile back about people in the religious right knowing that they won't be able to win the civil unions argument.  They know that there is only so far they can go without people turning on them.  While Republican supporters of the Federal Marriage Amendment want to believe that they were doing the public a service, they know that, publicly, it just looks like they supported hate.  It's along the lines of hate the sin, but love the sinner.    And, I think that McCain's statement really hit some people in the gut.  I'm imagining that Frist's comments also have more to do with appeasing Republican voters who also believe in state's rights and less bigger government.  This, I'm sure, is another way of Frist's appealing to this group of people.  Whatever the case might be, in the end, we just have to ask ourselves -- who the fuck cares about what a vicious hate monger has to say about civil unions?  NO SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP!  THAT'S TOLERANCE!  THAT'S RESPECT!  'Nuf said...I'm cranky!

      Last night, I got to watch  Outfoxed , the documentary on FOX News produced by the  urlLink Center for American Progress  and  urlLink MoveOn.org  and directed by documentarian Robert Greenwald, who many film critics are pegging as the "next Michael Moore." I unfortunately didn't get to go to one of the house parties that happened last night and I'm bummed about it...especially because it was going to include a conference call with Mr. Al Franken, who is one of my heroes...but, my DVD arrived just in time. So, I was resolute to watch it last night, even if it was later than everybody else.    Let me say this right off the bat, I really enjoyed the film and thought that Greenwald had done his research well. Regardless of what the FOX News Network says about the ex-employees that were interviewed in the film, it is undeniable that the network is completely and utterly biased toward the conservative. I've been a long time believer in the power of the media. I think those who discount its role in American society are delluded. I also think that FOX News truly is the scum of the earth in news programming. But, the thing is that I already knew all this. I think everybody who is liberal knows this.    That, ultimately, was my problem with Greenwald's film. I felt like it was trying to sell something specifically to people who already had the product. I already want to tear FOX News Network apart with my own hands. After watching 80 minutes of film, I was no further inspired than I was before I popped the DVD in. I still hated FOX News.    What I would have loved to have seen was a film that somehow spoke to the muddled middle, particularly right of center people who might be swung closer to the center and hopefully even left of it. It's people like my mom, who has FOX News on 24/7, that I would have loved to have shown this film to and have said, "See! Do you see how FOX News is as terrible as I say?" My mom is one of those people who likes to believe she's right wing, but, really isn't. Again, I do think Greenwald does a beautiful job of presenting the facts, but the emotional resonance is not there. This, to me, is ultimately what separates Greenwald from Michael Moore.    When I walked out of  Fahrenheit 9/11  with my mom, I knew that she would not be voting for President Bush this election. Moore showed her things that she didn't know before and related the facts to her as a mother and as a person who understands why people in lower economic classes join the military. Most of all, Moore makes a clear emotional challenge of Bush's integrity. Unfortunately, you don't get this with  Outfoxed .    I started to notice that this film was aimed more at the liberatti rather than the questioning public when they were showing comparissons of who had inaccurate information. Those who watched PBS or listened to NPR seemed to know more than those who watched FOX News. Now, I totally believe this because I watch PBS and listen to NPR. But, most of the rest of the world does not. If they're not watching FOX News, they're watching CNN or MSNBC (or, they might not watch cable news at all). The comparisson to PBS/NPR could be considered intellectual elitest.    Another part that I felt Greenwald missed an opportunity was when the film focused on  urlLink Jeremy Glick's interview  on  The O'Rielly Factor . Glick had lost his father in the 9/11 tragedy, but signed on to an anti-war advertisement. While on O'Rielly's show, Glick was told to shut up and his mic was cut off. I felt that Greenwald should have interviewed Glick about  why  he decided to sign the statement from a personal standpoint. Instead, Greenwald interviews Glick on his personal strategy for being interviewed on the show and then let's Glick's story as told on the show tell the viewers why he signed the statement. The only problem is that O'Rielly had him on such a defensive that you don't really feel the story. I would like my mom to see how this one individual loved his father but understood the importance of taking a stand against the war and then show how O'Rielly totally disrespected him. See...again, I get it. But, to centrists and right of centers, not so much.    But, I don't want to be totally down on the film. Again, I do want to point out its brilliance and making the case for FOX's conservative, right wing bias. And, if anything, some really good came out of the film in the form of house parties around the country watching the film and  urlLink MoveOn.org  and Common Cause have both  urlLink filed a complaint  to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), urging the agency to prevent FOX News from using the deceptive catch phrase "fair and balanced." It is also  urlLink urging activists to write the FCC  themselves.

      The last week was not good for the Cheneys, was it?  First, Lynne Cheney is seen on  Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer , clearly parting from the President's stance on same-sex marriage and then having it quoted over and over again by journalists and politicians throughout the week. Then, there were those ugly rumors about Dick Cheney being replaced as Bush's running mate this year. Oh, poor, poor Cheneys. What would help the Cheneys out? How about a  urlLink  Newsweek  article entitled "Cheney Family Values" ?       Under The Breath:   Oh, dear, Mary...your lesbianism   got mommy into trouble last week...      And, oh, look...here's a little passage about Mary, Dick Cheney's Uncle Tom-esque lesbian daughter:       Mary, 35, is a lesbian, a slightly awkward reality for a family identified with conservative family values. An M.B.A., she helped the Coors Brewing Co. handle a boycott by the gay community. (Gay-rights activists have targeted Mary, putting her face on a milk carton to pressure her to use her influence inside the Bush administration.) Last week, when the Senate voted down a resolution calling for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, Lynne Cheney spoke up to say that the issue should be a matter for the states to decide. Her remark was interpreted by some media outlets as breaking with the president, who had pushed the gay-marriage ban. Not so, says [former White House aide and now part-time Cheney spin doctor Mary] Matalin. "She was really carefully, artfully calibrating not to part with the president" while at the same time being "cognizant" of her role as a mother."       Um...excuse me?  Were we watching the same program?  Let's refer to the  official  CNN  urlLink transcript  of the now infamous July 11, 2004  Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer :    BLITZER:  Now, I interviewed the vice president a few months ago, and he revised his position to say he supports the president when it comes to this issue. As the vice president he has no choice: He has to support the president.  But is this a good idea for a constitutional amendment to come forward that would ban same-sex marriage?   CHENEY:  Well, I thought that the formulation he used in 2000 was very good. And first of all, to be clear that people should be free to enter into their relationships that they choose. And, secondly, to recognize what's historically been the situation, that when it comes to conferring legal status on relationships, that is a matter left to the states.  Of course, what's happened is we're in a situation now where the ability of the states to do that has been called into some question by the actions of the court in Massachusetts.    Okay, so, let's dissect this to see where Matlin could have interpreted Lynne Cheney's words the way that she did:    Well, I thought that the formulation he used in 2000 was very good.  I interpret this as Lynne Cheney agreeing with her husband's "formulation" during the 2000 election that there shouldn't "necessarily be a federal policy in this area." (This area, meaning, same-sex marriage). Okay, moving on:    And first of all, to be clear that people should be free to enter into their relationships that they choose.  In the most simplistic terms, I interpret Lynne Cheney to support the union of two people of the same-sex.  Okay, next:    And, secondly, to recognize what's historically been the situation, that when it comes to conferring legal status on relationships, that is a matter left to the states.  I don't know how anybody could interpret this other than Lynne Cheney saying that no federal policy should be written on same-sex marriage as this should be "a matter left to the states." Okay...then, what about:    Of course, what's happened is we're in a situation now where the ability of the states to do that has been called into some question by the actions of the court in Massachusetts.  This  could  be Matlin's "smoking gun" as Lynne Cheney does seem to stir up the Bush line of "activist judges." HOWEVER, she makes no mention that she believes in a federal policy and is still quite clear that she believes it should be up to the states. So, nice try, Mary...Oh, but there's more...    BLITZER:  So you heard Olympia Snowe and Dianne Feinstein say it is a bad idea, even though they both said it's not a good idea to have same-sex marriage, to codify it into law, it's a bad idea to have a constitutional amendment, that's the nuance right there. That's the difference between the Kerry-Edwards position and the Bush-Cheney position.   CHENEY:  I think that the constitutional amendment discussion will give us an opportunity to look for ways to discuss ways in which we can keep the authority of the states intact.   Let's dissect what Lynne Cheney has to say here:    I think that the constitutional amendment discussion will give us an opportunity to look for ways to discuss ways in which we can keep the authority of the states intact.  So, I interpret this as that she views this debate as a "discussion" and not "policy," but seems to reaffirm that she still supports the "authority of the states" and not a "federal policy." After that, Blitzer tries to question her more, but Cheney simply replies:    CHENEY:  No, I've answered the question twice, Wolf.   So, if you look at what she's actually said twice, she's said in no uncertain terms that there should be  no  federal policy and that the same-sex marriage issue should be decided by the states. That, my friends, clearly parts with the Bush stance on same-sex marriage.  But, to tell you the truth, I have respect for Lynne Cheney who could have easily outright lied. Yes, I believe she was being artful in her wording, but, I, along with many other people, interpret her words to mean that she is a supporter of same-sex marriage. Frankly, while Lynne Cheney is probably wishing she never agreed to be on  Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer , she has made more of a stance on same-sex marriage than her own openly lesbian daughter.

       I, Robot  might have been  urlLink number one in the box office this week , but, amazingly,  Fahrenheit 9/11  has been holding up pretty good, slipping only one rank to number five. The little film that could did very respectably, bringing in $7 million over the weekend and earning it a record breaking $93.8 million in just four weeks.  Everest  was the previous documentary box office winner at $84.4 million.  If the film holds up,  Fahrenheit 9/11  will pass up the magic $100 million mark by the end of next weekend. Actually, Box Office Mojo reports that the film has already  urlLink surpassed this mark  worldwide  .       To compare it to other films, based on estimates posted at  urlLink Box Office Mojo  for July 16-18,  Fahrenheit 9/11  did better than:     White Chicks  has in the same amount of time -- 4 weeks.  To date,  White Chicks  has made $63.4 million;    The Terminal  has in 5 weeks.  To date,  The Terminal  has made $71.2 million;    Garfield: The Movie  has in 6 weeks.  To date,  Garfield: The Movie  has made $70.3 million;    Kill Bill: Volume 2  has in 14 weeks.  to date,  Kill Bill: Volume 2  has made $66 million.    Congratulations, Mr. Moore!

          Escaping the summer heat, I went to see  I, Robot  on the big screen and thoroughly enjoyed myself. The film is set 31 years in the future in 2035 and centers around a police detective named Del Spooner (played by Will Smith) who is, for some reason, the only human on earth suspicious of robots. Spooner pretty much hates robots and gets a lot of flack for it. Suddenly, he is thrown in the middle of a murder mystery where he must follow cryptic "breadcrumbs" left by the deceased Dr. Lanning (played by Mr. James "I'm-In-Everything-Now" Cromwell). With, at first, the reluctant help of Dr. Susan Culver (played by Bridgette Moynahan), a robopsychologist for the corporate giant U.S. Robotics, Spooner discovers that he might be more right about robots than he imagined.    I, Robot  is a film loosely based on a collection of short stories written by Isaac Asimov, a prolific science fiction author whose work seemed to transcend the genre. The most similar part of the movie to the book is the THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS, which is, apparently, lifted word for word out of Asimov's stories:   1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.       So, we know right off the bat that this is going to be a cautionary tale a la  Minority Report  (which cautioned us that technology is not always fool proof in talking about civil rights),  Gattaca  (which cautioned us that genetic research could lead to a future genetic hierarchy),  Terminator  (which, again, cautions us on the dependence of technology), or...well...President Bush declaring war on Iraq (which cautions us that dependence on oil can make a President lie and declare war for oil interest). And, I'm a sucker for cautionary tales, when done well.   The thing about  I, Robot  is that it leads with action before it really makes a believable case for robot invasion. The film actually has me going throughout the film, but it felt like the ending was rushed in a kind of "Scooby-Doo Mystery" kind of way. This, unfortunately, makes the cautionary tale fall flat. Also, Spooner's anti-robot attitude seems to be isolated. He literally  is  the only person who has these fears. Yet, in this day and age where we seem to be slaves to technology such as the Internet, there are more than a handful that fear its potential. Humans, by nature, love a good conspiracy theory (otherwise, we'd never see films like  I, Robot ). Hell, I LOVE the Internet, but if you told me that it was trying to kill us, you'd have my ear. In this film, nobody believes Spooner, despite some very credible evidence to support his claims.  But, let's face it, the film is not so much a highly intellectual discussion about the role of technology on our lives and how this might affect our future. It is the eye candy that thrusts us into a fantasy world that makes us forget that it's friggin' damn hot outside. The special effects have become so advanced that you almost forget robots of this nature do not really exist. The soulful robot Sonny seems every bit as real as his human counterparts. And, the action scenes were superb. There were scenes that were so thrilling that I bit my bottom lip so hard I'm surprised that there are no teeth marks. Although, one could find it ironic that a film about technology overtaking humanity is almost taken over by technology.      But, I'm not willing to concede the film only being successful for its technological merrits. I enjoyed Will Smith who continues in his tradition of action movie star. He has just the right amount of charm that makes him feel accessible and the kind of person you want to be your hero. Admittedly, though, my favorite non-robot character was Spooner's wise and warm grandmother, played by Adrian Ricard. She, if anybody, made me feel that the future was not as bleak as Hollywood sometimes likes to paint the future (particularly in cautionary tales). She is what humanity is all about.    I, Robot  beat our  Spider-Man  this weekend for the top spot on the box office. For a summer movie, while not perfect, it's a lot of fun and definitely worth the price of admission. I give this movie   TWO THUMBS UP, FOUR STARS AND TWO RIPE TOMATOES  .  But, if you don't like what I have to say, you can visit  urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_robot/ .

      Well, it's going to be really interesting to see how the Bush Administration gets itself out of this one.  The 9/11 Commission will be releasing its  urlLink final report  which will both contain its findings as well as offer recommendations. Amongst the recommendations:           But the final report goes beyond the detailed findings of the commission's staff, scolding Congress for poor oversight of the nation's counterterrorism efforts and urging specific and dramatic reforms that include creation of a powerful national counterterrorism center, according to administration officials and those involved in drafting the document. The new center would have far greater authority than the Terrorist Threat Integration Center opened by the CIA last year, officials said.               The report also recommends a Cabinet-level office and director to oversee the CIA, the FBI and other intelligence agencies, as the  New York Times  reported yesterday, but one official familiar with the report said that was only part of a broader reorganization aimed at shaking up the intelligence community. The five Republicans and five Democrats on the commission say they have jointly agreed not to discuss details of their recommendations before the report is released.             The proposals follow two reports by the House and Senate intelligence committees that faulted the government's intelligence gathering, particularly at the CIA, and come amid a flurry of legislative proposals to remake the intelligence community.                     The commission has tried to remain as bi-partisan as possible, finding fault on both the Clinton and Bush sides in regards to fighting terrorism:       On the politically charged election-year argument over whether the Clinton or Bush administration had the more aggressive approach to battling al Qaeda, the commission has produced evidence on both sides. Scores of previously classified documents and e-mails the commission has already disclosed show, for example, that national security adviser Condoleezza Rice was correct when she argued in public hearings this spring that unlike Clinton, Bush adopted a policy early in 2001 that explicitly sought to eliminate al Qaeda.  Yet the commission has released documents showing that the practical steps Bush planned to take during the early years of his presidency imitated much of Clinton's unsuccessful strategy of negotiating with the Taliban, even though the threat of a massive al Qaeda terrorist attack seemed to be rising.        However, there's still a lot of damning evidence in the report for the Bush Administration.  it will be most interesting to see how the Bush Administration will weasle their way out of previously unreleased documenation from Richard Clarke.  Clarke, the former counterterrorism czar, had tried, although unsuccessfully, to get the Bush Administration to listen to intelligence that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda were planning a major attack against the United States.  But, the most interesting part will be a final note that Clarke sent to National Security Adviser Condelezza Rice just before the 9/11 attacks happened:       Clarke's e-mails and memos culminated in a dramatic note to Rice in early September, in which Clarke poured out his frustrations and, in eerily prescient language that forecast the commission's work, urged Bush's policymakers to "imagine a day after a terrorist attack, with hundreds of Americans dead at home and abroad, and ask themselves what they could have done earlier."       Also, as mentioned in another  urlLink  Washington Post   article, what of the 1998 memo prepared for President Clinton that specifically mentions possible hijackings by al-Qaeda and which was referenced in a President's Daily Brief (PDB) for President Bush in 2001?         The 1998 document is "the most important PDB about hijacking published before 9/11," [commission executive director Philip D.] Zelikow said. The Aug. 6, 2001, PDB prepared for President Bush mentioned 1998 intelligence concerning a plot by bin Laden "to hijack a U.S. aircraft to gain the release of 'Blind Sheik' Omar Abdel Rahman and other U.S.-held extremists."  The 2001 PDB said intelligence officials "have not been able to corroborate" the plot reports from 1998.  The 1998 PDB is titled: "Bin Laden preparing to hijack U.S. aircraft and other attacks." It was declassified, with redactions, by the White House last Monday at the Sept. 11 panel's request. The text of the 1998 PDB was read to a reporter by an administration official who had access to the declassified document.        And, for the more visually oriented,  The Washington Post  has posted a  urlLink graphic comparison  of early views vs. the commission reports.

           Okay...I'm going to admit something that I'm not terribly happy about. When I was living in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, there was an anchorwoman named  Bree Walker , who had deformed hands, that my friends and I used to make fun of all the time. I remember one of my friends came up with the nickname of "stumpy" for her and we'd laugh and laugh and laugh.  As the story goes, though, when you get older, you become more sophisticated in the way you view things. So, being what I hope is a more enlightened person, I'd like to think that I would be much more sensitive about the matter.  Anyway, the reason why I bring this up is because Bree Walker was on  urlLink  Larry King Live  tonight  (or, actually, it was an encore presentation, but this is the first time I had seen it). To tell you the truth, I actually had forgotten about Walker until now and, sadly, I remember hearing her name and the first thought popping into my mind being "stumpy." Walker, who has a genetic deformity called ectrodactyly, was on the show to talk about her activism in terms of disability. I decided to watch the show to hear what she had to say and I was really impressed with what she had to say, particularly when talking about issues of abortion, widening what we traditionally call "diversity," and stem cell research.  King questioned Walker about a controversy surrounding a KFI radio reporter who had called Walker out on bringing a child into the world knowing there's a possibility the child could also be born with ectrodactyly:    KING:  And what did they ask you to do, those who were against you having the baby?   WALKER:  Most people felt that I should have chosen abortion. And in fact, when I had gone to my ob/gyn in New York at Mt. Sinai Hospital. I was sent up to the chief ob/gyn to have a conversation after we saw that my first child, Andrea, who's now almost 16 in a sonogram did, in fact have my hands and feet.  And I saw it. I saw her little hands and feet pushed up against the uterine wall, and I said, "She's got my hands and feet." And at that time, the sonogram operator ran outside, left -- leaving me there lying with just the sheet and then the chief of obstetrics came down to speak with me.  And he said, "Please come up to my office." At which point, he said, "Here are the options."  And I looked at him, thinking, "This is an automatic conversation that the medical community and social science community had with women that have disabilities that are congenital. There is an automatic conversation that you're going to be expected to choose abortion."   KING:  You never thought of it?   WALKER:  Of course I thought of it. I mean, I'm someone who believes that a woman's right to her own body -- body is a supreme thing.   It's interesting listening to a woman who has the option to decide whether she wants to have an abortion or not. Ultimately, she chooses not to have an abortion, but she clearly states that it is a decision that is hers to make on her own without intrusion from outside forces.  Later, Walker talked about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):    WALKER:  Well, we live in a time, luckily, when as of 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed. But as time has marched on, a lot of that ADA has been gutted.  So we're living in a time now when, as you know, our popular culture has become pretty toxic for young women and for aging women. It's the same toxic problem. As the bar continues to be raised on what is physical perfection and a more narrower definition is given us, what's acceptable, we have an impossible standard. And we're forced to focus on superficial values.  That hurts the disability rights movement, because of course this kind of diversity isn't celebrated when you're living in a culture that worships only the pursuit of physical perfection.   I'm ashamed to say that I never thought of deformity and disability as part of the diversity spectrum. Sometimes, I get so focused on diversity as a racial issue or a sexual orientation issue that I forget the spectrum is much wider than we even imagine it. I appreciate people who continue to challenge our notions of diversity. As Walker explains, "It is the last civil rights movement. There are about 50 million people that fall under a category of officially disabled in the ADA, in various clarifications, which means one in five."  But, what was even more interesting was Walker talking about stem cell research as it could potentially help end ectrodactyly. Walker is quick to laud and support the coming of stem cell research but maintains that deformity is a part of our reality:    WALKER:  I think ultimately we will genetically engineer most disabilities and deformities out of our culture. I'm all for getting rid of diseases that reduce the quality of life. I don't want to decide anything for my kids. I think they will be faced with the decision of do we engineer this out of their futures? I don't know what they'll choose. We don't discuss it too much, other than to say this will probably be a possibility within their lifetime.  I think, however, it's important to remember that diversity is what makes human beings so interesting. And who's to say that, as we become more alike, genetically engineered to be all blue-eyed or brown-eyed or X number of girls versus X number of boys in the world, who is to say that we don't so challenge what is important in humanity that we've ruined everything?   Again, she points out our society's emphasis on physical perfection.  After seeing her on  Larry King Live  tonight, I gain not only more respect for Bree Walker, but for those who have to live with disability or deformity. While it's probably not likely Ms. Walker reads this entry, I leave an open apology for the things I thought about in the past about a woman who I think young women everywhere should aspire to be.

          So, our beloved Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is making his way across California in a deliberate smear campaign to destroy the Democrats who he says are holding up his $103 billion budget. Here in California, the budget should have been signed, sealed, delivered (I'm yours!  Er...sorry) on June 30. So, we are 17 days late. The problem is that Schwarzenegger won the recall election in October on a pledge that he will end partisan politics and fix the budget of the state.  The problem with Schwarzenegger is that I think he thinks that not playing bipartisan politics means just agreeing with him. To me, this only goes to show what a political neophyte Schwarzenegger is. I honestly believe that he thought he could invade Sacramento and everybody would just listen to him. And, in the beginning, the Democrats did try to work with Schwarzenegger in every way, including approving the passage of a controversial $15 billion bond that is supposed to help California's ailing budget.  According to  urlLink Reuters :       "The Democrats tried I think to extend an olive branch out of the gate and tried to work with him," said Michael Bustamante, a Democrat consultant who played a leading role in opposing Republican Schwarzenegger's election last year.      But, things are not that easy. Otherwise, we'd only have one party and live in utopia. The great thing about this nation is that people  can  disagree.  And, that's what's happening with the  urlLink budget :       Both the governor and Democratic leaders agree they're stuck on three major points -- local government financing and the repeal of two labor laws. One law prohibits schools from contracting services with private companies, while the other gives workers authority to sue their employers to enforce labor laws.  Schwarzenegger said he supported Republican demands to repeal the labor laws and protect city and county treasuries from the Legislature.       Schwarzenegger can't STAND the fact that people disagree with him.  So, now, Schwarzenegger has gone on a  urlLink rampage :       Though the governor didn't name particular legislators, he held the rally in the home city of Democratic Assemblywoman Gloria Negrete McLeod. He appeared Friday in the district of one of this year's few closely contested legislative districts, where Democratic Sen. Betty Karnette faces Republican Steve Kuykendall, a former legislator and congressman, for an open Assembly seat.  On Sunday he is scheduled to appear in Stockton, the district of Democratic Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews.       What's hilarious is that Schwarzenegger's language has suggested that he has mistaken being a Terminator robot with being the governor of a state. According to the  urlLink  San Francisco Chronicle  :       He drew boisterous cheers from mall-goers when he said the lawmakers were "girlie men" too afraid to admit they favored "special interests" over the public interest.       Looking past the inherent sexist and homophobic statement the governor made (especially given the fact that three of the four districts he's targeting have Democratic women running), it's impossible not to laugh and make us wonder, yet again, what the hell were we thinking? (or, at least, what the hell were those who voted for him thinking?)   And, if you can't get enough of that Terminator language, here are some other doozies:    "I was the Terminator on the screen. I'm going to terminate the big problems in Sacramento right now in real life. That's what we're going to do!"  ( urlLink  San  Francisco Chronicle  , July 16, 2004)   "I will stay here and I will fight like a warrior, for the people of California and there is no one that can stop me. And anyone who pushes me around I will push back, including the Democrats and the special interests, trust me."  ( urlLink Reuters , July 16, 2004)   "If these guys won't do the job, I'm going to announce each of you a terminator. Nov. 2 is judgment day. That's when you go to the polls."  ( urlLink  San Franisco Chronicle  , July 17, 2004)  It makes one wonder, though.  When he is voted out of office, will he look at the camera and say, "Ah'll Be Bahck!"

      Both  urlLink  TIME Magazine   and  urlLink  Newsweek   reveal that the 9/11 Commission will reveal evidence that suggests a link between al-Qaeda and Iran.  Yes...you heard me...IRAN.  Not IRAQ.  IRAN.  According to  TIME :       A senior U.S. official told TIME that the Commission has uncovered evidence suggesting that between eight and ten of the 14 "muscle" hijackers—that is, those involved in gaining control of the four 9/11 aircraft and subduing the crew and passengers—passed through Iran in the period from October 2000 to February 2001. Sources also tell TIME that Commission investigators found that Iran had a history of allowing al-Qaeda members to enter and exit Iran across the Afghan border. This practice dated back to October 2000, with Iranian officials issuing specific instructions to their border guards—in some cases not to put stamps in the passports of al-Qaeda personnel—and otherwise not harass them and to facilitate their travel across the frontier. The report does not, however, offer evidence that Iran was aware of the plans for the 9/11 attacks.  The senior official also told TIME that the report will note that Iranian officials approached the al-Qaeda leadership after the bombing of the USS Cole and proposed a collaborative relationship in future attacks on the U.S., but the offer was turned down by bin Laden because he did not want to alienate his supporters in Saudi Arabia.        Newsweek  fills us in on back history, including former White House counterterrorism director Richard Clarke's recollections of briefing the White House about an Iran connection while the President was more preoccupied with finding an Iraq connection:        Former White House counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke said the 9/11 report confirms a judgment that U.S. counterterrorism officials had reached soon after the attacks. At the time, the Bush administration was seeking evidence pointing to Iraqi involvement in the attacks. “See if Saddam did this,” Bush instructed Clarke on the evening of Sept. 12, 2001, according to Clarke’s book,  Against All Enemies . “See if he’s linked in any way.”  In fact, Clarke said, while there was no evidence of Iraqi complicity, "there were lots of reasons to believe that [Al Qaeda] was being facilitated by elements of the Iranian security services. We told the president that specifically. The best evidence we had of state support [for Al Qaeda] was Iran."  Bush did identify Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of the "axis of evil" in his January 2002 State of the Union speech. Iran had also long been identified by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism because of its close relationship with Hizbullah, a Shiite Muslim terror group with a major presence in Lebanon. But the president chose not to threaten military action against the Iranian regime, like he did with Iraq, in part because of a concern about possibly alienating "democratic forces’ within the country who might be in a position to modify Iranian behavior, according to Clarke.       Ugh...again, I'm sickened. And, if somebody says to me again, "well, isn't it better that Iraq is no longer in the hands of Saddam Hussein," I'm gonna friggin' scream. Yes, of course, it is better off, but there are many countries, including what is going on in Sudan, that have horrible people in charge. The question is -- Should the United States have taken a lead in a war and endangered thousands of American soldiers when it knew that there was no connection to al-Qaeda and 9/11 in the first place? Again, if the U.S. was in the business of taking out ruthless dictators, we'd be at war with most of the countries of the world.

       urlLink John Aravosis' AmericaBlog.org  talked about an Op-Ed by Nicholas D. Kristof in today's  urlLink  New York Times   that comments on (not reviews)  Glorious Appearing , the latest in best selling evangelical thrillers that has all non-Christians dying a horrible death at the hands of Jesus Christ.  Again, I want to remind you that I'm not anti-people of faith.  But, I do sincerely believe that many Christians are arrogant people who refuse to see anything beyond their backyard.  For instance, while I do believe that many people did go see  Passion of the Christ  for devotional reasons (and I won't besmirch them that), I know a bulk of people went becuase they couldn't deal with the fact that a film about Jesus could be horribly anti-Semetic and had to ensure that it did well.  In other words, screw the Jews...this is the most accurate depiction of the last days of Christ there ever was.  And, even though nobody living could possibly know this, if Mel Gibson puts it on celluloid, then it must be the truth!  Kristof reprints the the passage in  Glorious Appearing  that gleefully describes the genocide of millions:    "Jesus merely raised one hand a few inches and a yawning chasm opened in the earth, stretching far and wide enough to swallow all of them. They tumbled in, howling and screeching, but their wailing was soon quashed and all was silent when the earth closed itself again."    Kristof then goes on to write:    It's disconcerting to find ethnic cleansing celebrated as the height of piety.    This just makes me think of the many Christians I've met who just think that the Christian God is SO much better than the Muslim God (let's forget about the fact that they are the same). Many Christians believe that Muslims, in general, are bad people because they could perpetrate such violence in the name of God.  Christians could never do such a thing.  But, how interesting that terrorism in this country is perpetrated by many a Christian -- abortion clinic bombings, abortion-provider killings, gay bashings and other crimes not often attributed as "terrorism" happen all the time.  And, most of the times, the people who commit these crimes bring God in the picture.  Now, whether you prescribe to the Catholic version or the King James Bible version, the second or third Commandment reads:     Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD, your God, in vain.     Now, isn't permitting terrorist acts or, in a book, calling for the death of non-Christians using the Lord's name in vain?  I ask you.

      In a not too surprising display of global cruelty, President Bush has announced that it will  urlLink withhold $34 million in funds  to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).  This is the third year that the U.S. government will block such funding.  Why?  Because the State Department claims that the UNFPA supports coercive family planning programs in China.  But, the UNFPA says that the opposite is true and that it has been helping China to develop a voluntary program that educates its people about birth control and HIV/AIDS.      Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, acknowledged Friday that the goal of the population fund was to promote voluntary family planning, "but the circumstances of their operations are such that they are assisting the Chinese" in managing programs that exact penalties for too many children and ultimately result in abortions.  "We feel by funding these programs we would be indirectly helping the Chinese to improve the management of programs that result in coercive abortion, and that's prohibited by law," Mr. Boucher said.  The Kemp-Kasten law mandates a cut in financing if the president determines that an agency "supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization."  China's population control efforts - including its one-child policy - have long been criticized by American social conservatives and some religious groups for dictating family size and forcing women to have abortions by threatening their jobs or imposing special taxes.      Of course the Bush Administration's strategy is to just turn a blind eye on the health and needs of poor women around the world because of its anti-choice extremist ideology.  Forget about the fact that this money can prevent  urlLink literally thousands  of unwanted pregnancies, induced abortions, and deaths annually.   What a sad day for the world...

        scha·den·freu·de  \'shä-d &amp; n-"froi-d&amp;\  n  [German, from  Schaden  damage +  Freude  joy] : enjoyment obtained from the troubles of others It's interesting watching the  urlLink media coverage of Martha Stewart's sentencing today . Being on vacation, I had CNN on all day as I wandereded around my house cleaning it. Every single program was about Martha Stewart.  It dawned on me, though, how much the media does not seem to like her.  They were reporting about her with a great deal of  schadenfreude .  They seemed happy that she got hers.  For example, most programming had some kind of exploration of what five months in  prison  will be like for Stewart. It was almost with a sense of glee that they explained, through interviews with people who've been to the Danbury facility to which Stewart requested to be placed if she does indeed go to prison after the appeals, that Stewart will not be going to any "Club Fed" and that she'll have to work at $.40 an hour as a waitress or a janitor or something AND that she'll probably have to share a room with a drug dealer. And, they needed to also point out that Stewart will need to wear an ankle device to monitor her every move -- and, she'll have to wear it out in public! The Horrors! It was almost like there was this ire that Stewart was getting the lightest sentence possible.  And, as if to kick her even more, CNN posts this on their Web site:    urlLink      (which, okay...I have to admit is kinda funny)  Anyway, here are some highlights of CNN's coverage -- The Martha Stewart Sentencing: Domestic Goddess Under Siege...  In a bizarre interview,  urlLink Anderson Cooper had former Hollywood Madame Heidi Fleiss  give some advice to Stewart about life in the "Big House":    COOPER:  Does it help being a celebrity? I mean does the celebrity help or does it hurt?   FLEISS:  It does not help at all. But there's not going to be -- look it, mostly it's lesbian hell there. I would say 3 percent gay going in, 97 percent gay while you're there and 4 percent gay going out. So she could have her pick of the litter. She can go in the hobby crafts room and take a napkin and turn it into the house. The prison could benefit by her.   COOPER:  Do you think -- sorry. I mean, as you look back on your experience now, what do you think you learned that you didn't know going in?   FLEISS:  I think that it was -- I'm humbled. I have a broader perspective. I think it made me, I hate to say this, a better person. No one should have to go to prison to be a better person. I could have maybe grown to be a better person anyways, but look it, it was a terrible experience but in my head, to justify it, I say I'm a better person. Although I have been released quite a few years, it seems like it was a million years ago.  Paula Zahn had a  urlLink panel  consisting of Toobin, Susan Cotliar, correspondent for  People , Charles Gasparino, senior writer for  Newsweek , and Christopher "I Hate Martha Stewart A Lot" Byron, columnist for the  New York Post  and author of  Martha, Incorporated .  With the exception of Cotliar, all of the men seemed to attack Stewart, leading Toobin to saying:    TOOBIN:  I have spent two years saying to Byron and Gasparino you were too tough on her [...] they were right and I was wrong. I just don't -- this seems so utterly insincere to me. And her whole act today seemed more bizarre than anything.   Zahn later tries to get one of Stewart's friends, who wrote an impassioned letter to the judge on Stewart's behalf, to tell her how disappointed she was learning that Stewart lied:    ZAHN:  And apparently, the judge did take seriously the letters he received from friends of Martha, such as yourself, and she weighed that when she thought about the sentencing guidelines. Let's talk a little bit, though, as a friend, how disappointing it was for you when you learned, in fact, that she had lied to federal investigators.   LAGRONE:  Paula, I've never broached that with Martha and that is not something I'm going to broach now.   ZAHN:  OK. So you don't even want to talk about any level of disappointment you might have had?   LAGRONE:  Truthfully, Martha is my friend and I'm not judging her. A jury judged her, but I don't.   Part of the problem was Stewart herself. Toobin is actually right. She gave a bizarrely defiant speech on the steps of the courthouse. While she does apologize to all the people in her company who were affected by her case, she goes on to say:    STEWART:  And whatever happens to me personally shouldn't have any effect whatsoever on the great company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. And I don't want to use this as a sales pitch for my company, but we love that company. We have worked so hard on that company. And we really think it merits great attention from the American public.  And I'll be back. I will be back. Whatever I have to do in the next few months, I hope the months go by quickly. I am used to all kinds of hard work, as you know, and I am not afraid. I am not afraid whatsoever. I am just very, very sorry that it's come to this; that a small, personal matter has been able to be blown out of all proportion and with such venom and such gore. I mean, it's just terrible.     While some analysts say that she was just doing what any business person would do (show strength in the face of adversity), it almost seemed a little too defiant. In fact, it seemed to have  urlLink not played well with friends  even, as Stewart's friend Dominick Dunne from Court TV:     LARRY KING LIVE  GUEST HOST NANCY GRACE:  I would not want that confusion to cloud your career from this point on. You saw what went down in the courtroom today, her statement to the judge as well as her statement on the courthouse steps, apparently a vast difference.   DUNNE:  Two different things. In the courtroom, for the first time, in this trial, Martha showed a real emotion. I mean, I felt, Henry can maybe back me up on this, that she was kind of choking as she was talking. There were tears in her voice. And it was incredibly moving. It was a very, very moving moment in the courtroom.  By contrast, she gave almost the same speech with ad libs outside the courtroom on the steps afterwards. And she changed, she changed. It was displeasing at times, I felt. And I'm her big fan.  And I sort of didn't like hawking the magazine at that moment. I think that's OK for her to do on Barbara Walter's show tonight later, or on Larry's show next Monday, but at that moment, it just seemed wrong to me on the steps of the courthouse where she had just been sentenced.   Anyway, I am thoroughly exhausted from watching Martha Stewart 24/7 today. Generally, I love CNN, but this was a bit ridiculous. I hope tomorrow we'll have something more newsworthy to move to. In the meantime, I reiterate -- LET'S LEAVE MARTHA ALONE!

           The rapper Jadakiss has been receiving a great deal of attention for his new song "Why," which contains a  urlLink controversial lyric  that calls President Bush out on his administration's lack of attention to pre-9/11 terrorism. The line (seven words) mind you goes like this:   Why did Bush knock down the towers?  While I expected conservatives and the Republican Party to be up in arms, I was surprised that others have been playing an edited version:        Not everyone loves it. Bill O'Reilly called Jadakiss a "smear merchant" this week, and some radio stations have edited out the line in the song, in which Jadakiss talks about perceived injustices, conspiracies and problems affecting the world. MTV says it is playing an edited version of the video, as it was sent by his label, Interscope.      I downloaded the "explicit" version on iTunes, which does contain the lyric.  Listening to the  urlLink whole song , I have to applaud Jadakiss for very intelligent lyrics that question a world beyond the unsular urban setting in which most rap lyrics are set. But, like any good rap artist, Jadakiss presents his case in a highly accessible way by keepin' it real.  I remember years ago thinking that rap was the stupidest music out there. But, after trying to dispell my stereotypes and really taking in the lyrics, there is something more than just brutal sexism and homophobia. In really good rap, there is a potential to emote raw honesty that doesn't exist in other music styles. I am now a true believer that, if many rap artists can get past sexism and homophobia, rap has the potential to draw people in politically.       "I'm growing up, I'm getting a little older. I've got two kids. I'm almost 30 years old," says the Yonkers, New York native.  He talks up  Fahrenheit 9/11  as an important, must-see movie -- he's watched it twice -- and he's even registering to vote in the upcoming presidential election, a first for him. (He backs John Kerry.) He wants the minimum wage raised and more jobs created.  "As a rapper, as an artist, we've got power," he said. "If we can get people to vote from the ages 18 to 44, we can make a change."      That is all we can hope for.  Thank you, Jadakiss, for being on our side!

      Donna Brazile, who was Al Gore's former campaign manager, was on  urlLink  Inside Politics  on CNN today , talking about the Federal Marriage Amendment with Bay Buchanan of the right wing American Cause.  The exchange went like this:     INSIDE POLITICS  HOST JUDY WOODRUFF:  Then why don't you get -- can't you get a majority in the United States Senate?   BUCHANAN:  Because, Judy, if you took a look, that body up there does not represent Americans on most issues. They are not representative of the U.S.   BRAZILE:  Because they don't want to legislate hate, because they don't want to set the country back.   BUCHANAN:  There's no hatred.   BRAZILE:  Yes, it's hatred toward individuals...   BUCHANAN:  It is not.   BRAZILE:  ... who decide that they want to spend life -- their life together. Why not allow them...   BUCHANAN:  They can.   BRAZILE:  ... to have that? But they need -- Bay, they don't enjoy the legal benefits of marriage, they pay more taxes than most Americans, they get no Social Security and survivor benefits, they can't visit their partners when they're sick. Why not give them the rights?   Buchanan, of course, was at a loss for words and tried to spew a few of the talking points I'm sure she was given by Hatred R' Us.  I commend Brazile for being one of the few Democrats to not focus so much on arguements of divisiveness or political underhandedness, but to really call the Federal Marriage Amendment for what it is -- legislating hatred.  That is why Donna Brazile is a rock star!

      So, it seems that the good  Reverend Jerry Falwell  has  urlLink broken non-profit tax law  by allowing his organizaton to post his endorsement of Bush both in their newsletter and on their Web site. Yes, folks, in the tax-exempt non-profit world (of which, for better or for worse, Jerry Falwell Ministries is part of), this is a big no-no.  The complaint was filed by Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, who told the  New York Times , "I certainly hope that this sends a clear message that religious organizations have got to operate within federal tax laws restricting partisan politicking. And I think the message is that the campaign has been reckless in its approach to churches, recklessly trying to lure them into political activities."  Falwell has countered that it was his lobbying group that paid for the article that printed his endorsement of Bush in both the newsletter and the Web site. The only thing is that, in order to do that, the lobbying content MUST be clearly labelled with appropriate legal language indicating what organization is making the message. He also said that he is entitled to his own opinion. This is true. But, you are not entitled to your own opinion when you make it in the name of the organization that doesn't pay taxes because it has agreed to not endorse candidates.        He [Falwell] called Mr. Lynn's charges "a fright tactic" intended to silence conservative Christians. "His problem is that I am a Ronald Reagan, George Bush conservative evangelist," Mr. Falwell said.       While your statement may be true, there's no denying, Rev. Falwell, that you broke the law. And, if we have learned anything in the last couple hours, celebrities are not above the law.

      Oh, dear god.    urlLink Atrios' blog  just posted yet another example of how the Republicans just can't take any criticism.     Rep. Corrine Brown addresses Congress    Congresswoman Corrine Brown (D-Jacksonville, FL) was  urlLink censured when she made this statement  during a debate on H.R. 4818 which would provide for international monitoring of the election:     "I come from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat. We need to make sure that it doesn't happen again. Over and over again after the election when you stole the election, you came back here and said get over it. No we're not going to get over it and we want verification from the world."    Brown was expressing her frustration with the election system given that hers was one of the districts in which African American voters were disenfranchised during the 2000 presidential elections. The GOP, of course, cannot take any criticism and asked not only that her comment be striken from the record, but that she should be censured, preventing her from talking for the rest of the day. Yes, Republicans, I can see how each and every day you empower the African American community.  Hmmm...do I notice a trend?  First they fire Whoopi, then Scott McClellan and Bush attack the NAACP for disagreeing with the White House, and now they censure Corrine Brown.  Who's next?  Me, for suggesting this?

           Martha Stewart, domestic diva and patron saint of happy homemakers and gay men everywhere, was  urlLink sentenced to five months in jail  with two years probation and a $30,000 fine. Previously, Stewart was convicted on charges of making false statements, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy in connection with her sale of ImClone Systems (an anti-cancer drug maker) shares. Many people have criticized the U.S. Government for their relentless attack on Stewart, who's lawyers claim is a one-time offender, as a distraction from prosecuting big business closer to the Bush Administration (ie - ENRON and Halliburton). This prompted Martha supporters to launch a  urlLink "Free Martha"  campaign and to appear at the courthouse to encourage Stewart to "Hold your head high, Martha!"   Legal analysts agree that Stewart's sentence was about as good as she could have possibly asked for and is considered a light sentence for crimes of this nature. Martha fans will also be relieved that she is not going to be taken off to prison immediately. Federal Judge Miriam Cedarbaum has stayed her sentence so that her legal team can file an appeal.   So, here are my thoughts. The thing is that I am a firm believer that if you do the crime, you must do the time. It was clear that Stewart was guilty of the things she was convicted of. BUT, I also do agree that this was a distraction. The government saw this as an opportunity. One has to wonder why they didn't go after such giant companies that, unlike Stewart, hurt scores of people in the balance. It would be nice to see Ashcroft go after ENRON and Halliburton with such voraciousness. Also, I think that Stewart was not treated well by the media. Every picture you saw of her implied "coniving conspirator," "bitch," or "haggard." Hell, I'm going to start my own campaign to "Leave Martha Alone!" At least, now that the sentencing is over, I'm hoping that people will do just that.

           Before we find out if Martha Stewart will be going to jail or not, I think we need some humor.

      So, I tried to find some video footage of Kerry at the NAACP convention, but I couldn't really find anything.  This  urlLink ABC News footage  (which, unfortunately, you need a subscription to view) contains very little of the actual Kerry's speech in which Kerry vowed to be a "uniter."      "I will be a president  who truly is a uniter,  not one who seeks to divide our nation  by race, riches or any other label.    urlLink CNN  wrote:       In a politically significant speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee promised never to seek to divide the nation "by race or riches or by any other label."        In the end, Kerry made big points with the African American community. While I obviously haven't heard all his speeches, I was impressed how he managed to motivate the crowd in a culturally sensitive manner. Frankly, I'm glad that Bush passed up the opportunity, becoming the first President since 1930 to pass up such an invitation (talk about being out of step with the mainstream).   Not only did it allow Kerry to get a jab in:   "Some people may have better things to do, but there's no place that I'd rather be right now than right here in Philadelphia with the NAACP."  It also gave NAACP Chair Julian Bond to make a comment that had me fall in the floor laughing hysterically, giving new meaning to the term ROTFLMMFAO:   "[Bush] didn't come because we criticized him. But if he didn't go anywhere people criticized him he'd never leave home."   I find it fascinating that, after a very public statement where Bush, as usual, whines about people who criticize him, they trot the White House spokesman  Scott McLellan  out to explain that the reason why Bush didn't show up was because of a "scheduling conflict." However, he did go on to criticize the NAACP because, you know, it's better to make your boss seem confused about his own schedule and then attack African Americans than to just say that your boss can't take the heat.   "I think it is really disappointing to see the current leadership continue to repeat the hostile rhetoric that they have used, which really shows that they're not interested in a constructive dialogue," McClellan said.   Wow! Interesting. I could say the same thing about the current leadership of this country. Is it fun throwing stones at glass houses, Scott?  And, if you look at the ABC footage, McClellan then goes and parades out the African Americans who serve as leaders in the Bush Administration to show us all that Bush is hip with black people. Forget the fact that he's done nothing to help the overall community when he's got Secetary of State Collin Powell, National Security Adviser Condi Rice and Education Secretary Rod Paige on his side. And, I wonder if  urlLink Rod Paige  can sleep at night knowing that Bush's "No Child Left Behind" has left many, many (particularly African American) children behind.  It's a sad day in America when the current Administration can pass up an invitation to speak to a disenfranchised community, lie about why he didn't attend, make one of his staff attack the oldest and largest civil rights organization for him and have his Education Secretary act as Uncle Tom. Gee...why would the NAACP criticize him?

       The Washington Post  had an interesting article about  urlLink outing  yesterday. I remember that outing was big back in the 80s and 90s during the height of the ACT-UP era. Back then, outing was seen, by both gay people and straight people alike, as a cruel scare tactic to yank people out of the closet before they're ready to come out. Actually, it's very much like that still today. The thing is that I think I've changed my stance toward outing. I used to be in the camp of outing as being a bad thing. But, four years of Bush and the reign of the Right Wing has gotten me to rethink this.         In an editorial on July 2, the [Washington]  Blade 's executive editor, Chris Crain, wrote: "It is 2004, not 1954, and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a 'private fact' beyond the pale of inquiry." The  Blade , he wrote, "would investigate and report about whether influential Hill aides are gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti-gay members of Congress for whom they work."          Crain makes a good point. We live in an age where sodomy is no longer illegal and a federal court has ruled that calling somebody gay is no longer considered slander or libelous. The world has changed.    We all know that the closeted gay people work very closely with those who choose to tear down our rights. Why should we have compassion for them? They obviously have no compassion for us. Also, I think that being against outing somehow implies that outing somebody would "ruin their lives." We all know that this is not the case. It feels as if being against outing only fuels internalized homophobia.    The truth is that Republicans are unscrupulous. They would absolutely not think another second if the shoe were on the other foot. Maybe it's because I'm no longer in the gay organization loop or perhaps I've gotten cranky over the last eleven years of working on gay rights issues, but I believe outing is now a good thing.

      I was just on John Aravosis'  urlLink AmericaBlog.org  and saw this  urlLink  Washington Post  article  referring to a celebrity endorser of Bush's making inappropriate comments about the Democrats:           Speaking of celebrity endorsements:  Dennis Miller , a big backer of Bush, was in Green Bay, Wis., yesterday to warm up the crowd before the prez spoke. Miller made a glancing reference to Whoopi but promised, "In deference to  George W. Bush , I will try not to fall to depths that some would in this case."               Then he went on to imply a homosexual attraction between Kerry and Edwards.              "Those two cannot keep their hands off each other, can they?" Miller said. "I think I have a new idea for a new campaign slogan -- use the bumper sticker 'Hey, Get A Room.' "              The Post 's Dana Milbank also reports that Miller riffed on other noted Dems. "Asking    Bill Clinton  to write an honest book is like asking    Britney Spears  to sing a capella," he said.              And he called strategist    James Carville  "a muppet who accidentally was washed on hot" and a "Satanic Chihuahua under a strobe light" who has "more nervous ticks than a Belfast parking valet."        All in good fun, of course. Bush thanked Miller "for joining us" but made no mention of his warm-up act.           Well, I wonder why not? Probably because he knows the amount of hullaballoo he and his party made about the celebrities supporting the Democrats.    But, do we see the Democrats getting up in arms about asking CNBC to fire Miller. No. You know why, because unlike a certain baby we call the President, liberals can take it. I'm not condoning the fact that Miller, and other comedians and journalists (cough...cough...coughTuckerCarlsonOn Crossfire ), seems to think making homophobic remarks is hilarious and acceptable. But, I'm not about to call a boycott because of it. Plus...and call me un-PC, I do have to admit the same thoughts have run across my mind watching Kerry and Edwards together. Although, I pass it off as two men who, unlike Miller and Carlson -- and, hey, Bush, are secure with their masculinity.

      I just watched the live broadcast of Senator John Kerry addressing the NAACP Convention.  Let me say it clearly now.  If I ever had any doubts about John Kerry before, they have been swept away.  I had goosebumps listening to Kerry deliver an electrifying speech.  If you didn't get to watch the broadcast, you can read his full remarks  urlLink here .  Although, if you can find video, I think it's even more compelling.  Critics of Kerry say that he's rather stiff and un-Charismatic.  Watching him today made me think about 1992 election and listening to Bill Clinton speak.  I am thoroughly excited about this presidential candidate.  I now have extremely high hopes.  Kerry was also good about deflecting some of the detractors in the audience, which didn't sound like they were many.  One woman was screaming out "VALUES!"  Kerry, who has been shaping the values message over the last month or so, respectfully replied:   John Edwards and I have the vision and values to bring our country together again and build stronger communities.  For us and for you values are not just talk.  They’re not just words.  Values are the way we make the lives of all Americans better.   Then, he proceeded to talk about the values of bringing back jobs, healthcare and education back to the people of America.  He was absolutely thrilling!  Alright, more to come...If I manage to find a link to video footage, I'll post it.

      So, Whoopi Goldberg has been let go by  urlLink Slim Fast  as a result of the Republican furor over the Democratic "hate fest" (as one Right Winger put it) in which Goldberg made unflattering comments about the President.           "We at Slim-Fast trust the public understands that the way in which Whoopi Goldberg chose to express her own personal beliefs at the recent fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall does not reflect the views and values of Slim-Fast," said a statement from Terry Olson, general manager and vice president of marketing.  "We are disappointed by the manner in which Ms. Goldberg chose to express herself and sincerely regret that her recent remarks offended some of our consumers. Ads featuring Ms. Goldberg will no longer be on the air," the statement added.      Of course, this is all after several members of the GOP called for a boycott if Slim Fast didn't step over Ms. Goldberg's First Amendment Rights by silencing her through their commercials.  The Republicans are trying to pass her comments off as "hate" speech akin to racist, sexist or heterosexist comments.  The thing is that Goldberg did not generalize about a people.  While one might question the appropriateness of her comments, Goldberg was vocalizing her feelings about  one  man who one could prove has decimated this country.  And, to tell you the truth, the whole linkage of the President's name to a euphamistic name for female genitalia is  not  new.  Goldberg responded:    ...it saddens me that people who were not present at the fund-raiser, including anyone from Slim-Fast and others who have not seen the material for themselves but are only reacting to soundbites produced by the media, have opted to judge my 'conduct.'    This reminds me of Al Franken's book  Lies: And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them  in which he exposes many a Right Winger and journalists who place judgement statements on things they've never seen before.  Somebody probably heard that Goldberg made a joke comparing Bush's name to a vagina and went all out after that.  Frankly, we all know what this is about.  It's about the fact that Republicans know that their list of "A" celebrity supporters pales in comparison to that of the Democrats.  Jealousy is so ugly.  Goldberg continued:      "I only wish that the Republican re-election committee would spend as much time working on the economy as they seem to be spending trying to harm my pocketbook."  Goldberg said she wished "godspeed" to Slim-Fast and its users and hoped "that everything will be better digested, now that I'm no longer representing them."  "And just because I'm no longer in those spots, it doesn't mean I will stop talking," the comedienne's statement said.      Good for you, Ms. Goldberg!

       urlLink Keith Boykin , who served as an aide to Bill Clinton and now a political and social commentator who has appeared on countless media programs, has been selected as  urlLink one of the ten people  chosen to compete in Showtime's upcoming program  urlLink  American Candidate  .  According to the Reuters article:      Premiering on August 1, "American Candidate," will follow the contestants across the country over the course of ten one-hour episodes as they campaign, debate, hold rallies and face media scrutiny.  Much like a traditional reality show, each week one contestant -- designated the "front runner" -- will have immunity, while the two candidates who finish last in a weekly competition will have to debate and face elimination at the hands of their peers.  Showtime said the winner will get $200,000 and a "nationwide media appearance" to address the country.      In my travels, I have had the pleasure of working with Keith on a couple of occassions.  I admire his intelligence, his perspective and his commitment to making this world a better place.  If he  were  running for President, I would vote for him.  So, with that, I wish you good luck, Keith!  You deserve to win!

      Contrary to popular belief, I don't really hate people of faith.  Honestly, I'm all for people of faith who have been able to be spiritual without being hatefully judgemental of people.  I liked the movie  Saved!  because, I felt, it wasn't an outright attack on people of faith.  It actually made me respect those kids that I have stereotyped as "freaks."    So, as I watched  urlLink CNN Live Today  this morning, my eyebrow raised as I heard Daryn Kagan announce her interview of Cameron Strang, the president and CEO of a new Christian youth magazine called Relevant Magazine.  Admittedly, I expected to think he was an idiot.  But, then, I really listened to the interview:    KAGAN:  And so it's a Christian magazine, but not specific denomination. Why did you choose to do it that way?   STRANG:  Well, because I really believe that this generation is very spiritually hungry. You can look all over the culture and see them searching to know God, and it's not specific to a denomination. There's people outside of the church or people who maybe just grew up in the church but left their faith, and they're looking for more, and I really wanted to connect with those people.   KAGAN:  And so what do you think the Christian community is getting wrong when it's trying to draw young people in? And what's the secular community getting wrong?   STRANG:  Yes, well, the secular community -- I mean if you look at most media and entertainment, there's no basis of faith. They can't completely disregard the fact that the majority of America has a faith foundation. So I think they're kind of missing the boat.  And if you look at a lot of Christian media, they put blinders on and don't look at the world they live in. They talk about Christian issues and Christian things and you shop in Christian book stores and listen to Christian music. But they don't interact with the world around us.  And I really think that we need to break down those walls and be able to talk about faith in a way that's relatable to culture.   KAGAN:  And so here comes "Relevant" magazine and your Web site. And you're saying, let's erase those lines because, you know what? Young people are living in both worlds and each world is getting it wrong if you going to ignore the other one.   STRANG:  Absolutely. That's absolutely right. What we found -- on  urlLink RelevantMagazine.com , it's a user-driven Web site. Everyday we have features that are written by our readers. And so it's a great way to keep in touch with the heart of this generation. And they're talking about faith issues and cultural issues and new music that they're into.  It all kind of blends together. And we're on a spiritual journey together. And I think our staff represents that in a way that nothing else does.   Strang seemed well reasoned and very intelligent.  Actually, he was almost hypnotic and inviting in his pitch implying that reform comes from both sides of the Religious ruler.  So, I decided to check out the Web site.    The first thing to draw my attention was a review for  urlLink  Saved!  .  I was really interested to see how a Christian would have rated this film.  To my surprise, the reviwer enjoyed the movie:    One thing that keeps Saved! from being more than just fun at conservative Christianity’s expense is Michael Urban’s smart script, which contains numerous gems of both cautionary and devotional tone. There is one exchange that finds Mary talking to her mother Lillian (a well-meaning archetype of a Lifetime-watching, Left Behind-reading, sugar-coated single soccer mom) who has just had a fight with boyfriend Pastor Skip. “I keep trying to remind myself that when Jesus closes a door, somewhere he opens a window,” Lillian says. To which Mary solemnly replies, “Yeah, so you can jump out of it.” It is this kind of honest dialogue — the kind that wouldn’t be caught dead in the average “Christian” movie — that speaks so resonantly to the sometimes-unpretty reality of Christian life.    But, then, a few lines down came this line...    Though there are some sketchy aspects present in Saved!  (its handling of Dean’s homosexuality seems to go beyond endorsement)    To which I easily threw my hands up in the air and said, "Yup, it's the same kind of hateful Christian tripe!"  Plus, I have to admit that I want to take some whiteout everytime I see the word "Him" (with a capital H) in the middle of the sentence and replace it with "him" (with a lower case h).  But, I decided to look deeper.  I did a search for the word "homosexual" (interestingly enough, "gay" yields no results).  While there were definitely people who were of the anti-gay variety, I was surprised to read more than just a few contributions from what seemed a more enlightened group of Christian people.  A really interesting article was one entitled " urlLink The Gay Issue Revisited ," in which the  Relevant Magazine  crew asks the question "How should a Christian respond when a close friend is gay?"  I actually expected to read an anti-gay rallying cry, but you had people with such a diverse opinion.  Some believe that "sin is a sin" and there's no in betweens (which is what you'd expect when you hear the word "Christian"), but some believe that "We are Not Called to Change Anyone."  They're not necessarily pro-gay, but they don't believe it right to exploit God's or Jesus Christ's name to try to change you.  I can respect that.  I then read one person's review on  urlLink  The Passion of The Christ   which I expected to be loaded with praise.  Instead, it was an editorial on the violence in the movie and that criticism that  Passion  IS as violent than a movie like  Kill Bill  is not unfounded.  And, then another editorial on  urlLink  Raising Helen   which actually talked about "s-e-x."  Then, I decided to do a search for "abortion."  Unfortunately, I did not see one pro-choice article.  Most of these articles are centered around abortion as murder.  I would have really liked to have seen some articles discussing different viewpoints on the Catholic Church denying communion to pro-choice candidates.  John Kerry is not a "Godless" person.  He is Catholic.  Yet, he's found a middle-ground that allows him to be against abortion, but for choice. I did read some people calling for the need for people who do decide to have abortions to be compassionate.  And, surprisingly (for me), an article on  urlLink birth control  popped up.  So, what did I learn surfing this site for the last couple of hours?  I learned that I actually did  not  waste my time.  While no one person actually represented my view points in total, I was heartened by the fact that these Christian youth are actually talking about issues I thought they really never talked about.  I thought that they just took everything at face value and then swayed with their hands in the air to Christian music.  I still don't think I understand why these people have the devotion that they do.  But, as one person pointed out, I'm not here to change anyone.  In the end, what I am here to do is find  respect  for Christians without hating them because I think they hate me.  So, in the meantime, the  Relevant Magazine  Web site seems to be an excellent place where frank discussion can occur.  How could anybody disagree with that?

      Okay, so I've talked about one of the Senators of our fine Golden State.  Now, I want to comment on the other one -- Senator Barbara Boxer.  Boxer is viewed as one of the most liberal members of the Senate and, for that, she has earned my respect.  Actually, I've very much appreciated Boxer's work around defeating the Federal Marriage Amendement despite the fact that she jumped on board with basically every Democrat in the Senate to publicly state their disapproval for gay marriage.  Boxer seems to have formulated clearer arguments that challenge what Republicans  aren't  looking at by trying to push through clearly discriminatory legislation.  While I, of course, appreciate Senator Feinstein's "nay" vote for cloture today, everytime I've seen her speak publicly, I always felt like she never had any good arguments other than the Republicans are trying to make the Democrats look bad.    Anyway, I bring this up after watching  urlLink  Lou Dobbs Tonight   on which Boxer appeared along with Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) to talk about same-sex marriage.  Brownback kept going on and on about "a fundamental institution that's been under attack" without really saying how, considering the Republicans have voted against so many things that would actually  help  families. This is a portion of how the interview went:    DOBBS:  Senator Brownback, let me ask you this: The issue of amending the U.S. constitution and denying marriage to same sex couples, that would be the only amendment that was constraining of rights rather than embracing or empowering. Does that give you pause at all?   BROWNBACK:  Not on this in the least. And the reason I say that is, you're talking about the fundamental institution around which we build families in this country. And you're talking about a fundamental institution that's been under attack for nearly 40 years and in a lot of difficulty. And you're talking about a fundamental institution that you've seen in other countries that have engaged in same sex unions has declined even further.  And so really what you're talking about is the children. Where's the optimal setting? And what can we do to encourage that family and that mother and father bonded together for life in a low conflict union that raises children that will be the next generation?  Children are raised in a lot of different settings nowadays. That's certainly the case. But we know the optimal place. We know the place we want to push for. And I think that's worthy of enshrining in the constitution with a simple statement that marriage in the United States is a union of a man and woman.   DOBBS:  Senator Boxer?   BOXER:  I have to say that is the most pessimistic view of marriage I have ever heard. Marriage has been under attack for 40 years? Not in my community. Not where I live.  And I have to tell you, if we want to ease the burden from families there are things we need to do. Lou, you've talked about the outsourcing of jobs and the pressure that's putting on our families. We see that the income has gone up about 1 percent while cost of health insurance and college tuition is running away.  So if there are ways that we can help marriage, let's do it. But let's not amend the constitution for something that isn't even a threat at this point. It doesn't even make any sense at all.   Senator Boxer is up for re-election this year.  While I know that California is considered a safe, Democratic state, in this age where we just elected a Republican most well known as "The Terminator," I wouldn't put it past us to do something stupid again.  This is just a good reminder to get out and vote on November 2.

       This was an attempt to divide Americans that backfired and divided Republicans    -- HRC President Cheryl Jacques     In a thrilling victory, the  urlLink Federal Marriage Amendment was defeated  in a 48-50 vote.  Actually, what's really happened is that the Senate has voted against "cloture," which would end debate on a filibuster and force a vote.  So, what does this mean?  This means that this amendment will not go further in Congress.  Will not be ratified by State Legislature.  Will not be signed by the President.  Will not be written into the Constitution...at least for now.  Filibusters can go on and on and on and on until it eventually dies.  Of course, this does not mean that the Republicans are through with this issue.  Reports  urlLink  The Hill  :       Republicans touted the results as a clear indication that they will eventually pass their bill.  Democrats had a different analysis. “I think the outcome sends a very important message to the Senate,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “This amendment was not only unnecessary, it was poorly prepared.”       The Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have already started to make trouble.  They've  urlLink marked   up three bills that will affect the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community .  These include:    The Marriage Protection Act (H.R. 3313) - a bill that doesn't even seem possible that it could be real.  Basically, it calls to strip federal courts over their decision making power in regards to the Defense of Marriage Amendment (DOMA).  Could this even be legal?  Isn't that playing with the checks and balances system?  The fiscal year 2005 DC appropriations bill - a bill that prohibits DC officials from using either federal or local funding for either scientifically proven HIV/AIDS prevention programs or from starting a domestic partnership program.  The House is considering language to also expand the bill to include preventing marriage prevention.  So, in other words, it would SUCK to be gay in DC because the House is saying we're NOT okay with you marrying, but we ARE okay with you dying from HIV/AIDS.  Kinda sounds like the Reagan Administration.  The Labor/Health and Human Services/Education bill - a bill that does not do enough for HIV/AIDS.  Again, it boggles my mind that people are SO freaked out about two consenting adults loving one another, but, on the flip side, have no conscience to watch people die.  I hope Republicans can sleep at night.   Now, one big bright side to the whole shebang is realizing  urlLink Senator John McCain   is  the Barry Goldwater of the new Millennium.  In other words, he's still no angel, but, he has integrity and I can respect that.  So, how did McCain suddenly get on my good side?  He not only voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, but he also  urlLink railed against his fellow Right Wing Republicans  for supporting what he cited as decidedly un-Republican activity.  Said McCain, "The constitutional amendment we're debating today strikes me as antithetical in every way to the core philosophy of Republicans." He added that the amendment "usurps from the states a fundamental authority they have always possessed and imposes a federal remedy for a problem that most states do not believe confronts them."  Aside from McCain, I also have to tip my hat to the 5 other Republicans who voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment --  Ben Knighthorse Campbell (CO), Lincoln Chafee (RI), Susan Collins (ME), Olympia Snowe (ME), and John Sununu (NH).   Eh, what the hell.  From an e-mail I received, the full tally:    U.S. Senate - 100: 51 - R,48 - D, 1 - Ind.

And, I don't even want to describe what I'm doing to the 3 Democrats that did.   And, finally, for those who can't get enough, here is an excellent transcript from a  urlLink  Washington Post  online chat  with Evan Wolfson, Executive Director of Freedom to Marry.

       urlLink This is really so sad.   Bobo, a six year old tiger, raised from a cub by Steve Sipek who, under the name Steve Hawkes, played B-movie versions of Tarzan in the early 70s, was shot to death by police after escaping Sipek's estate. Officials said that the tiger made "an aggressive move toward the officer, he felt threatened, and, unfortunately, the animal was [killed]."  I remember in May,  urlLink an officer killed a mountain lion  in Palo Alto.  There was a large uproar and public sadness about the killing.  The officials said that it takes too long to tranquilize an animal (20-30 minutes) and would put more lives in danger.   If one does a news google seach for "mountain lion," you literally get hundreds of pages about mountain lion sightings.  What is drawing these animals out of the mountains where they have to scavange civilized areas.  Could it be that development is making it more difficult for these animals to find food and shelter?  In essence, isn't it our fault that wild animal attacks are happening on a frequent basis.    But, are we just going to kill these animals until they're extinct?  I hope not.  Now, I totally appreciate the fact that police officers risk their lives everyday and have to make split-second decisions.  I also understand that people have often been hurt by large animals and are panicked and afraid of them.  I, admit, if confronted with a large, wild cat, I'd probably be pissing in my pants.  But, come on, people, these are animals.  They are not humans who have the intention to kill.  Unfortunately, the newspapers make them out like they're these psycho murderers who are just stalking people and waiting to maliciously kill them.  There needs to be more of an effort to find humane ways to stop animals while, at the same time, protecting officers who put their lives out there to keep us safe.  But, most of all, humans need to stop being arrogant about wildlife.  This goes for the people who live in areas where wild animals might roam who are constantly surprised to see wild animals roaming to Sipek himself who feels the need to privately own wild animals.  We live in nature...nature doesn't live in our developments.  I'm not trying to get all Earth mothery on people, but I am a firm believer that if we respect our environment, our environment will respect us.

      Okay...I couldn't resist this.  This is an Associated Press photo:       Now, this is the caption that accompanies it:      Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Penn., left, looks on as singer Pat Boone, right, gestures during a news conference on Tuesday, July 13, 2004 in Washington. Santorum discussed his support for the passage of the Marriage Amendment. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)      Um...with that tangerine colored jacket, pink shirt and  questionable  hand gestures, I'd not speaking out too loudly against the gays, if you know what I mean, Pat Boone.*  *  Note:  In case anybody happens to wander by here who doesn't know me, I am openly gay and this entry is only meant to point out that it's ironic that Pat Boone has gone to lend his support for a discriminatory amendment against gay people when he's dressed like a big Mary herself...I mean, himself.  Also, for anybody who thinks it is  slanderous  to refer to Mr. Boone as gay, I refer you to  urlLink this article .  PS - While we're at it, Mr. Boone...let's face it, your daughter's only hit recording "You Light Up My Life" is one of the gayest songs ever.

       So, essentially, the Bush Administration's strategy to fight terrorism is..."repitition."   -- Jon Stewart,  The Daily Show , July 13, 2004   I was watching  urlLink  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart   this evening and, as usual, it was hilarious.  The lead story was on President Bush's defending his decision to go to war in Iraq.  Stewart pointed out the numerous times in which Bush repeated that "the American people are safer."  Of course, knowing that, while frighteningly accurate and informative,  The Daily Show  still  is  a comedy show, there is a possibility of the video possibly being edited (although  The Daily Show  is very good at letting the video speak for itself and presenting the truth in a very humorous way).  So, I decided to  urlLink Google  it to see if it was true -- if the President, indeed, repeated the same statement over and over again in a 30 minute speech.  One of the articles that Google pulled up was Dan Froomkin's  urlLink White House Briefing  for the  Washington Post .  Froomkin, whose headline reads "You're Feeling Safer...Safer...Safer," starts off:       It's not hard to tell when President Bush is really, really serious about getting a particular message out. 	 He repeats it, over and over again.  But it's unusual even for him to say the same thing seven times in one short speech.  That's what he did yesterday, in Oak Ridge, Tenn., asserting that because of his foreign policy initiatives and the war on terror, "the American people are safer." (Here's the  urlLink text .)  Bush said it so many times that  urlLink CBS  and ABC both spliced a sort of dance mix and inserted it into their reports on the evening news: "The American people are safer. . . . The American people are safer. . . . The American people are safer."      Um...it's reprehensible that Froomkin missed the ever popular:  "America  and the world  are safer."  I feel there's a bigger message in that statement.  But, maybe it's just me.  But, seriously, what's most important here is that Froomkin's column confirmed that  The Daily Show  knows -- President Bush.  Not so much up here (me, pointing at head).

      I'm going to say something that I never thought I'd say -- Thank you, you Right-Wing Republicans!  Oh, I can't just leave it at that.  So, I'll add a second sentence:  You're fucking stupid plans to fuck over gay and lesbian Americans only illustrates your hypocritical, hateful and heterosexist ways!  Oh, my...It's amazing what a second added sentence can do.  Now, I'm as potty mouthed as Dick Cheney.  So, the Republicans, knowing their fearless leader has made many a boo-boo over the past few months, decided to push forth the vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment to turn people's attentions away from their fearless leader's boo-boos and to make the Democrats look "bad."  Many Republicans wanted the Amendment to look like this:    "Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman."    So, as the story goes, the Right-Wingers, predictable as they are stupid, decided that a second sentence should be added:    "Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any state, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidence thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman."    And, therein lies the problem (er...not for gay and lesbian people...for the Republicans).  The second sentence sounds like it could potentially make civil unions and domestic partnerships illegal as well.  And so, what ends up happening is that it looks like the Republicans are doing exactly what they are doing -- writing discrimination into the U.S. Constitution.  And, that scares the swing voters.  And the Republicans don't like scaring the swing voters.  Because of this (thank God!), it appears as if the votes are not there to pass the Federal Marriage Amendment because more moderate Republicans don't want to look homophobic (eventhough, they still are).  They just want to "defend marriage" and, hey, if you can fuck over the Democrats at the same time, then great.  Aren't they swell?  And, what's even more funny is that even their plan to use Kerry's and Edward's voting records on this issue backfired as well.  Because there were not enough votes, Kerry and Edwards announced that they would  not  head back to Washington, DC to vote  nay  on the Constitutional Amendment.  So, what have we learned.     1.  The Constitutional Amendment does not have enough votes to pass. 2.  The Republicans are stupid, hateful people. 3.  While we all know Kerry and Edwards opposed the Constitutional Amendment, the Republicans now have no political fodder in the form of an official record. 4.  The Republicans are stupid, hateful people. 5.  The Constitutional Amendment, as is, looks like discrimination is being written into our nation's most prized document. 6.  The Republicans are stupid, hateful people.   Still, I'm going to be on pins and needles because, in this high stakes world we're living in right now, anything can happen.  AND, we know that the Republicans are not just going to let this lie.  Already, House Republicans are gearing up to fight the scary gay people with legislation that would take power away from the Judicial Branch and the wacky "activist judges."  And, you know that the Senate will propose some other crazy bill.  Delightful world we live in...

      Given that many conservative Asian American religious and civic leaders have spoken out against same-sex marriage, it's wonderful to see such a coalition of Asian American groups coming together to support same-sex marriage...   MEDIA RELEASE   For Immediate Release    Contact: Andy Wong Phone: (415) 341-6415                   Email: andy@asianequality.org    Asian Pacific American Leaders Condemn Federal Marriage Amendment                            July 13, 2004, San Francisco, California --  ­ The Asian Pacific American Coalition for Equality (APACE) today announced its launch as a national ad hoc coalition of Asian Pacific American (APA) leaders and organizations determined to fight marriage discrimination against their communities. It represents a broad alliance of APA lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) affinity groups, as well as major APA and LGBT civil rights organizations across the country.   "Through anti-miscegenation laws, exclusion acts, and immigration restrictions, APA families have faced a long, heartbreaking legacy of marriage discrimination in the United States," said Clay Kwong for the People of Color Media Program of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). "That shameful legacy continues to impact thousands of APA same-sex couples who are currently denied access to protections that marriage would afford them and their children."   APACE encourages APA communities to support marriage equality and oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA), which if passed, would write discrimination directly into the Constitution. Throughout U.S. history, amendments to the Constitution have been adopted to expand or protect the rights of Americans. The FMA would instead limit civil rights.   "For same-sex couples in our communities, the basic privilege of hospital visitation rights and health care benefits would be forever unattainable. The goal of one day being able to sponsor non-citizen partners for immigration and naturalization would be forever unreachable," explained Diana Ming Yin of Scripps College. "Ultimately, this amendment is anti-Asian American."    In recent months, religious conservatives in APA communities have organized rallies in opposition to marriage equality in California. "They are not representative of our communities," said Andy Wong of Marriage Equality California (MECA). "Indeed, fair-minded leaders of our APA communities support equal marriage rights for same-sex couples, and have played a pivotal role in spearheading the movement for marriage equality."   These leaders include: Japanese Americans Al and Jane Nakatani, who helped organize the 1998 campaign against a proposed anti-marriage amendment to the Hawaii state constitution; Chinese American Mabel Teng, who made history by marrying the first same-sex couple in San Francisco earlier this year; and, South Asian Americans Mala Nagarajan and Vega Subramaniam, who are chief plaintiffs in a lawsuit seeking to overturn Washington state¹s 1998 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).   "As South Asian American lesbians, we recognize the importance of marriage equality for the Asian American community," said Nagarajan and Subramaniam of Trikone Northwest. "Marriage is not just about individuals, but also about parents, families, and community. When our marriage is legally recognized and no longer stigmatized by our government, we fulfill that family and community responsibility."   Below is a list of organizations that endorse APACE and support marriage equality in APA communities.   Asian and Friends - Washington Asian Lesbian Bisexual Alliance of Seattle (ALBA) Asian Pacific AIDS Intervention Team (APAIT) Asian Pacific American Legal Center (APALC) Asian Pacific Islander (API) Family Pride Asian & Pacific Islander Lesbian, Bisexual Women's and Transgender Network (APLBTN) Asian Pacific Islander PFLAG - Los Angeles Asian/Pacific Islander Queers United for Action (AQUA) Asian Pacific Islander Queer Sisters (APIQS) Asian Pacific Islander Queer Women & Transgender Coalition (APIQWTC) Asian Pacific Islander Pride Council Barangay ­ Los Angeles Filipino LGBT Group California Freedom to Marry Coalition Children of Lesbians and Gays Everywhere (COLAGE) Chinese Rainbow Association (CRA) Community United Against Violence Equality California Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Gay Asian Pacific Islander Men of New York (GAPIMNY) Gay Asian Pacific Support Network (GAPSN) Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) Honor Thy Children  Immigration Equality Khush DC L.A.

Through community education and coalition building, we seek to empower our APA communities to challenge this legacy and to confront present-day marriage discrimination against same-sex couples. In doing so, we want to affirm lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender members in our communities and acknowledge the enriching presence of their love and lives.( urlLink www.asianequality.org )

      I was just at  urlLink Atrios ' blog that pointed out this quote in a July 11  Washington Post   urlLink article :       Quotable    "It does not affect your daily life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle. But that does not mean it is right. . . . Now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife."     -- Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), advocating a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in a speech Thursday to the Heritage Foundation.        To be fair, Cornyn's staff did respond and told  urlLink Andrew Sullivan :       CORNYN AND BOX TURTLES:  From Senator John Cornyn's press secretary: "For what it's worth, Sen. Cornyn did not, in his speech to the Heritage Foundation, use the 'box turtles' quote. The Post was given a copy of remarks 'as prepared,' but Sen. Cornyn did not like that passage, and did not use it. The Post, which did not attend the speech, reported the quote nonetheless. Sen. Cornyn said that he did not think that statement appropriate, that's why he didn't use it. I've advised the Post of this fact."      Well, that's lovely to know that Cornyn is not directly a homophobe.  He just employs crazy homophobic people to help him make decisions and create his public face.  So much better...

      Conservative syndicated columnist  urlLink Maggie Gallagher wrote that John Kerry's problem  is "the religion thing."       On the one hand, he wants to appeal to Dem elites who tend to be (let's face it) more secular than not. On the other hand, he doesn't want to offend the vast majority of voters who consider themselves religious folk, especially black and Hispanic Democrats.       What Gallagher is basically saying here is that the Democratic base are a bunch of godless heathen and the rest of America are God fearing people.  That's what the Conservatives love to believe.  That there can be no people of faith at the core of the Democratic Party.    But, that's the fundamental difference between conservatives and liberals.  Conservatives see the world in terms of black and white, up and down, left and right.  There is never anything in between...that is, unless you are trying to woo their votes.  Liberals don't think as linearly as conservatives.  We tend to see things in shades of gray in round organic motions.  That is why you have labor teaming up with the gay community teaming up with inner city black youth teaming up with pro-choice women teaming up with environmentalists.  So, Gallagher thinks the Kerry campaign is nuts because they keep picking people of faith whose "whose views are simpatico with the American people" to head their outreach to communities of faith.  She rants that Kerry had the audacity to first choose Mara Vanderslice whose crime was...gasp...speaking at an ACT-UP rally.  What a bad person of faith, cavorting with the gays and calling for the end of AIDS!  She's just EVIL!  In Gallagher's religious America, it's hate the gays and watch them die.  To her, that's the Christian thing to do.  Then, they chose Rev. Brenda Bartella-Peterson, who Gallagher admits is a christian minister, but is also quick to point out that she's from the Disciples of Christ and not one of the biggies like Catholics or Protestants.  To Gallagher, Bartella-Peterson is despicable.  She opposes the word "God" in the Pledge of Allegiance.  How dare she!  In Gallagher's religious America, Christians should be taking over, not supporting the separation of Church and State.  Screw those of non-Judeo-Christian faiths!  If they don't believe in God, they're heathen and therefore EVIL!  I wonder what it's like to live in Gallagher's narrow little mind.        What explains this ineptitude? Is the Democratic leadership unable to vet or simply unable to find a religious adviser whose views are simpatico with the American people? As Catholic League President Bill Donohue quips: "If Peterson were a plant by the Bush camp, we'd understand it. What we don't understand is political suicide."       It's this kind of divisiveness that turns me off to religion and people of faith all together, which is sad.  Instead of trying to bring people in, faith, in American politics, has become something that keeps people out.  And, the more narrow minded it becomes and the farther right it travels, I have a feeling that Gallagher is going to be finding that Bartella-Peterson and Vanderslice are more "simpatico with the American people" than she is.

      So, Jerry Corsi, one of the co-authors of the anti-Kerry book  Unfit for Command  has  urlLink apologized for some rather offensive statements he's made lately .  These remarks include:     On Islam:  "Islam is a peaceful religion — just as long as the women are beaten, the boys buggered and the infidels are killed."     On Catholics:  "So this is what the last days of the Catholic Church are going to look like. Buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the Vatican (news - web sites) altars. We may get one more Pope, when this senile one dies, but that's probably about it."    An anti-Semetic comment on Kerry's faith:   "After he married TerRAHsa, didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judaism? He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish. What religion is John Kerry?" Boy, lots of tolerance and understanding from this guy who describes himself as a "devout Cathoic."  But, ha ha!  The jokes on us.  Corsi said that he was kidding.  That his comments were taken out of context.  "I considered them a joke," he says.  Okay, how do you take "We may get one more Pope, when this senile one dies, but that's probably about it" out of context?  Now, admittedly, I have no great love for the Pope.  But, I admit that.  And, frankly, I'm not spreading hate about somebody and pretending to be a "devout Catholic."  I'm a happy "recovering" Catholic.   "I don't stand by any of those comments and I apologize if they offended anybody," he added.  Bullshit...and so's his book.  That's all I want to say about this man.

      One thing that can be said of President George W. Bush is that he tries...  ...tries to get his way all the time, that is.  And, so,  urlLink he has announced the most partisan and political candidate that he could possibly name to the post of CIA director  -- Rep. Porter Goss, who is the Chair of the House Select Committee on Intelligence.         Goss’s candidacy has foundered because of opposition from Senate and House Democrats who believe he is too partisan to run the CIA. The agency is at the center of the political battle over whether the invasion of Iraq was justified.      But, you know it's bad when it's not just the Democrats. Senator Pat Robert (R-KS), chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, even thinks Goss is a bad choice. While he says he doesn't think that Goss is too partisan or too political, he also added, "My only message to the White House is if they do this, make it an extraordinary person that will get bipartisan support. My criterion for it is that the intelligence director should be someone who has a lot of information-management experience because that’s what it’s all about."  I say, right on, Pat...but, then again, isn't your suggestion to the President also saying that he picked a person that's TOO partisan if he doesn't believe Goss will get "bipartisan" support. So, you're also not making sense, but the sentiment is good...

      So,  urlLink Laura Bush has come out swinging at Kerry and Ron Reagan, Jr.  and others who have criticized Dubya's limit on stem cell research and have suggested that we should be allowing stem cell research to happen so that science can hopefully bring an end to some painful, degenerative diseases.  Her over simplistic response was, "I hope that stem cell research will yield cures and therapies for a myriad of illnesses.  But I know that embryonic stem cell research is very preliminary and the implication that cures for Alzheimer's are around the corner is just not right, and it's really not fair to the people who are watching a loved one suffer from this disease."  I'm not quite sure what she's getting at here.  Is she saying that it's better to do nothing and be okay with the fact that somebody is going to die than to hopefully try to go for scientific advancement and medical breakthrough if not for today than for the future?  But, seriously, this is the same kind of denial that Reagan (senior, that is) had in regards to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s.  Why do anything about it when it's only the gays?  We see what this kind of inaction has caused.  Mrs. Bush, get your head out of the sand.  NOW is the time for embyronic stem cell research.  No, we cannot promise those who are suffering right now, but as a nation, we owe it to our loved ones and ourselves that we move forward with science.  Stop the ideological tyranny!

       urlLink The August 9 issue of  Variety   offers a review for a FOX News produced reality series entitled  The Expermient: Gay and Straight .  Less interesting is the show than is the first couple of lines of the review:       Feature version of a reality-TV miniseries that's deservedly gathered dust for a couple years, "The Experiment: Gay and Straight" offers the thoughtful consideration of weighty social issues one might expect from Fox News. In other words, it's an overpackaged, rather hysterical entertainment/exploitation/quasi-documentary that ought to be put into a time capsule, thus preserving some of the era's worst mass-media characteristics.       Amen...never has FOX News been explained in such a clear and concise manner...

       The Daily Show with Jon Stewart  tonight had Bill Clinton as his special guest. You know this show is being taken more serious (probably more than it should) in Washington, DC when it gets increasingly high calibre guests. One thing I have to say is thank God Stewart is on our side!  They don't have Clinton's interview up on their site, yet, but I will link to it when they do. However, let's take a few moments to laugh at some of the incredibly funny stuff they have put up there. Of note is one of the funniest segments I've seen in awhile --  urlLink Samantha Bee's "Tropical Repression."         urlLink      urlLink  Crude Intentions   "It's shocking that a product with a finite suply gets more expensive the more we use it."     urlLink      urlLink  Mark Your Calendar   "If it comes from a farm or it can be fried, you're gonna find it at a state fair...every year, they prove that old adage -- if you can eat it, you can eat it on a stick."     urlLink      urlLink  Tropical Repression   "It turned out that the gayification of pool was far more extensive than I had realized."     urlLink      urlLink  John Kerry:  He's No George Bush   "I'll take a ham sandwich...better than Dubya!"     urlLink      urlLink  Colbert at the DNC   "Well, from here it's on to New York at the Republican National Convention...and since the Democrats have already claimed the themes of a stronger, more secure America, that leaves the Republicans only a tax free, less gay America."     urlLink      urlLink  The Media At Large    Samantha Bee:  Who'd you have to f*@! to get in here?  Tucker Carlson:  Tons of people."     urlLink      urlLink  Interview with Congressman Harry Bonilla   "You know who seems to be the only people not tracking you?

      Speaking of "results matter," David Kusnet, a former Clinton speech writer, wrote a  urlLink fascinating column for AlterNet  that analyzes all of President Bush's zany catch phrases as he's out and about campaigning.       Bush's new speech would have two new phrases – "turning the corner" and "results matter." He'd say America is "turning the corner" on the economy and the Iraq War. And he'd show how he had gotten things done as president, pointing out that Kerry hadn't done much as Senator, and conclude with "results matter."  One week later, Bush's speech hasn't transformed the campaign. At least not in the ways he wanted. Bush's catch-phrases have made headlines – mostly, when Kerry has used them to counterpunch against Bush.  When both candidates were campaigning a few blocks away from each other in Davenport, Iowa on August 4, Kerry joked that Bush could attend the Democrats' economic forum "if he were just willing to turn the corner." More seriously, in an address on Thursday at the UNITY 2004 Journalists of Color Conference in Washington, D.C., Kerry declared: "Just saying we're turning the corner on the war, on terror, on jobs, on opportunity, and on one America doesn't make it so."  Meanwhile, Bush and his handlers have yet to craft a stump speech that uses the "turning the corner" and "results matter" – or any other catch-phrases – to make a compelling case for his re-election.       Hmmm...maybe because there's  nothing  one could say to "make a compelling case for his re-election?"  Actually, it's really very funny listening to Bush speak.  I try to make a point to watch him, as painful as it might be, so that I might understand the tactics he uses.  I hear him say things like "turning the corner" and "results matter" and I wonder if he actually believes we've turned a corner and that he's produced results.  It seems so obvious to me that he's done neither.  But, maybe he truly believes these things.  If so, he's dumber than I imagined.

       urlLink  The Washington Post  reports that Matt Cooper from  Time  and Tim Russert from MSNBC  are in big trouble with the law.  A federal judge has compelled them both to  testify before a grand jury whether a White House official knowingly leaked the name of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame.  Disclosing a CIA operative's name is considered a federal crime.  The two journalists have argued that it is their right to protect their sources.       Both journalists had earlier tried to quash the subpoenas issued by Fitzgerald in May. But, citing a Supreme Court decision, Judge Hogan ruled that journalists have no privilege to protect anonymous sources when the state has a compelling interest to investigate or prosecute a crime.  Hogan wrote in his just-unsealed order that the information requested from Cooper and Russert is "very limited" and that "all available alternative means of obtaining the information have been exhausted." He added that "the testimony sought is expected to constitute direct evidence of innocence or guilt."  Sources close to the case say that Fitzgerald's investigation is reaching the critical stage of questioning reporters under oath before the grand jury. His team has already questioned several high-ranking administration officials or received their statements. Among those who have been interviewed is President Bush.       Cooper has already been cited in civil contempt for refusal with the threat of jail time, although the article reports that Russert has agreed to answer questions.  The irony of it all is that conservative columnist and CNN's  Crossfire  co-host Robert Novak started all this hullaballoo when he tried to get back at Plame's husband former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV for his criticism of the Bush administration's claim that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction.         The disclosure came in a column Novak published last July 14. He said that when he wondered why the CIA selected Wilson in 2002 to investigate claims that Iraq had tried to buy uranium in Niger, two administration officials told him that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA and set up the trip.       What an idiot.  But, hey...we love to see the Novaks and the Russerts of this world in trouble, don't we?  And, if it busts the Bush Administration at the same time then all the better.

       urlLink  The Washington Post  reports on a growing grassroots movement  supporting mothers being able to breastfeed their babies in Starbucks.  "Nurse-ins" have been or are being planned for Starbucks coffeehouses around the country as well as the national headquarters.         In Maryland, the mothers have the law on their side: An act passed in 2003 prohibits restricting mothers from breast-feeding their children in public. A spokeswoman for Starbucks wrote in an e-mail that the company follows local laws and plans to reemphasize Maryland's ordinance to employees.  "We will instruct our Maryland store partners to inform any concerned customer that by Maryland law, mothers have the right to breast-feed in public and to suggest to the customer that they either avert their eyes or move to a different location within the store," spokeswoman Audrey Lincoff wrote.  But [Starbucks headquarters "nurse-in" organizer Lorig] Charkoudian, who got a similar message when she wrote to the company, said that is not enough. She is pushing the company to adopt a nationwide policy.  To support the effort, she's launched a Web site,  urlLink nurseatstarbucks.com . There, mothers can download a letter to send to Starbucks chief executive Orin C. Smith on behalf of their babies. "Sometimes [my mother] goes to Starbucks. When she does, I don't want to have to starve," the letter reads in part.       Personally, I don't understand why people have such a problem with women breastfeeding in public.  Admittedly, the first time I saw it, I didn't know what to think.  But, then, the adult in me said, "She's a mother.  The baby needs and deserves to eat.  The mother should breastfeed her child."  There, that process took less than a minute to get over.  So, I don't understand why others get so offended by breastfeeding.  It's not like the mother is doing a striptease pole dance in the middle of the scones.  No, she is feeding a child that needs to be fed.  And, I think it's unfair, and probably unsanitary, to ask a woman to go to the bathroom to breastfeed her child.  So, I say good for you, grassroots group of mothers.  I think I, a single gay man, will write a letter to Starbucks myself in support of this effort.

      I can't believe how stupid Michelle Malkin is.  In today's  New York Post , she wrote a column on Department of Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta's "sad obsession" (a reference to the title of her sad little column and not my personal beliefs).  Since everyone thinks she's a crazy ass "aunt thomasina," she feels the need to attack anybody who experienced the Japanese American internment during World War II and thinks it was a bad idea.  Malkin argues Mineta should allow the airlines to racially profile Arab and Muslim looking people (something Mineta has adamantly against). She feels that Norm Mineta is using a personal issue to get in his way professionally and that puts the country in danger.           While ostensibly defending the Bush administration's treatment of Arabs and Muslims in America, Mineta revealed his real beef: "I think we are seeing shades of what we experienced in 1942."  During World War II, Mineta was evacuated as a young boy from San Jose, Calif., to a relocation camp in Heart Mountain, Wyo. He remains deeply aggrieved about the so-called "Japanese-American internment" and his gross misunderstanding of history continues to blind him to current realities.  Mineta, like most Americans, has been brainwashed into believing that the decision to evacuate the West Coast and relocate ethnic Japanese to the interior of the country was motivated solely by racism and wartime hysteria — rather than bona fide national security concerns.  This myth has served as personal catharsis for many. But in a post-9/ 11 world, we can no longer afford the abuse of history as multicultural group therapy.       Malkin believes that, to win the war on terrorism, you either allow racial profiling or you support terrorism.  It must be strange to live in her psychotically pessimistic world.  But, it doesn't surprise me.  Conservatives will have you believe that you either wholeheartedly support the Bush Administration on everything or you're anti-American.  There are no shades of gray within the mind of a right wing nutcase.  Plus, Malkin concentrates too much on what she thinks people think motivated the Japanese American internment.  In her mind, she doesn't think it was racist.  But, what she doesn't realize is that the motivations of the internment are not important.  Whether racist or for national security, it doesn't matter.  The RESULTS are what are important.  Many Japanese Americans, even after the war, became targets of racism...this whole idea of "if the government can lock 'em up, there must be something wrong with 'em."  The Japanese Americans had to literally leave behind everything and carry only what they had on their backs.  When they returned, many of their businesses and homes were taken over.  And, while in internment, many had to live in stables and the camps were in dusty isolated places.  It is a testament to the strength of the Japanese American community that they were able to survive the experience.  So, please...excuse Mr. Mineta if he doesn't want another innocent American to experience what his family had to go through.  This is why we have civil rights in America.  These are the same civil rights, Michelle, that protect you as a journalist of color from being able to spew your hatred.

           Tennessee GOP Primary Winner James Hart shows us his favorite races     This sounds so incredulous to me. I have to say two things -- 1) I'm glad that I don't live in Tennessee, and 2) The GOP are more racist than even  I  thought they were.  With 86 percent of the vote, James L. Hart, who ran his campaign on "keeping 'less favored races' from reproducing or immigrating to the United States," won the GOP primary in Tennessee for a congressional seat. 86 PERCENT, PEOPLE!       In campaign literature, Hart contends that "poverty genes" threaten to turn the United States into "one big Detroit."       Are you fucking kidding me?  I seem to remember some other political leader who had these similar kind of views...I think his name was Hitler or something like that.       While campaigning, Hart sometimes wears a protective vest and carries a .40-caliber pistol, but he said he has run into no trouble.  "When I knock on a door and say white children deserve the same rights as everybody else, the enthusiastic response is truly amazing," he said.  If a black person opens the door, he says he simply drops off campaign literature and leaves.       I wonder if the Republicans will let Hart speak at the Republican National Convention?

           Under The Breath:   Hmmm...I wonder what Condi uses in her hair.  It's so nice and shiny.   After watching  urlLink National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice on  Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer   I'm even more convinced that the Bush Administration has got to go.  Here are a couple of highlights:    BLITZER:  Last Sunday, a week ago exactly, when Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, announced the higher threat levels in parts of New York, New Jersey, here in Washington, he failed to mention that most of the information is three or four years old, and that caused a lot of angst the next day. Was that a mistake?   RICE:  Well, I don't think that it really occurred to us to mention it, and I'll tell you why. Al Qaeda does meticulous planning over many years. We know that the material that they used to case the East Africa bombing, which was done in 1998, had been generated probably five years before, and we have just found the information, of course.  And so, the key was to tell people who were responsible for security in buildings that have been cased that they had been cased. It also was in the context of a pre-election plot that we have been examining for some time, and a concern that in this window, al Qaeda was going to try to pull off an attack against the United States. And of course, since much of the information also linked up with known al Qaeda operatives, some of whom were still at-large, this seemed to be moving in the direction of a plot that was against financial institutions in New York. We were concerned about the pre- election period. It seemed just irresponsible not to tell people that their buildings had been cased. Okay, but you  knew  that an already terrified public already on guard was going to get this information. I mean, don't you think, if you're trying to tout Bush's leadership in this all, that a good leader would have mentioned it. You know, something like, "We know this information might be three or four years old, but the intel we've gotten is very detailed. We are doing everything in our power to ensure everything is in order."  So, it leads me to think that either the Bush Administration was politicizing the terror alert OR it's exerting ineffective leadership. Either way, they suck.    BLITZER:  Let's talk about some of the people who have been picked up, mostly in Pakistan, over the last few weeks. In mid-July, Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan. There is some suggestion that by releasing his identity here in the United States, you compromised a Pakistani intelligence sting operation, because he was effectively being used by the Pakistanis to try to find other al Qaeda operatives. Is that true?   RICE:  Well, I don't know what might have been going on in Pakistan. I will say this, that we did not, of course, publicly disclose his name. One of them...   BLITZER:  He was disclosed in Washington on background.   RICE:  On background. And the problem is that when you're trying to strike a balance between giving enough information to the public so that they know that you're dealing with a specific, credible, different kind of threat than you've dealt with in the past, you're always weighing that against kind of operational considerations. We've tried to strike a balance. We think for the most part, we've struck a balance, but it's indeed a very difficult balance to strike. So, Condi, you once again make the argument for the lack of effective leadership from the Bush Administration. If you can't control what is and isn't leaked to the public, how can we trust you when you say the intelligence agencies are communicating well? I'll tell you how. I can't.    RICE:  As I understand what Prime Minister Allawi is doing, who, by the way, has been a brave, courageous and really very competent leader for this new Iraqi interim government, Prime Minister Allawi is trying to siphon off people who have not been the hardcore in the insurgency, who might have joined the insurgency for reasons -- young people, young tribal people -- and to isolate then the people who really are determined not to allow Iraq to move forward, the people who have no future in the new Iraq.  And he is someone in whom we trust. We believe that he has made a very big difference to the political environment in Iraq. He's asked the multinational forces to stay there and to help him. Would this be in the same way the Bush Administration put all its trust in Achmed Chalabi only to get stabbed in the back later? Do I really trust the Bush Administration to know who to trust? All I've heard about Allawi is rumors of human rights abuses and his censorship of Al-Jazeera. To me, it's like placing one dictatorship in for a potential one.    BLITZER:  All right, one final question, because we're all out of time. Iran and the nuclear bomb, if in fact they're going forward with that program. I assume you believe that they are. Wouldn't United States, under a worst-case scenario, take unilateral action to make sure Iran does not become a nuclear power?   RICE:  Well, I think we -- I won't get into the hypothetical here, but the United States was the first to say that Iran was a threat in this way, to try and convince the international community that Iran was trying, under the cover of a civilian nuclear program, to actually bring about a nuclear weapons program.  I think we've finally now got the world community to a place, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to a place, that it is worried and suspicious of the Iranian activities, that Iran is facing for the first time real resistance to trying to take these steps.  And we're going to have to stay strong as an international community, because it would not be acceptable for the international community to accept an Iranian nuclear weapon. So, in other words, the Bush Administration is flip flopping on its original policy of going it alone. I mean, isn't that what we did in Iraq? And, again, this begs the question -- why Iraq again?  To be honest, in an alternate reality, I would actually like Dr. Rice. She seems like she's a very bright woman who could serve as a role model. BUT, I live in  this  reality where she has become a shill for the Bush Administration. She's just another piece of the evil, giant Bush machine...an evil, giant Bush machine that's gotta go.

      Okay, I know that sometimes I find certain things funny, but I like to share them anyway.  This Associated Press photo has a caption that reads:    Bev Ehlen of the Coalition to Protect Marriage in Missouri thanks voters after a gay-marriage ban passed there last week.  So, now here's the photo:      Now, is it just me or do their signs make little sense in relationship to their overall hate campaign? I mean...yes, one man and one woman do equal two. But, so do two men and two women.  So, in essence, wouldn't this mean, by their example, that all these scenarios are the same? Hence, same-sex marriage is equal to hetero marriage?  I know...I know...why try to find logic in the Religious Right?  Ugh...these right wing idiots vex me so.

       urlLink The American Bar Association (ABA) held a hearing on Friday  to discuss whether judges should be able to join anti-gay organizations.  This is all in light of the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision  Lawrence v. Texas  that struck down sodomy laws throughout the country, saying that such laws discriminated against lesbian's and gay men's right to privacy.  The ABA, however, will not vote on any changes until next year.  If accepted, this would be another big step in being inclusive of LGBT people in the judicial system. Judges are currently barred from organizations that discriminate on the basis of gender and race.  The only thing is that homophobia or, better yet, heterosexism is extremely prevalent in the country.  For example, the Boy Scouts is considered anti-gay, yet most of America holds the organization in high regards.  The military, despite its laughable "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue" policy, also discriminates against the LGBT community.  Yet, the military is the nation's largest employer and also held in high regards by most of America.  So, the big question is what will be considered anti-gay.    If it's too broad, it might scare off most people.  Again, barring judges from participating in the Boy Scouts would seem too harsh to some people.  Personally, I think they should include it.  The Boy Scout's policy on gay men is quite clear. But, in reality, I find myself realizing that incremental steps are sometimes a good thing.  I'd rather there be a policy that bars judges from participating in the American Family Association, Concerned Women for America or the Traditional Values Coalition and still permits involvement in the Boy Scouts than nothing at all.

          Alan Keyes does his best flight attendant impersonation as he announces his run for the U.S. Senate seat in Illinois   So, it is official.   urlLink Barack Obama has a challenger.   Mr. Alan Keyes, a political commentator from Maryland and a two time presidential candidate.  It's funny how the GOP had to go all the way to Maryland to find somebody to run. What happened to other Republicans in the state of Illinois?  Um...what was that?  Oh, they didn't have a  black  candidate capable of standing up against Barack Obama? I mean, I want to applaud the GOP for thinking diverse...but c'mon. Isn't it all just a  little  bit suspicious, given the Republican Party's track record on diversity? Don't you think some Republican somewhere thought of a great idea -- Barack Obama is black, Alan Keyes is black, Barack Obama is popular, ergo Alan Keyes will be popular as well. And, since Alan Keyes is black, when the GOP runs its little smear campaign, they know nobody can cry "racism" which is a word Republicans are quite sensitive to because they know they are racist.  So, this is what we know about Mr. Keyes:  1.  He failed two times trying to run for president.  2.  A political commentator from Maryland, he has  no  connection to the state of Illinois.  3. He thinks that "as a matter of principle, I don't think it's a good idea" for a person from one state to run in another state in which you have no ties and might that quite apparent in a direct criticism of Hillary Clinton running for the Senate seat in New York in 2000 when he said, "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness to go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there, so I certainly wouldn't imitate it."  4.  "Keyes still owes $524,169 from his two presidential bids, according to federal elections records."  5. "He also owes $7,481 in unpaid state income taxes in his home state of Maryland, according to court records. The state filed a lien against Keyes in December 2001 for those unpaid taxes. Bill Pascoe, a Keyes adviser, said the tax bill was erroneous and Keyes only owed $152, which he paid on Friday. "  6. In 1992, he got 29 percent against Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., amid grumbling by some voters that he had been paying himself a salary with campaign funds.  Gee...sounds like a winner.  In other words, a two-time loser, tax evader and flip flopper.  I'd like to vote for him...NOT.  And this is not even bringing up his horrendous party-line stances on issues such as gay rights and abortion, which he opposes, and affirmative action, which he calls a "government patronage program."  Now that I think of it, maybe the GOP picked him because they know Obama will win and needed a sacrifice.  Now, that  is  racist.  I'm just saying...

      So, Michelle Malkin, who has quickly become the most hated person in the Asian American community, is lamenting that the Unity 2004 convention did not take her up on her offer to speak. So, because she can't get her way, she decided to write a  urlLink scathing and self-loathing column on why journalists of color are not diverse and she is .  In fact, she named her column  THE MALKIN MEDIA DIVERSITY TEST  to prove that she represents diversity and every other journalist of color on the planet does not. Well, I took her test and I got either 17.5 or 20 out of 100. I say this because I probably should only get 2.5 points for question 15:   15. I do not believe the phrase "a chink in the armor" is offensive.  If, in context, it means, as Webster's Dictionary defines it, "a small cleft, slit or fissure" -- such as "As I stared at it, I noticed a chink in the armor. I believe it can be repaired." -- then, no, I do not find it offensive either. However, if, in context, it means "a derogatory term for a person of Chinese descent" -- such as "Hey, that's something you don't see every day...a chink in the armor. Usually, they're white." -- then, I do find it horribly offensive.  The other ones I got 5 points for were the fact that I do eat meat, I did think O.J. was guilty and, believe it or not, I did cheer at the capture of Saddam Hussein.  Clearly, I failed, though. Boo hoo...I'm not diverse in Michelle Malkin's sick little world. Whatever will I do? Frankly, I'll thank God that I DON'T live in her world.  In other Michelle Malkin news,  urlLink The Catch has people submitting crazy variations  of the cover of Malkin's book  In Defense of Internment .  These are a couple of my personal favorites along with the original book cover:    urlLink     Be sure to visit  urlLink The Catch  see these images larger.  There are more funny ones!

      The Federal Elections Commission (FEC) has  urlLink dismissed a complaint by a group called Citizens United  which claimed that ads for  Fahrenheit 9/11  featuring President Bush violated campaign law.       In a unanimous decision made public on Thursday, the Federal Election Commission (news - web sites) found no evidence that the movie's ads had broken the law or that distributors of the film intended any violations in the future.  The commission said it agreed with the recommendation of its general counsel that the FEC "cannot entertain complaints based upon mere speculation that someone might violate the law."       Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya, Citizens United.   In other  Fahrenheit 9/11  news, this weekend, the film finally dropped out of the top 10 after seven weeks.  The film landed at 11th place this week for a total of $113.4 million.  Considering the one place drop, it's still holding up strong, considering that  The Notebook , which opened the same weekend as  Fahrenheit 9/11 ,  King Arthur  and  Anchorman:  The Legend of Ron Burgundy , both only five weeks in the theaters, dropped past the film in ranking.  At the rate that  Catwoman  is tumbling (from 6 last week to 10 this week), it could easily drop past  Fahrenheit 9/11  by next weekend.

          One should watch what one is wearing before criticizing what others wear.    urlLink The Associated Press reports that country music performer Charlie Daniels  will not be performing his controversial post-9/11 song "This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag" at a Dearborn, MI concert where a very large Arab American community lives.       Daniels wrote and recorded "This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag" after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. It became a country hit, but critics said it refers to a slur against Arabs.  The song begins: "This ain't no rag, it's a flag and we don't wear it on our heads. It's a symbol of the land where the good guys live. Are you listening to what I said?"  "Ragheads" is a derogatory term for Arabs, Muslims and others who wear turbans or cover their heads.      But, Charlie Daniels says that the song is not supposed to be anti-Arab, but anti-terrorist and anti-Osama bin Laden.        "The only thing it's 'anti' is the people who bombed us on 9/11. I have people who say you're putting down people who wear turbans. I'm not," Daniels, 67, told the newspaper. "There are good Arabs and bad Arabs, good Greeks and bad Greeks, good people and bad people in any race."      Now, the AP story concludes with the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee absolving Daniels of his actions. I thought this a little odd and went to their Web site and  urlLink read their press release .  They indeed did say they appreciated Daniel's explanation, but the AP left out some important information:       ADC recognizes and truly appreciates Mr. Daniels’ explanation of the song’s intent. However, its concern remained legitimate that, if performed, it could trigger animosity and foster false stereotypes in a City that has worked so hard to overcome these obstacles.      Actually, I, too, believe Daniels was not  trying  to be overtly racist. But, he represents a great number of people who believe that it is okay to overlook racial or cultural sensitivities to make a statement. The end result is that, no matter how purposely somebody does something like this, it still gives people license to discriminate.

      According to  urlLink  The Seattle Times  , John Kerry is challenging President Bush about his commitment to true scientific achievement in medicine. This, of course, comes during the third anniversary of the President's limiting federal embryonic stem cell research.       Scientists want to study the primitive cells extracted from 5-day-old embryos because they have the ability to morph into virtually any type of human tissue. "Replicated" tissue cells might someday be used to treat spinal-cord injuries and diseases such as Parkinson's and juvenile diabetes.  Opponents, including anti-abortion activists and some religious leaders, object because the work involves the destruction of an embryo. They advocate research on adult or fetal-tissue stem cells instead.  Now, three years after administration officials claimed they would make 78 cell lines and $100 million a year available for the controversial research, scientists and patient groups complain that the Bush policy is inadequate. Fewer than two dozen cell lines are available, and the budget for embryonic stem-cell studies is $25 million.  "Here in America, we don't sacrifice science for ideology," Kerry said in remarks prepared for his radio address. "Every day that we wait, more than 3,000 Americans lose their lives to diseases that may someday be treatable because of stem-cell research."      But, in Bush's America, we do sacrifice science all the time for ideology. For example, in June, President Bush re-appointed Dr. David Hager to the Food & Drug Administration's (FDA) Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee.  urlLink According to Planned Parenthood , Hager "co-authored a book that recommends scriptural passages and prayers for problems like headaches and premenstrual syndrome, and he is widely known to be opposed to prescribing contraceptives for unmarried women. He also played a prominent role in the creation of a petition designed to pressure the FDA into rescinding its approval of mifepristone [(formerly known as RU-486)]."  Does that sound like somebody who is committed to science in the realm of reproductive health?  The Food &amp; Drug Administration, itself, put politics in front of science when it  urlLink ruled  not  to make emergency contraception  (also known as "the morning after pill") available over the counter despite overwhelming recommendation by two of its advisory committees.       "This is anti-choice politics at its worst," said PPFA Vice President for Medical Affairs Dr. Vanessa Cullins. "There is no scientific reason to restrict access to this safe, effective backup method of contraception. Comprehensive scientific data shows that Plan B meets the FDA's criteria for over-the-counter status. The FDA's decision proves only one thing: dangerous anti-choice ideology is trumping scientific fact at the expense of women's health and well-being. This is the latest assault in this administration's war on choice. They are willingly sacrificing the health and lives of women and teens to promote a narrow ideological agenda."      But, if you don't believe Planned Parenthood, how about the Union of Concerned Scientists, whose membership holds 48 Nobel laureates and 62 National Medal of Science recipients. In February, the Union released a report citing many ideological abuses at the expense of science by the Bush Administration, from reproductive health to HIV/AIDS research to the environment. In July,  urlLink they released an updated version with more abuses .  Hell, even the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Government Reforms keeps  urlLink tabs on the President's putting ideology before science .  In terms of true scientific advancement, the Democrats win hands down.

      So, if you've done the run of the blogs, you will know that Secretary of State Colin Powell will not be speaking at the Republican National Convention. Many have speculated the oddity of this, considering Powell's popularity and the fact that Republicans, who want to try to show that the party is diverse, won't be spotlighting one of the three biggies whose name President Bush constantly brings up when he tries to woo (yet, ultimately scares off) people of color.  I'll be honest, when Bush took (and I mean, literally, took) the Presidency, I tried to like him. When he appointed Colin Powell to Secretary of State, I'll admit, it increased by respect for the President. But, that respect lasted about ten minutes after Bush, the uniter, was replaced by Bush, right wing religious hardliner and war president. With that, everyone in the Bush Administration, including Powell, crumbled in my mind.  I wonder if Powell's not speaking has anything to do this. I often wonder if Powell is at odds with the President for constantly putting him in difficult situations. Honestly, I don't know. But, this  urlLink  Seattle Times  article suggests otherwise :        The most popular Republican in the country will not be speaking at the Republican National Convention. Secretary of State Colin Powell will not even be there — and may not be in the United States, according to U.S. officials.  Powell consistently has scored better than his boss in public-opinion polls, often by 20 points or more. But in keeping with tradition, Cabinet officials do not speak at the conventions — or other campaign events. So Powell will not appear.  "As secretary of state, I am obliged not to participate in any way, shape, fashion or form in parochial, political debates. I have to take no sides in the matter," Powell told the Unity: Journalists of Color Convention on Thursday. Powell was a featured speaker at the 2000 convention and even campaigned with Bush.      But, hmmmm...if Cabinet members are not to speak at the Republican National Convention, then  urlLink why is Secretary of Education Rod Paige speaking?        "The No Child Left Behind Act is an important issue for the president," said Judy Pino, a spokeswoman for the Republican convention. "It will definitely take center stage as a theme."      Personally, I think it's odd that they want to spotlight this program considering that millions of children have been left behind under "No Child Left Behind." But, whatever...  Honestly, I think that Paige is being brought on stage because, unlike the Democrats who had dynamic African American speakers such as Barack Obama and Al Sharpton, the Republicans have nothing. They think Powell would outshine the President and they couldn't let that happen. There's not way they'd let Condaleeza out on stage. So, why not drag out Paige, especially considering that Paige is as looney as the rest of them:       Mr. Paige has occasionally sparked controversy with his public statements. Earlier this year, he likened the National Education Association to a "terrorist organization," a comment for which he later apologized.      The Republicans know they're not a very diverse party. Although, the  urlLink  Palm Beach Post  reports that their numbers are up :       Seventeen percent of the delegates and alternates at the New York convention will be minorities, up from the 9 percent at the party's 2000 national convention in Philadelphia.  The percentage increases — including 65 percent for black delegates — are relatively large because the raw numbers are relatively small as Republicans continue their effort to attract minority support that has been part of the Democrats' dependable base for many years.  Overall, there will be 4,853 delegates and alternates at the New York convention that begins Aug. 30. Included will be 297 Hispanics, 290 African-Americans and 104 Asian and Pacific islanders.  "The president and the GOP have a great story to tell and are working hard to get the message out to minority voters," said GOP National Chairman Ed Gillespie, who called the delegate diversity numbers a "milestone achievement in our party."      No, Ed, it's still called  SAD , particularly because your party has been courting minority votes through the politics of division by using social issues as a wedge issue. At the same time, your party has, and will continue, to do nothing to address issues of affirmative action, ensuring less wealthy people of color get good jobs, education and healthcare, and put a stop to racial profiling. In fact, your party LOVES racial profiling.       [Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael] Steele recounted the now long-ago links between the Republican Party and blacks, dating back to President Lincoln's efforts as the first GOP president but ending in the early 1960s.  "A funny thing happened on the way along the road," Steele said, referring to blacks' strong allegiance to Democratic candidates in the past 40 years. "I believe the party at that time forgot its relationship and strayed away from the partnership we had formed at that point for almost 100 years with the African-American community."      o I should mention is one of the few African American members of the GOP, doesn't tell you is that this split that he mentions wasn't just a "funny thing that happened on the way along the road." Republicans actively campaigned against...oh....things like civil and voting rights for African Americans. I love the way that Steele seems to minimize this.       Though eager to release the numbers, Republicans have been reluctant to release the names of delegates. Gillespie said many state Republican parties have declined to do so because of potential harassment of delegates.      Sorry...don't need their names to call them UNCLE TOMS.

           Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) participating in a ritual marking of trees    I went to see  The Village  today and I have to say that I really enjoyed the film. Perhaps part of this is because I had heard so many bad things about it that my expectations were low anyway. The film revolves around an isolated village surrounded by a wood inhabited by some unseen menace. The town's elders explain that a truce exists between the village and "those we do not speak of" (as the villagers call them) which consists of the villagers never, ever entering the wood. The villagers are also never to display the color red as it attracts the beasts. Outside of that, those who live in the village live quite happily. Then, one day, a tragedy happens and Ivy, the blind daughter of the town's leader, must leave the village, travel through the wood and get help. The only thing is that, outside of the town elders who founded the village, nobody's ever been through the wood and evaded the monsters. Will Ivy be able to do it? You'll have to see the movie to find out.  To tell you the truth, I wasn't all that excited to see it in the first place.  While I loved  The Sixth Sense , I hated  Signs  (I never got to see  Unbreakable ).  I thought  Signs  was full of depressing people and depressing scenes. I hated the characters so much that, by the end, I didn't care if they survived. And, it's really sad when you're rooting for aliens to kill little kids.  SPOILER FOR  SIGNS  TO COME.  SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW  SIGNS  ENDS...  And, I became enraged that they could kill the aliens so easily. Hello! If you have the intelligence to travel space, you'd think it wouldn't be such a hot idea to invade a planet where the bulk of the surface is a substance that can kill you! God, I hated that ending.       Phoenix's Lucius is not really the life of the party, but charming nonetheless    Anyway,  The Village  could potentially be one gigantic downer as well. Joaquin Phoenix is not generally known for dynamic, happy-go-lucky style acting. But, while he's a big silent type in this film, he manages to make the character more endearing than his character in  Signs  (did I tell you I hated that movie?). This is one of the downfalls of director M. Night Shyamalan. His characters tend to have so many secrets that they all seem so uncomfortable with each other. And, they all tend... to... talk... with... long... dramatic... pauses... that... it... makes... you... want... to... fall... asleep...  In  The Sixth Sense , Toni Collette happens to bring balance to the depressing characters. Her more flamboyant personality is a welcome respite from the darkness Shyamalan takes us through. In  The Village , it's newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Ivy. Given her handicap, she could potentially be the most depressing of all. But, she has a warmth that draws you in. You genuinely care about her. You know why Phoenix's Lucius is drawn to her.       Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a welcoming respite in a sea of otherwise depresing characters    All of Shyamalan's films seem to be constructed of a bunch of clues followed by a surprise ending, which wouldn't be such a surprise if you managed to string all the clues together.  The Village  is no exception to this rule. To be honest, I wasn't surprised by the ending because I actually did figure it out. But, I was so proud of myself and I was just so happy that it wasn't as lame as  Signs  that it helped me enjoy the ending even more.  While it might be obvious to people who are paying attention, it's still difficult to discuss this film without giving the ending away. The critical watcher should enjoy an interesting discussion of ethics and will even be able to draw some parallels to the current political landscape in a presidential election year.   The Village  is Shyamalan's fourth film and, while I did enjoy the film, it indicates to me that he is becoming more and more predictable. This is, perhaps, the reason why  The Village  was panned by the critics. In the future, Shyamalan might consider taking an entirely different narrative course that wasn't so steeped in foreshadowing that you could bathe in it.  But, for now,  The Village  is fun summer fair.  I give it   THREE STARS, TWO THUMBS UP AND A FRESH TOMATO  .  And, as always, if you don't like what I have to say, go to  urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/village/ .

      The politic of the economy is often a touchy one.  On one hand, you don't want to come off sounding like you want the economy to be bad right now.  Times are tough for everybody right now and it SUCKS that the economy is still in bad shape.  Nobody wants the economy to be bad, even the Republicans.  BUT, it is.  The  urlLink latest report shows that job growth in July fell extremely short of what many economists expected .         Recent economic news has ratcheted up pressure on Bush to be bold. The economy generated 32,000 jobs in July, far short of economists' expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 324 points this week to the lowest point of the year, closing Friday 772 points below its position when Bush took office.   Payroll jobs remain 1.5 million short of where last winter the White House said they would be by now. To avoid being the first president since Herbert Hoover to preside over a net job loss, Bush must hope for 372,000 new jobs a month in August, September and October.       I mean, that's pretty serious.  This would be a worse situation when his father left office in 1992.  And, it was pretty bad back then.  We have a President who has squandered away massive surpluses left by the Clinton White House, deficits at an all time high, and efforts in Iraq that have become a giant financial blackhole.  This is yet another reason why change is necessary and it's important to hold these records up to the  results  Bush keeps saying he's bringing.  I bring this up because Republicans have criticized Democrats for pessimism around the economy while others have accused Democrats of  wanting  the economy to be bad.  But, there's pessisism and then there's psychotic optimism.  Economists projected 200,000 jobs this month.  We fell pretty much 170,000 short of that.  Yet, the White House calls this small blip "decent."  It must be fun to live in your little world, President Bush.  Kerry brings hope that we won't spiral into decline.  Voting for Kerry is the most optimistic thing I can do.

      Wow...so, the  new  U.S. overseen government of Iraq has decided to squash freedom of speech by  urlLink closing down the Al-Jazeera offices .    Hmmm...is this valuing freedom, Mr. President?  Is this what the fine women and men who died in Iraq fought for?  A government that silences perceived opposition rather than invites debate?       Iraqi Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib said the closure was intended to give the station "a chance to readjust their policy against Iraq."        I'm sure that President Bush is wondering if he could do the same thing here.  He'd probably say, "I'll keep FOX News, but shut the rest down.  They're polarizing the country while I'm trying to unite it."

      In the "What the fuck?" file, here's a  urlLink transcript of an interview with Laura Bush on  The O'Reilly Factor  :    O'REILLY:  Your husband ran on a platform of "I'm a uniter, not a divider."   BUSH:  And I do think he has really tried to unite.   O'REILLY:  But why... this is a very interesting question. I do too. You know, I don't think he went out to polarize the nation. I mean, that's just left wing bomb throwing and it's irresponsible, in my opinion. But it is a fact that the debate now is more intense than I've ever seen in my 30 years in journalism.   BUSH:  Well, you don't think it was equally intense at the last?   O'REILLY:  No, I think it's more intense now. I think the partisanship and the divisiveness in the United States is more intense now than when your husband took office.   BUSH:  And maybe that's also because the Congress is so evenly divided.   O'REILLY:  There is political fighting, but I think a lot of it's social. I mean, you've got these issues like gay marriage and pledge of allegiance under god, which split the country, even though the polls say that most Americans come down on the traditional side on all of these issues. The media portrays it as that's not the way it is.   BUSH:  You gave me a really great idea. Maybe it is the media that has us divided.   O'REILLY:  I don't think that's far out. I mean, I think the media is very polarized itself. Look at the attacks on this network, and you know, we strike back. But the European press is brutal on your husband and it's brutal on America. France is not our friend anymore, I mean, as far as what their actions are. They may say they are. And I'm not sure why that is happening. Is it all about Iraq? Okay...so, did I just hear Laura Bush say that the MEDIA, not her HUSBAND, was polarizing the country and Bill O'Reilly agree with her saying that it's all the other media's fault and absolving FOX News?  Okay, either these two are the most politically inept people in the world or they're insane.  So, you're saying that the extreme right, no compromise stances President Bush has taken are the fault of the media?  And, they say that we're out of step with the mainstream.  Right wing nut jobs is da craziest peoples!

         Our mom in the White House   Piggybacking off of the entry I just posted on John Edwards remarks on the Missouri contitutional ban on same-sex marriage comes this story I found on  urlLink Wonkette  about  urlLink Teresa Heinz Kerry speaking to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender delegates  at the Democratic National Convention.       You are pushing the envelope," she told the 255 delegates. "We have to respond with policies that reflect the capacities and the tolerance of all Americans."  She then abandoned spin control for undiluted empathy. Amid applause and chanting of her name, the aspiring first lady recounted meeting a gay man estranged from his mother because of his sexuality.  "It was clear that he had not made that peace with his mother and he wanted someone who loved him," Heinz Kerry told the audience, according to the Washington Blade newspaper. "And so, at least, if nothing else, you'll have a mom in the White House."       Now, granted, Mrs. Heinz Kerry isn't the one running for the Presidency, but I ask you...when was the last time you heard Laura Bush embrace our community and tell us that we have a "mom in the White House?"  Let's see....mmmmmm, never.  Instead, Mrs. Bush has called same-sex marriage "shocking."  And, we know Mrs. Heinz Kerry means what she says.  As she admits, she is a woman "who has something to say."  Recently,  urlLink the media picked up her response to Bush supporters  at a Kerry rally screaming "Four more years!"  Mrs. Heinz Kerry simply replied, "Four more years of hell..."  Another reminder of why we need to keep our eye on the prize...

       urlLink Gay.com has reported  that John Edwards has said he and John Kerry have "no problem" with the Missouri constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.  This is bound to ruffle a lot of feathers in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  But, I'm really hoping that it's not something that divides us in our goal to get George W. Bush out of office.  I'm not saying that I agree with John Edwards or think that it's fine to ignore this issue.  Nobody was as upset as I was that these right wing assholes in Missouri passed this stupid piece of legislation and that more follow.  No.  But, again, in a world where our political reality is two parties -- Republican and Democrat -- and where the Republican candidate and incumbent to the presidency George W. Bush has not only showed his opposition to our community, but pure contempt by backing a  federal  marriage amendment, we cannot be divided right now.  Let's keep our eye on the prize and then work with Kerry and Edwards on the issues that mean most to us.  Unfortunately, we are in for a fight.  But, it shouldn't really come as a surprise to anybody.  Civil and human rights never come easily.  Just think about it.  We still live in a country where legislation can still be passed with no thought of a woman's health or life and where black voters can still be disenfranchised in a presidential election.  We should absolutely continue to fight for equality.  Just not each other and those who are better friends to us.  Not now.       "The Kerry-Edwards ticket has the strongest human rights record of any ticket in history, and we in the LBGT community have to keep our eye on the prize: defeating George Bush," said Steven Fisher, communications director for Human Rights Campaign.  Instead of denouncing the Kerry-Edwards stance, Fisher assailed Republicans for pushing the gay marriage issue so hard in an election year.  "We think the American people will see these state ballot efforts as George Bush's attempt to divide the American people and distract them from the failures of his administration."       Not that I think the Human Rights Campaign has the greatest responses for everything all the time, but in this case, I agree with them.  This is another reason why we have to get Bush out of there.  This is another reason why we have to turn red states into blue states.  The sentiments of a red, white and blue America are great in rhetoric, but, in reality, we must make sure blue rules if we are to have a fighting chance...

      The  urlLink Asian American Journalists Association  (AAJA), along with the Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, released at the  urlLink Unity 2004  convention  urlLink a study  entitled “ urlLink Asian Americans in Newsroom Management: A Survey of TV and Newspaper Managers .”  The study finds "cultural stereotypes, non-participation in informal industry networks and low numbers in the job pool are some of the reasons why Asian Americans are under-represented in newspaper and television management positions."  It's interesting how, in this day and age where Connie Chung is a legend and has paved the way for other Asian American television reporters, that representation is still low.  Asian American women tend to be more successful in television because of the Connie Chung factor.  Producers see her as having a proven track records.  So, they try to create new Connie Chungs.  In essence, television news creates its own Asian American stereotypes.

       urlLink Media Matters reports the blindsiding  of Disney President Robert Iger by FOX News Channel's  Your World w/ Neil Cavuto  substitute host Stuart Varney.  While talking about Disney's new Dream Desk computer, Varney suddenly brought up  urlLink Gay Days , an annual event organized by a private company and not sanctioned by the Walt Disney Company.    IGER:  It's easy to set up, easy to use, compact, it doesn't take much room, and most importantly it has what's called ContentWatch built in.   VARNEY:  Well, you know, I -- exactly. I mean, in June you have "Gay Days" at your theme parks. You got any 'Gay Days' on the Mickey computer?   IGER:  Well, this has built into it all kinds of protective devices that protects the kid, or the child from internet sites that a parent wouldn't deem appropriate. Also, the fact --   VARNEY:  Well, you don't protect the kids from "Gay Days" at the theme parks, do you? Why do you have to protect them in the computer?   IGER:  No, we don't sponsor -- we don't sponsor "Gay Days." You know, we are a company that lets anyone who is willing to pay through our gates. WTF?  I'm sorry, were we watching the "news" (if one can call that which runs on FOX News "news") or Rush Limbaugh?  They were talking about the new Disney computer and "BAM" -- out of nowhere -- Gay Days.  In fact, I think Varney has "gay" more in his mind than I do and I'm gayer than Gay Gae Gayerson.  I wonder why?  Let's just say, "me thinks the Lady doth protesteth to much."  I'm just saying...  Since 1991, groups such as the American Family Association have boycotted Disney.  Yes, God knows that the Disney Company has suffered because of that boycott.  Nobody knows who they are anymore.  Mickey who?  But, getting back to the stupidity of it all, Varney must have either had a momentary (or full on) lapse of insanity and thought "hey, let me lose all my credibility in this one moment" or he was just plain bored of reporting like a serious journalist and thought "hey, let me lose all my credibility in this one moment."  Not that he had much credibility to start off with.  Maybe, Varney was trying to prove that he could be just as idiotic as the show's regular host Neil Cavuto.  Again, it is incredulous to me that the FOX News Channel seriously tries to argue that it is "fair and balanced."

      There are a lot of people angry at EMILY's List (which stands for "Early Money Is Like Yeast (It helps the dough rise)). It seems the nation's largest grassroots political network that raises money for pro-choice Democratic women has  urlLink endorsed Inez Tenenbaum from South Carolina for U.S. Senate .  Tenenbaum, however, is a  urlLink supporter of the Federal Marriage Amendment  (FMA).  EMILY's list has claimed no wrong:       "EMILY’s List links its position, in terms of who we back, firmly to the issue of choice. This is not a conflict for us," [EMILY’s List CEO Joe] Solmonese said. "Other progressive issues have come up in the last 20 years — gun control, capital punishment — and EMILY’s List has always chosen to stick with its original purpose.  "You have to be careful to respect individual organizations and their missions, and to make sure we all stay true to those missions."      However, gay groups are crying foul:       "We think that it is unfortunate that EMILY’s List would support anyone pro-FMA," said Dave DeCicco, a spokesperson for the [Gay &amp; Lesbian] Victory Fund. "We see them as an ally and this is a matter that we should stick together on. Just as the Victory Fund only endorses candidates who support women’s reproductive rights, EMILY’s List should back only those who support gay rights."      It's a slippery slope because, while Tenebaum is pro-FMA, she is a Democrat. In a state where you already have a conservative Democrat, the logic would be that the Republican would be even more conservative than your standard Republican. And, to me, that is a scary thought. So, what do you do? Which one would it be easier to work with? Would both shut the gay community out?  The whole thing makes my head spin and makes me glad I don't live in South Carolina.  I think Suzanne Martinez from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund said it the best:       Susanne Martinez, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood’s PAC, the Action Fund, agreed that a more socially conservative Democrat would fare better than a conservative Republican on progressive issues, but she added that voters must not lose sight of the basic tenet behind pro-choice and pro-gay legislation: the right to privacy.  Planned Parenthood issued a statement in June officially opposing the Federal Marriage Amendment and Martinez said its PAC would not endorse Tenenbaum — partly for her refusal to answer a questionnaire regarding her reproductive health viewpoints and partly for her opinion on the amendment.  "Several cases, including  Roe vs. Wade  and  Lawrence vs. Texas , form a seamless web that underscores an individual’s right to freedom from government interference in the most personal, private decisions," Martinez said. "We see them as intertwined. You start pulling away at individual freedoms and equal protection laid out in the Constitution, including the right to private sexual activity, and you unravel all other privacy rights."

      In another effort to keep the right wing nutso "let's use our nation's most sacred document to ban everything" craze, the so-called Unborn Child Amendment National Committee (UCANC) will urge state legislatures to pressure Congress to  urlLink "create a constitutional amendment banning abortions .  Sound familiar?       The petition directs the state Legislature either to call on Congress to send an amendment banning abortion to the states for ratification or call a convention to consider such an amendment, according to the [ Sioux City ]  Journal . If Congress sends an amendment to the states for ratification, it must be approved by 34 state legislatures to be adopted, according to the  Journal . [Charles] Kacprowicz[, head of UCANC,] said that it will take up to three years to persuade state legislatures to call on Congress to call a convention, adding that the amendment approach will work best in "small" states like Iowa and South Dakota where "God-loving people" live. Kerry Koonce, spokesperson for  urlLink Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa , said that various antiabortion groups occasionally propose a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, adding that such strategies involve "a very vocal minority of extremists that wants to get (abortion) completely outlawed"       What the hell is with these right wingers?  And they call us anti-American!

           Bush renames the war on terror    in his laugh riot speech to Unity 2004    Well, I got my wish to be a fly on the wall of the  urlLink Unity 2004  convention in Washington, DC while President Bush gave remarks and fielded questions (CNN actually broadcasted most of the questions section). Let me tell you, it was a laugh riot.  Here are some highlights:   On the meaning of  urlLink tribal sovereignty in the 21st century...     BUSH:  Tribal sovereignty means that; it's sovereign. I mean, you're a -- you've been given sovereignty, and you're viewed as a sovereign entity. And therefore the relationship between the federal government and tribes is one between sovereign entities.  On  urlLink diversity  in his administration...    BUSH:  The people who walk into the Oval Office and say, 'Mr. President, you're not looking so good' -- they're diverse.  On renaming the  urlLink "War On Terror" ...    BUSH:  We actually misnamed the 'war on terror.' It ought to be 'the struggle against ideological extremists who do not believe in free societies and who happen to use terror as a weapon to try to shake the conscience of the free world.'  On  urlLink affirmative action ...    BUSH:  I support college affirmatively taking action to get more minorities in their school.  On being the " urlLink War President "...    BUSH:  This is a dangerous time. I wish it wasn't. I wish I wasn't the 'war president.' Who the heck wants to be a 'war president?' I don't.  On the  urlLink disenfranchisement of black voters  during the 2000 election...    BUSH:  I can understand why African Americans in particular are worried about being able to vote since the vote had been denied for so long in the South in particular...This administration wants everybody to have the right to vote.  On whether Bush will  urlLink send monitors  to ensure everybody has the right to vote...    BUSH:  I'll consider it. The  urlLink Unity 2004 convention  also reports that there was a heckler in the audience that was quickly escorted out:       A heckler was ejected from the ballroom as Bush spoke. "Shame on you for calling on the name of God to kill," shouted the unidentified man who did not appear to be wearing a convention badge. Bush paused but did not stop his prepared remarks as the man shouted, "He’s a liar!" and was escorted from the room by UNITY organizers and security officers.  Several groups of protesters also gathered outside of the convention center during the President’s address.      Finally,  urlLink  Editor &amp; Publisher   also shows us how calculating Bush can be...       Bush's finale to his speech was a contrast with Kerry, who gave a snappy salute at the end of his remarks. Bush ended by saying, "Well, I'm off to shake a few hands in New Hampshire. But what the heck? It's the season, right?"      Sigh...what a difference a candidate makes, no?  For a lesson on how   not   to speak to communities of color, you can read  urlLink President Bush's full remarks with question and answer period here .

      I was reading  urlLink Daily Kos  and I just have to say how despicable these men are who have been speaking out against John Kerry's military record. The flip flopping and admitance to outright lying makes you wonder what brought these men to the depths of depravity. Frankly, they are pathetic.   FLIP FLOPPER  So, it appears that Retired U.S. Coast Guard Captain Adrian Lonsdale has apparently flip flopped on Kerry's records.  The ad contains Lonsdale agreeing with other men who have spoken out against Kerry's record. He finishes off by saying, "And, he lacks the capacity to lead."  How interesting when you consider  urlLink his saying in 1996 , "As far as I was concerned, the war was won over there in that part for that period. And it was mainly won because of the bravado and the courage of the young officers that ran the boats, the SWIFT boats and the Coast Guard cutters and Senator Kerry was no exception. He was among the finest of those."  Actually, there is even more proof of Lonsdale's flip flop at  urlLink Lonsdale's Disinfopedia entry .   LIAR, LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE  And, now,  urlLink Lieutenant Commander George Elliott admits that he lied  in an affidavit saying that Kerry lied about his military service.       "I still don't think he shot the guy in the back," Elliott said. "It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm the one in trouble here."  Elliott said he was no under personal or political pressure to sign the statement, but he did feel "time pressure" from those involved in the book. "That's no excuse," Elliott said. "I knew it was wrong . . . In a hurry I signed it and faxed it back. That was a mistake."      I want to commend Elliott for coming forward, but, then again, I think it's unexcusable to outright lie about something like this.  I have to wonder if the big GOP donor from Texas is offering more than funding for their ad campaign.  I'm sure they're being handsomely paid to turn their back on the honor they so prized in the military.  And, what's hilarious is that I've yet to see what anybody Bush has served with has to say about him.  At least, no matter who you hear from  -- his band of brothers or the lying Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, we know, for a fact, that John Kerry served in the military.

           John Kerry receives the standing O at Unity 2004     urlLink John Kerry delivered his remarks to the Unity 2004 convention  in Washington, DC.  Again,  urlLink Unity 2004  is the largest gathering of journalists of color. Kerry spoke to 5,000 participants of the conference and received approximately 50 times and laughs at jabs at Bush during his presentation. In the end, he received a standing ovation.       The reception for Kerry "surprised me a little, but should not be viewed as an endorsement of him or his policies," Sotomayor said. He said many Unity members, including those who were covering the speech or plan to report on it in the future, weren't cheering. As for the others, "they're people who vote, and they have a right to express themselves" when they're not working, [Ernest] Sotomayor[, president of Unity: Journalists of Color and Long Island editor of Newsday.com,] said.  The crowd's reaction made some Unity delegates uncomfortable. "It was a little awkward for me," said Akilah Johnson, a "night cops" reporter at the Sun-Sentinel in Delray Beach, Fla. "I guess a lot of people were acting like citizens, not reporters."  Journalists risk losing their credibility if they let their politics show, said Bob Steele, an ethics specialist at the Poynter Institute, a school for journalists in St. Petersburg, Fla. They should be "observers guided by the principle of independence," he said.      I totally agree that reporters need to keep their objectivity. But, as Sotomayor suggested, journalists are also human beings and citizens of this country who do vote. It's important to recognize that Unity 2004 is a convention where journalists of color go for professional development, networking, and socializing. It is generally not an event that the participants go and cover. So, before the media gets out of control about journalists of color losing their objectivity, think twice before you react about the applause.  While the bulk of  urlLink Kerry's speech  was his standard fare that he's been taking around the country, he did customize it to address communities of color and recognize some of the leaders in media of color.  But, of most interest were his answers to the questions from the audience. Kerry has actually addressed the black and Latino communities before, but has actually said very little about the Asian American and Native American communities. So, it was nice to hear him field questions about these issues. Some highlights...   On how he will "walk the walk" in terms of not taking people of color for granted...     KERRY:  In every vote I have cast -- 100 percent NAACP rating last year -- I have voted to expand the rights, to enforce the rights, to be inclusive.  I worked with President Clinton to fix affirmative action so we didn't end it; we mended it. So there were a lot of questions about quota. I support affirmative action. I've practiced affirmative action.  On direct access to homeland security funding for Native Americans...     KERRY:  I think we have to recognize that the Native American community, which has not been recognized, has as much desire, has as much interest and is as prepared and is as capable and always has protected America with as much zeal as any other community, and we ought to trust it and provide the funding necessary as a separate jurisdiction where that coordination is not absolutely necessary.  On what he would have done if an aide had whispered "America is under attack" while reading in a classroom full of kids...     KERRY:  First of all, had I been reading to children and had my top aide whispered in my ear, "America is under attack," I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had something that he needed to attend to and I would have attended to it.  On the ongoing push for media consolidation...     KERRY:  I'm against the ongoing push for media consolidation. I think it's contrary to the stronger interests of the country.  I understand the world has changed with cable and Internet and the numbers of outlets that we have. But notwithstanding that, the concentration of power still remains, I think, a very significant issue.  I was in favor of the rollback. I voted against the expansion.  I've sat on that committee now for years; I'm familiar with all the issues. And as president, as I said, I will appoint people to the FCC, and I will pursue a policy that tries to have as diverse and broad an ownership as possible.  On the Filipino Veterans Equity Act...     KERRY:  So I can guarantee you this is a fight that is a 35-year fight for me. And I will fight to make sure we do justice to those who fought with, fought for, wore the uniform of the United States of America in the interests of freedom and the defense of our country, and I will do that. Bush is expected to address the crowd on Friday. Lord, I can't wait to see how he fields the questions and how he is received. Said on convention goers:       "I expect there will be much less cheering," said Brian Tong, a Brisbane, Calif., TV host, though he and others interviewed said Bush would get a respectful reception.       Hmmm...I wonder why.  Maybe because Bush has done nothing but fight AGAINST civil rights for the last four years?  Oh, how I wish I could be a fly on the wall tomorrow!

      Why do I have more respect for John McCain than Mary Cheney?  Yes, both of them are Republicans and have campaigned against Democrats.  But, I have to admit that I respect John McCain in some ways for at least coming forward and saying what he believes.  Although he has party allegiance, he did criticize President Bush's handling of the war and voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, calling it un-Republican.  Do I love McCain?  No.  But, he has not let the outright GOP fantaticism get to his head and I respect that.  In the latest event where McCain has criticized GOP trickery is an ad that attacks John Kerry's military record in Vietnam.  A group of Republican Vietnam veterans who were not on Kerry's boat, mind you, appeared in a 60-second ad that said Kerry's record is based in lies.  McCain has called on the White House and the Bush/Cheney ad to also condemn the ad:        Asked if the White House knew about the ad or helped find financing for it, McCain said, "I hope not, but I don't know. But I think the Bush campaign should specifically condemn the ad."  Later, McCain said the Bush campaign has denied any involvement and added, "I can't believe the president would pull such a cheap stunt."  The White House and Bush-Cheney campaign did not address McCain's call that they repudiate the spot, though a Bush spokesman said the campaign does not question Kerry's highly decorated war service. McCain is co-chair of Bush's campaign in Arizona.  In 2000, Bush's supporters sponsored a rumor campaign against McCain in the South Carolina primary, helping Bush win the primary and the nomination. McCain's supporters have never forgiven the Bush team.  McCain said that's all in the past to him, but he's speaking out against the anti-Kerry ad because "it reopens all the old wounds of the Vietnam War, which I spent the last 35 years trying to heal."  "I deplore this kind of politics," McCain said. "I think the ad is dishonest and dishonorable. As it is, none of these individuals served on the boat (Kerry) commanded. Many of his crew have testified to his courage under fire. I think John Kerry served honorably in Vietnam. I think George Bush served honorably in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War."  McCain himself spent more than five years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp. A bona fide war hero, McCain, like Kerry, used his war record as the foundation of his presidential campaign.        Now, if only John McCain would just leave his party and campaign for John Kerry.  Party allegiances suck, especially when you have an idiot in the White House.

      I was reading this  urlLink article  posted by  urlLink AmericaBlog.org  and I have to wonder, "How does Mary Cheney sleep at night?"  Not only has her father supported the Constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, but now he's helping raise money for one of the gay community's top enemies -- Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.  Her father is actively campaigning to make her a second class citizen, yet I have yet to hear a peep out of her at least chiding her dad.  The days of "agree to disagree" are long gone in this campaign.  Unfortunately, you are either for or against.  I have to echo the questions that activists such as John Aravosis and Michael Rogers are asking, "Where are you, Mary Cheney?"  The age of silence is over.

           Michelle Malkin  BIG REPUBLICAN LAP DOG AND FILIPINO AMERICAN UNCLE TOM   Argh!  I found this on  urlLink Angry Asian Man ...  Apparently, Michelle Malkin, syndicated columnist and FOX News commentator, has written a book entitled  In Defense of Internment: The Case for "Racial Profiling" in World War II and the War on Terror .        I've been keeping it under wraps over the past year as I quietly toiled away in the wee hours of the morning, but since Instapundit kindly mentioned receiving the book yesterday, I am delighted now to share a few more details with you.      I'll tell you why you were keeping it "under wraps," Michelle. Because you are a puppet of the conservatives...a little lap dog who is constantly looking for approval from the white dominated Republican party. What better way than to stab your own race in the back so that you can both support the GOP's obsession with racial profiling.  What's sick is that Malkin is not even Japanese American. Malakin, I'm sad to say, is Filipino American -- blech! I'm vomiting in my mouth saying that!       It's a daunting task, I know. This issue is fraught with emotion. Already, the first two reviews at Amazon.com have been posted--one on either side of the debate by individuals who have obviously not read a single page of the book. Another individual, who also admits she hasn't read the book, e-mailed the following to me today with the subject headline, "Shame on you:"    I have been a fan of yours since spotting you a while ago on FOX news…and I often agree with your views. I’m therefore appalled to read on Instapundit that you have published a book which endorses the internment of Americans of Japanese descent during WWII...I’m shocked that you would use Michael Moore-ish “truth-telling” to make the case for the internment camps. My parents’ families were interned in the middle of the desert in Arizona, and it was far from the summer-camp-like experience your publisher describes on Amazon.com. You apparently note the many “amenities” in the camps---sounds almost like Moore’s depiction of pre-OIF days in Iraq.  Geez, Louise. She compares me to Michael Moore without having read a single sentence of the actual book.      Oh, yeah, Michelle...boo hoo for you.  But, to be fair, it is unfair to judge somebody without having fully read the book. I plan to hopefully spend some time in my nearest Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders reading the book so I don't actually have to buy it. But, one does not have to read the book to know that a Filipino American has no right to make an argument for Japanese American internment and compare it to what's going on in the War on Terrorism. Racial profiling and internment are wrong, no matter how you look at it.  Oh, and by the way, you're right. It is unfair of that person to compare you to Michael Moore. You come nowhere close to the brilliance of Michael Moore.       Neither has Eric Muller, who runs the blog Is That Legal? that I mentioned earlier. (He is also mentioned in my book on p. 352.) Yet, based on the book cover and publisher's description alone, he comments that they do "not inspire confidence that Ms. Malkin is going to be giving us history that is Fair and Balanced." He complains that the cover unfairly likened "a Japanese-American man to Mohammed Atta"--but he does so without bothering to find out who the man on the cover is. He is Richard Kotoshirodo, a Japanese-American man who by his own admission assisted the Honolulu-based spy ring that fed intelligence to Tokyo that was key to the design of the Pearl Harbor attack. Every scholar and student who writes about Roosevelt's decision to evacuate the West Coast should know his name and story.      You know what, Michelle. Fill the cover with 165 Japanese American spies up against all the members of al-Qaeda and I'll still tell you racial profiling and internment is wrong. That is deliberate discrimination that ruin people's lives in the rumors prove to be false and perpetuate stereotypes and hatred of a people based on their race. It's stupid and wrong, Michelle. But, I wonder how you would feel if the Muslim terrorists in the Southern Philippines start attacking the United States and the conservatives start wondering about Filipinos. Would you back your precious racial profiling then?  And, why stop at the war on terrorism, then? Hey, let's open it up to the inner city. Hey, there are a lot of homocides that people credit to African American members in the inner city...let's racial profile ALL black people. Er...wait a minute. That's being done already.  But, I'm sure you support that, Michelle.  So, I'll read your book, Michelle Malkin, but I'm sure there will be very little I will find to know that your thesis is wrong and that you are a  BIG GOP LAP DOG !

      Okay, you right wing nutsos who tend to get "blindsided" by musical artists who get "out of line" with their fair minded, progressive viewpoints...listen up. You are now on notice that the following artists will probably make overtures to the failing presidency and the hope for changing the administration come November 2:   Bruce Springstein   Dave Matthews Band   Pearl Jam   R.E.M.   The Dixie Chicks   Jurassic 5   James Taylor   Jackson Browne  All of these artists will be part of Vote for Change, a group of musical artists seeking, as  urlLink Bruce Springstein wrote in  The New York Times  , "to change the direction of the government and change the current administration come November."  So, you are now on notice...  This means that you should not go to one of their concerts and be totally surprised by anything they have to say. If you do, do NOT cause disruption and ruin the experience for other folks with their stupid and childish ways.  This has been a public service announcement from "Confessions of a (thirtysomething) Drama Queen."

       urlLink Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting  (FAIR) released today their  urlLink wrap up on media coverage of the Democratic National Convention .  The report pretty much confirms everything that the  urlLink Columbia Journal Review observed from watching 24 hours of CNN coverage  -- that the media, even credible media outlets such as CNN, depended greatly on GOP talking points and that the media made it a point to call out Democrats speaking "off message."  The chief example FAIR uses is coverage of the Reverend Al Sharpton's speech:       Despite the perennial complaints from media that conventions are too scripted, many in the press corps seemed most interested in policing the convention for anyone who might stray from this script. Their golden opportunity came when former presidential contender Al Sharpton spoke (7/28/04). The MSNBC pundits were none too thrilled about Sharpton before he took to the podium, deriding his effect on the entire primary process: Chris Matthews asserted that Sharpton "probably hurt this campaign. He was a humorist. Everything was a joke." Newsweek's Howard Fineman agreed that Sharpton's campaign "was not to be taken seriously, frankly." Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin asked the panelists to "think of the contrast between Jesse Jackson in '88…. or you think of Obama the other night, last night, where he's a future candidate." Goodwin didn't make clear why Sharpton could only be compared to other African Americans. Nor did Fineman, noting derisively that Sharpton "stayed first class wherever he went," explain where he thought Sharpton ought to have been staying on the campaign trail.  The response from the convention delegates to Sharpton's address was very enthusiastic, but MSNBC actually cut away from the speech in order to resume its panel discussion, where the pundits were having a markedly different reaction. Matthews pondered: "I have got to wonder tonight, Howard and Doris, if this is doing any good for the Democratic Party. They're trying to reach those middle 20 percent." Fineman echoed his consternation, saying he was "very surprised, given the way the Kerry campaign has tried to control and modulate this message here. They didn't need to do this tonight. African-American voters are going turn out in droves for John Kerry and John Edwards regardless. They will walk through walls for them…. He is the only guy-- he could actually turn off the black vote, yes." Goodwin concurred: "In fact, the yelling in the rally right now is like chalk on a board, a blackboard. It's grating. You can't bear to listen to it." Instead, MSNBC viewers were treated to more analysis on the order of this from Fineman: "I think, frankly, it's an insult. It's an insult, I think, as an outsider, to African-American voters that they're giving this guy as much time as they are."  Matthews finally summed up MSNBC's vision of public service: "We're doing a favor to the Democratic party right now. This is a partisan act. We've taken him off the air." The pundits shared a laugh, before Fineman added: "It's completely counterproductive to what the aim of tonight was, to introduce John Edwards as the spokesman of and tribune of rural people, moderate voters, you know, not necessarily African-Americans, who are already in the camp, already in the camp of the Democratic Party."  Interviewing Sharpton after he spoke, even NBC anchor Brian Williams appeared clueless about Sharpton's speech, referring to the "teleprompter that just sat there for what seemed like a half-hour while you did a riff on whatever you did a riff on." Has it really come down to reporters taking politicians to task for *not* just reading off a teleprompter?      What amazes me is that the media didn't call themselves on the inherent racism of these comments. These journalists are saying "why worry about the black vote when you already have them in your pocket?" I remember seeing some of  Hardball  and watching white people discuss how relevant a black man speaking to the black community was at the Democratic National Convention. Their comments were SO offensive, I was waiting for them to take out their white hoods and start burning crosses in front of the Fleet Center.  It will be interesting to see how the media covers the Republican National Convention in a few weeks.  If they don't depend on Democratic talking points and challenge Republican scripting, then I don't want to hear ANYTHING about how liberal the media is...

           The  urlLink National Black Justice Coalition  (NBJC) has launched an  urlLink ad campaign aimed at African American media to urge the African American community  to oppose discriminatory constitutional amendments such as those that ban same-sex marriage. The ad campaign will feature prominent black leaders, including Coretta Scott King, Rep. John Lewis and former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown.  Given that George W. "I'm a uniter, not a divider" Bush is using issues such as same-sex marriage to divide the African American community and given Missouri's passage of a discriminatory constitutional amendment just recently, this is an incredibly important campaign. According to the NBJC, the first round of ads will hit over 500,000 African American homes.  One of my personal heroes said of the campaign:       "We will not stand idly by and allow discrimination to be written into the Constitution of the United States or the constitutions of any state in America," said Mandy Carter, an NBJC board member and chair of its Grassroots Mobilization Committee. "We call on all advocates for fairness to reject injustice and discrimination and to oppose conservative attempts to enshrine their prejudice."      Go, NBJC!

      So, Ron Reagan, Jr., on the heels of making a very impassioned plea for embryonic stem cell research at the Democratic National Convention, has offered to  Esquire Magazine 's September 2004 issue a column entitled " urlLink The Case Against George W. Bush ."  Reagan , in no uncertain terms, lays into the Bush Administration for its ideological stances over scientific proof and the lies that have been constantly spun around Iraq. My two favorite paragraphs in a very lengthy, but well written and well worth the read through, column are:       Politicians will stretch the truth. They'll exaggerate their accomplishments, paper over their gaffes. Spin has long been the lingua franca of the political realm. But George W. Bush and his administration have taken "normal" mendacity to a startling new level far beyond lies of convenience. On top of the usual massaging of public perception, they traffic in big lies, indulge in any number of symptomatic small lies, and, ultimately, have come to embody dishonesty itself. They are a lie. And people, finally, have started catching on.  None of this, needless to say, guarantees Bush a one-term presidency. The far-right wing of the country—nearly one third of us by some estimates—continues to regard all who refuse to drink the Kool-Aid (liberals, rationalists, Europeans, et cetera) as agents of Satan. Bush could show up on video canoodling with Paris Hilton and still bank their vote. Right-wing talking heads continue painting anyone who fails to genuflect deeply enough as a "hater," and therefore a nut job, probably a crypto-Islamist car bomber. But these protestations have taken on a hysterical, almost comically desperate tone. It's one thing to get trashed by Michael Moore. But when Nobel laureates, a vast majority of the scientific community, and a host of current and former diplomats, intelligence operatives, and military officials line up against you, it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize the opposition as fringe wackos.       But, tell us how you really feel, Ron Reagan, Jr? LOL! Thank God you're not a music artist because that would surely get boo'd off stage. Unlike here where we will bask in the glowing truth of that which you speak.  Reagan also defends his honor to those who will naysay his column:          UNDERSTANDABLY, SOME SUPPORTERS of Mr. Bush's will believe I harbor a personal vendetta against the man, some seething resentment. One conservative commentator, based on earlier remarks I've made, has already discerned "jealousy" on my part; after all, Bush, the son of a former president, now occupies that office himself, while I, most assuredly, will not. Truth be told, I have no personal feelings for Bush at all. I hardly know him, having met him only twice, briefly and uneventfully—once during my father's presidency and once during my father's funeral. I'll acknowledge occasional annoyance at the pretense that he's somehow a clone of my father, but far from threatening, I see this more as silly and pathetic. My father, acting roles excepted, never pretended to be anyone but himself. His Republican party, furthermore, seems a far cry from the current model, with its cringing obeisance to the religious Right and its kill-anything-that-moves attack instincts. Believe it or not, I don't look in the mirror every morning and see my father looming over my shoulder. I write and speak as nothing more or less than an American citizen, one who is plenty angry about the direction our country is being dragged by the current administration. We have reached a critical juncture in our nation's history, one ripe with both danger and possibility. We need leadership with the wisdom to prudently confront those dangers and the imagination to boldly grasp the possibilities. Beyond issues of fiscal irresponsibility and ill-advised militarism, there is a question of trust. George W. Bush and his allies don't trust you and me. Why on earth, then, should we trust them?             This is what I've been trying to say. It doesn't matter what Bush is doing right now. I don't trust him. And, how can one be the leader of the free world if most people don't trust you?  On a different note, it is true that Bush's so-called "family values" seem vastly different from the "family values" of Ronald Reagan, Sr. There is a fanatacism now that didn't seem to exist back then. But, I will agree to disagree about this notion somehow absolving the senior Reagan for any responsibility for the environment today. Ronald Reagan's return to conservativism helped pave the way for the so-called "culture wars." But, it was his vice president's presidency that fully ignited them. And, now, it's this current President that charges in with bayonet, striking down fairness and democracy in the name of "family values."    Reagan never gives a direct endorsement to John Kerry, but it's quite clear in this paragraph that he not only wants Bush to lose, but he wants him to go down in flames...          Fortunately, we still live in a democratic republic. The Bush team cannot expect a cabal of right-wing justices to once again deliver the White House. Come November 2, we will have a choice: We can embrace a lie, or we can restore a measure of integrity to our government. We can choose, as a bumper sticker I spotted in Seattle put it,  SOMEONE ELSE FOR PRESIDENT .        Somebody else for president INDEED!

      Actually, if you want to get technical, first it was the Dixie Chicks, then Linda Ronstadt, and now Don Henley. What the hell am I talking about, you ask? Well, apparently, Don Henley was boo'd for making political remarks at a concert in Orange County. Of course, it's too be expected behind the orange curtain, but still, it only shows how completely childish Republicans can be.       Henley, referring to that incident [involving Linda Ronstadt and the Aladdin Casinos in Las Vegas] Thursday night, began a sentence with, "Given what my good friend Linda Ronstadt ," but was silenced as the amphitheatre erupted in boos. He responded: "Whoops - Orange County," adding, "We used to be able to have civil debate in this country. Not anymore."  Henley then suggested his next song could be a duet sung by President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. He launched into Randy Newman's darkly satirical tune, "Political Science," which imagines the United States dropping nuclear weapons on the rest of the world.  "He really blindsided everyone," said Joshua Owen of Long Beach, who had taken a group of employees to the concert and was upset by the political content. "There was booing. Some people headed for the exits."      He really blindsided everyone? Henley's politics have not been a secret. Now, granted, I would probably do the same if the rolls were reversed, but, then again, I wouldn't really go to a concert of a Right Wing, conservative artist. And, if I did, I wouldn't be blindsided by anything they say. You don't like Henley's or Ronstadt's politics...enough to make you go insane at a concert? Don't go to their concerts. But, don't be surprised by anything they say either.

      I saw this on  urlLink Daily Kos  and thought I'd post this here since I'm such a fan of Donna Brazile.    Donna served as a  urlLink guest hosts on  Crossfire  today  -- the liberal voice up against the conservative Tucker Carlson.  In the "Rapidfire" section, Brazile threw a question about Dick Cheney out there.  Republican consultant Ed Rogers took the bite...    BRAZILE:  Dick Cheney served in Congress for over a decade. How many bills did he pass?   ROGERS:  Dick Cheney was very effective.   (LAUGHTER)    ROGERS:  He was rewarded by his party and he was acknowledged by his party as a leader very early on. He was put in a leadership position in Congress.   BRAZILE:  Only two. Only two. John Kerry, 57. We've corrected the record today. We've corrected the record today.   ROGERS:  John Kerry never acknowledged as a leader of his party ever, zero, doughnut.   BRAZILE:  Two bills. Yes, this is why Donna Brazile rocks.  She's such a smart and savvy woman who is able to get the last word.  I'm so sick of the Republican party always bringing up Kerry's record in the Senate.  If he did nothing, why do they fear him as a liberal Senator?  What's amazing to me is that the Republicans can make such broad statements without checking their own ticket.  Earlier in the program, Brazile also calls Alan Keyes, a possible U.S. Senate challenger for the so-far unchallenged Barack Obama in Illinois, on his "flip flopping."    BRAZILE:  You wouldn't want me in charge of religious outreach, not this week at least.  The hardworking establishment is in Illinois today still trying to find a running mate to go up against Barack Obama. As we reported yesterday, they are trying to pick a candidate strong enough, bold enough to challenge Barack Obama in the Senate race. One of the two finalists is two-time presidential loser Alan Keyes, who of course is a resident of Maryland.  He's apparently willing to relocate, even though four years ago he told FOX News, quote, "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness to go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there. So I certainly wouldn't imitate her."  (LAUGHTER)   BRAZILE:  Or would he? Sigh...I love her.  Personally, I'd love to see her be given a role in a Kerry White House.

      The  urlLink Asian American Journalists Association  (AAJA) has released a  urlLink statement condemning the Bush/Cheney campaign  for questioning an  urlLink Asian American reporter on her race .       "Mamta's race is not relevant, and to ask for it sends a message that certain races represent security risks and are not to be trusted. That is wrong," said Abe Kwok, AAJA vice president for print.  Kwok said he is also troubled at published reports that the inquiry of race was made of some journalists and not others. AAJA, which represents more than 2,200 reporters, photographers, editors and media executives of Asian descent, calls for the practice to end immediately.      Well, that's just lovely.  So, here's the new Bush/Cheney campaign slogan:    BUSH/CHENEY 2004:  WE BELIEVE IN RACIAL PROFILING TO KEEP  US  AMERICA SAFE!

           Bush will have you believe that these brave men    and women who risk their lives everyday are lazy     and fat because they support John Kerry.    This is another thing that's been posted on several blogs, from kos to atrios, but I thought I'd post it here since I've been ranting about Bush's ultimate flip flop of being a uniter rather than a divider.  Here, the  urlLink Bush/Cheney Campaign Blog  has refered to a  urlLink National Review column  that really insults firefighters.  The blog post was meant to take a swipe at the  urlLink International Association of Fire Fighters  (IAFF) who have announced their  urlLink endorsement of John Kerry . The post quotes a fairly innocous passage from the column. But, if one reads the entire column, there is a contempt for firefighters in general.       Generally speaking, the likelihood that a firefighter will vote for John Kerry is inversely proportional to the number of fires he has actually fought. Witness all those T-shirted "Fire Fighters for Kerry" you saw at the convention. A little soft around the middle some of them were, weren't they? Do you think some of them could haul a hose pack up 50 flights of stairs? I'm not betting on it. I'm guessing the only fires many of them have seen lately were at IAFF barbecues.       So, in other words, the Bush/Cheney campaign believe that any firefighter who endorses Kerry is lazy and fat. Uniter, not a divider? I think not.

      A superior court judge in  urlLink Washington state ruled that gay couples could be married  because it violates their state constitutional rights.  The ruling is a result of a  urlLink Lambda Legal Defense  led case on behalf of Washington couples challenging the state's Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that held marriage as a union between one man and one woman.       "[King County Superior Court] Judge [William L.] Downing saw the couples in the courtroom and he's recognized that they are full and equal citizens of Washington. No more and no less," [Lambda Legal Defense legal counsel Jennifer] Pizer said.       While the Judge's ruling has been stayed until the state's high court hears the case,  it is important to note that the court's role.  Republicans decry that the judicial system is useless and full of so-called "activist" judges who, as a certain Senator put it, strips away the right of self-government.  Is that why our forefathers created a judicial branch as part of the checks and balances system of U.S. government?  To strip away self-government?  No!  What the court system is meant to do is intepret the laws set up for this great nation to avoid the tyranny of the majority.  This way, no one side can just decide everything.  In other words, the Republicans are constantly seeking ways to become a tyrannical majority.  But, it also underscores the importance that fair minded judges be the ones seated, not those who value ideology over fact.  Again, a lesson learned here is that courts DO matter.

           Is it just me, or there something inherently evil in this photo?    In his whirlwind tour demonstrating how he is becoming the most religiously ideological, right wing President in the history of the United States,  urlLink President Bush went a courtin' the Catholics  as he spoke at the Knights of Columbus convention. Catholics, for the longest time, had voted primarily Democrat, but have become increasingly swing voters as the so-called "culture war" errupted.  Bush pulled out every stop as he took pride in eradicating women's and reproductive rights:       We're making progress here in America. Last November, I signed a law to end the brutal practice of partial-birth abortion. This law is constitutional; this law is compassionate; this law is urgently needed; and my administration will vigorously defend it in the courts.  I was pleased to sign the Born Alive Infants Protection Act. I want to thank the Knights on that piece of legislation. I signed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Common sense and conscience tells us that when an expectant mother is killed, two lives are ended, and the criminal should answer for both crimes.  I was pleased to sign legislation supporting maternity group homes. We'll continue to work to help crisis pregnancy centers. We'll work together to strengthen incentives for adoption and parental notification laws. The Knights have been helpful -- the Knights have been helpful and I appreciate your help.      ...supporting unintended pregnancies...       My 2005 budget, I proposed to more than triple federal funds for abstinence programs in schools and community-based programs above 2001 levels.      ...making potentially life saving scientific advancement sound unholy...       I'll continue to work with Congress to pass a comprehensive and effective ban on human cloning. Human life is a creation of God, not a commodity to be exploited by man.      ...and supporting discrimination against a group of American citizens just because he doesn't like them...       I look forward to working with the Knights to defend the sacred bond of marriage. A few activist judges have taken it upon themselves to redefine the institution of marriage by court order. I support a constitutional amendment to protect the sanctity of marriage by ensuring it is always recognized as the union of a man and woman as husband and wife. I appreciate the Knights' stand on this issue.      Of course, in his speech of hatred, Bush never mentions the war on Iraq because he knows the Catholic leader -- The Pope -- opposed that little operation from the get go.  Catholics have often voted Democrats because, despite the culture war, the Demcrats have been the party of taking care of the tired, the poor and the huddled masses whereas the Republicans have taken care of, as Bush himself suggested, the "haves and the have mores." Democrats have often been the party of protecting the downtrodden rather than purporting human rights abuses (for example, the Abu Ghraib prison scandal) for their own needs.  Bush's speech at the Knights of Columbus convention is yet another example how Bush's favorite politic is the politic of division. Now, he looks to drive a wedge within the Catholic community by making them choose. Uniter, not a divider...I think not.

      Here's another item I found on Angry Asian Man.  The Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy research organization, released a report on the  urlLink Latino and Asian vote .        Latino and Asian vote is rising.  While the number of votes cast by whites in the presidential election rose by only 4.3 percent between 1996 and 2000,1 the number of Asian votes rose by 22 percent. Hispanic votes increased by 19 percent.       The report illustrates that both parties need to be paying more attention to the Asian American community.  This, in light of the recent ire both parties drew as a result of little to no campaign visibility in the Asian American press.  While there are still challenges right now in terms of the Asian American population being relatively young, in terms of housing multigenerational communities, and with a larger chunk still being immigrant (64%), the numbers are changing and will continue to change as those of Asian descent become increasingly woven into the American population.        Latino and Asian voters will play a much larger role in future elections.  Both Latino and Asian populations are projected to grow rapidly in the future, reaching about 25 percent and 10 percent of the population, respectively, in 2050. The aging of these groups and the increasing share of natives among them will strengthen the presence of Latinos and Asians in the pool of potential voters. Currently, only 40 percent of each group is eligible to vote. By about 2025, about 50 percent of each will be eligible to vote. This date could be speeded up through increased rates of naturalization.       A  urlLink PDF version  is also available.

       urlLink Advocate.com reports  that Missouri voters have passed a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.  It is clear, with precincts already reporting around 60% for, that the amendment will make the simple majority required to make it law.         Missouri's was the first such ballot-box vote in the nation since Massachusetts began legally recognizing gay marriage in May. National groups on both sides of the debate consider the vote a litmus test for which campaign strategies work and which ones don't as the battle spreads to ballot boxes around the United States. At least nine other states, and perhaps as many as 12, will vote on similar amendments this year. Four states already have anti-marriage amendments. "What happens here in Missouri could have a tremendous impact on the rest of the nation's other elections," said Vicky Hartzler, spokeswoman for the group backing the amendment, the Coalition to Protect Marriage in Missouri.       Louisiana will be the next state to vote on such a constitutional amendment, followed by Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Utah with initiatives pending in Michigan, North Dakota, and Ohio.  What a sad day that so many people could be filled with such hate that they would call for legal discrimination.  And, I hold Bush accountable with his idiotic language about "activist judges."  I'm trying to figure out where the press is on calling those who support constitutional amendments as criticizing the way our forefathers created this nation by trying to eliminate the judicial system.  There is a reason why the courts exist and this is one of them.  What's next?  Making the separation of church and state illegal?  That will be the day this great nation dies.   urlLink The National Gay & Lesbian Task Force has committed itself to the battle .  According to NGLTF Executive Director Matt Foreman:       The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has committed to contributing $500,000 in cash grants to organizations fighting the anti-marriage amendment fights this fall. To make a contribution to this campaign (every dollar of which will go to the states), "Save Our States" campaign at  urlLink http://www.TheTaskForce.org/sos        I cannot stress this enough.  In this time when everyone is exhausted by the efforts of the radical right to tear our community down, we must not give in.  If you have extra money, donate to the effort to "save ours states."  If you don't have that, donate time.  I know there's been a lot of talk about the Democrats valuing our community.  Let's get them in and work with and educate them.  We have no chance with Republicans who are now possessed by the radical right.  Support your local and state elected officials with whom our community can work.  And, if you can, let's do everything that we possible can to ensure that asshole Bush is out of office.  We don't want four more years of, as Teresa Heinz Kerry accurately and concisely puts it,  hell!   God, I'm pissed.

      Okay, I got this from a segment on  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart  tonight.  It's just another example of how stupid Bush sounds when he calls John Kerry the ultimately flip-flop.        BUSH:  THE ULTIMATE FLIP FLOPPER - PART 312        "We are a nation in danger."           -- George W. Bush,   urlLink Remarks by the President on Intelligence Reform  , August 2, 2004          "Today, because America has acted, and because America has led, the forces of terror and tyranny have suffered defeat after defeat, and America and the world are safer."    -- George W. Bush,     urlLink Commenting on the War on Terror at Oak Ridge National Labratory  , July 12, 2004         So, which one is it, Dubya?  Are we in danger or are we safer?  You can't have it both ways unless you're...gasp...politicizing this issue!

      I found this on  urlLink Angry Asian Man ...NPR did a story on  urlLink Bubble tea  is becoming successful in the United States.  At first, I wasn't going to really write about this, but  urlLink Angry Asian Man 's comments struck me.  He said:    A little yesterday, but okay. NPR story on the popularity pearl tea: Entrepreneurs Find Success in 'Bubble' Tea. Yeah, like seven years ago.  Now, this is true that I have been enjoying Bubble Tea for awhile in the United States.  It would be naive and inaccurate to say otherwise.  But, in the United States, the success of "ethnic-inspired" culture, from food to media, is not so much based on whether people are able to open up businesses that don't go out in the blink of the eye, but whether the "mainstream" (often read as "white") embraces it.  For the last seven years, I've pretty much had to get my Bubble Tea from either from an urban area, generally from an Asian ghetto, OR from a suburban area with a large Asian American population.  If I was lucky, I might find Bubble Tea in a restaurant (which, from my experience, never has the best Bubble Tea since the bulk of their business is making meals).  Anyway, just recently, a Q-Cup, one of the growing chains of Bubble Tea shops, opened near my neighborhood...in Dublin, California.  Now, I do not know the ethnic makeup of Dublin, but I think I can confidently say that an Asian enclave it is not.  AND, this Q-Cup isn't open in just some abandoned strip mall.  No, it's in the giant "media center" very close to the 25 screen and IMAX movie theater and right behind the Fudruckers.    Whenever I go in there, it's always busy.  They get a lot of Asian American customers, but also a whole slew of customers of other races.  To me, that's success.  It's not so much that I think white people are the end all of deciding what gets to be popular.  But, we still live in a country where we're considered foreign and, for the most part, considered uncool.  Bubble Tea, which is inherently Asian, is now considered "cool."  I also notice a Goldilocks restaurant that opened down the street from where I work.  Goldilocks is the largest international chain of Filipino restaurants and bakeries.  Again, this is a restaurant that has always been in cities with large Filipino populations -- Daly City, Union City, Vallejo, El Cerrito, etc.  Concord, where I work, is  not  a Filipino enclave.  So, I found it strange that they would open one there.  The first time I went, I also noticed that it was very different from other Goldilocks I've been to.  Gone was the slop and serve that displayed the foods and in was ordering off of a menu.  Added to the menu were the adobo sandwich, an easy entry for those who have not had Filipino food before.  The place is always packed.  And, not just by Filipino Americans.  People of all races eat there.  Again, a success.  So, while I agree with Angry that Bubble Tea has been successful, as a business for awhile, I also agree with NPR that Bubble Tea has reached crosscultural success just recently.

           Both President Bush and Presidential hopeful John Kerry will be  urlLink speaking at the Unity 2004 conference  in Washington.   urlLink Unity 2004  is the largest gathering of people of color journalists from around the country, including members from the  urlLink Asian American Journalists Association  (AAJA),  urlLink National Association of Black Journalists  (NABJ),  urlLink National Association of Hispanic Journalists  (NAHJ), and the  urlLink Native American Journalists Association  (NAJA).       Unity President Ernest R. Sotomayer, Long Island editor for Newsday.com, suggested Bush's and Kerry's encounters with Unity journalists will help the nation get "a fuller view" of the candidates' positions on race as well as the media. "People of color have long been, and still are today, vastly underrepresented in the national press corps in Washington and on the campaign trails," Sotomayer said as he announced Kerry had agreed to come to Unity, "so we hope this appearance will provide the opportunity for us to pose the questions that no one is likely to hear before election day."       I remember going in 1999 to the Unity convention in Seattle and it was absolutely wonderful.  I remember seeing Al Gore speak at the event and how well he answered questions about race.  I wish I could be a fly on the wall to hear how Bush answers the questions.

      Okay,  urlLink Atrios  has already done this, but the whole thing is so ridiculous that I have to repeat it here:        THE MANY FACES OF TOM RIDGE         urlLink   Tuesday, August 3, 2004    "We don't do politics in the Department of Homeland Security.  Our job is to identify the threat."        urlLink   Sunday, August 1, 2004    "But we must understand that the kind of information available to us today is the result of the President's leadership in the war against terror. The reports that have led to this alert are the result of offensive intelligence and military operations overseas, as well as strong partnerships with our allies around the world, such as Pakistan. Such operations and partnerships give us insight into the enemy so we can better target our defensive measures here and away from home."

      So, the  urlLink President believes that he was "right"  to declare war on Iraq.  That's not the point, you dimwit!  You played on everyone's fears and made us believe that there was a clear connection to Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda and were certain that there were weapons of mass destruction, despite what your own staff were saying just months before the 9/11 tragedy.  The President has to be dumb to think that he would have gotten the support he got if he didn't lie his ass off.        The comments, which the president offered during a brief White House news conference, marked something of a political gamble. Polls suggest that up to half the American public now believes that the war was a mistake, given that no weapons of mass destruction have turned up in Iraq.  "I don't think the president is helping himself when he says things like this. It's a real stretch to think that a majority of Americans would have been supportive of attacking Iraq in the absence of either a clear connection to Sept. 11 or an imminent WMD threat," said political analyst Charlie Cook, referring to weapons of mass destruction.  "Statements like this by the president only lend credence to the charges that he was determined to attack, no matter what," Cook said.       Well, you keep on making an ass out of yourself then, Mr. President, but let me give you a piece of advice from a  true  leader, "The United States of America never goes to war because we want to; we only go to war because we have to."

      I caught this  urlLink  Chicago Sun-Times  article , or really, commentary on this particular passage, on  urlLink Atrios' blog  discussing the possibility of a viable Republican candidate to oppose Barrack Obama for the U.S. Senate seat in Illinois:       Former GOP presidential candidate Alan Keyes told Illinois Republicans Monday that he is ''open to the idea'' of taking on the Democrat in the U.S. Senate race -- a move that would pit two eloquent, nationally known African Americans against one another.       Atrios pointed out the word "eloquent" as a way of describing a successful African American.  I have to second that.  It's reprehensible of the  Chicago Sun-Times  to use such a descriptor, even if it's true.  The implication is that eloquent African Americans are rare and that's why it has to be mentioned.  This kind of descriptor would not be used for eloquent white candidates, would it?

      So, it seems that Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  has been  urlLink banned from Kuwait .    Why would a country censor a film?       Kuwait has banned Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" because it doesn't want to offend Saudi Arabia.  "We have a law that prohibits insulting friendly nations, and ties between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are special," said Abdul-Aziz Bou Dastour, cinema and production supervisor at the Information Ministry.       Hmmm...I betcha the Republicans wish they could pass this law right now.

           Under The Breath:   Gee...Daddy didn't say it was going to be this tough.  Now, how else can I screw Kerry over?   You know, just on his transparency alone, I think that George W. Bush should be asked to vacate the White House. Okay, so how funny is it that it was just a couple weeks ago that President Bush was being vague about important recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission, which, by the way, he never supported from the get-go, but eventually caved to pressure. Now, suddenly, he's ready for action... RIGHT AFTER THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION . Yes, probably fearing the fact that he's consistently been under 50% in all the polls,  urlLink Bush has begrudgingly called for a new Intelligence Director .  Of course, the terror alerts have already distracted us. I mean, we all needed to be on our toes because al-Qaeda has been planning these attacks...  Oh, what is that you say?   urlLink These plans were at least three years old?   Wow...it kind of makes you wonder -- why all of this now --  RIGHT AFTER THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION?   Oh, I know why...because most of America, after being shocked into believing that a terror attack in the financial centers are going to happen any moment and watching the President come out  for  the 9/11 Commission recommendations, will ask, "I'm sorry...What was that about the Democrats?"  I'm sorry, Joe Lieberman, you might think I'm outrageous, but it just seems so transparent to me.

      In another show of what the Bush Administration does best -- government intrusion into matters of privacy -- the  urlLink U.S. Census Bureau surrendered statistical and detailed information about the Arab American community to the Department on Homeland Security .  Why would they do this?       Christiana Halsey, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection, said the requests were made to help the agency identify in which airports to post signs and pamphlets in Arabic. "The information is not in any way being used for law enforcement purposes," she said. "It's being used to educate the traveler. We're simply using basic demographic information to help us communicate U.S. laws and regulations to the traveling public."       How nice of them to think  only  of the Arab American community to create signs and pamphlets.  Why can't the Bush Administration just be honest and say, "We want to track Arab Americans and make sure they're not up to any terrorist activities."  Oh, because it would be very similar to what happened to the Japanese Americans during World War II and 50 years later we realize that this was a very, very bad thing to do so, of course, why not mask it and come up with the most ridiculous answer ever.  People, do we never learn from history?

           A bill has recently been introduced in Congress, by a Republican no less, that proposes to hang  urlLink a portrait of former Congressman Dalip Singh Saund (D-CA) in the Capitol s as well.  He was elected in 1956 and served three terms.  Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), who is also a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, introduced the bill as the second Indian American runs for Congress, "With Bobby Jindal poised to be the next Indian American elected to Congress, and the first ever Republican, it is appropriate to honour Congressman Saund with a portrait for his historic election in 1956."  Ugh...does he have to be a Republican?  Whatever the case might be, though, I applaud Wilson's proposal for a portrait of Saund.  Saund was a great Asian American hero and role model.  Aside from his service in Congress, in the 1940s, he fought for Indians to become legal naturalized citizens of the United States which came true in 1949.

          My Hero!   In this day and age where terrorism attacks loom over us, death tolls rising in Iraq as a result of a U.S. war against it, and the worst president in the history of the United States in the White House, we can all breathe a sigh of relief because there is a silver lining out there --  urlLink Al Franken's radio program will be broadcast on television on the Sundance Channel starting September 7 .  Al Franken is my hero because he's what I believe we've needed all along out there -- somebody who can hold their own with the likes of Bill O'Rielly. Again, I'm totally on board with trying to call FOX on their bullshit "fair and balanced" slogan, but I think there's been so much effort in trying to prove that FOX is right wing. We all know this to be true and chances of Rupert Murdoch changing his tune are slim to none. So, what we need are more voices out there that can be as loud and, I mean this in a good way, obnoxious as the Limbaughs, the Hannitys and the Coulters. We need a liberal version of FOX...a televised Air America.  It sounds like Franken's show will only be on through the elections, but it would be wonderful to see it go on past it.   Congratulations, Al!

      So, if you read other political blogs, by now, you must have seen  urlLink Tom Ridge's quote that raises questions about whether the new terror alert is a political move  by the Bush Administration.  Ridge said, "We must understand that the kind of information available to us today is the result of the president's leadership in the war against terror."  Now, I know that the Kerry campaign is trying to distance itself from any notion that this is a political move.  Here's a piece of the  urlLink transcript from Bill Hemmer's interview with John Kerry on CNN's  American Morning  :    HEMMER:  Yesterday, here on CNN, Governor Howard Dean suggested that there may be an element of politics in this announcement.   KERRY:  Well, I haven't suggested -- I don't care what he said. I haven't suggested that, and I won't suggest that.   HEMMER:  Are you dismissing yourself or even distancing yourself from Howard Dean at this point?   KERRY:  It's not a question of distancing. People have their opinions, other people are entitled to them. I do not hold that opinion. I do not believe that.   HEMMER:  He held the question, is it politics or is it real, or is it both?   KERRY:  Well, he asked the question. It's not my question. I believe you take these threats seriously. I take them seriously.  I think people of good conscience are working on these issues. I respect the men and women in the threat reduction effort. I respect the people who are in the Homeland Security Department.  I don't question them. I question the leadership. I question why it is that we are struggling to get Arab countries and European countries who have a stake in the outcome of the war on terror to be part of it. It's a failure of statesmanship and leadership. And I intend to do better.   HEMMER:  In Boston, Howard Dean told us he speaks to you by telephone about every two weeks.   KERRY:  Somewhere in that vicinity.   HEMMER:  And he said the conversations aren't short, they're actually pretty long in discussion.   KERRY:  We've had some good conversations.   HEMMER:  And he's a surrogate for your campaign.   KERRY:  Yes, he is.    HEMMER:  Based on his comments yesterday...   KERRY:  I disagree with his comment yesterday. It's very simple.   HEMMER:  Will he stay on your campaign?   KERRY:  Absolutely. He's done a very, very good job. He has his opinions. I respect those opinions. But I happen to differ with him on this one. I can understand why Kerry needs to not make the political connection, but, thank God that doesn't prevent me.  Actually, whether or not the Bush Administration fabricated the story is a non-question.  Ridge's statement proves that they're going to milk this for all they can.  In the end, though, the question all boils down to leadership.  I truly believe in Kerry's challenge to the Bush Administration -- what we need is leadership, not followship.  Bush has not proven this to me and any action he's taken here is followship.  Leadership would have been making it an utmost priority to have a comission investigate the 9/11 attacks from the get-go, supported the process from the beginning and implemented their suggestions immediately.

      According to an  urlLink  Arizona Daily Star  article  I saw posted on  urlLink AmericaBlog.org , the Bush/Cheney campaign thinks its okay to involve itself in racial profiling in the name of national security.  Teri Hayt, the  Star 's managing editor, was asked by the Bush/Cheney campaign for the race of Mamta Popat, a  Star  photographer of Indian ancestry, who Hayt was trying to get credentialed for Cheney rally.       "It was such an outrageous request, I was personally insulted," Hayt said later.   Danny Diaz, a spokesman for the president's re-election campaign, said the information was needed for security purposes.   "All the information requested of staff, volunteers and participants for the event has been done so to ensure the safety of all those involved, including the vice president of the United States," he said.   Diaz repeated that answer when asked if it is the practice of the White House to ask for racial information or if the photographer, Mamta Popat, was singled out because of her name. He referred those questions to the U.S. Secret Service, which did not respond to a call from the Star Friday afternoon.       Is this how Bush keeps America safer?  By discriminating against certain people because of their race?    Oh, yes...I'm sure that when al-Qaeda was trying to think of ways to terrorize the President and the Vice President, they thought, let's have one of our operatives become a photographer somewhere in Arizona and then wait and hope that she eventually gets assigned to a Bush/Cheney event where she can cause havoc and mayhem.  Bright, people, bright...  Yeah, Bush is an effective leader in the war on terrorism.  Right...

       urlLink So, the sky is falling again .  Threats against financial institutions in New York and a raised terror alert from yellow to orange in Washington, DC have marred our Sunday.  I don't mean to sound so cavalier about it.  I know that terrorist threats are very real and we always want to remain vigilant about them.  It  is  better to be safe than sorry.  But, at the same time, I'm exhausted.  I feel like the Bush Administration has cried wolf so many times before that I don't know what's real anymore.  Again, I point to the news a few months ago where Ashcroft's Justice Department and Ridge's Department of Homeland Security were at odds with one another in regards to whether there was a terrorist threat at all.  And, how weird was that that it was  conveniently  around John Kerry naming John Edwards as his running mate.  Again, I'm not saying that they did it on purpose, but, either the Bush Administration is inept and can't get it together (which is entirely plausible) or they were once again trying to milk our fears of 9/11 for all its worth to take attention away from the Kerry/Edwards ticket (which is also plausible).  This morning, CNN had political pundits on, giving their views about whether they believed this to a political stunt by the Bush Administration.  First, Wolf Blitzer asked the question to Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senator Joe Lieberman (D-CT).    BLITZER:  You know there will be those critics, skeptics, Senator McConnell, who will say politics behind this, this is an issue that's good for the president and his re-election team so they're taking advantage of this.  And I want you to respond, because you know that there will be people who will be saying that.    MCCONNELL:  Well, you don't hear people like Joe Lieberman saying that. I think that's the most cynical view. The president, after all, is the president, even if he's running for re-election. And I don't think the American people that George W. Bush, the man who's led us so effectively on the war on terror, would politicize something like this.   LIEBERMAN:  I just want to jump in and say that Mitch is absolutely right. And I don't think anybody who has any fairness or is in their right mind would think the president or the secretary of homeland security would raise an alert level and scare people for political reasons. That's outrageous.  And it's exactly that kind of thinking that we got to put aside so we can get together, unite and defeat these terrorists and protect ourselves from another terrorist attack. First of all, what the hell is McConnell talking about?  What effectiveness has the President had on the war on terror.  You've got to be deluded to think we're safer than we were three years ago.  And, now I know why I always disliked Joe Lieberman.  He's too centrist for my taste.  Not that I think politicians should be on either extreme, but I personally think it's  outrageous  not to question the President given his actions over the last several years.  Later, Blitzer asked a similar question of former Vermont Governor and former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean.    BLITZER:  And I want to immediately get your reaction to both of these developing stories. First, the decision by the federal government, the Department of Homeland Security, to increase the threat level here in Washington, D.C., from yellow to orange, from elevated to high. What do you make of this?   HOWARD DEAN, FORMER GOVERNOR OF VERMONT:  It's hard to know what to make. None of us outside the administration have access to the intelligence, which led to this determination.  I am concerned that every time something happens that's not good for President Bush he plays this trump card, which is terrorism. His whole campaign is based on the notion that "I can keep you safe, therefore at times of difficulty for America stick with me," and then out comes Tom Ridge.  It's just impossible to know how much of this is real and how much of this is politics, and I suspect there's some of both in it.   BLITZER:  Well, when you say that, that's a very serious allegation, that the federal government, Tom Ridge, the president of the United States, may be playing politics with the whole issue of fear and terror threat levels. And I want you to explain specifically, so there's no confusion, what you mean by that.   DEAN:  What I mean by that is the president himself has played politics with it. The president is basing his political campaign for re-election on the notion that he ought to be re-elected because terrorism is a danger, and his case to the American people is, "I'm the only person who can get us through this." So of course this is politics.  The question is, do I believe this is being fabricated? No, of course I don't believe that. But I do think that there is politics in this, and the question is, how much is politics and how much is a real threat?  I have no doubt there's a real threat here, but I also -- this is a long history of orange to yellow, yellow to orange, orange to yellow without a lot of explanation.  I find that the warnings -- watch out for somebody walking into buildings, watch out for somebody driving cars, watch out for somebody driving a truck -- that's not very helpful in New York City. It would be very helpful if the federal government would be much more specific about exactly what they'd like to us watch out for as they're raising all these levels.   BLITZER:  But isn't it important that if there are serious indicators of a threat out there, that the federal government at least notify those who may be in harm's way to be a little bit more vigilant?   DEAN:  Yes, it is very important. And one of the things about this warning, which is different than the previous many, many, many that the Bush administration has given us is they've given us specific cities and specific targets.  The usual pattern of the Bush administration is just come out and tell everybody, "We have chatter, we have chatter, watch out, watch out," and that is totally unhelpful. This at least confines it to a geographic area, and I think that's an improvement.  I think, frankly, that this is an area which I think John Kerry would handle much differently. I think John Kerry would probably wait until he knew exactly what the situation was.  He's also said that he would hire more special forces people, and that's going to be the key to stopping this. We need to stop these people in their own lands, not when they get to ours.   BLITZER:  Governor Dean, you were governor of Vermont when Tom Ridge was governor of Pennsylvania. You clearly know him. Is he the kind of man who would play politics with this kind of sensitive subject?   DEAN:  Look, I like Tom Ridge. And I knew George Bush, and I like George Bush.  The president himself has said he is playing politics with this. The president himself has said that he ought to be re-elected because of the terrible terrorist danger. I don't see what's the big deal about this. I mean, it's obvious politics has something to do with this.   BLITZER:  Well, as I said before, that's a very serious charge that you're making against the president.   DEAN:  I don't think it's a serious charge. It's something the president himself has acknowledged.   BLITZER:  Well, when you say he's acknowledged, he says this is not...   DEAN:  The president's campaign is based on...   BLITZER:  Well, let me just say, he says that what he's doing is trying to protect the American people when he and his intelligence community, law enforcement community sense there are threats out there.   DEAN:  I have no doubt that the president is trying to protect the American people. That's his job. And I think that's a good thing. I think that's good. That's what he should be doing.  However, when you're going to run on inspiring fear in American people, that's politics.  And there's no way you can get out of accusations and discussions about the relationship between politics and protecting us against terrorism in an election year when the president of the United States is avowedly running his political re-election campaign on the notion that he can protect us better from terrorism than John Kerry can.   BLITZER:  Let's move on. Clearly, by the end, both men were exasperated and, clearly, Howard Dean probably pissed a bunch of people off.  But, again, this is one of the reasons why I've always loved Howard Dean.  He always seems to speak his mind.  Dean speaks to the fact that the Bush/Cheney campaign truly does depend on the nation being afraid.  Even  urlLink psychological studies are coming out about the Bush campaign's methods .  Finally, Blitzer asked the Reverend Al Sharpton, also a former Democratic presidential candidate, the same question:    BLITZER:   We'll get to politics in a moment, but I wonder if you'd want to react to the news of the moment here in the United States, that the secretary of homeland security about to announce at the top of the hour that Washington, D.C., will go on a heightened level of alert, from yellow to orange, from elevated to high, because of some specific threats here in Washington, D.C., joining your hometown, New York City, at this higher level of threat right now.  What do you make of this?   SHARPTON:  Well, I think we've got to be careful not to have a partisan, knee-jerk reaction.  Clearly, as one that, as you say, is from and lives in New York and was here during September 11th, we should take any threat seriously, and we should unite to try and protect the American people. Whatever the politics is is not more important than that. And I think we need to wait and see. We do not have the intelligence information. So, since the present administration does, I think we have to wait and see and abide by whatever they tell us at this point.  Anyone that lived through the horror of September 11th would act responsibly. I don't want to, in any way, be as irresponsible as I have accused the administration's supporters of being.   BLITZER:  So in other words, you tend to agree with Joe Lieberman, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, the former vice presidential nominee, who doesn't believe that the president or the secretary of homeland security would play politics with this issue, as opposed to Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, who was just on this program, who's accusing the president, to a certain degree, of playing politics with this whole war on terror?   SHARPTON:  I think the president has used terrorism as a centerpiece of his campaign, and I think that the president has certainly said to the American people that, in so many words, he's better at this than Kerry.  I happen not to believe that. I think the candidate that we have, Kerry, would do a better job.  But I also think in the light of threats, we cannot without any evidence say this is just politics, because we don't know that.  And I think that, given my suspicions of him and certain things done in the past, I would not in the wake of new information with no data to back it up just say, "This is what that is," because I don't know that.  And I know that we have already been attacked, and we can't discount any threat without any information or any basis of making that discounting.   BLITZER:  All right. So you're willing to give the administration, at least for now, the benefit of the doubt. Is that right?   SHARPTON:  I'm willing to give them the benefit of further information, being that 3,000 people did die in the city I'm sitting in. And that is not something that either party, I think, could tolerate the threat of that happening again. Once again, I have to ask myself why I  didn't  take the Reverend Al very seriously before.  I'll admit that part of it has to do with internalized racism.  But, whatever the fact might be, the Reverend Al hit the nail on the head one more time.  Sharpton, I think, expressed the caution we all are moving at.  None of us want to see another 9/11 happen.  But, we can't help, with Bush's record, wonder.  All this leads me to wondering why those who support Bush want to live in this kind of fear.  What kind of leadership has Bush had on the war on terror?  Could derailing the hunt for Osama Bin Laden so that he could finish daddy's war in Iraq for oil interest possibly be a way he led us through the tough times?  Oh, wait a minute...things are worse now.  Yeah, folks...that's leadership for you.   In fact, in light of these new terrorist threats, what is he doing now?  The Department of Homeland Security has raised the terror level which, to me, is like saying he's renamed the word "terror" as "Picachu" and the word "threat" as "Jigglypuff."  In other words, it's meaningless to me as a citizen.  It has also recommended financial institutions step up security measures.  But, other than that, what has Bush done?  I ask you, if you don't believe that this latest move is a political one, don't you think it's time for a change?

      I was just at  urlLink AmericaBlog.org  which posted a  urlLink piece by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman , which basically offered that ALL television news, both cable and network, prefers "puff over policy" when covering the Kerry/Edwards campaign.    Krugman starts with:       Under the headline "Voters Want Specifics From Kerry," The Washington Post recently quoted a voter demanding that John Kerry and John Edwards talk about "what they plan on doing about health care for middle-income or lower-income people. I have to face the fact that I will never be able to have health insurance, the way things are now. And these millionaires don't seem to address that."  Kerry proposes spending $650 billion extending health insurance to lower- and middle-income families. Whether you approve or not, you can't say he hasn't addressed the issue. Why hasn't this voter heard about it?  Well, I've been reading 60 days' worth of transcripts from the places four out of five Americans cite as where they usually get their news: the major cable and broadcast addressed the issue. Never mind the details - I couldn't even find a clear statement that Kerry wants to roll back recent high-income tax cuts and use the money to cover most of the uninsured. When reports mentioned the Kerry plan at all, it was usually horse race analysis - how it's playing, not what's in it.       I'm so glad somebody's writing about this because I thought I was going crazy.  I also wondered why the media kept saying that Kerry did not mention specifics.  I wondered if they went to a different convention than I was watching on television, because I heard both John Edwards on Wednesday and John Kerry on Thursday SPECIFICALLY talk about taxes (probably even more specific than I've heard a presidential candidate get), healthcare, education and the war on Iraq.  What more did the journalists want?  Charts, graphs and a powerpoint presentation?  Also, I remember hearing John Kerry telling people to check out  urlLink johnkerry.com .  If you go to  urlLink johnkerry.com , SPECIFIC plans are discussed, issue by issue.  What are the media looking for?  While the analysis may be fascinating, there is actually a bigger danger here.  The public DOES depend on the media to shape its opinions about things.  I remember hearing a Times Talk panel on whether there is liberal bias in the media or not.  Tucker Carlson from CNN's  Crossfire  talked about how journalists didn't seem to like Al Gore during the 2000 Presidential Election and their coverage reflected that dislike.  The media must be held accountable for how it presents the news.

      CNN has always been my channel for news, although, I will admit that I thought their coverage of the Democratic National Convention was really weird.  For example, right after John Kerry's acceptance speech, the first commentary they get is Ed Gillespie, the head of the Republican National Committee.  From the repition of GOP talking points to trying to find dissent in the Democratic Party itself, one had to wonder if CNN was even trying to outfox FOX News.  The  Columbia Journal Review  has a Web Site called  urlLink The Campaign Desk  which analyzes the coverage of the 2004 campaign and followed  urlLink CNN coverage for a day .  The article, actually, confirms what I was thinking about the coverage and offers a possible reason for the conservative slant:       Defenders of Fox News, CNN's arch rival, argue that Fox takes a conservative slant to offset CNN's liberal stance. Critics of both think, by contrast, that CNN, badly bruised in the ratings war, has stooped to slavish imitation of Fox's most dubious ploys and policies.       Unfortunately, love it or hate it, FOX News has taken a giant bite out of the news reporting world.  I once asked my mom why she watches FOX News and it is because of commentators such as Bill O'Rielly and Sean Hannity.  I don't think it's so much that they're right wing, for folks, but that they are obnoxious pricks who are entertaining.  She added, "Everytime I turn on CNN, you have Aaron Brown.  He's not exciting."    Unfortunately, while I enjoy Aaron Brown's program, it is true, he can never match up to Bill O'Rielly.  I understand why Aaron Brown's more objective and calm method makes for more believable news.  But, we live in a time where  Extreme Makeover ,  Trading Spouses  and  My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancee  rule the airwaves.  People want EXTREME.  We live in a time when  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart  is a major news source for youth.  People want ENTERTAINING.  Both of these things, FOX News has to offer.  Unfortunately, now we've seen reputable cable news follow suit.  We've seen MSNBC add conservative commentary such as  Scarborough Country  and  Hardball . A major value in journalism is integrity.  Let's just hope CNN doesn't fall into the FOX News trap.
