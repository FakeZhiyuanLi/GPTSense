Damn tired today, was sleeping while standing on the train until woodlands until they ask me to do survey and i lost my leaning spot... damn... had mighty difficult time through gp lecture tdy keeping my eyes open but the eyelids just would not listen to the master so i decided not to resist and give myself some rest. lucky daljit not prowling around if not she would have spotted me. And my back and stomach still hurts like hell frm alex lee's training, lucky tmr no soccer if not i wun b able to run properly man. Oh yah, looks like BFA got a new&nbsp;variation again, BFA now stands for either Big Friendly Ang or Big Friendly Angel... damn lame seh. Relatively sian day tdy... like almost everyday.. jus looking forward to sat, maybe can play soccer at lam soon, 2 weeks nvr play liao!!

      lately I've been thinking, yea, real deep searching in the insides of my mind... not something i do very often i guess... and wats the reason for all this soul searching all of a sudden? I dono, perhaps i'm just too bored with life now... life has become so much of a monotony now... heck i can predict my routine for the nxt few wks... mondays are dominated by the farking morning pe which always leaves me drained for the entire day usually... tuesdays are just plain boring, wenesdays bring some cheer coz its a short day and if theres soccer, i have to psyche myself up.. by the time it reaches thursday, where theres only 2 lectures, leaving tutorials for the rest of the day, i'm already half zombified... fridays are kinda ok coz its the last day of the week... and there are lab periods... which is kinda fun sometimes... unless it involves use of the bloody microscope... i swear, that crap will make me go blind or cross eyed someday... ok weekends come, which is supposed to be like really great right? negative... sats have common tests which means i have to burn for friday nite which i really honestly want to use to rest after a freaky week... but no... i have to burn up friday nite in some pile of notes that i haven read b4... thankfully... theres soccer in the afternoon at lam soon wif my soccer khakis... then i go home, sapped of energy and await the nxt day sunday.. which i use to do hw and stuffs... yup... thats my week for u... 5 days of being an undead person, 1 day of fun, 1 lousy sunday... combine these 3 and repeat for weeks... zzzz....  U know... sometimes i wonder whats the purpose of blogging... is it for urself? or for others to see? perhaps its a bit of both... people have an exhibitionary nature sometimes... yea and perhaps someday in the future I would like to read what i've posted... to see my life in the past.. yup that would be fun rite? to really see what u are goin through like a few years ago on this day... yea...  anyway... i managed to do tutorials at a fairly fast pace tdy... woke up in a dreamy mood... sat down and attempted to do chem tut in the morning... but was in a way too dreamy mood to do anything... put it off until 12... but did quite alot tdy... probably enuf to cover me for this week... baring the damn chem and maths test this sat... fark... seems quite a mountain to cover... which i have no idea of how to tackle... but wat the heck... i will probably find someway to do so... ppl always do... my mum probably thinks i'm too slack as i only do work on sundays, the rest of the time i'm jus lazing around in front of the com... i dono... maybe she expects me to b a mugger( which thankfully i'm still sane enuf not to be one ) not doin work from mon to thurs and sat doesen't mean i will lag behind in class... anyway lately i've been listening to alot of music... yea... suddenly i love songs by maroon 5 and dashboard confessional... and i've got all the albums hehe... wonders of file sharing programs... and jay's new album is gd too... and i'm still listening to spiderman 2 OST... yea its kinda old... but i like it and its spiderman... my favourite comic bk hero yay...  think i shld end now... my post tonite is really kinda random yup... a little rojak... but whatever... its not that i really care...

      yest was testimonial match which saw j1s against the j2s... as expected, i was left on the bench as the j1's 2 other forwards are better then me... anyway, the match started with the j2 team looking stronger despite a first 11 being fielded for the j1s... rolling subs were being played and the first substitutions were made not long after the match started. one of the strikers was subbed out but i didn't go in cuz the coach tot i was a defender instead... so he put a midfielder in to convert to striker... zzzz..... however, i finally got my chance at the start of the 2nd half and damn, i think i played really terrible.. since i'm the only right footed forward among the 3 j1 forwards, i played more to the right and had to come up against some probie left back.... damn it man... out of 3 times i went against him, i only manage to beat him once, first time he tackle the ball before i reach the ball, 2nd time he block my cross... den only 5 mins into my game, i hurt my left ankle while trying to play a return ball to nelson, sian man... weak ankles.... and i oso let the ball bounce while receiving long ball.... was trying to head it when boon han ( soccer god ) asked for ball... den duno whether to head or kick to him ( coz i can't direct my headers ) and in the end i let the ball bounce... zzz... felt i didn't run enuf in the game coz when i was subbed out, i don think i had even started to pant... dono y when i played yest, i felt so tired, like my reaction was slowed... although i wasn't tired physically... didn't have the motivation to run for ball... perhaps i was too tired, maybe i'm just thinking too much so i had an early nite yest to get more rest and i felt much much better better tdy... at least after playing tdy's recre session i felt a little better... although its recre soccer and we were playing small pitch with big goal posts... but at least i had my shots on target.. at least my shooting more or less still can make it... but still got many more areas to improve! like control and awareness and i nd to run faster oso... yea.. improve improve improve!

      Woo tdy was national day celebrations day where we had amazing race AJ style Was pretty ok stuff... not the most thrilling race ever but what the hell... at least there was an attempt at creativity... Anyway class debrief was quite a moment where I kinda reflected upon my life in class 17/04... the fact is... 17/04 is split into 6 cliques... we have the multi racial "think we're so cool" girl power gang... the malay speaking gang, cheryl qianhui partnership, chinese speaking girl gang and of coz, the guy gang. Wait... I forgot, theres still the weird gals group..Today, mrs loh sorta told the class that we should not conform to just our cliques and try to be one as a class but somehow... I just dun really wan to be so close to the rest.. i mean its fine that we interact during class time but I just don see myself wanting to get close to some of these people... fine.... say that I have a superiority complex or wadever but I would like to choose my own friends thank you very much.... Of course, I will go to every class outing and wat so ever but please don ask me to be pally pally wif someone I don wish to be close to... it irks me Anyway.. off to happier stuff... went to eat after the celebration thingy wif the guys as well as dinah mayvina and hui xian at PS den later went to play pool wif the guys ( who else..) and huixian... Woo I think my pool's getting better... more confident now wif my shots but breaking still needs more training yup... after pooling decided it was way too early to head for HSH so we went to search for some coffee joint to sit down and tok cock Finally ended up at Taka Coffee Bean after fruitless search at paragon... vegetated there for like 1 hr? or sumthing b4 headin home.... Hope to have this kinda outing again man... wif more people....

Anyway, tdy is finally the eve of national day eve, which means an extended 5 day break! Woot! Although got bio test on sat, but i still in holidae mood lah, heck man... but tdy sian man, keep thinking that I wun make the cut for soccer... demoralising myself... duno y but I suddenly find that I dono anything being a striker lor, my new position after playing in defence for the past years... basically, i only feel gd abt my shooting... thats all.. off the ball, headers the rest all i think i'm crap lah... hai... how to improve that much in such a short space of time... trial coming soon.... maybe these fears are unecessary coz I didn't think i would have much chance of making it to soccer initially... but the more i think abt it... wif other ex-bpians in other jc teams... the more i wan to be part of it.... to be involved... not just a mere spectator... mus hope for luck man...
