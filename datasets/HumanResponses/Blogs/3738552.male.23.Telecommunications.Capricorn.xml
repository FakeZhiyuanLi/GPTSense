      So I have found yet another way to spread my mental problems around the net like so much Skippy . The ego boost almost knocked me out of this chair . But my problem lies in the fact that I have no idea what this first of many posts should be about . I think something about monkeys would be good . However I cannot think of a single thing to say about those fuzzy little poo throwing, flea eating, angelic bundles of monkey goodness. Well of course with the exception of the horrible monkey incident that befell me when I was but a young impish boy *cringe* . So maybe something deep and thought provoking , but no not enough sleep for deep thought , the synapses aren't firing today . So after much personal soul searching and meditation I have decided to leave this as is . I mean it's not like anyone is going to read this but me so it doesn't really matter what I say. Example: Marbles don't float in Ketchup . Now why would I say that ..... Because I can hahahahahaha Laugh with me , laugh with me  !! ahahahahaha

      You know it's odd sometimes how you can find small parts of enlightenment in everyday life. Case in point , the other day I found my own little piece of nirvana in the movie Return of the king . Yes , I know a very fanboyish thing to say . However it is true , the really odd thing is where it came from . Now I have been studying religion for as long as I can remember , I started with Greek and roman in like second grade and have been chugging along ever since. It is one of my favorite topics of discussion.  Anyway in that time I have come across many different concepts of the afterlife, what it is , how you get there , ect ect . But watching that movie kind of put it in focus a bit for me . I was watching the scene where Gandlaf was talking to the bo-bo hobbit about how the afterlife was great and he shouldn't be afraid to die . This to me was a very powerful scene , mostly thanks to Sir Ian Mckellen's great acting , and great writing my one of the masters. It really made me stop and think about all the stupid stuff I deal with everyday and how it doesn't really matter , because when it's all said and done I get to go and feast and fight with my ancestors for all time in paradise .  What could be better than that , I mean aside from being a rich good looking porn star. By the way if any of you haven't read the LOTR series I suggest it. Tis one of those things everyone should read in their life . After that you can move on to Heinlein , the stories are just as good but a lot more debauchery .

      So I get on here today praying , hoping , wishing that someone or something has read my shiny new blog post . It was not there . Now im pretty sure I saved it and looked at it after it was written but mayhaps I did not do something correctly .       Damn shame really as it was great blog work , it was funny , smart , thought provoking and witty to no end . It would have made me an instant star , women would want me and men would want to be me . Alas I am here now but because of my own stupidity or error you don't get to read one the greatest pieces of literature ever written . Sad
