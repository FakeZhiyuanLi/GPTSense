      It was the first time I've seen you since the incident, I must say you've changed in this past month. Your eyes, they look so drowned, you look so exhausted and when you were sleeping, God, I wanted to make it better, because I know something was bothering you, you weren't yourself, did I know you as yourself? All these thoughts cascading through my mind and in an instant everything has and will change again so I know not what to feel. For a split second in my insanity I can almost pick up your scent, I can almost feel you breathing again. Then reality takes hold once again and I am left with these thoughts that I  am  happy now and that I  did  get what I wanted and just to  give up  on hopeless dreams and romances because nothing's the same when you've got it we just throw away.  So I leave you with this. You are in my mind and I care for you always, and I'm a fool for my thoughts and my actions. Pitty...

       The Examination of Sarah Good    irony of the day:  So, back when the Salem Witch Trials were occuring, everyone was claiming outragous sights of "witchcraft" and blaming them on so called "witches". They believed these "witches" were making deals with the devil so they could have the ability to perform MAGIC. As believable as that sounds, it was recently discovered that in the Salem area, there were crops found with this horrific mold growing on them. Something else was also discovered..it appears that there was a drug in the mold [the same drug found in ACID]. So they most likely weren't seeing witches and magical things...they were  trippin'..

       I'm on fire   Inhale. Forget the pain. Exhale. Jealousy withers away. Everything is "little" when we want it to be. Say it just to downsize me. The lackluster of a word when it is like a record. over and over and over you say..

Nothing like winter. Wake up early, go to a set-destination, smokin' ciggarettes and talking about the impossible, livin' the impossible, friends are *new age hippies*, these are the days. Yes, these are the days.  I have this feeling of utter happiness, swallowing me up and I'm floating higher and higher. NoN-Induced High...

       2 AM Scribbles..   T here is nothing I find more beautiful than these dead hours. Soon before the sun will rise, early morning, but the stars have yet to stop shining. To my eyes, it is still dusk. All the peace, all the tranquility in the world that we have searched for all these years has been hidden in this paradise aglow forgoing dawn.   L ightning. This scene is now chaotic, full of storm and rain, ah, to my ears it is soothing and magnifiscent. A particular dream of mine: to be in love under this inclusive blanket of emptiness that makes us feel so absolute.   O ne day, let everyone witness this perfection.  Heaven is on earth when no one is watching...

       No Missouri.  My dad is proud to be my dad because when I found out, I didn't say "YES" as expected, I asked if he was okay. He told me he loved me, it was a "character judging moment" as he said. Sometimes parents aren't cool and you think they just don't understand, like they just don't care..but at that very moment, I knew that my dad does care. And he just wants the best for me. [ although i'll never admit that to them. ]  *All her dreams are falling from the sky right in front of her eyes*  --I LovE yOU ToO ZAcH

      Fucking Missouri. I'm NOT going. NO. I fucking refuse. GOD forbid I stay in one place for more than five fucking years.. I look around, all these people are childhood friends, they've grown up together, but I don't HAVE that because MY dad makes me move around all the country looking for more money. Money this, money that. Is MONEY really the answer? I mean I know we need to pay our bills for the house and cars and all, but can't we get a  smaller  house? do we have to have 9874359873 square feet? i dont WANT to start over. they're like "it'll be hard for Sam too" SAM is EIGHT YEARS OLD...the older you get the stronger bonds you make with people, it's not going to be hard for him, he'll play with anyone. but i already have my place in highschool, in society, in life and i don't want to have to start over..      I love all you guys, I swear to God I do..

       "I can't see nothing, nothing 'round here..."   Passed out and forgot my name last night I dont think "it's going to be alright." No, no not at all. "I will fall, I will fall.." "I want to be alive," the man sings Staring at this tattered ring. Time and time again, I ask myself this can't be good for my health. And all I want, is in the pouring rain you to come and act insane Tell me I'm pretty and you made a mistake and that tears rolling down your cheek aren't so fake.  My  impetuous  wishes your 'mean nothing' kisses  watch me fade away...

      Okay, how about everyone gets off my ass about the things I feel. I'm sorry that I care about someone that I'm "not supposed to", I'm sorry that I messed something up and that I lost someone that was very important to me in my life, I'm sorry that I'm upset and that everyone around me seems to be able to justify feelings otherwise, but for now, I am hurt. And I don't feel like taking anything from anyone, so I'll just curl up into my little 'lonely girl' corner while ya'll bitch about me not having the right to feel this way until I've had my time to get over it...  If you think it's stupid or ridiculous or a waste of my time to feel sorry for myself or complain about my own pain then DoNt read what I write. This is how I vent, this is my escape from the stupid judgemental world we're all so wrapped up in, and I'm not about to let that change.  ::tells herself:: this will go away, this will all go away soon.

       Stayed up till 6, only to wake at 11 with the news: "I don't think it would work out between us, Bre"   Well, I'm glad that's off your shoulders, I'm pretty sure it was there all along I just hope everything goes as fucking plan. While I lay here, lifeless and float away you'll find me dead in the fucking sand.  Self-medicate till you go away it won't be hard to find a replacement. Just one that means the same, feels the same. And even though I fucking hate you, I'll always love the memories [the ones you fucking stepped on today]  So good luck with your fucking fill-in I hope you find shit I couldn't give and while you suck face and fuck the days away I'll be dying to live..   By the way, I give up on my 'masterpiece' it would've been stupid.

      All is lost with you, so in the mean time I will do something productive.  I am creating something, for all of you. Because I love you all so much and I want you to know how beautifully I see you. You guys mean the world to me, and I love the things you say.  Friends, leave your responses on my tagboard or send them via AIM. LooOOve Yoouu GUyys.     If you could give me a quote, a meaningful outlook on Life, Love or just Experiences in general,  [you pick which one]  What would it be?

      This love is a love that branches off, apparently, and I am left at your will. Kiss me and tell me it's over between the two of you or drug me up and leave me crying. At least I'll be floating until I come down. At which time I'll ask you again to tell me what I wanna hear, c'mon baby whisper in my eeeaaar. 	 Straight from my heart to Cory.

       This stupid JAgGeD PiLL stuck to my throat, polluting my stomach, filling me to the top.   A few minutes, I feel it sinking, into my blood to rot away or whatever makes it feel good.  A few more, the time is really ticking. So desperately obvious, but at least I feel fine. Yeah, I'll be fine in no time at this rate..  Almost an hour, my god what have I done. This fucking substance, does me no good what so ever. Alone and shaking. You couldn't help but crack a smile at this. A stupid girl takes stupid pills cause of one stupid kiss. No, it's more than that. 6 months I'll miss.   "You can't make them want you, they're all just laughing"  --Taking Back Sunday. Oooh how I love those boys. Mmmm, mmm.

       You kissed me like you meant it.. And I  know , that you meant it..   Love takes its toll, that's for sure. Never wanted this much, you never wanted more. Now all the sudden everything's gone and all we have left are some stupid songs. I can't take this for long.  When you love someone a choice like this shouldn't be so hard A caring person like you, it's difficult But the Fact still stands, if you Wanted to be with ME..and not anyone else..you WouLD.  I think I know your answer, already How else can you explain the tears rolling down your cheeks You want her, you don't want to hurt me.  Understanding, I wish I could be.  Take this fucking gun and  kill me please.

Last evening, I was actually happy for a few hours. Props to:  One Derek. One Sarah. One Meg.  I love you guyssssss   [I don't know what to think of  you . You tell me one thing, you do another.

You're so guilty it's disgusting She's been sneaking underneath your sheets and your hands have been in places that they probably shouldn't go but don't worry, sweetie 'cause i already know.

      ~Look at you, keep smiling~  Merry Christmas. Thank you for calling, though I don't know whether to feel at ease or restless as usual. I do love you. I'm sorry for the hurt I've caused, I knew not of how that felt until now. And I never meant to, I care..so much. If things are over, I promise to remember the great things, there were so many things I loved. I had many firsts with you and I wouldn't of chosen any other person to share them with. You've taught me so much..about my self, about others. If you don't mind, I have so much more to learn. This will either come across as really lame or really caring and sweet, hopefully the latter of the two.   ::playing the fool::   Stole my words and used 'em for profit The things I believe belong to me.

       A tribute to things lost:  Behind drunken eyes, pursed lips I never thought it'd come to this.  A friends house, or getting high stay up late, the clouds fly by.  You we(a)re my star. A little girl scared to have come so far.  Of all of them, you were my favorite feel. It took something like this to make it real.  And though I can't go back, I hate some things I've done. I still want to be good for you, what light will I have without my sun?

      I have deleted an entry. I do not hate anyone that I have not had the chance to meet. That is obsurd. I do not even hate the other, who I have known for so long, I hate what he did. I hate the way he made me feel. I hate feeling jealous of something I know not of. I hate being clueless to what's going on, and furthermore I hate making myself pull away from the world because I am too hurt and scarred to look anyone in the eye right now and be decent with them. My body is restless with all this envy and hate and betrayed feelings inside of it, I shake at the very thought of you. A dream haunting me over and over. But I do not hate  them . How immature would I be. The fact of the matter is that I'm just a little teenage girl. I don't know how I feel. I just take 'em as they come and I realize that that's just not good enough for the world. But I will not try and change myself. Only time can change all of this, and I am willing to wait.  Oi. What a week. What a Christmas. I love all of my friends. Thank you for the advice and love you've given me. I don't know where I'd be right now without it, but probably not somewhere nice. Merry Christmas. Tell yourself "It could always get worse. If not, then it  has  to get better"

      A little sleepless. I dare not close my eyes, everytime I do so I see this image in my mind you made for me. I thought I was okay to write, but I shouldn't do this. Hateful, spiteful words will spill from these lips once so poisoned by your own.  Dead. Empty. Fin.

      I am nothing now. Sitting in white. There is no color, no pigment. The only hint of a sound comes from an unknown faucet. Drip, dripping. Dripping blood from my vains filling this void with what once made my very heart beat. Now I stare blank. I dare not move, the arrows are pointed directly at my chest. I only gaze, blink, barely breathing. An arrow flies at me, pinning my arm to the wall (an apple in my mouth, a target painted on my body). I do not flinch, for I have felt this sting before. The urge, an urge to see the stars is quickly shattered with another pointed blow, this one to my leg. I am seeing a pattern now, they'll kill me slowly, I am their pig. Another arrow is let loose from the bows, then another and another until my body lies limp. This deathe sentense is a beautiful one. Here I am, these things killing me are the only things keeping me held together, as I look at my murderers, their eyes cold and black, my sickened face mirrored in their eyes, these are those I have loved...

       "Sweat'n for the Oldies" yes, an  ooooold  one:   Saturday, June 21, 2003 I am hanging suspended in midair. Like a puppet, my arms and legs dangle loosely. Exhaustion drags down my eyebrows and the corners of my mouth. Darkness flows around the contours of my body, avoiding my skin, It seems that nothing wants to touch me. In an instant, my left arm whips out. My right leg kicks at the emptiness. All of a sudden, my arms and legs begin to scramble frantically. My lips and eyebrows turn upward, energized. Around and around I twirl until the darkness begins to whirl with me, losing its round shape, oozing, splashing, jetting me forth. In the soft light of morning, I am born. Dancing through the air, my movements are delicate and graceful. A welcoming sparrow pecks me on the cheek. A butterfly caresses my lips with its wings. Gnats, June bugs, and dragonflies dip down to taste the sweetness of my skin. I am wrapped in wings. It seems that everything longs to be near me.

       There's a pain in my stomach, and a hazy rain. And I stumble to get myself up again...  Today, Yesterday. Breathtakingly crude. I don't understand. I don't see why Josh had to go. I want him to stay here, we had so much fun, he was always there. Smoking, talking about our crazy things. Sitting on Derek's backporch sharing a ciggarette enjoying life and all at the same time hating it. But it was cool, cause we all did together. It was in unison, a joint effort.  A good friend.  "CH". "You  would  say that." Love you, kid.

Try and bring me down, I feel this is the right way. You don't know how difficult it was today.  I'm sick of fucking rhyming and everything is out of tune. So go to hell, you fucking jerk..and blah blah blah...um, June.      Blasted poets.

You guys make me so happy and ..And I don't ever want that to change, no matter what else happens [or doesn't happen]. I don't ever want my friends to be sad, or down, and just..you all mean the world to me. [Even those of you that aren't supposed to.]  THank you, and goodnight.

       "hello beautiful"  (i need this)   but she said not a word, just smiled. and she thought he knew just what that smile meant, when she leaned back on him (a night well spent) but i think it was the moment and nothing more at all shes still thinking over and over: "I will FALL. I will FALL."

And as I reach for them, you laugh in my face 'cause I'll never make it make it away from this place.  But you, you have touched them many, many a time. And what once was a beauty seems not so devine. Still you discard his romance holding me to the ground singing, your pretty voice such a pretty sound..  But you weren't singing for me that, I see clear. For we'll never relive our old affairs, my dear.

       A Kade.  He's losing faith in the stars what has this world fallen to? A beautiful boy with a beautiful heart. How dare you, hot sun, corrupt his fine eyes. Don't you know the moonlight is his heaven in disguise.

      Is this a bad night or am I just dying? We got in a fight cause he got caught lying. And all this time we gave up trying. For what? Who's to say, who's denying that what we had is multiplying? What are these curious thoughts signifying? And how much time is worth your buying when all she does is sit while crying? Things would be fine, yes, things would be flying. And here I sit, "sighs" and "why" ing..  [Late and no one is awake. Why am I so wired? 'Tis another NoNiNdUcED high I have not felt in a while, not the same as the others, no. I dislike(/enjoy) these omens. I do not wish(/ I beg) for things to happen. What a shady girl, what a shady facade. That is, if everyone didn't expect just that(+ a little more) of her..

       These grass stains on my knees, they won't mean a thing..  True, young boys must grow into big boys, but not through corruption, I don't think so anyway. It's getting late and I need some sleep, I just thought I'd put my two cents in before bed.  Oh, and I was  so  happy to see you two. Oh, and jealousy is  stupid , concentrate on the bliss.

       how's  that  for controversy?   I LOVE people's petty minds. The way we think amuses me oh so dearly. Our train of thought goes as follows: 1- We see a boy and girl, linked arms walking down the hallway. 2- The boy walks the girl to her classroom and they stand outside for a while chatting before the bell. 3- We immediatly invent this supposed relationship between the two of them. [I mean, c'mon. What members of the opposite sex link arms and walk eachother to class if they aren't dating!] 4- We proceed to go as far as to  ask  if they are dating.  ::whistles::...

       Tell me your secrets Ask me your questions You don't know how  lovely  you are...    ::sigh:: Love. Love is a many, splendid thing. Waiting, it seems as if we're always waiting for Love to come to our door in the pouring rain and kiss us on the lips and explain where it's been all our lives. But that's not how it is, society has created this ideality of what we are supposed to feel, how Love is supposed to be. This is the very thing that is so confusing about Love. It comes in many ways, many forms. It's not like the movies or storytales. Love continues to change for everyone that endures it. Sometimes it's cold. Sometimes you're left alone without them. It is never all smiles all the time, and what makes it that much more splendid, the ones that can make it, the ones that can live through the bad and learn to focus on the laughter, well, I believe that that is the most beautiful accomplishment in the world. Maybe all we need is not love. Maybe two people cannot live off of eachother's air, and if there is no ideal lifestyle in place, there can be no successful Love. But this is not my way of thinking. I'd like to believe that two in love can live somewhere far, far away. Living only for their other's smile, only for their voice, only to make their other's life worth.   Mmm, picture it. We're under the sun, on a towel on the beach somewhere in Cali. The water's beautiful, just look how everyone's smiling. I look over and so are you, and I wouldn't rather be anywhere else in the world.  That's how it feels everytime. That's how I always want it to feel. Sincerely,  the Hopeless Romantic.

       Where is the kid with the chemicals? I've got a hunger that I can't seem to get full I need some meaning I can memorize   And the phone's ringing and the band's leaving Let's just keep touching, let's just keep, keep singing. But you, but you write such pretty words But life's no storybook Love's an excuse to get hurt And to hurt, do you like to hurt? I do, I do, then hurt me.  Hm. Around 12 days left. As much as I hate to say this  [it's exactly what they want me to say]  Don't skip school, it isn't worth it.  Oh, and apparently, I am a little girl because I don't like authority. I like to make my own decisions and I don't believe in anyone looking down on me, telling me what I should and shouldn't do. I have common sense, I have human decency, I know what's right and wrong and it should be my prerogative to decide whether I wish to 'conform' or not. See, these are the thoughts that get me in trouble. 'Cause when I'm in a bad mood, it's me against the world and I could give a fuck about any other person that came along. So how do you change your beliefs if you still believe them? ALL I know is that I cannot be grounded anymore. Not only is it affecting my home life and my friendships..it's affecting my relationship and that just won't fly.   All your love, all your love is gone, so sing a lonely song..

Did you say this to her? Did you touch her like this?  I swear to God this is eating me alive. I try not to dwell on what they say but it's EVERY DAY.  [I love you..]

       THE MARS VOLTA!   Is it unhealthy to sit in the same place for over 4 hours straight? Like a computer? Or for that matter, a home? No, no I don't think so, sounds to me like a waste of a perfectly good Saturday. Yes, yes indeed.  Waiting for that boy to come over, seems like I'm constantly waiting for something or another. Blah blah blah wait wait wait. You'd think with the amount of waiting I endure that I'd acquire some sort of patience, ah, but this is not the case! No patience what-so-ever. And we are out of Coke so I am forced upon Sprite. Boo Sprite. I think if Sarah was here she'd throw a fit.  In any case, this was my day, slow, boring, yada. Tomorrow will be filled with church, ciggarettes, [i like those words next to eachother, muaha] the boys, and fun fun fun!   Sing me something pretty I'll watch your lips part in the dark I want a sunset serenade come steal my heart..

       I can't imagine all the people that you know and the places that you go when the lights are turned down low..   Two little names on a wall and I fall to pieces. I hate to be rational, but it was just a reality-check. I mean, right there in front of everyone, everyone fucking saw me when I saw it, and I could feel him holding his breath wishing I didn't, but I did. And I wonder if it will ever go away? Will this be in my head forever? Always looking over my shoulder, always feeling 2nd best...   It's to dying in another's arms and why I had to try it..

       YOUR AURA IS PURPLE!   With you one look, just one look and  everything  is s  ha   TT  e r ed..  Mmm. I realize I don't explain things much. That's not a very good habit to be forming, now is it? Parents can be ruthless, completely unbarable for no apparent reason whatsoever other than to aggrivate you. Spending about 5 hours on worthless cleaning is not the way to go, I wouldn't recommend it at all, at all.  Aaand then there's something I've been meaning to write. Lately I've been slightly..okay a little more than slight..insecure about a few things. This feeling is completely rubbish and I do not condone it! But in any case, it is still there and I would ask of you not to frown upon it as much due to the circumstances. *Speaking of those circumstances, it's just difficult, okay? Being with you..which is spectacular..and knowing that you have done some of the same things with her, said some of the same things.. it's just literally heartbreaking, maybe it'll feel that way forever..it's just not a comfortable situation and I do not want to think about it. So in the mean time I shall force it out of my head as best as possible and try and avoid conversation about such things.  That is all for now.  --She kissed as if she, alone, could forge the signature of the sun-- And I love you..

      There's talk that in the future, every U.S. resident will have a National ID Card with an individual National ID Number, which will have all your personal information stored on it.   A way to crack down on terrorism or an excuse to put Big Brother in office? You decide.   Operator : "Thank you for calling Pizza Hut. May I have your national ID number?" Customer: "Hi, I'd like to place an order."  Operator : "May I have your NIDN first, sir?" Customer: "My National ID Number, yeah, hold on, eh, it's 6102049998-4554610."  Operator : "Thank you, Mr. Sheehan, 1742 Meadowland Drive, phone number 494-2366. Your office number over at Midtown Insurance is 745-2302 and your cell number's 266-2566 . That's you?" Customer: "Where d'ya get all this information?"  Operator : "We're wired into the system, sir." Customer: (Sighs) "Oh, well, I'd like to order a couple of your All-Meat Special pizzas."  Operator : "I don't think that's a good idea, sir." Customer: "Whaddya mean?"  Operator : "Sir, your medical records indicate that you've got very high blood pressure and extremely high cholesterol. Your Private Health Care provider won't allow such an unhealthy choice." Customer: "Damn. What do you recommend, then?"  Operator : "You might try our low-fat Soybean Pizza. I'm sure you'll like it." Customer: "What makes you think I'd like something like that?"  Operator : "Well, you checked out 'Gourmet Soybean Recipes' from your local library last week, sir. That's why I made the suggestion." Customer: "All right, all right. Give me two family-sized ones, then."  Operator : "That 's quite a bit for a family of six, sir, especially with your daughter's thyroid problem; but your total is $49.99." Customer: "Lemme give you my credit card number."  Operator : "I'm sorry sir, but I'm afraid you'll have to pay in cash. Your credit card balance is over its limit." Customer: "I'll run over to the ATM and get some cash before your driver gets here."  Operator : "That won't work either, sir. Your checking account's overdrawn." Customer: " Look, I'll borrow the money. Just send the pizzas. I'll have the cash ready. How long will it take?"  Operator : "We're running a little behind, sir. It'll be about 45 minutes, sir. If you're in a hurry you might want to pick 'em up while you're out getting the cash, but carrying pizzas on a motorcycle can be a little awkward." Customer: "How the hell do you know I'm riding a bike?"  Operator : "It says here you're in arrears on your car payments, so your car got repo'd. But your Harley's still paid up. Customer: "@#%/$@&?#!"  Operator : "I'd advise watching your language, sir. You've already got a July 2006 conviction for cussing out a cop." Customer: (Speechless)  Operator : "Will there be anything else, sir?" Customer: "Yes, I have a coupon for a free 2 liter of Coke".  Operator : "I'm sorry sir, but our ad's exclusionary clause prevents us from offering free pop to diabetics."

       The crowd gasps as they round the corner...   bad actors with bad habits. some sad singers, they just play tragic and the phone's ringing. and the band's leaving let's just keep touching. let's just keep, keep singing. I NEED SOME MEANING I CAN MEMORIZE   The sun is out today. Without the breeze, you'd think it Summer. I feel accomplished, we saved some lives [with our little petty charm]. And lately I've been in love with the day, so I can be with you and stay awake..But when I dream you seem to fade.  Funny how tables turn, can we ever learn to not be afraid? A promise not to lie, not to hurt... sincere as ever.  I have to close my eyes, this isn't real Can you believe how  good  it feels?

       And the race begins..   I  was just guessing on numbers and fingers pulling the puzzle apart questions of science, science and progress would not speak as loud as my heart come tell me you love me come back and haunt me oh, what a rush to the start..   Maybe we have changed. Maybe nothing is ever the same. Maybe this will never work and we'll prove them all right. But I know how I feel, I know how I feel with you, and I know that hasn't changed. And even though we may be two different people now, and might have forgotten all the things we once knew, maybe there is such a thing as 'meant to be'. Maybe there is such a thing as You and Me..

If I've never played the fool, I don't know what this is. Why should I fall for one stolen kiss?  I need to not dwell *swimming a month in hell* and I'm terrified of reoccurring infidelities. Why are you even here with me? 		[if that's what we call it]  Well I love you so I'm playing the charade. I'm getting what I wished for [right?] So why complain?

And I'll stare off to the darkness, to find us a kingdom, just kiss me before I go]  Sad to have missed Round 2. Dad and I had a heart to heart in the early morning hours driving home.

       Breeeathe, breathe in the aaaair..   Interesting evening. All familiar faces, some worth looking a little more into. Couples kissing on the balcony. Drunken girls are all in love. Ciggarette smoke along with winter breath, the house is smogged with another. A few cans lying around, mostly bottles clinking. Walk up, two doors are locked, the host is down the stairs. Who cares about the time, just one more drag. Coming and going and back again, the English accents are all the rage. Looking for you, I guess you decided not to come. Was the last time we were here together the night that started the summer? You probably don't want to be reminded, I understand. Now this other one, the one she left behind, I do say, lingers in my mind...  *

We won't care about that, look how cute the kids are. Your dead-beat job, but you'll make it to the top soon. And I have writers block, little poems on napkins everywhere. And you'll say I'm beautiful, and I'll think you're witty. And for vacation we'll run to the big city. And we'll own so much land, and have so much money. Wouldn't that be perfect, honey?  With not a care in the world, it's summer everyday. And no stupid bills to pay. An unconditional, thorough kind of love, this shit won't fade and neither of us would have it any other way. Walk outside, the sky is sunny Wouldn't that be perfect, honey?  The sunset through the window, aray of colors in the clouds. Laying in the sand, laughing outloud.  Wouldn't that be perfect? That would be so perfect, honey.

       I..don't ask why I...just fall into the meadow..  This thing over me, it sure does smell of you. Ciggarettes and your skin, the sweetest scent.  I hope this is a phase. I hope.

       Pardon me while I burst...  Not what I expected. Not sure to how to...take this. You, I love you. You're..you're so adorable. Go to pick her up, awkward silence. Get back and you cuddle up, leave me stranded alone. I wish this wasn't so strange.  I hear things, things I know are true. Why does "i love you" mean nothing to you!

      Fresh.  Now the tree is naked and bare. Like my heart and your stare. It's easy for me to remember the days in bed, playing with your hair. Coldplay in the air. The sound of heartbeats spelling out our names and perhaps this is so tragic 'cause I never had as good as you and now I know how bad it can be My god, this is killing me.  And whilst the poets make their money on heartache and things like these I will write about you and me and how Perfect can seem hidden with stupidity.  But I'll tell them, I'll say, "There's always a day where you're forced to grow up where you're forced to move on to walk away." "Cause hindsight's a bitch." That'll be my catch phrase. And there's no going back, it all goes astray  Heavenly prices to pay...

       ['tis a week or so old, and i just found it, enjoy:]   I'm flying on empty and everything's a blur. At least now when I think of you I won't have to see her.  With these over my eyes, no one can see my pain. I'll tuck my feelings away  'Cause being o p e n with you did me no good at all. So I'll fully induce, you can watch my fall.  And life's a bore when you're being a whore. And nobody calls when you aren't around. And my world seems to have turned off it's sound.   (attack on the senses!)   Looking at you now, not a one of us smiling.

       Shrug off the other boys 'cause they don't compare. Believe in that one boy even though he's not there.   Dug up a very old CD. One I made for a romance growing older by the day. Oi, I listened to this thing every night before I went to bed. And I remember telling myself, "This is..this is beautiful. A love like this can't be real..I don't ever want to lose this..ever." Aye, that was a mere 4 or 5 months ago, seems so far away. Even now as I think I'm growing up, and learning the ways of the world, I find myself more naive than ever. Knowing not of these things I feel or how to cope, how to go back. The little girl in me still wants to believe we  can  go back. But..but we can't. No, no this is how things are. To sleep to the sound of nothing, and to wake with memory of the emptiness of my dreams. In all of this void I can see happiness. I can even outstretch my fingers and practically feel it. But it is not in me, it is in the eyes of all my friends, and those of whom I love [who I couldn't make as happy.] Please let me believe that half a year of my life was not a charade, something worth throwing away.  Stupid. Stupid dwelling little girl. Stupid me. Stupid heart. Stupid memory. Stupid pills.

       ^ A Certain Collins' Birthday ^  My little girl is all grown up!   ~on a different note~  "I didn't call 'cause I know you just hate when I'm on something and I call." Or maybe you thought it more important to worry about her rather than dying ex girlfriend? Yes.  Meaning less  and piti ful(l) , tables turning everywhere. Stupid girl, stupid pill, boy who left her lying there.

       Flutters and an Empty brain..   One hundred and ten dollars. That was the most hectic night EvER and I hate it so.  You left me there to shake and cry and die, you lied to us so you could go have a little fun with the girlfriend. And you wouldn't even let us meet her.  Low. Blow.

      The skies were bleeding.. the music was up screaming, pleading boys..LET ME GET A DEAL  Let's leave, I need a cigarette.. James house to jam out. "Simple kind of man" all in unison And Zachy and Cory.. Singing, smiling..singing out to someone something in the air, gin and coke and rum and champaign singing at the top of your lungs, Steven you looked so happy Like a rock star in our midst, ladies and gents these people are beautiful. Look at the way they smile.. look at the way they love the music..  The way they make us love the music.. Singing, smiling..singing out to someone..

       So please, please, I'm running out of sympathy. I never said I'd take this lying down.   Hm. Vuh vuh valume. Kind of like VACCUM. Only..not at all. Sitting at home on this Friday night is such a drag. I've got a tripping boyfriend..and thuurs a sober girlfriend.  Weak.   I think this is the last night we'll be keeping secrets  Trip..roll..sip......I bet your nose hurts, sorry for hitting it  It's to dying in anothers arms ..all over the house You're coming over? Promise? Swear you'll hold me in your arms Not in front of the kid  The tree is burning and yellow The sun has bark and leaves  WHat would happen if everything you knew or thought you knew fell apart right in front of your eyes  What would go through your head what do you think you'd of said if she tore up your letters and they set burning, aflame at your feet. You're lying aflame at her feet.  She tried heroine. Too many firsts were with that woman. How could you fall for anything else but us? How could you come back after everything we said?  Wishful thinking with the worst intentions   How come you always smell the way I want you With perfect skin and deepsea eyes I dive in with all of me Losing myself in all that you are  Sex becomes a love poem I LOVE it I LOVE you, right? But what comes first, man? You going to suck my kiss or make a fist or hit the bottle or off with your friends?  There are timberwolves at New Jersey.   Dude, do you realize that when we look at the world everything..nothing merges it all contradicts Mommy takes a drag while lecturing healthy lungs.  You have it or you don't  DONT YOU? WELL?? DON'T WE?!  TriPpInG bOY..where are you I type I type you lie you lie there waiting  literate and stylish, kissable and quiet, that's what girls' dreams are made of  lying, lying on the floor in a puddle of sin kick the grass cause she left ya kiss the air cause she left ya she left ya she left ya   wait they don't love you like i love you   I'm coming down. Down down down. Where is he to bring me all the way up..Mmm higher.. Mmm harder..  footer:  N  O  O  N  E  H  A  S  T  O  K  N  O  W  A  B  O  U  T  T  H  I  S   my fist vs. the bottle.

       "You have a foundness for stars. But it's weird, like, they fit you if that makes sense"   I found a ring on my middle finger. We're gonna be rich someday and I'll buy you a personal jet. It's not my fault, okay? Something about your eyes makes me want to promise you everything.  But I guess we'll end up in the slums if we really ever end up at all. Maybe we'll slip away, but somehow I see myself with you right now and forever until whenever then.  A phone call to a friend in Okla. To see about some activities Forced apart for a year... the 17th year of our lives spent apart and afterwards not another second.  ::sigh:: This is such a buzz kill..

       She said she'd wait for me, but I can't make her see, that she's called to other skies, I can't be her place to hide.   "Embarassingly Wasted" is what they said. Punching. Floor surfing. Shot shot beer beer. Cigarettes..here, here..  Today: Downtown, 5 hours early. Halcyon Tragedy..badass drumming. 7$ pizza..only got one piece The Big Win, I hope you make it. "You take everything too seriously." Fuck yourself, but good job playing.  Come home: 5; they leave 2 hours later.  I saw a sign downtown with the word "  BOOBS  " written in large, bold letters. I'm going to miss you, Austin, Texas...

      Just to sit and listen to the music. Let it set the pace for my every heartbeat. I find our lives revolve around such moments. Waiting for that instant where.. Between lips you can't see but you know them by heart and legs between the sheets whispered promises, hands gripped tight as it feels so good where you look into your lovers eyes and at that exact second.. the music picks up, your pulses quicken and no one in the world is breathing but the two of you   ..Love you, baby.

       Don't try to get it.   Talk 'cause you have nothing to say I'll show you my blue side Where is my mind? Back at the car next to the cigar.  Change positions 'cause "that's what it's all about" Don't 'x' the box Be careful with that yay I'll call you tomorrow Don't be such a stranger. Toy with your anger.  Put down that meteor The end is coming, and, and. But where will I hide the pipe? Turquoise ring, stars that sing.  You laugh like a duck. I wanna dissapear in your closet. What a puffy jacket, Dude, he's throwing up in the front yard. On your car, next to the cigar. Don't be such a stranger, she'll toy with your anger. You left your turquoise ring, like stars that sing..  Will you be my Valentine?

       "Parting is all we know of Heaven and all we need of Hell." -Emily Dickenson   All my words are getting lost in these moments between the sheets and telephone rings. To be so attached, to feen for something this much, I bet you dream about it, you couldn't sleep without it..  And wanting to change is just part of the game. At the end of that cigarette you will still feel the same. Only a little less attached, a little off the ground. So just drive through the night, think about when I'm gone, and you'll sing us a song but it won't be for long. 'Cause you'll find you a star and like me, it is far. These words from me, keep them 'til I come home  Yeah, I swear I'll come home and you won't be alone, baby. And try not to forget those days in your room when we laughed and we smiled, babe, wasn't it perfect? There's 30 more minutes, her foot's out the door. Yeah, the bottle's half-empty, we've been here before Don't forget...

      This pen is faded. It no longer writes symphony. This hand, no longer steady, now shakes at every word uttered. My only motivation is the touch of your skin But I keep repeating that over and again  I want to write what they all will praise. I want to say something worth telling to your lover in the darkest of hours inbetween grins and your skin on the sheets. I want to tell everyone how love can really be Like the sky and the stars, every single shade, every texture I want to describe each aspect to let you know..to know anything worth knowing.  One day.

      A touch that you can really feel (And felt the flutter underneath your skin) The brokenness inside (You stood in glowing rooms) (The light dripping from both of you) As hope and less collide (And nothing since has felt as radiant or real) And nothing is real Love, there's nothing more I want Than just one night That’s free of doubt and sadness    (i love you)

      Today I completed all of my driving hours and in ten days I shall be a LICENCED driver. It feels so good saying that. I mean so good.  I am reading The Great Gatsby and so far I found a few parts that I like. This is one of them:  "And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on trees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer."   Beautiful. I absolutely love that line.  Baby, I hope you're having a wonderful time and maybe you'll come home with a half-way decent tan ;).    A  L  L   M  Y   L  O  V  E

      Imprisoned. Oklahoma for Spring Break. ::gunshot::  Everyone: I hope you have a great Spring Break and get lots of tan and be safe and for god's sake get throwed. Love, Bre.  Cory, I hope you are reading this because otherwise only everyone else will be reading it and it will have done no such good. At any rate, I am leaving for Oklahoma either Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning. My {nazi parol-officer} mother says you can come over before we leave..So I am hoping you will be back from Padre on Monday rather than Tuesday. This would make things golden, golden indeed. I love you and I hope I get to see you before 10 days from now when I return from {hell} Oklahoma. Sincerely, Your girlfriend.

       A new-found love for people.   Life can be so silly. So sweet. You could hate someone. You could never want to see them again. The problem could've been so big [or worn away with time] Yet all it really takes is an apology or a simple peace offering And most times, I've found, people are willing to settle differences, and be civil,  just like that.   Just something I'd like to share.  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  There's a dead-end straight ahead. Won't you take me home?

      F f L l U u   At least I think so.  I totally hate you today. First last night, what with seeing the ex-girlfriend for an hour then today, you're supposed to take care of me and what do you do? NOTHING.  Sometimes I ask myself why I put up with this.  She's not as "gross" as I remembered her to be--which made things a lot worse. Seeing her, standing near me, my boyfriend, my friends.  What a horrible excuse for a weekend.

       Then I see you standing there wanting more from me...  It's been a long few weeks, and I feel like there's so much weight on my shoulders I can barely breathe! I need some sleep, I need some motivation. I need a beer.  I wish you could see me loving you  Are all the little looks I give all that insignificant that you can't tell anymore? The rose in my cheeks when you say a word, is it that too trivial? Well, I am here, and I'm trying and I give and give and give. Shouldn't that count? Shouldn't that count for SOMETHING?  ...and all I can do is try

       Old friends. I have all too many of them.  Tonight, talking to my trusted friend, Zachary, the topic of our 'old friends' came up. I'm not sure when everything changed or when i moved into that "transition" everyone tells me about, but in any case, it  did.   I don't know, maybe I'm ridiculous for holding on to past friendships, but the truth is, they were good friendships. And it shouldn't matter how much either of us have changed because that's what it should be about--being able to be friends no matter what.  I guess that doesn't work out, but it feels weird seeing an old friend in the hall and just brushing passed them...  Maybe we could keep in touch? Pick up where we left off?   [whoamIkidding?]   --------------------------- Another note: Yes, tomorrow is  4.20  and I hope everyone enjoys their day safely and responsibly.

       one day we'll see the clear blue beyond the grey sky   this song. makes me think of the concert. Zachy. Bone. screaming, singing. you felt a part of something. something worth being here for.  I want to breathe again. I want to lie in summer grass, feet on the hot street, with a cigarrette in hand and the boys singing in the back. Warm days at Pendrey's, just laughing, living it up. "Remember when the AC went out, oh man, that was hell!" Yeah, I want to sit with a beer in hand and ride around in the 'Stang, Collins and I screaming at the top of our lungs "STUPID GIRL!"  I want to run away to Jareds, with Derek holding the baby ten feet away. I miss sneaking screwdrivers here and there. Speeding over speed bumps 'cause we were meant to fly. I want to hear Led Zepplin in the house and know that Steven is walking around in boxers singing along.  I want to be drunk at Bone's house. And trip over the stairs and Ivan and.. Have a Cory take care of me and fall in love all over again. I want to try all new things with wide, open eyes with him and new-found friends 'cause "that's what it's all about."  I want to stay here forever and build a life other than my parents. I want to go to school and become a writer, a novelist! Lately, I've wanted to go to film school too, become a DIRECTOR! I want to impress the world, show everyone how much they mean to me and, make all those that love be loved in return because that is what I've gained, and more I hope to learn.  Now another summer is approaching fast. It will be [mostly] filled with new faces, new adventures. New cars, new styles, new places.  And hey, I'll be driving by then. A shiny-new licence, a shiny-not-so-new car.  As great as this sounds, can't you ever have the past? Just for one day, can't it ever be as great as you remembered?  I don't know anymore. I love you guys.

      Just got back from Okla. It's weird, like two different worlds going back and forth. They will never merge. They will never connect in any way. ..still trying to decide as to whether that's a good or bad thing.  Today--boring at first.  I'd like to take this opportunity to point out an annoyance:  You hit on me. You make fun of me. You tell my boyfriend you liked me. You hit on all my friends [which disgusts them.] --THE LIST GOES ON AND ON--  That had been bugging me all day, so I'm glad it's out of my system.   Then the fun began:  Thank you, baby. T'was  amazing .   Good evening.

       Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs...   [she hits the lights, this doesn't seem quite fair]   What it really feels like... I could give you some of me, so you wouldn't feel so alone. I would run through the stars at all hours of the night screaming something wild, if that would make you smile. I'll carry on my back, all the pain on your shoulders, and I.. and I'll never look away, so you know your the only one We can lay on some beach in nothing but eachother, cause how beautiful would that be?  If we're all looking for something beautiful, this is it. It's these moments between the instant we smile and the instant we breathe. And for once it's like I finally see...

      I just finished Gatsby; marvelous. I've officially added it to my list of most favorite books. Today, I feel like I am on my own. Setting out for the grand adventure that is tonight. I haven't partaken in such festivities for quite some time now and I am eager to do so. Every minute, every second will be a breath of wild, extravagant air.  I hope for two months to pass slower than these turning skies. A change is in my own midst, and I'm afraid, unlike many things, this fate cannot be altered. It can only be lived, and learned, and I can only gain from this experience. I can only become wiser and worldly through my moves and travels. I will miss this place, this heat, this feel; the smooth drives along that favorite path with a hand out the passenger window  wav[e] ing to passers-by; the taste of a lovers lips, quiet and soft like whipped cream ( WITH  the cherry); the faces of friends, laughing, waiting for something beautiful--when they don't recognize the beauty in everything they create. But mostly I will miss the love; the love I have put into this place and the love I have recieved in return. I hope to keep this cycle up for years--upon years upon years-- to come.   "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."

       ...where the wind comes sweeping down the plains   Yes. The day finally came. I said goodbye to my beautiful Austin, and drove away to this new life. A lot of interesting things can happen once you leave  home , in my particular case: It rained for 30 minutes straight and I couldn't see a damned thing in front of me, my car began to stall, my gas card was denied, my car died and I had to leave it in some motel parking lot, and now my precious baby is in the shop. Not to mention I have no home for 30 days, I'm leaving in a furball-infested apartment complex until our house is ready.  I miss Austin already. The music, the faces, the stories. The fantastic drives around town [with no specific place to go] that I was just getting used to. Honest to God, I don't know how we're going to do this. For the next 11-12 months, I am dating a telephone. With a voice over 400 miles from here. I am hanging onto a memory, with every possibility of failing, but I want. I want and if we succeed in this, if we can do this impossible thing, then love is not an obstacle anymore. No, to me, this is the test. How long can we take it? Who's going to break?  Forever.  Ballins, Keyboy, Homegirl, Townsell, Chubbs, Big brother, Kade, Little brother, Zellar, KTQT, Lizard king, Frankus, Foreman, J's, Bloody Brit; all of you are my favorites, each one a different story waiting to be told...

       Remember that sonnet I told you about?    Blooming Realities  (spark of something)   It's the beautiful symphony of us Paradise of dreams I fall asleep to My secret insurgency that I trust Despite attempt, I fiend for something new. Put of my plans for a little phone call the Karma Police must be after me A little voice in my head, "you will fall" We're dangerous, chaotic and obsene. I know this feel, the fading in and out of conciousness and you and this love. I have a question, what are we about? And does it matter what we become of? I want to hear your melancholy thoughts Before they dissapear and all is lost.

          Why do our eyes burn to form a tear? And how do we differ between wasted years? Why, close to end, does it all break apart? Why is this weakening my lonely heart? Why is it that all I do is cry? Why, tell me why, all my questions are 'why'? When the storm rolls in, I will drown in the pool while I'm tramping around as they "pity the fool". So I ride the wind away from this place black smudges raining from my face... I wish you all well in my pitiful hell, as you're looking down the bridge in the place where I fell.

       P   R   O   M .  So, about that. It seemed like just another school dance to me. Everyone piled up into a gym-like environment, teachers (+ cops) all around, and a DJ that only played [ c ] rap  the entire time. I did, however like the mix of people there. It wasn't just one or two particular groups of people at Prom, it was everyone. I did enjoy that.  Also, I did not get intoxicated. I did not induce myself with any drug of any kind. Therefor I did not drive under the influence. I did not stay out all night. I did, however, go to one party, where someone handed me a beer at which point I proceeded to go home and crash.  On a side note, everyone did like absolutely beautiful. Those pictures will last me a lifetime and the limo was amazing. Although some hopes were let down, and despite Prom not living up to our expectations, we had fun because we were all together and I wouldn't of had it any other way. [Plus we all got to dress fancy!]

       Falling back to me, back to me.   Today I wrote a song called "Austin Love Song." I was  in a downright horrible mood when I wrote it. I'll put it in later tonight.  And the best part of my day: MY NEW STERIO SYSTEM. She's beautiful, I tell you. Beautiful.

      I feel like the other side of me is coming out, today. Like I can look around and see things that were not there yesterday. Like I can see you for who you are. See you for what I have loved, what I have hated. Not just you, but..but everything.  Transcend into another world Fall and fall and rise you will. Scream out loud until you feel what once connected now is not real. But, what is real? If only we knew, Is my upside-down vision too much for you? Cause it's not my fault that I can see with my mind See what you've all tried so hard just to find. In fact it's hilarious to think where we've been Swimming and sinking together in sin.   I don't really know where that came from, enjoy.

      Too many almost-wrecks today and yesterday. I'm beginning to get depressed. And I'm leaving. Too soon. It's all I can do not to just sit and cry.  I wrote a sonnet. But I'm just not in the mood to share any poetic nonsense right now.

       All I can do is just pour some tea for two and speak my point of view but it's not sane..   [I just want someone to save me. I'll always be there when you wake.]  As time unravels, this life seems to do the same. Things are fading, and I can see new beginnings in the distance but I'm not quite sure if I want to indulge in them. I like the old way. I like waking up to a hot Austin sun and riding around all day, just looking for somewhere to belong [WE COULD GO  ANYWHERE ]  Maybe my new horizons will move me. I mean really move me. That's what I've been looking for. Something or someone to touch me and...  ...forgive me for almost saying "have everything else fade away" I don't want anything to fade away. I want something to really move me and let me breathe in all my surroundings, everything I love.   That, my friends, is what we should be looking for. Why would you want "everything else to just fade away"?

       Mothers Day  Hm. Blogger seems to have readjusted a bit. This weekend was a blur. A lot of being smashed and rambling. Lots of rambling, indeed. There were a few words wrongly spoken and a few actions wrongly taken, and for those I deeply apologize. I hope they will not have an effect in the future.  Thanks to A. Price for letting me shack up with her this weekend. I truly had mounds of fun, and I'm sorry for last nights' inconveniences. A lot of love goes to that young woman.  So, I wrote my mom a simple mothers' day poem--  SHE CRIED  How adorable. Here's to you, mom. You're the shit:   The one who raised me day and day, with all the right advice to say. Now 16 years have come and gone, like beginning and end to a beautiful song. And no matter the friends and strangers we meet, it will always come down to my mom and me.   Muahahaha. Suck it.

       Damn that Theresa.   the OC. What a show. I must admit I've been indulging in it like chocolate. All of us, with our little remotes, sitting in the chairs infront of the TV as if they were showing Jesus or Porn. And to think! What a sick sad ending to this season. How the hell are they going to bring Ryan back?..Oh god. They had  better  bring Ryan back. But  without  that Theresa, thank you.  Wow, enough mindless rantings about television. Yesterday I got my  licence . Today I got my  insurance . Today I went and played with friends in my car and we made fun.  Tomorrow until Sunday I will be living at  the Price residence . Allyson and myself will, indeed, be participating in all of the girly, sleep-over activities such as:   Nails, Hair, Makeup, Facials, etc. Boy talk. Girl talk. Drives. Smokes. Etc.  My car is going into the shop tomorrow for my el systeme to be installed and ready by sunday/monday. I DO hope all works out well, I DO I DO I DO!  That's all.  Twenty two days until I shoot myself.

       Enjoy my English poem about Flapper Fashion in the 20's:    Stomping her feet when she won’t get her way A generation of babies, what more to say? Their parents were “squares” obsessed with “correct” Their kids getting off with their talks about  sex.  How did we let this happen? Taking swigs at the table? I thought  we  were wild, how are they able?  We just want to be heard, so we dance and we sing 'Cause when I'm dancin' the Charleston this dress has got wings.  And the boys, they all want them, 'cause they're not like their mom who waited in white in the corner at Prom. No, these girls have got style. Their hair is too short, their music too wild. And reasons for dancing and smoking are clear. Perhaps we all just need someone to hear. And until someone did, or until someone does They're Flappers, non-conformists, something like  us.

      There isn't much for inspiration in this town. I could tell you what I'm thinking, I could tell you how I feel.. The usual bland "I miss home" attitude is still intact. And for a few short days I actually thought I was finally where I belonged, that I met people who were a little taste of what I had to leave behind...   SHAME  on me..for trying to find Austin in this place. Their faces, their behavior  nothing  compared to Austin's. Not the feel, not the sound, not the music!  Merely faux images floating around still looking for a place to fit in. I've become part of this cycle..drifting from eye to eye trying to find where I fit in. Not out of insecurity, or even lonliness, no, but it is the largest cramp of boredom that leaves me searching for a friend. Even a friend whom..I may have no interest in what-so-ever aside from their complete lack of thorough thought that I enjoy noting.  A girl thinking in circles cannot be tied down..

I will miss you so when the distance grows & the nights are long & your scared at times & you wonder why... Take care & don't go too far, I will miss you so. I've looked into the sky a hundred times & I've seen the stars that shine so bright I'm sure that one of them is you, my friend. Watching & waiting & hoping that I'll be alright. So take care & don't go too far, I will miss you so & when the distance grows & the nights are long & your scared at times & you wonder why. Take care & don't go too far  THE ROAD BACK HOME IS SHORTER THAN YOU KNOW " - Moonpools & Caterpillars  [given to me by  Collins ]  ::sigh:: Missing you...
