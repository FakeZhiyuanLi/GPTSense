      Happy bits on the first day of the new semester koz of 2 reasons:  1. Scored a High Distinction for my last semester 2. Jeremy Parker's birthday and there was literally a cake! Coffee one at that!  Nyways, still waiting for the reply from Sydney University. Tomorrow's going to be the last day to know if any of us have made it to the top 3 spots. Fingers are all wound up like an old grandmother's panties.

      Huzzah! Have finally came up with an idea for my Major Project in the comin semester. It's taken me a whole bloody week to finally come up with somethin concrete. Have been thinkin of cockroaches the entire week and it's beginning to make me sick.   Considering that i've done something funny in the previous semester, I'll be attempting to make an animated piece that will be sad and touching. Will post the ideas up on the new blog i'm going to create to keep track of contents. Hopefully then, people will come in and tell me the bad the good and the ugly.   Kimi Raikonnen's FINALLY on pole position this weekend! HUZZAH again! how i've longed for this to happen. Lets wait for the race tomorrow and i really hope that it's not going to be another one two red finishes. Then i'd be totally buggered.

       "How on earth am i going to make this movie?"                              Sam Raimi(Director of Spiderman2)   Well, wherever on earth did he actually come up with the solution, it was amazing. The lives of each individual characters have evolved nicely over the 2 years. And it really shows us the weight of the burden that Peter Parker was destined to carry after that fateful day he became spiderman. You really felt for him when he decided to hang up his suit. And just as you get used to seing the old Pete Parker again, you see the burning flat, the bullies in the alley, etc. and deep down inside you'll go "C'mon Spidey, the world needs a superhero"  Altho the coming together of Peter and MJ was very well told, i felt that it would still have been better to have Gwen Stacy in the first movie and have her death in the fight between Spidey and the Green Goblin and then show the comin together of Peter and MJ in the second movie. But that might've been a little over the top in the movies.  whatever it is, spidey is a super-hero that was marvelously created thanks to Stan Lee & Steve Ditko

      Finally! sorted the problem. Just a stupid thing about blogger not wanting to call up the image files from my geocities webspace. How stupid and inconvenient. So it's not me not being able to comprehend the codes but something stupid. Now that's sorted...opens up a whole new world of personalizing... Not tonight tho. Tired as hell

      I'm stuck stuck stuck for ideas! Been sittin here going through 35 short animated clips that i've downloaded today (downloaded 20+ and watched 5 dvds of "Cowboy Bebop" yesterday)and i'm still faced with a very very blank wall. How in the world do you come up with an idea for a killer animated film in 1 week of holidays?  Imagery flits back and forth, teasing me, taunting me, knowing that they're too vague for me to reel them in and immortalize them forever in my work. Somehow i'm having vivid dreams about cockroaches. Cockroaches wearing crash helmets in little matchbox cars with bottle caps as wheels. Weird Weird. Just when i thought there was nothing weirder than cows wearing israeli gas masks tipping humans out of bed at night.   For the less informed, here's a brief explanation on what the term "COW TIPPING" is.   When a cow sleeps, it sometimes sleeps standing. And when the snoozin bugger is in the 'zone' its totally relaxed. Just creep up slowly to it and when you're about a few metres from it, charge straight at its side and shove it sharply in the side. The cow should easily fall over onto its side and as it falls, it wakes up, and in a state of bovine confusion some will let out a long resounding 'moo' as it crashes to the ground. You on the other hand should shimmy on out of there before the bastard gets up. That my friends, is a basic overview of what the term "COW TIPPING" means.  I've created an animated piece where this phenomenon is reversed. That is where the cow puts on a disguise, comes into our bedroom at night, tips our bed over and fucks off back to dixie. That piece has been sent to Sydney University for the  "National Student Film and Video Festival (NSFVF), for University and TAFE students in Australia" . Still waiting for an answer to wether or not my piece has been selected as one of the finalists. *fingers crossed*. I only have 2 more days to receive that notice and i'm virtually shitting bricks in anxiety.

      Was just browsing through photos that i've taken and came across one that struck me as a very captivating shot. It's a shot of the underside of the Sydney Harbour Bridge at Circular Quay from a ferry.  I've always had a liking for images of constructions like these with steel girders that seem to look messy and yet organised. However this one captivated me the most because the whole space seems to be intruded by the flag flapping in the wind which is something completely different from the cold steel. What's more, the photo was shot under very bright sunlight and i feel this greatly enhanced the imagery due to the strong shadows cast by the girders. Just my 2 cents anyway... Anyone else share the same views?

      Okay I'm now back in Melbourne but that one week away in 'Sunny Sydney' was good. It was very very good. You just can't imagine how it felt like to get off the plane in Melbourne and be struck to the bone by the chilly 5 degree wind. It's pathetic. I wish winter was over. I'm sick of wearing winter clothings. I'm sick of wearing shoes. Bring back the sandal season!  The screening was a little bit disappointing, and no i'm not being a sore loser or anything. I just feel that 'Motion Graphics' should be in a category of its own. I'm more eager to see an animated piece that displays animation 'craft' instead of automated movements in AfterEffects. Bollocks.  Nyways, it's back to work now. Have to do lots of planning to get some sound designers in for an audition. Gotta get focused.  I'd like to use this space to say 'Thank you Heaps!' to Lyn who was my host in Sydney. What would I have done without you. hmmm... nothing perhaps. Thanks for brining me out here n there, altho technically i was driving but who's complainin? Certainly not me. Thanks again.
