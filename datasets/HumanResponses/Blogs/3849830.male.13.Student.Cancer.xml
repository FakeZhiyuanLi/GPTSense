      katie and jake r boy friend and girl friend... u could say that they best of friends and even more than that... they both are my best friends when they  r away from each other but when the r 2ether they only hang out with each other they dont hang out with any other of there close friends... for example when we all (chris, james ,me, jake katie, kimmy , amy and anna)went camping 2 lion contry safari,and before james, chris, and jake got there me, kimmy, katie, amy & anna where going 2 go 2 the park on our scooters, katie saw the ardells camper coming. she turned around with out telling us she rode her scooter as fast as she could.  she jump off the scooter falling in the road hurting her self.  we all ran down there 2 help her but half way there katie looked up and saw that the ardells car was coming closer.  she got ^ and ran 2 the car just 2 see jake.  she did not even tell us that she was ok.  katie practicly broke here hip, she scraped both elbow. she did all that just 2 see jake.  they still r 2 of my best friends but they have gone way 2 far.  also on that trip they both ditched me, chris, and james.  they only did things 2gether nothing with us, and we all where very made.
