MY GOD the train was so full even tho i got on at tampines! and the train had this funny smell in it..=S haha.. got off at city hall and joined the rest which consisted of    sarahJ2, JJ,tiff,luthfi and fir .   haha..and tiff used her papaya spray again! hahaha..seriously i still tink it smells of papaya. =P    azri     arrived with a black face. he was pissed bout these ah bengs standing at the door of the train. blablabla. typical singaporean behaviour as he saed. haha...but quite true lah. singaporeans really dont have the sense of courtesy. *ashamed*   we went to grab a bite at delifrance after discovering that the Buger king queue was so long. hahaha..couldnt believe the crowd at city hall was SO crowded just to watch a 3 minute fireworks display. there was MASS jaywalking, which worsened the peak hour traffic situation, and the crowds were like bigger than that of the linkin park concert.=P headed in the direction of the esplanade next. wow..really power man. people crossed the road junction DIAGONALLY. and in masses. hahaha..like some kinda riot or something. we managed to settle down under the goalposts at the padang. *Junjie referred to it as the field outside the Supreme Court* hahaha..sarahJ1 joined us soon after and she too was complaining bout the kiasu-ness of Singaporeans. haha..well..the fireworks were due to start at 8 i tink, but the first firework only came at around 835. just after the 7-11 gang went to buy food for the rest of us! hahaha..managed to take some photos with my phone. =) too bad they werent as clear as i wanted them to be..=S hee! Fir took a really nice one with his digital cam. haha..The whole thingy lasted around 3.5 minutes. and followed by a total breakdown of mobile coverage. hahaha..we couldnt call out from out phones or recieve messages. can u believe i actually took 7 minutes to send a single sms out?=S we took some stupid photos at the padang and ended up with out hands legs backs necks and everywhere else itching like mad. hahaha..=P  we walked to plaza singapura next just to use the TOILETS. hahaha..sufian and i scared the shit out of JJ by hiding behind the corner. hahahaha..man, i cant wait for the next camp or something. he's scared of the tini-est things.=P hahahhaha..e went to carrefour to take a look around and i bought this weird tasting aloe vera drink with large chunks of aloe vera in it,. i actually bought the thing cuz of the big pieces of aloe vera. haha but by the time i could drink til there i dint have the mood to eat the aloe vera pieces cuz the drink tasted REALLy weird! hahaha..went home after that. reached pasir ris mrt around 1135 and i saw keith and yanru. hahaha..cool. thye went to see the fireworks too!  was so tired after that so i ditn blog.  anyway, went to my grandfather's house todae. so nice to see my cusins again. but i feel so old being among my cousins cuz im the eldest one. haha..the rest majority are still kids. hahaha..so i had to end up playing with them. ahahaha..lego. helped my cousin build this structure. made me feel 13 years younger..=P hahah! helped to clear the rubbish a few times. and went to be a labourer to carry drinks and food from the cars up to the house. haha..but it was fun. hahahah..came back home and slacked after that. man. better start on my bio tmr! haha..  enough for today! see ya..

      Hello all! i know there's no one added to this blog yet but yup. just made a new one under blogspot cuz i tot my xanga;s soooooooooooper boring so i needed a cahnge! well, still kinda newbie at this though..=S  anyway, i didnt have much time to update my xanga blog over the last week cuz i was so drained from school and CCA everyday..anyway, lets start from Friday then. Went to school on Friday wearing this Red 'Indians' Tee and my Black Quiksilver pants, and of course, my white adidas squash shoes. I met Piggy on the bus and she INSISTED that i was gonna perform some indian national day song on stage juz cuz of my tee..Once again, met DaQuan on the bus. 4 days in a row we so happened to take the same bus. haha..only today the bus was nbot double decker so we didnt sit at the usual place.=P  Alrite, the national day celebrations were a bore except for the Taekwondo performances maybe and the interhouse beauty paegent. lolx. what a weird occasion to have a beauty paegent.  Luqman  and his cheeky antics gave his house the win, of course. Now I know who was the one singing Hoobastank's the Reason So out of tune during the rehearsals. Luqman and his friend. haha..At the end of the celebrations everyone started singing national day songs..Saw Wadi being carried to stage by Hakim and another guy who's face was blocked. so we did the same. We dragged  Anand  onto the stage! hahaha..  Alrite, after the celebrations there was some kind of Lighting ceremony which we didnt see cuz the atrium was so hot and crowded. Crashed an ODAC meeting at 10am but found out that i actually wanted to go for the China Trip. haha though the pictures looked disgusting, i mean..how often would u get to go to another country to help out? haha..=P After the meeting the J2 ODAC guys went for prayers so   Me, Sarah J1, Sarah J2, Fathiah, Alex and Ziting   went to Tampines to have lunch first while waiting for them to finish and for tiffany and jj to finish their meetings. haha..actually supposed to go back to HSC as well but dint go..naughty eh. anyway, after that, Alex and Ziting went off and The Rest went home to change. hahaa..so i went walking round TM for about 40 minutes b4 Jj came to meet me. haha..Wow saw So many people there..  Shafiq, Ram Amin Jasdeep Yasin, Wee Keat, 'Aunty' and my sec skool friends  !=) Surprisingly me and JJ saw alex and ziting walking around so we went to play at the arcade. U noe this hockey game? yeah that one. Stupid man, i seem to have bad luck with this hockey machine,. Everytime i play at the machine my handphone gets spoilt. last time the screen cracked, this time the vibration spoilt! ahhhhh..  JJ and I Met up with Sarah J2 and Fathiah then we went to orchard where we were supposed to meet   saiful, tiffany, sarah J1, and sufian  . all at different places. well when we reached somerset MRT, fathiah and i went to have a cup of Maggi Mashed potato at 7-11. haha! then went to check out the movie times for the Village or the notebook. hahaha..Went to cineleisure first..while the rest was looking at movie timesm i stumbled upon this   Spiderman 2   game and started playing for around 30 minutes. Damn fun siah,. hahaha.,.i got past 7 stages then the rest dragged me away cuz we were going to the Heeren. hahaha..oooh yeah and we saw Gerald and the choir gang there.     *fast forward*     okay so we went to watch the village at lido at 730. Actually met Jia Wei but he wasnt watching the show so he waited outside for us *how nice* hahaha..azri hilmi and luthfi came late for the show haha..they came from the mosque and had to rush all the way to lido to catch the show. future sprinters for singapore i tell you.=P hahaha..well, if u didnt read the reviews bout the village but saw its advertisements, u'd actually think its kinda freaky scary show. But actually, its really interesting if u can understand it. Like azri saed, some kind of gp-ish sorta movie. Its hardly a scary show except for the sudden LOUD sound effects. hahaha and sarah J1 was like covering her face almost EVERY part of the show...ahhahaha..=P luthfi and i fell asleep cuz the starting was actually rather boring. slow moving movie but with a nice twist here and there. you'd never expect the blind girl to be the hero i tell you. hahaha...anyway, i rate this show 3.5 out of 5 stars. haha ..=P  After that headed to wheelock place for the toilet. hahah! but instead we stood outside chatting while some went in to enjoy aircon. hahaha..Went to the same 7-11 near somerset MRt to have mashed potato again and then headed home. A nice but tiring day..=)

      helllloooo!  ah..=) its been such a TIRING week at skool so far. haha..todae being the most excruciatingly painful n tiring day yet.=P I am flat out TIRED. Life's been sucha blur this week so far. Ive been sitting in lectures and tutorials just staring at the worksheet on the table and nodding my head but clearly im lost in my own world. dont know whats happening to me! really losing interest in studies alreadi..the only periods and long for during school days are..' recess' and 'lunch' and 'GO HOME'=P hahaha..if only there was school but a school just to have fun..=P haha..oh speaking of lunch. Me Gerald Jun jie Tiffany and Luther sneaked out to West Plaza to get some food yesterdae! so sick of the school food so we went to 7-11 and i got my fav mashed potato and my milo-freezz! wheee! haha..finally something good. but the period after that was some kinda dumb GP compre test..=S haha  oh anyway, about todae.. I seriously DREAD coming to school on wednesdaes. Though its a short day and lessons end at 215, there's practically nothing to look forward to in between lessons. Well, other than soccer which starts really late..=P haha..First thing come to school every morning i'll have to suffer the irritating-ness and *#&*$&amp;% of our 'beloved' biology teacher. grr. just speaking about her makes me fume. especially today. Me WenFeng and Xueli were sitting at the same bench, actually, we always sit here at the same bench ANYWAY. and our dear ms foo had to come next to me and make noise that im supposed to find a partner and that there are only supposed to be 2 in a bench. i mean. HELLO. firstly ive been sitting at that place all 8 months in MJC. Secondly, the neighbouring bench had Luther JJ Gerald and Joel crowded at the table and she still had to come over to my bench to make noise. grr..Another problem with her is that she speaks and tlaks way too much during our practicals. like cant she just leave us in PEACE to do our practicals instead of talking and talking and confusing us?! talking bout confusing and misleading. I asked her something bout the calculations for T-test on which values to use. She told me just had to use the length of the potato strips to count. and whats worse. i was gonna 'complete' my evaluation when she announced to the class that we have to use the  change in length of the potato strips. grrr...i swear i was THAT close to ripping my paper in front of her. she screwed up all my calculations. see, i told you you;d only get CONFUSED if u clarify anithing with her. ahh..and the thing that pissed mi off the most. Joel tried to counter her sarcasm by saying something sarcastic. Miss Foo gave him that look and saed "Dont try to be sarcastic to me coz i will always out-sarcast you'..I mean,..what type of teacher would sae such things to their students rite..I tell you almost everyone in the biology lab was like SO pissed with her just now. Ahhh Mr Yeow PLEASE come back to teach us. Im really beginning to HATE biology with her teaching..She;s the female equivalent of Mr Lam, our GP teacher in the 2nd term...or maybe worse.  Alrite. nuff bout that. i practically lazed through the rest of the day. still felt so irritated with ms foo.  Went on another 'secret mission' after school cuz i dint go with my class for Learning Journey. Yay im going with mr yeow's class. Then, it started pouring. Small droplets of rain turned into torrents of rain, with lightning and thunder. A THUNDERSTORM. i tot the soccer match would be cancelled. i got the stuff then went back home to get my PE shirt to lend to Lan.  Alritey i reached back in school. Had a match with the Gurkhas today. Prior to this, i never heard of the gurkhas before but man they are damn fit and fast siah. haha..im grateful that i managed to play more than half the match. was a great and fun experience playing at right back centreback and left back as the game progressed..hahaha...and i couldnt put on my bib properly. sigh. got injured once again. Some big guy trampled on my knee when i was going in for a challenge. man it hurts. =S sigh.. anyway, SOCCER ROCKS.  be back later..gonna study now..=)  Denzil out.

ODAC ended at 315 or so and by the time they FINALLY got cleaned up it was about an hour later..grrr..which meant that i was in the odac room for 6 hours or so. hahaha...never mind. we finally made out way to orchard, the area outside paragon where we were supposed to perform our Mass Dances to raise funds for charity. haha.. We reached there around 445 thus onyl danced for an hour or so. hahaha..We danced to Lou Bega's Mambo No. 5, Black Eyed Peas' Hey Mama, and Outkast's Hey Ya. haha..  Me, Alex Muhsin Luther Johnson and eventually Zhengyang   did some outrageously modified dance moves for the chorus of Hey Ya and everybody started laughing..ahhh so paiseh. Imagine doing some funny dance move in the heart of Orchard Road in front of your friends and some strangers.=S Geez. Cant believe we still did that. hahaha..was kinda fun lah. then for the mass dance {mambo} we started doing some retarded dance and the others followed..=P haha! damn sure gonna get teases by my soccer friends tomorrow.=P haha! oh well, too bad she wasnt there watching..=(  hee..

Tiff and I shared the aloe vera drink along the way. Yes finally i mastered the trick of getting the aloe vera pieces out without using your fingers.=P haha refreshing! Luther and i bought an apple each from Nicholas and his Citibank charity group for 2 bucks.=) *feel good* haha..ate the apple cuz i was kinda hungry anyway..=) hahaha..oh yeah then our group got split up cuz some walked too fast (the hungry ones i assume) and the others walked way too slow. haha luther and i were in the centre. seperated from the rest cuz we bought the apple. Hilmi and Luthfi went to the toilet to do some business..=P hahaha..Finally all of us met up at Wheelock place BK. hahaha..so hungry man..i had Mushroom Swiss. Den and his friend came to join us. hahaha..not bad siah. Den has a nice phone, [which as he says, belongs to an even nicer person.]..can play Tony Hawk proskater on it..haha! JJ and I were fighting over it on the way home.hahaha.. hahaha! Den and I sat at this table and the people previously sitting there left some chicken and nuggets. Den took and ate them. a leftover specialist. hahaha..=P oh and azri felt like vomitting. salleh and den tried to make him puke by putting disgusting things in front of his face.=P haha! In the end he only burped. =P hahaha anyway, we had some   Orange Julius & Dairy Farm   ice cream after   BK  . so yummy. hahaha..the person doing the ice cream dint quite like Luther and JJ i tink. gave them small ice creams.!After eating we went to   Kinokuniya  . haha..we found some 'Making out in Japanese' and VIetnamese and some other languages book. hahaha..damn funny siah. lotsa dirty translations inside such as "Itta" and "Reo Reo Reo Reo" wahahhaha.. can only remember these. Den can memorise the one in Thai. hahaha..walked around in Kino until it closed. haha..man i was like SO tired after the dance that i was just stoning as the rest walked around. haha..Luther and luthfi had the same look on. lolx..  As we walked back to Orchard MRT station there was this guy at some Pub singing Hotel California and Here Without You so we popped by to have a look. hahaha the girls were like mesmerized by the guy's voice sia./.hahaha! and that band played good music. haha..finally went back home. haha..as i was saying, Den lent me his phone to play games and JJ and I were fighting over the phone. haha..damn fun siah. hahaha..To Den, the phone is his 'walking FHM'.=P hahaa..i know why. lolx. Yay at least today there was someone to accompany all the way back to Pasir Ris. hahaha..Luther also came all the way back..haha..My mum fetched us and dropped luther off at his place. haha then i went home and slept like a pig. =P  and now im updating this blog. hahaha..one whole day of slacking! actually went to Downtown east cuz my old skool was having some kinda thing there but it was full so i dint manage to go it. then i went on a secret mission.=D hahaha..  alrite gotta go for dinner! =)    To Jiayan JW Ziting and Gerald: thanks for stopping by my blog! haha..=)      To Keith: Congratulations!=D      To Rocky: =) Dont stress yourself up alrite...
