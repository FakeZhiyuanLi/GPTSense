      For half the day I practiced a song that my sisters and I are singing at my Dad's 4th wedding Friday night.  The song is a bit ironic considering his track record, but what are you going to do?  I was pleasantly surprised with how well it went.  Now we just have to try it at the church with amplification.  Scary!!  It is mildy terrifying as I haven't sung in public for approx. 11 years.  I figure if I just close my eyes I'll be okay.  I am really dreading the whole weekend.  We have the rehearsal on Thursday night, rehearsal for a wedding my son is in at 3pm on Friday, Dad's wedding at 6:30pm Friday night, than the other wedding at 1pm on Saturday.  I won't have a minutes breathing space until Sunday, on which we are invited to my nephews birthday party.  Bleah!!!!  And sometime in there, B has to fix his bosses car that is apart in our garage.  I really do hate weekends like this almost as bad as Guard weekend.

      Today is shaping up to be an extremely frustrating day.  For some reason, whenever B has Guard Duty, the kids think that it is a good time to be their most obnoxious.  And to top it all off, my period is due tomorrow which cuts my tolerance in half.  I have been so exhausted the last couple of days, I'm not sure if there is something going around or if it just the 10 years of interupted sleep that is finally catching up with me.  I have no energy and all I want to do is eat.  I need to get out and do something.  Still mulling over the idea of a move to AL.  Sometimes the thought of starting over in a new place is very refreshing and at other times, terrifying.  Truth is though, I probably don't have the drive to move this whole family.  And I know that B is pretty happy right where we are, if he got a little better job we would probably be very comfortable, and wouldn't even be considering a move.  I've done so much work with tweaking his resume and getting it out there that every time he has an interview and it doesn't work out, it almost feels like a rejection of me.  Stupid I know, and he totally takes it in stride, but I am starting to get frustrated that people don't see his potential and qualifications.  Well, I should really get busy and get something done today, there is a ton of laundry to put away and maybe I'll bake something.  It is a gorgeous day out and not too hot yet, so it is great weather for baking.
