       yea.. i was really bored and this looked like something fun to do to hold my interest for at least an hour.&nbsp; so lets see.. my thoughts.. hmm.&nbsp; ok well for one thing i miss dance like crazy.&nbsp; i'm so out of shape it's gross.&nbsp; i tried stretching the other day and i felt like an 80 year old woman.&nbsp; not too pleasant to say the least.&nbsp; i miss my girls too.&nbsp; which sucks even more is that it looks like we're all going our separate ways in the fall :'(&nbsp; `tear     &nbsp;   another thing.. summers getting pretty damn boring for me.&nbsp; i mean the sleeping in and having no work isn't exactly getting old.&nbsp; but lately it seems like all i do is watch dawson creek and saved by the bell reruns.&nbsp; next&nbsp;thing you know i'll be sitting on the couch in a robe and slippers with a bowl of&nbsp;popcorn watching days of our lives&nbsp;*shudder*... (no offense mere).&nbsp; i just get that feeling sometimes like i'm just watching my life pass me by and not really living it.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   wow.. sorry this blog has been so depressing     &nbsp;   heres a hopefully inspirational quote for ur evening:&nbsp; "i can sum up everything i've learned about life in three words:&nbsp; it goes on"     &nbsp;   peace out!!

       it seems as if i've been doing that a lot lately .  stepping out of my comfort zone.. entering a new world of uncharted possibilities. it's a scary thing too, let me tell ya.  it all started on wednesday when i went to check out touch of class dance studio.  they were having an open house and me and jess (long) decided to see what it was all about.  its just that we were getting tired of elevations and being lied to and not learning what we needed to learn.  jody didn't run a professional business and we're sick of it.  debi and debbie ended up inviting us to take a lyrical class and a workshop with frank hatchett the next day at the studio.  i haven't danced all summer except for taking that class with mere so i decided to try it.       the class was incredible.  i realized how far behind i am in technique.  these girls are doing so much that i haven't even heard of.  the first class was very hard, while the second was a lot of fun and not really so hard.  but after 3 1/2 hours of non-stop dancing i was exhausted.  and i'm feeling the pain today.  i really like this studio and i think i'm going to try it out next year.  but it's a major step out of my comfort zone.        i hate to brag, but last year me and my friends basically ran the studio.  i mean we were the studio.. it wouldn't have existed without us.  we were there over 12 hours a week, helped teach classes, had real friendships with the teachers, and were in every other number in the recital.  we were the best in the studio and the younger students looked up to us.  i loved it.. it was great.  my 5 years of hard work at the studio had finally paid off and i had made it to the top.  but being the best in a crappy studio isn't going to get you far.  so next year it'll be like starting all over again.  no more best in the studio.. no more stealing the show.  me and jess are going to be the newcomers.  and it's going to be difficult but its the only way i'm going to get better.      so in a way i'm taking a big leap (preferably a jeter .. hah dancer joke ..) out of my comfort zone.  and it's really scary.  but i think that a big part of growing up is trying new things and not hiding in your comfort zone your whole life.  because your comfort zone is only so big and you have to leave it in order to get to the real world and live your life.      so i'm sure i have bored you with all this talk about comfort zones.  sorry about that but i do hope you've been somewhat inspired to take the leap out of your comfort zone as well.        on another note... I HATE THE DAMN SCHOOL... and they better frikin call me back so i can make a damn appointment to get this schedule fixed or else I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL ON AUGUST 30!!!  cause theres no way i'm taking 2 ap courses, hon chem, french 5 AND on top of that.. hon english so they better get that out of there and give me my web page design class or they are going to have one very angry student on their hands.. and they don't want that.        ok i'm bored so i'm just gonna keep going but u have permission to leave if you're bored.      heres a song i really like and i just need to put it in here:      you can find me   if you ever want again   i'll be around the bend   i'll be around the bend   i'll be around...      and if you never stop when you wave goodbye   you just might find if you give it time you will wave hello again   you just might wave hello again      and thats the way this wheel keeps working now   thats the way this wheel keeps working now      you can't love too much one part of it   you can't love too much one part of it      i believe that my lifes gonna see   the love i give returned to me      -john mayer for all those people who didn't know      ook i think i'm really done now..      peace out!      -j

       hello again!  i'm back with more stories of my life (hopefully with better grammar this time).  so today jess and i went out and ran some errands.  see we have nothing better to do all day then to drive from store to store looking for things her parents want.  and you can almost guarantee target will be one of those stores hah.  on todays errand-running adventure it was our first stop.  i splurged a lil and allowed myself to buy the spider-man 2 soundtrack which i might add is very good.. i recommend it!  listening to it right now actually.      so after target we had to go to home depo.  oh god.  me and jess walking around home depo looking for a hook.  thats right folks.. 1 hook.  like finding a needle in a haystack.  we finally found paul :) and he helped us find the perfect hook!  woot!  another mission successfully completed...      then tonight me jess and jennina watched freddy got fingered.  frikin hilarious if you ask me.  "daddy would you like some sausage?  sausages sausages sausages.." woo funny stuff right there.  anyways that was over around 10:30 and it was time to drive jennina home.  well knowing us we can never go straight to where we have to go.  of course not.  we have to go on a wild goose chase to find this kid thats at this girls house.  all we know is the girl lives in the seasons and her friend has a jeep.  so we enter the seasons and start searching every driveway for a jeep.  after about 10 min i see a jeep!  heres how the convo went from there      "hey theres a jeep!"   "his is dark green"   "it was dark... and it had a hard top"   "HIS HAS A HARD TOP!"   "and it was next to another car"   "she drives a cavalier"   "IT IS A CAVALIER IT IS IT IS!!!!!  ITS A CAVALIERRRRRRRRR"      omgg i was peeing myself.. although you prob had to be there.  anyways we make a sharp turn and start heading back and there's this kid we're looking for.. standing right in the driveway.  jess feels the need to start drag racing down the streets of the seasons.. jesus.. with no "oh shit" bar in the back i was flipping.  although when it was all over it was a good laugh.  we continued on to jenninas from there.. cracking up the entire way.  then we got back to jess's and i chilled there for awhile.. looking at old address books... "with pat..? lol" and "with katie the bitch" ... omg tooooo many laughs.      anyways i'm home now and yet another adventurous, however not out of the ordinary, summer night is over... *sigh* the wonderfulness of summer vacation.. which is slowly coming to an end *tear*      til next time,        jaimie      p.s. inspirational quote for ur eve..."life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away"         soooo true...

          ok so yes.. i realize it has been awhile since my last (and first) post... but thats because my life has been so utterly boring lately there's been nothing to talk about.. until last night!!      the concert was indescribable. there aren't even words. i'll start at the beginning...      i walked over to jess's house around 3:30 to go do some errands at target (where else? not with jess ur not goin anywhere else...) and then head over to erica's. only as jess and i were walking out the door to her car that i remembered "AHH SHIT THE TICKETS!" fortunately for me her house is a whole 30 ft away from mine and this wasn't a huge problem. although it could have been if mrs. c didn't say the word ticket (thank you mrs. c). so we journeyed out to target in search for a disposable camera and jess's work schedule. we drove out of the target parking lot around 4 o'clock, while blaring maroon 5 (hyping up for the show) and me putting down the windows POWERLY (hah. hah. ha...). so then we're stopped at the light at the 100/30 intersection and this guy drives by and shamelessly stares at us the whole time he's driving past. now c'mon guys.. don't make it so damn obvious everyone in the frikin intersection knows who ur lookin at.. we don't like being looked at like we're some caged lions getting fed for the first time in a week (yea i dunno that kinda just came to my head). anyways jess has this knack for yelling at people in traffic (you'd thought with all those road rage videos mr. fantazz popped in the vcr...) and she screams "JESUS I KNOW WE'RE HOT BUT C'MON!" well the second she said that.. this old guy in the truck next to us turned his head so damn fast he probably got whip lash. good lord... caged lions...       anyways i proceeded the rest of the way to ericas to give jess directions... with my hands. "turn" *hand motions left* "go" *hands motion front*... i thought it was successful until she missed a turn.. oh well. i tried.      we did safely get to ericas and from there went to go pick up her friend meg.. who is very cool and also a maroon 5 groupie (ha such a great word) like jess and i. the ride down was filled with lots of chatting and giggling. i mean what did you expect with 4 girls in a car going to a concert honestly? we realize as we get down there that i could be a prob if the ferrys aren't running cause of the hurricane cause erica has no idea how to get over the bridge. so just in case we get lost and need assistance jess and i proceed to put the cd jackets from the john m and m 5 cds in the windows so everyone knows where we're going and can help us get there! BRILLIANT! and to add a touch she writes "john mayer and maroon 5!" in blue pen on the back of a target receipt and puts it to the window... way to be ghetto.      fortunately the ferrys were fine and we got an early ferry across. made jokes at stupid things like the 'diet food kitchen' and '24 ADULT (not children people... adult) life preserver' signs, the RIDE THE DUCK boat that appeared to be sinking, and all the guys using the bathroom on a 5 min ferry ride. the one who went in as we were docking was even better.      so we made our way down to the gates of the tweeter center only to realize we had to wait an hour.. outside.. in the rain.. wonderful! it was made somewhat interesting by the underage drunk girl next to us who was laying on the pavement with her boobs popping out and all the guys stretching their necks to get a look. then there was the lovely butt crack episode.. i'll leave that up to your imaginations.      we made it in.. got some food (frikin $8 for a hot dog and bottle of water)... got our teeshirts (i'm going to live in mine).. made some quick bathroom runs and went to our seats, which were awesome.. center, 1st row of the second section, and surrounded by lots of hot guys ;). then a bunch of older (not to offend the rents) drunk couples sat behind us and said something about their kids and how they don't get out much in one big runon sentence. they were fun though.. and it was entertaining to watch them dance. hah      THEN it was time... the show was about to begin!! maroon 5 took the stage and omgg let me tell you.. they are amazing. the lead singer is just... *drool*. we screamed like lil girls at a backstreet boys concert (which i was at one point in my childhood so don't make fun!!). anyways they started with though with you which i def wasn't expecting but made me very happy cause it's a great song. after that all the songs kinda just ran together in one big blur.. and me screaming out every single word. but she will be loved was just *sigh* amazing.      the funniest part of the show was the 4 or 5 guys three rows behind us. they sat there (no lie) half asleep the entire time maroon 5 was on. they had to be so stoned and looked miserable. the four of us would whisper to each other, look (very discreetly) behind us, and then burst out into fits of laughter. like they didnt know we were talking about them. oh and then there was the gay kid and his girlfriend in front of us sucking face the whole time. jess cupped her mouth and said in her booming voice.."this is a concert, not a HOTEL ROOM"... that made them leave haha gotta love jess and her openness.      then they went off and people began setting up for john. well me and erica decide its time to go make a quick bathroom break. yea right.. so did everyone else. needless to say there was a huge line and as we're walking back to the seats we hear all this screaming and then OMG john starts singing! well me and erica take off running down the sidewalk in the dark going "WHERES THE SECTION? WHERES THE SEAT? OMG I'M GONNA FALL"... quite comical. we made it in record time to our seats though and could enjoy the rest of no such thing.       john did a good job. but personally i like maroon 5 better. while he sang all my favs, there are lots of other great songs on his heavier things cd that he didn't play.. i really was looking forward to hearing split screen sadness or wheel. but i am def not complaining. the whole let-me-and-this-other-guy-play-each-others-guitars-without-looking-thing was crazy cool. and let me tell you.. that guy makes some interesting faces when he sings...      and then to all of our disappointments.. it was over. *tear*. and we made our way back to dtown    in conclusion.. concert was aflsjndiLSFI#()P#*% nidsn... ahh the adventures of concert-going      yup that about sums it up      til next time-   jaimie
