        Hi Guys! well.. not alot has happened lately but i'm glad we don't have to go to school tomorrow. okay well yesterday, i went to MUCKLESHOOT CASINO on sat; not to gamble but to eat lol. Well... when we were there i had to use the restroom and right when i opened the door that said "restroom" there was this lady sitting on the toliet screaming at the sight of me. I said sorry and closed the door real fast and stood there all embarrassed. To make it even more embarassing my whole family saw what happened I feel really bad for her but it was her fault she didn't lock the door!   Today.. i went shopping with my mom we went to OLD NAVY. I got a couple of stuff.. after that we went to SEARS because my uncle bought a new lawn mower and he needed to put it in my mom's van. When we were there i looked at some clothes and tried them on. When I was trying it on, I heard my mom telling me we had to go so i rushed and little did i know i wore my shirt inside out. NO one told me about it so i was walking in the store like a freak. THIs one guy at the shoe section was looking at me wierd and so i was like "freak" and also this senior from my school was looking at me funny too so i was staring at him funny back. After shopping at Sears, my mom and I went to my uncle's house and i had to use the restroom and when i was there i saw a tag sticking out of my shirt and i was like "OMG!!!" and then i asked my cousins and my sisters why they didn't tell me that i was wearing my shirt inside out! all of them said they didn't notice but one said that they notice but they thought it was a style! WHAT THE HECK~!!   okay well that's all.

       >      What can i say... Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was bloody brillant!! i went to see it right after school on friday. Yes, that's right i saw it on the opening day!! (Thanks mike for the ticket) Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter had grown up soo fast and he is sooo cute!! Malofy too haha. okay well... the movie was all the great i give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important detailS!! Overall, the movie was good... I didn't really dress up to get the movie but i was wearing a Ravenclaw tie even though, I like Gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again like in 2 more weeks.   Movies I have to see this summer: -The Notebook (one of my favorite books :]) -Spiderman 2 -A Cinderella Story  That's all i can think of right now! Enjoy the pictures!!       Me, getting ready the wicked movie          A bunch of us waiting for the movie to start (bad pic of me by the way)         Me and my favorite character Sirius Black
