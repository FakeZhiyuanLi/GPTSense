						   THE Award for the Coolest SITE belongs to: http://home.comcast.net/~mjbrunner1/boyfriend.html !! IT's just bursting with the hottest guys ever set foot on the face of Earth.  Hey this include George Eads and he's not left out! This site's done up pretty well, has the latest info on most of the greatest (looks-wise) actors and bits on their history before they broke out into the world of TV and movies. and not forgetting, into the hearts of screaming girl-fans out there..  And Hey, how could I forget???!!! After many long and agonizing waits, I finally got my hands on the glossy, nevermind thin, illustrated books featuring SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS!! hoorah! But sadly, I'm giving one away to a friend, who's celebrating her birthday next week and a Sponge fanatic herself so that is why one of them books is going to have a new owner.  Alright, it is after all more noble to give than to receive.  Hopefully, she'll squeal her head off and set the story book next to her SPongeBob toy and what other memorabilia.. That's great, I like to make people happy whenever I can.  Makes you feel like the nicest person in the world.  No second thoughts here.  I practically dug out the entire shelf of Nickelodeon books and  my face beamed with pride and happiness after discovering my  treasure.  It's nice to see a familiar, yellow face peeking out  behind Eliza Thornberry and her "off" family.  Now, despite the fact that I spent about 80 bucks altogether on books alone, including "20000 Leagues Under the Sea", which I simply grabbed off the shelf and tucked in between my knees as I did the search for SPongeBob, I realize that buying on impulse can be quite addictive.  Here are the titles, the only ones I found pathetically bound together with a rubber band:  1) Level-2 Halloween Scare (for those below 8, I think) 2) Sponge and princess or something 3) Sponge Bobbini  Fantastic, the birthday girl shall have the newest, shiniest and funniest SpongeBob book as her present.  With that, I hope she's blown away (not by my giving her the best book) by the fact that such a book exists in Malaysia and not mainly in US and Australia and that she's got a perfect bedtime story every night without ever getting tired of it!

						   Stupidity has finally revealed itself in many ways, one of them is through my exam results.  Yes, and I have no one else to blame except myself.  My expectations were not very high really based on the number of times I've been out of the house to do kawad Bomba since the beginning of April.  Didn't emphasize too much on my studies that time because it was just too exhausting but equally fun to be drilled in such a way that your coccyx protests by giving problems for a freaking week.  Took it all in without any complaints as this is my last year in school.  So where will I be after this? Oh god, I hope not in National Service.  Just dread the idea of "community bathing".  I'd love to get someone's opinion on this.  Oh yes, I sidetracked on the subject of my exam results.  Nothing to boast about and I still don't have the feeling of urgency in my studies which proves why I am not performing very well at this time of the year when I really should start kicking my own butt.  Looking back, there were and still are, plenty of distractions-tv, radio, Spongebob, parties and now, it's the deadly procrastination habit that has to be rid of from my brain.  Ok, let me set this for the record: Now that everything has settled, meaning that the party's over , my only focus has to be on studies and from now onwards it's "  WORK HARD, HAVE EVERYTHING LATER".  To be more specific, almost 4 months to put everything in order and then it's a new, endless freedom to break free from this idiotic, monotonous school life that really bores me to death and doesn't have much to offer.  Still scared of driving actually but nevermind, I'll have to tumpang somebody or maybe just find the courage to face Friday night's traffic to Bangsar.  There's a perfect reason to go there, right Maha?

						   Oh well, today's the very end of my school holidays and I must admit, it has gotten a wee bit boring for me ever since I got back from Penang.  Crazy!!! Must've gained pounds living off durians, nasi kandar and air sirap for 4 days.  However, it never feels like a holiday once you have homework and all the crap that has to be completed.  Found a book heaven right on top of ChowRasta market in Penang. Didn't mind the stench nor the dusty air.  Well, the directions were confusing initially but I found it coincidently while walking back to the car.  The mamak guy, I tell you, he's the richest guy on the planet (brain-wise), ie if he ever got to read every single book he has collected for the past 12 years.  It was simply astounding to be surrounded be heaps and stacks of books that is at least 10-50 years old.  Time passed pretty quickly while I was in there rummaging for Lord of the Flies.  I knew I would never find it.  So far I've picked up about 20 books and I can only imagine if I had spent the whole day there.  And that was Monday afternoon.  Nevertheless, yesterday I had a blast at the 17 Summer Splash party with Maha all thanks to Z2.. YEAH!!!THANKS Z2! Lots of girls parading in itsy teeny bikinis and wrap-around skirts, lame contests and a handful of hot guys were spotted in the vicinity.  The theme was "Hawaiian" after all so it was all to be expected from the crowd.  Anyway, I showed up feeling like a fool and a nun in a sleeveless top and shorts but so what, I went there with a mission and I would like to think that I've achieved it.  Never guessed that the place was that happening among people my age. After having my heart beat twice as fast for half an hour, we went home feeling extremely happy and lucky and in total disbelief.  You could only guess....

						   Well, it's zooming by and 5 days had passed since the start of the holidays.  I've realized that time is just crucial as hell to prepare for the much dreaded exams but admittedly, procrastination is a natural part of the holidays.  There's a lot of distraction going on of which I'm always glad- phone calls, dogs and the TV.  Our movie plans for tomorrow didn't work out so we are all left to die in front of our maths and karangan books.  What?! Harry Potter? Oh sure, let's go. I'm ready anytime!  On the other hand, I know of people who pore over their revision books and past year questions religiously, which is of course, a wise act of self-discipline and time-management.  I'm truly amazed and there's always a part of me that feels that pinch of guilt whenever I spend my time frolicking on the beach or whacking some mamak food in a different part of the country.  I'm longing for some fun just to break the monotonous life here in the city because thoughout the damn 5 days, I haven't been out to do anything fun.  Okay, besides reading Spongebob in the bookstore lately..
