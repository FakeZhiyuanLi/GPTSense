      So tonight was my birthday.  It also happened to be the day of the 3Flow show at the Heart of Illinois Fair.  It went very well considering the circumstances and we got to play to a very large crowd that would normally not hear our music.  Overall, it was a great experience and a really good birthday.

      WOW.  That is about the only word to describe the trip to Michigan/Wisconsin last week.  Here is a brief rundown of the trip.  Saturday:  We ended up getting a late start and left town around 9:30.  Great driving weather and a fun trip all around.  A few miles outside of Wausau, WI we saw a bear on the side of the road.  First time I had ever seen one, so it was a pretty cool experience.  We rolled into Ironwood, MI around 5:30 and had dinner at the house of the couple that invited us up for the youth camp we were to attend. (Laura & Otto)  After dinner we headed to Lake Superior and had a bonfire and skipped rocks and lit off some fireworks.  It was an incredible experience.  According to my brother-in-law Jason, we also watched the Russian Space Station pass by overhead.  *rolling eyes*  We then got back to Ironwood to stay at a host home and I slept for about 2 hours because of the most obnoxious snoring from my brother-in-law in the same room.  Needless to say, I was a little tired.  Sunday:  Woke up at 6:30, showered and headed out to Ramsay to attend church service and played for offering for both services.  Before first service, Jason managed to back Otto's car out and break his frontend off by hitting a light pole.  Freakin' hilarious.  Anyhow, service was great but that was just a beginning to the day.  In the afternoon we headed down to the camp which was back in Wisconsin.  We got there and took in the beautiful scenery before unpacking and getting setup for the evening service.  Service began around 7:30 and lasted till around 10PM.  It was incredible time of Worship and the Word from LP was life-changing.  Several kids came forward and got saved or rededicated their lives, which fulfilled the entire purpose of our trip.  The rest of the night was a blast hanging out with the kids and getting to know people.  Monday - Wednesday:  Cold nights up in those parts.  Mosquitos the size of helicopters.  Shaving cream everywhere.  Awesome services.  Incredible Word.  Awesome people.  Service on Tuesday night was a breakthrough.  To sum it up, it was life-changing for myself as well as for most of the kids.  As much as I missed my wife and little boy, the trip was well worth it for the impact it made in my life and the lives of the kids there.  Side note:  Wednesday Jason and I went fishing and I had either a Pike or Muskie on my line.  Pulled our canoe to the middle of the lake and ended up breaking my line after about a 10 minute fight.  ARGH!  Thursday:  Left at 9:30 in the morning.  Lots of pictures, hugs, and some tears.  We compiled an email list the last night, so we can keep in touch with the campers.  Took off and made pretty good time on the way home.  Around 3PM we received a call from 99X letting us know that the band we were supposed to open for Friday night was not going to make it for the show.  Therefore, we were asked to extend our set from 30 mintues to 45-60 mintues.  Talk about a little bit more pressure. Anyhow, we rolled back into town around 7:30 and I got to see my wife and little boy again.  It's great to be back.

      Today my son is 9 days old.  What an incredible feeling of being a father for the first time.  To hold your own child in your arms is a miracle.  God has blessed my wife and I with a healthy, beautiful baby boy and I am in awe.

      Just sitting here at work missing my wife and son.  It's crazy how much I miss being around home after having a week off.  I leave for Michigan on Saturday morning and I'll be gone almost all week.  It's going to be tough for me, and I'm sure it'll be especially tough for Mom and Isaiah.  *sigh*
