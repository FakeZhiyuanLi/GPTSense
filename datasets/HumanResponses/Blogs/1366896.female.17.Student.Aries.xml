      Hey everyone! I'm so glad to see this blog finally getting some activity from everyone. All along, our class has to be initiated and pushed towards something? I think if I did not do this, no one would bother. I'm not being big-headed or egoistic, but look around and tell me if I'm right. People like chengsiew and sandra have to organise class outings and things like that. Perhaps that's the way we are. I mean, we all have a purpose being in this class, with the followers and leaders all alike. But to a certain extent, leaders do get tired of initiating all the time. I hope that some of you will also come forward to initiate things and organise stuff and try to get as many people to come. How's that? That's the way 4s2 will stay united and not let chengsiew down. Why her? I mention her because she's suffering from 4s2 withdrawal symptoms for almost 5 months now. She's the one who really felt the most towards our class, so let's do this for each other okay? :) I hope I have not offended anyone by saying this. I guess this is the only way to tell you guys how I feel, I'm sorry if I'm blunt or rash, but that's the way I am.   I'm fine with the going to Pasir Ris Theme park. It'll be interesting. I hope everyone who reads this or san's post will spread to our classmates okay? Spread it as best as you can, to whoever you meet, to sms-ing. Let's make this a good class outing, so that we all can come together to have fun okay? :) Besides, it's one day before school starts, and once school starts, you guys will be busybusybusy while I'll be shaking my legs at home. Haha, but I'm free if you wanna ask me out yes? Dinner anyone? Book NOW! -grins-   Anyway, I'm glad to see this blog moving somewhere. I've made everyone an admin, so access it as often as you want, as often as you can, to just blog about anything. No one is supposed to feel out as long as you still have us behind you ok? Take care people. I'll see you in a month's time. I really miss you guys alot. More than some of you think. Cheers. :P

      hey  barbarians , as you all know, rachel, xiuhui and siew will be returning somewhere in the last week of june. Everyone said we will go to sentosa on the 27th, right? Can we change the venue to the newly built water theme park at pasir ris instead? Sentosa is well, kind of boring, don't you all think? So, how? and yes, one more thing, june's birthday falls on 27th! What shall we do?

      you know how everyone says, i miss what we had, i miss the times, i miss everyone... -hugggg- at least we all have things to look back on yes? so we all gotta keep our heads up and have faith in each other.  my cousin told me tht the best friendship usually happen during the last two years of secondary school. lol. i scoffed at tht idea once before... but now i know what she truly means. :) we were there for each other when we needed to be, through the good times and the bad times and, god bless, i think we've all come out as stronger, better people. lol. even if we didn't, we still have all the friendships we forged with each other in the 2 years we had as a class.  who knows... 10, 20 years down the road, we'll have a reunion. :) lol. tht'll be funny. seeing everyone at 35... imagine what we could be by then. :) and the best part is? we'll still have each other.  i pledge alligence to 4S2 2003. forever more. :) in faith. and in hope. that though we are all leading seperate lives now, there'll be tht clearing in our paths tht will bring us back to where we were before.  love love love love love everyone of you! :)

       haix... how different life is here and in singapore. how different life is here and Crescent!! :(  sometimes i wonder why i had to leave, when the degree i was doing here is of the same regconition with A'levels. then i would tell myself it's because i couldn't stand the education system there, yet it seems that there's more stress here as compared to there! now, this is confusing me. if there isn't much difference between staying in singapore and coming here, why was i so stupid to forsake my love ones to come to a completely different place and start all over again?!  i had to learn how to cherish by losing everything i had.  is it too late for me to cherish those whom i love? why did i stupidly think that i could forget the memories i had. why was i so heartless to want to forget those who love me and those i love?  i wake up one day and realise how naive i've been. is it too late to turn back and start from where i left?  i miss you, my friends. and my only way to tell you that is through this blog we have. we've almost completely lost contact with one another, and i don't expect you to still remember. but just to tell you how i feel: i miss all of you tons and tons and tons...

      I hope everyone is doing fine and things like that. :)   I love our class too. The different personalities and how people just blended in and complemented each other in ways we didnt know exist. It's amazing, how bonds can be forged, how friendships can link people over oceans, and how memories will forever be etched in the heart.   To each and everyone of you, thank you for being part of my life. No matter how small or big, trust me, somehow, you've influenced it in some little way. May the spirit of 4s2 always live in our hearts even as we all grow up into our dreams and future.

      why is it always only ccs or rachel blogging? i really don't understand... it's like, so rare to see anyone else blogging? if that's the case, what's the point in having this blog? might as well just get a tagboard enough already... i know i sound a little overboard/sore about this issue, but i just don't understand why people just won't make an effort to come to this blog and just write an entry? i believe it doesn't matter whether what it is written is funny or whatever, what's most important is that we share our lives with everyone, isn't it? i don't write funny stuff like cheng, nor any meaningful stuff too, but at least i come here and i share my joy here with everyone and i believe that it's enough even if no one reads because i've done my part in sharing? and i feel good about it because i know there's still this place for me turn to when i need a listening ear. but what are the others doing? just tagging on the tagboard doesn't really help maintain the bond at all ok. does it hurt for anyone to just spend 5min or even just 1min typing even just one sentence? i don't think so, at least i'm still in one piece here right? so come on people! there ought to be more participation here!! i don't know how the others who always write in here are feeling, but i personally feel very sad because every time i come to this blog, it is ALWAYS the same old entry!! it takes like SO LONG for someone to type something in here, and it is ALWAYS the same old person. if you don't feel sad, then all i can say is that i feel sad for you. if you feel angry or anything, all i can say is that i apologise for causing your fury, but if you had been contributing and you know this arrow isn't pointed at you, then you should not be angered at all, am i not right? well, that's it then, i really hope this would make someone start doing something. it isn't the first time that this had been written here, rachel wrote the same thing a long time ago but it didn't seem to work, let's just hope this time, you guys would wake up yah?

      Continuation of The Way We Were...  Our mass dances were awful. We just held hands and ran about in circles. Tertia would run about head butting everyone in her way. She was like an angry bull. Ok. Nvm she was cute. We were the only class that didnt know how to dance properly and had to watch other classes dance. Our mass dance teacher was EVEN WORSE? I cant rmb her beautiful name. But she is lovely. She wore the same pants everytime (blue in colour) and she loved her sling bag so much she carried it wherever she went. Our class will just stone and ignore her when she was trying to teach us the steps. I told you we were a cool class. We cldnt be bothered with her.    Rmb how we slept during CME class in sec 3? Yeahyeah. We rocked. We made Khoo Shui Lian (mrs khoo) so pissed when we slept. And she will slam the books on the table..and shout out..I AM  NOT  ANGRY. And stormed out of the class just because Tertia killed a bee for the safety of the class. Hahah. And Mrs Ow...GIRLSSSSSS KHEEEPPPPPP QQQQQQQUIET!!!!! in her really weird and high pitched choir voice. Then she will make her shoulders go up and down up and down and up forever. And we love to imitate her voice screaming KHEEEEEEEEPP  QUIETTTTTTTT GIRLSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!! And do her shoulder thing. It was the most in thing to do that. Hahah. GWS she once said Wong Xi looked like a Darlie the toothpaste advertisement. My goodness. Speaking of wx, she used to flood the room with her tissues. And Eudora once brought a tissue box and hang it on the wall. Free flow for anyone like lauren rage or wx to have some tissues. Our class is very auntish you see. =) But we are high class aunties. And Ms Lee( ok. Janet Lee.) She's cute huh? Forever laughing at her own jokes. And we laughed along only becos she looked funny laughing by herself. She thot we were laffing at her jokes.   Here are some food our class loves to eat.  Everything.   Ok just kidding.    We love to ta bao chicken rice. Buy back hot hot nuggets from the malay store. Or buy the stupid pizza from the western stall. We also loved to drink packet drinks like milo or ice lemon tea( althou i hate ice lemon tea) or we drink lime juice. And we love to buy back chicken sandwiches egg sanwiches and chicken seaweed. We consume a lot and therefore, it is highly dangerous for other classes not to eat before our recess. After our recess, it is unlikely you find anymore food in the canteen. We have chomped down the whole canteen alr. After eating we love to take a nap in class during lessons. After napping we feel very refreshed and it's time to go home alr.    We love to tsk at any outsiders coming into our class during lessons. Not that we love lessons a lot. But we tsk with mighty echoes for the thrill of it. We get aroused easily by our TSKS YUCKS ERBX BURPX. We like to have peace when we are doing work/tests and will TSK YUCKS ERBX BURPX at whoever makes noise outside. But the moment we finish, even if other ple are having exams, we love to make a lot of noise. Complete with our TSK YUCKS ERBX BURPX as we walk along their classes.    Hey, did I mention before that we are a cool class?   What do you think??   NO need to think la. It IS THE COOLEST. HOR?   =)

      this post goes especially out to chengz, i really feel that i owe you a lot for making you feel so troubled for me. thank you and sorry... after i got to aussie land, my connection if any of you is almost completely zero. ZERO. i guess i'm really guilty for not making the effort of staying in contact even though i'm always the one whining that i miss 4s2 this much and that much. believe it or not. something in me just makes me feel so insecure. what is my status in your hearts now? do you guys think of me as much as i think of you? do i even exist? these thoughts keep flooding my brain even though my heart knows that you people really care. that's why i can never seem to be able to blog or do anything properly because i feel that even if i did, you all wuldn't even give a damn. and hell i'm so utterly wrong! you all do care! and it's refelcted in the tags! and only then am i able to once again realise that i do have many precious friendships in singapore... just that i keep forgetting they exist! so it isn't your fault now that i feel like i don't exist, but my own fault that i forget that you all exist! what a weakling i am! to fall under such mediocre pressure. i feel so sorry for everyone of you who takes the effort to think of me.. 'cos i'm the one guilty of not remembering you. thanx guys for your care and concern, it really means LOADS to me. love you.

      I was reading sandra's past entries that made me blog abt our class. U noe. as usual our class has so much to blog abt. Our echos of tsks. Ttsk tsktsktskts all over the place and GWS will ask if we are old men sitting by the corner trying to suck our teeth. HAHAH. That was highly amusing. No??   sometimes i wonder why i even miss this class so much when it appears that actually none may have missed the class. well i figured out why alr. Its because we spent our time together doing things which were like SO SPECIAL example: Tsking. Yucksing. Erbxing. Burping. U noe I feel a sense of achievement and proudness whenever our class tsks and YUCKSS together in unison when LBK makes a lame joke? Or when some annoying teacher irritates us and u can REALLY hear echos of TSK TSK TSK TSKKKKKKKK like we are some parrots. The feeling was awesome.  Also, we spend so much time a day in class. On average its 8am to 3pm. Sometimes with mock tests or remedials it will be until 5pm. So its at least 7-9hrs of a day. Dun tell me we have no feelings at all when we spent so many long hrs tgt as a class?   Our habits. Our habits are the same. We like cheap stuffs but well quality ones. We like to do cheapskate things but act high class. (hahah. I rmb tertia grabbed one stack of contest forms from mac donalds just to fill in and win something............)  The way we sit for good ventilation for our legs.. The way we wear our skirts half way and LBK will be like..."GERS CAN U GO TOILET AND CHANGE??? I NOE U ARE WEARING SHORTS BUT............" The way we moodswinged. The way we eat. The food which we eat. We eat anything everything. The way we litter. The way we study. The way we passed a test paper ard and cheated. The way we slacked. The way we rush down to court and play bball. The way we suan our teachers. (we suan so much thats why we got wee suan..) The way we topped the cohort with horrible grades of E8s and F9s. The FIRST TIME we ever won something as a class was our CNY decoration of the class. we made it look like a prostitute den. HAHAHAH. The way we treat our notes like tissue paper(anyhow throw). The way we got upset together the way we shutted uped together as a class when goon scolds us. The way we thot of ideas of where to hide hps during spot checks: ceiling, in our sports bras, in our shorts, inside coloured water bottles and inside OHP machines. The way we arrived late fer lessons. The way we throw our books all over the floor cause of overflowing lockers. The way we scream in happiness when janet lee is absent. The way we laff. Its like thundering. The way we are not upset upon knowing we got F9s again. Hahah. =) uniquely fourstwo. The way we rush to mobil to get cup noodles and leave the soup lying in the class dustbin for YEARS. (yukers..) The way we throw our tissues on the floor. Just throw. hahah. The way how we always ta bao food and eat in our class. The way where our class is made up of different ple. Like ple who can counsel u.Ple who can make u laff. Ple who are nerds. Ple who are sporty. Ple who are smart at certain subs. Ple whom u can pour out ur probs to. Ple who can be there fer u.   Awesome class?      YES.

      well people, sorry to say this, but i might not be able to go for the class outing. i don't even know if i'm returning to singapore during the july holidays at all. my mom is coming down to Queensland at late june, so i might need to go and accompany her there... haix, sorry people. still hope for the best that i can see everyone of you, but don't keep the hopes too high, i don't want to disappoint everyone of you. that's it for now then. hope you all enjoy your well-deserved june holidays! ;)

       Best Friends Forever  by Angie Belanger   As the years pass, And we grow apart, I want you to know, That you're in my heart.   You helped me through problems, Through things good and bad. You helped me keep smiling, When I was sad.   You helped me with guys. (n/a) You made me stay strong. How will I live, When you are gone?  And where the years take us, No place is too far, We will think of each other, Wherever we are.   You're a wonderful person, With a good heart to lend, And I want you to know, You're a really good friend.  When the whole world looks down on you, Remember you always have 4s2 :)

      ok firstly. my heart melted and dissolved away when i read that entry.  robber. its ur fault fer writing such a ...... SWEET and TOUCHING entry. I hope we dun get diabetes when reading that.   hmm. some of the buddies i have made in 4S2 are like...my aorta in my heart. Very impt blood artery. Ok i&nbsp; sound stupid trying to talk in bio terms. who am i to use bio&nbsp;when i hate bio...&nbsp;To put it simply, 4s2 is like my stead lah. The company i get, i enjoy. The jokes i hear, i laugh heartedly. The advice i get, i put it to use. The help that comes, i cling onto it like a log. I dun mind seeing my buddies everyday, i cant get enough of them.   I get my joy peace and laughter from my buddies.   Separation is not sweet. Yet I am addicted to my sweet buddies.   I sure do miss my buddies in 4s2.&nbsp; U ple do also right? How cld u not when I am:  1) SO GOOD LOOKING 2) SO CUTE AND ADORABLE 3) SO COOL AND STYLO  4) SO NICE AND HAPPENING 5) SO SWEET AND CAUSE U ALL TO GET DIABETES 6) SO LOVE U ALL. PERIOD.   &nbsp;

      well here i am to resuscitate this blog. (my First Aid certificate has not expired yet...!)  I'm thinking that&nbsp;in a way&nbsp;its a good thing the class split up.   Now we seem to be more together, with class ppl meeting up regularly to go out (almost every month and whenever someone returns from Australia)...of course not everyone......but for those who do actually turn up, it makes for a&nbsp;damn good time and great bonding, hardly realising it.  Also, the ppl who come for the microscopic class gatherings in make strange combinations....ie they come from all different cliques and were&nbsp;not close at all in Crescent, eg Caili, Sandra, Rachel Ho,Iffah,&nbsp;Xiu, me, June, CCS...etc...I mean, can u imagine such a group gg out together on a Saturday afternoon in Sec3 or Sec4? And still all enjoy each others' company to the fullest.  My point is,&nbsp;4S2 is still intact to a large extent and is still evolving.&nbsp; It didn't disintegrate.  4S2 is&nbsp;more like some popular TV show who's series has ended and all the actors move on to other projects&nbsp;and there is a spinoff series.  Or the Fellowship of the Ring. Or something that broke up.   In the same way we all have our own lives outside 4S2 now. But are still connected by the fact that once in our lives we were all together in the same container class.  Ok. Enough of metaphors.And one more thing: I don't think we can ever fully appreciate our lives until they've become the past. 4S2 was often&nbsp;terrible while we were&nbsp;actually in it.&nbsp;Though i guess&nbsp;sometimes not.  All thanks to CCS for organizing all the gatherings and the people who invented SMS and blogs

      hey.. came across this fwd email so just wanna share it with you people.  - Everyday when you return from your school, whether or not it is from a secondary school, a junior college, a polytechnic, or ITE, you would probably think that school sucks.   All that work and torture under your lecturer's or teacher's homework or assignments, or tutorials...   But think about this, all the time spent with your classmates, all the laughter, sorrows, and happiness of knowing that your friends are there in your class.   Now imagine them gone, perhaps part of them or even all of them. You may not realise it, but when advancing into the next level of education, it is inevitable that some friends will be parting with you.   What is all this you ask yourself, what I ask is of you to think, for those who received this mail, what do those people who were once or were still your classmates and friends meant to you.   Anyone who has at least finished their o levels and has graduated from respective schools would know the feeling of parting with your classmates and friends.   Not knowing when you still see them again.   Perhaps the next day, the next week, month, years, or even decade. Perhaps one day, you would realised how bitter sweet those memories were, the fun you had with your classmates and friends.  That is why ever so often when you asked someone which is the most fond memories they had in their years in education, they would often have that sadness in their eyes, but yet, they smile briefly.   It's the memories of their school friends. Those unforgettable years of laughter and happiness in school.   Each classmate had suffered under the same stresses in school. The teachers, whether they are kind or extremely strict.   So treasure your schooling days, don't complain, because you never know when you will miss them dearly. And perhaps, shed a tear for those treasured times in your youth.
