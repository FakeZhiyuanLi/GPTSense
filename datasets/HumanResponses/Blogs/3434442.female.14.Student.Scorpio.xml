       Nikki couldn't believe this was happening. This was the moment she waited for since she met him. Not just to have sex, but to be with him and love him. Lennon was moving at a moderately quick pace now, in a smooth motion, and Nicole's moans increased in volume as she panted harder and quicker. They were both sweating profusely, all over their bodies. Lennon was now moving very rapidly, almost slamming into her, and thier moans made a powerful music together that echoed throughout the room.

      omfg i think im about to die! check out what josh wrote just now!"Nicole closed and locked the door, then wrapped her arms around his neck and they began to wildly and passionately kiss, their toungues playing against one another. Lennon felt what little grip he had on reality slipping away and wrapped his arms around her waist then began to move quickly toward her bed. Nicole kept up with him, rapidly moving her feet backwards, then stumbling on her back onto the bed. Lennon fell over her, laying on top, neither one thinking too rationally. " not too bad but no josh no... GAH!!! lol bad thoughts bad thoughts! OUT DEMONS OUT! dang you josh! im not gonna be able to sleep now! oh man... thats great. see how wonderful he is. can make anything up just to get a kick outta your reaction... butt wipe. lol j/k josh is awesome... i just really hope he doenst write a sex story for me and lennon... oh goddess help the boy. *crawls away to rock in a corner in fetal position from all the disturbing thoughts*

I borrowed a bunch of cds from becky and bill last night.  Lol! I also scavenged art work from the art room that was gonna be trashed. They are awesome paintings... i'm in love with them... lol.  Monday in science we did an "expirement" about bears.  I got to be the mama bear and carry around two stuffed animals. Lol i named them Josh and Lennon then Dylan asked who the father was so Lennon became Lennon Jr. lol. This school year is over. I'm happy, but not.  There's alot of things I'm gonna miss.

      Today was National Love Josh and Lennon Day. I follow this holiday everyday, lol.  Tomorrow is Josh's b-day, also when "the pact"(a pact they made that they would both be kissed by the end of josh's b-day) ends.  No kiss with Lennon yet.  I want to, its just that I get nervous and abandon the whole idea.  Very VERY frustrating.  Today in anime was great.  I played Soul CalaberII (spelling please josh?) and super smash bros. melee.  Lost both times, but hey its all good.  I cheered for Lennon and Josh on the side lol. *sigh* it was the very last day for anime... I will miss them all, except Kevin... nah he's pretty cool.  Josh says that when I want to do something with Lennon, I should go for it because they are equally the amount of hopeless romantics.  WTF is a hopeless romantic? Anyone? Never mind, thanks again Josh!Looks like they are both losing on the pact...poor guys.  Josh makes very interesting videos lol. Today in shop I was complimented on my "indian." Gym... well watched Rob stare at my boobs and hid behind Michael.  Math.. nothing special. Social Studies... continued to be interested in  First Knight  which is a pretty cool movie. Science... I got to be the mama bear in this expiriment, my cubs were josh and Lennon Jr. lol.  English... the usual goof off with ben and eric lol. very entertaining people.  Encore... studied my elvish.  after that i watched pirates of the carribean in Mrs. Ashby's classroom. CLeaned out my locker at the end of the day.  Then went to anime and you heard about that already.we sat around outside till my dad came, josh was 'spying' on me and lennon, again attempting to make us kiss.  its quite entertaining when he does this. Oh yeah, before i forget, some one burnt up the recycle bins on the 8-9 campus, there was paper and ash EVERYWHERE! Very amusing. well gonna go. toodles.

      *yawn* Yay! Finally figured out how to start a blog thanks to Josh! Love you 4everz! Much happiness today! Everyone seems to be feeling great and all, everyone is happy. Oh yessuh! Last night me, Lennon, Josh, Don, Cassidy, and Dylan went to the mall.  I think Josh and Dylan felt left out considering they were the only single people there :*( Josh is a great guy, hes the one who acctually hooked me and Lennon up, and if it wasn't for him, we (as in me and Lennon) would probably not exist.  We had a great time yesterday I think.  The end was especially nice for me. Lol.  Me and Lennon all kinda cuddly and junk.  I almost fell asleep from so much comfort. Evil pyro people who like to cause death to things kept being rude and mean... grr! Dylan threw pennies at people as usual... particularly me and Lennon and Josh.  He says he "seriously was trying to hit the wall and not us." Yeeeeeah, suuuuure. Anywhit, tomarry is the last day for Anime Club *tear*.  But hey, I get to see Lennon and Josh again! YAY! Thinking 'bout wearing a skirt... hmmm... eh well since my comp sucks (!!!) I guess I should go ahead and post this before it locks up on me like it frequently likes to do! Much love!  ~Nicole/Nikki/whatevertheheckyouwannacallme~

      okay i went to the blue plum festival yesterday to hang out with lennon, and we walked around for a while then sat down and started counting stars and all that stuff, then we held each other for a really long time just talking about things that mean nothing to anyone and i fell asleep on him for about 15 minutes.... we just sat there looking at the stars and holding each other and listening to rather good music....it was so sweet! We were sitting on the bench for 2 hours when the music acctually stopped and we had to go.  He and his mom and his little brother (they were walking ahead of us a little bit) walked me to my car, so lennon gained another ounce of respect from my day (YAY). and get this.  DAD OFFERED HIM A RIDE HOME!!!!!! it was awesome. i came home and considered getting online, but decided not to (sorry josh) and went to bed, only to lay there and watch tv from 12am-1am, watching old reruns of courage the cowardly dog. before mine and lennons star counting, we walked around with Don and Nick for a while and watched don drink the cheap $2.46 a bottle Boones Farm Mountain Berry Wine. Lol. he tried to get lennon to take a drink of it (it was in an ibc root beer bottle, not the original) and good for him he didnt, then i grabbed the bottle and sniffed it and immediately recognized the scent (lol what does that tell you about me?).  then later don asked me if i had ever heard of smirnoff or knew what it was and i was juts like "no don, im just a dumb ass."  then we were following don and nick and they started going to where i wasnt supposed to be so me and lennon turned back and they just kept walking on and on and on. im not sure if they even realized we were gone... very very very entertaining night.  i was so happy at the end of it all though!!! hee hee *dances* i wanted to kiss lennon so0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o bad last night, and had the perfect oppurtunity to do so too, but naturally, i chickened out and didnt.  his lips were right there! and so were mine! dang it! why do us humans have to get so nervous at times? well im gonna quit writing now. see ya!

      *yawn* man... i am so tired... and all i did was lay around the house and then went grocery shopping with dad for 4 hours. I talked to lennon a bit today, around noon or so. he was helping with the yard sale or something and i was cleaning off the porch, so there wasnt much conversation, but there were some good jokes, which i cant remember worth a poop.  Tomorrow we will all go and see shrek!! YAY! another oppurtunity (spell check anyone?) for josh and tierah to hang out! yay! he FINALLY called her today and talked to her.  i was so proud... my little babies are growin up! *tear* the movies will be yet another                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

This Fri. and Sat. is the Blue Plum Festival! more and more blue grass for the soul! what a crock of shit... i just go because of the vendors and to meet interesting people. lennon is going and so is amanda i think, so i wont be bored this year! yay! well im gonna go, ill update tomarry!

      *sigh* just got off the phone with lennon.  this week will be boring because i wont be able to wait for friday and saturday which is when the blue plum festival takes place and also when i get to see lennon again. yay! i was thinking about volunteering again, but i dont feel like going down and filling out an aplication. its normally not that busy with face painting anyway.  Lennon is now known as the "god of sugar consumption" michael still calls me the goddess. lol i know some crazy people.  havent talked to josh all day and no one is online.  poo poo. well there are people but i dont really wanna talk to them. OOH!!! PERSON!.... damn.... no one good... *tear* lennon's parents are having a cookout or something at his house.  i wish i could go! id be alot less bored! *sigh* some times the world doesnt work the way i want it too and thats very disappointing. why cant i just have a little vcr remote  that makes everything do what i want it to do?come on inventors!!!! it would be very nice if it could all happen like that.  *tear* sadly it cant.  but boy if it could.  i would just fast forward myself through all the bad junk that i didnt like then pause the good times. *sigh* i would have too much fun though and would abuse my privileges... dang it. all of these people are getting on and i dont want to talk to any of them!!! GRR! I wish lennon would get on and read my email i wrote... lol, i explained how the shirt was trying to convince him. i need something to read... *bangs head on table* ive been off the phone with him for 15 minutes and im already wanting to call back. but i dont want to get him in trouble so yet i resist. *sigh* i miss the god of sugar consumption... *crawls to the corner and gets into fetal position and cries*

       HA!!! hey before i go any further, check out one of my best friend's blo... err... xanga: http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=Annerly HA! Xanga! WTF kinda name is that? It's pronounced Zanga, but yet they continue to spell it with an x.  After saying I'd NEVER EVER EVER go and see a harry potter movie, I went and saw it.  Mainly because earlier Lennon and I had planned to do something today but didnt get to because it was inconvenient for dad, but Josh called me and asked if I wanted to go and see it and guess what! Lennon was going lol. So I accepted.  I spent five minutes (he only gave me a 45 minute notice)scrounging around the house for 50 more cents to go to the movies, brushing my teeth and my hair, and searching for my purse and jacket.  I didn't really need the purse or the jacket but oh well.  When I arrived I was 23 minutes early (what a shocker!!!)!!! and waited around in the car with my dad (-.-;) for about 10 minutes until lennon and josh arrived.  no matter how much I waved to them, they still didnt see me, so I ran across the parking lot and purposely roughly bumped into Lennon.  We got our tickets and I stood for a few minutes talking about my disbelief at going to see a Harry Potter movie.  Well I came up with this wonderful name for the movie: Hairy Pothead and the Prisoner's Ass Band.  Me and Lennon sat there and made striking resemblances to Lord of the Rings and cuddling, while poor Josh sat there and hugged himself and made some rather good jokes.  All in all on a scale of one to ten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban got an overall 3 from me. Thats the actual movie, not the experience. the experience gets a 9. Later we walked around the back of the building where Lennon and Josh raced each other and surprisingly (to my shock atleast) Josh won. =0   -.-; Eh, oh well.  Then me and Lennon hugged... alot... while josh smacked a wall and humped a pole (under my command MUWAHAHAHAHA!!!) Dad and I had a talk on the way home about comming around the side of the building. and now im talking to josh so bye.

      Went to the Blue Plum Festival again, met up with Lennon, Don, and Nick.  Ran into Josh and Elf(steven) there, too.  and before i forget, DARIUS IS HOME FROM IRAQ!!!! He is on medical leave though, so he will go back in a few months. Shot once in his chest and twice in his leg, i was so happy when he called me today. things have just been awesome for me this weekend. Josh and I are now talking about me and Lennon. Go figure.  They (josh and nick) stalked us (me and lennon) for quite a while last night before we realized it. Josh, yet again tried to get us to kiss, but hes gotta understand the nervousness and feelings that come along with it. It has to feel right, ya know, you cant just jump into something like that. Its not just something, a kiss really is something special. My first kiss was at the magnolia fest in florida with connor collins (i have dated too many collins'). thats was acctually when i was going out with The Prick (aka Joe). I was depressed, connor (who i met here at a play and dated for a while till he moved to new jersey) was illegally (hes only 18) semi-drunk.  Quite an exciting time lol.  but anywhit! Lennon has an abnormally fast heart beat. I really do like him... ALOT. hell... possibly even love him. No, dumb ass! dont say love! not yet... im, just head over heals for him. when i see him, i smile, when i think about meeting him some where, i smile, when i go to bed every night i think about him and guess what! I'M SMILING! and whenever im not with him or talking to him i miss him so0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o much, i miss how safe i feel when he has his arm around me, and my hand feels do empty with out his hand in it! GAH!!! what the heck am i oing here? man... its too crazy lol... i really do like him... oh man *bangs head on a wall* dont... get....so ... hung...up...on...this...one!!! AHHHHH!

      Darius has permanent medical discharge from the marines now, so he doesn't have to go back to Iraq.  Today we were talking and then all of the sudden, out of the blue he says "I'm in love with you."  He's 18, four years older than I am, he doesn't know about Lennon yet either, I haven't had the heart to tell him.  I don't like Darius in that way though, I think I may be falling for Lennon and I refuse to go back to my two timing days. I will NEVER do that again. It causes too much pain. Lennon is possibly the most awesome boyfriend I've EVER had, I just don't want to crush Darius' heart either.  He knows we can't go out anyway because he's legal I'm not. And again I say I DONT LIKE HIM IN THAT WAY.  I've gotten myself pulled in too far with Lennon. lol, he has this thoughtful, serious look that he does thats so awesome, it just makes me melt like butter.We hung out at the library today.  We actually spent most of our time at Anna's house, lol, even though I was supposed to stay at the library, shh... don't tell dad. It was pretty fun... I made the bad choice of wearing a black shirt to walk around in the sun though... I'm so smart. Once we got in her house (which was nice and air conditioned)i collapsed on the floor in front of her door lol. Lennon had the infamous Elton John glasses which I so love. I tried to put his hair in a ponytail, but alas, no such luck. One day, I WILL get ahold of his hair, I'm determined.  I dare not cut it though lol, i like his long hair! He met Cheryl (Anna's mom who is my 2nd mom) and Andy (anna's dad) and Paw (Anna's Grandpa). Snow white likes Lennon and still hates me and Anna.  Blue tried to hump his leg (HA!). Everytime I picture that it makes me giggle a tad. Hee hee! This was the first time me and Lennon have actually gone somewhere ALONE, lol. Sorry guys, but we need our space sometimes! Well I'm gonna go. See ya! Listening to: Nina Sky's awesome song "Move Your Body"

        I am slowly but surely learning HTML! Yay!  I resorted to writing something in my blog because I have absolutely nothing else to do. Lennon went to the bank and Josh is at his grand ma's.  Anna is having Mikey over. Poo.  See? Nothing to do.  If I haven't told you already, me, Lennon, Josh, Lisa and Gary all went on a date last Friday.  Well Josh and Lisa went and me and Lennon went with them to make it a double date and Gary just kinda tagged along because he had to.  We went and saw Spider-Man 2, it was uber awesome, especially the elevator scene.  Josh and Lisa cuddled, and afterwards he complained about how all she did was lean over a little bit.  What the hell are we chicks supposed to do except lean on you guys????? Me and Lennon were cuddling too but I was holding his hands and leaning on his chest.  Gary was just kinda… cuddling the chair… I guess. *shrugs*  Poor guy.  Anywhit.  Lennon and I got there early and walked around the little shopping mall thingy by the theatre, which kinda sucked cause I was wearing high heels, which wasn’t very smart of me.  I still had an awesome time walking around with Lennon though.  We went into the Jade Tree and I bought this cute new change purse and a wooden fan, he bought a very, ehem… masculine pendant of a rabbit (his Chinese zodiac symbol), then we went to the comic store and walked around for quite a while, looking at all the comics, me drooling over a lot of stuff, then I spotted these trading cards from The Crow, so I had to get them.  10 bucks isn’t bad for 36 packs of cards plus a pretty box.  We came out of the comic store and sat down in the oh so comfy chairs at the hyperlink outside and waited for Josh, Gary, and Lisa to go inside the movie  theatre so we could throw ice at them.  What do ya know?  They didn’t, so we finally walked down there and talked to them and waited for 7:30 to roll around, then we found our seats. Yadda yadda yadda, you know what happened then.  NEXT DAY They were having a July 4th celebration on the 3rd of July at Freedom Hall.  I met Lennon, Don, and Cassidy there. We had lots of fun, shooting off fireworks dangerously, jumping around, scarring nice innocent people for life with our demented brains.  I choked on water from a church (aka, bottled lord, lord in a bottle, Wicca killer). Lennon bought a bottle of water and he couldn’t open it so I had to LOL! It was very entertaining. Later on that night we go pizza and went to a perfect spot on the old track at the 10-12 campus.  We could see the fireworks perfectly through the trees and everything.  Me and Lennon cuddled of course, so did Don and Cassidy ^,^  NEXT DAY July 4th came and Lennon got to come over and meet my whole entire family, even the ones that live in NC. We went outside and shot arrows for a bit and pet my cat (the animal, Josh, the animal). I went out and rolled in the grass a few times.  Then he left and there was about 30 minutes of my family talking about how much they liked him.    Okay. That was last weekend, now its time for this weekend.  Today me and Lennon are doing nothing. Tomorrow however, we are going to the Grandfather Mountain Highland games! YAY!!!!!1111111one1111 We are gonna spend the WHOLE day together! YAY! From 8am to probably 2am on Sunday! WEEE! *sings* I’m so excited, and I just can’t hide it.  I’m about to lose control and I think I like it! Now I’m talking to Lennon, and he’s trying to open up a Sprite, but is failing (its one of those glass bottles with the metal cap). I asked him if he needed me to come over and open that bottle for him.  Lol, no… poopie.  I talked to one of my best buds the other night, Natasha.  We talked about A LOT of stuff.  One of my favorite parts of the conversation was when we were discussing which marvel super heroes were screwable.  We came to the conclusion that batman was bulky, superman was too hunkified, wonder woman was just a no, hulk was too hulkified, and flash and spiderman were the most screwable. Come on, Flash would make for some nice quickies for the lunch break home at work.  And Spidey, well…. He’s just hot, plus the little twinge of geekiness make him cute too.  Not to mention that Tobey McGuire is the best looking guy in spandex that I have ever seen! Lol.  Well gonna head out to bed. G’night!
