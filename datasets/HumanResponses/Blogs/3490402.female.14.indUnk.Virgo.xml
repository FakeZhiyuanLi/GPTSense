      Ok, today the pools were suppost to open. Kids were suppost to get 5 degree sunburns, and parents were suppost to buy kids ICE CREAM!! (well for me anyway.) But no, it's suppost to rain...again. For the last 3 weeks we've had rain, tornado warnings (LIKE 80!) and hail.. That really gets us all in the mood of hitting the pool. So instead I'm going on a car trip with my family.  Nice small car + 2 boys under the ages of 8 + two parents who don't go out alot together anyway + me= ONE HELL of a crappy day. I just want to go to the library!  But enough self pitty...... ok I don't really have anything else to say. So I'll go. :)  Be sure to check out that horrible site!!! Thanks all. Bye.

      I've been working on closing this company for a while now. When I first saw this site, I'd have to say that I was completely creeped out and angry. I'm personally do not have a large love for animals, but there is no excuse for what they are doing to this poor cats. So in hope of spreading the word, and getting people to act together to closing this company; I'm going to post the site here  -->  urlLink http://www.bonsaikitten.com/   Thanks for listening.

      Have you seen The WB Super Star show? Holy Crap, how horrible is that!   (AND IS ROSS A GIRL OR MAN!?)   That is my question! Yea he/she is from Hawaii, and we know he/she can't sing! BUT WHAT THE HELL IS HE/SHE REALLY!? I knew people can be extremely gullible, but seriously what the fuck!? Yea, ok I would just like someone to tell me what gender that man is because I don't think I'll be able to sleep if I don't find out.  All right got to find info on Springfield. (Family trip coming up.) We're visiting the capitol, and Lincoln's home.(You think it really is made of lincoln logs?) Joy. Actually I'll like it because I LOVE history.   bah Bye

      I'm stuck at home with the littliens :( (little brothers that is) It's been about 5 hours now, and it doesn't look like the parents are coming home anytime soon. (Joy.) It's already day 3 of summer, and I feel like if I don't do something soon, I'm going to start cleaning! (scary I know!)  You know how they say that you can't put babies on a set time? Yea well that doesn't include my brother. He has cried every 30 min. For the last 3 hours! He gets angry for 5 minutes then stops. AND when you think you're out of the blue 30 minutes later (on the dot) he starts crying again! (what gives!?)  I'm hoping to hit the pool tomorrow in search of a  little  color. If only I lived back when being white was a sign of beauty! (I would fit in so well) But no the only way to look good is to go out side and fry your skin tell it turns brown (nice) and then when you finally turn 20 your skin will look like a 50 year-old women on menopause! (That's the price of beauty my ass!)Oh well. (Wow. That didn't make much sense.) My day will be high lighted by a trip to the library where I will stock up on books, barricade myself in my room, and read until my eyes pop out! (unless we decide to play put-put golf instead) I'll cross my fingers for my eyes to pop out.  All right I'm sure your bored of how random this entry is (but at lest I'm consistent with the randomness) that's progress I tell you! I'll go now.  Later gator.

       HOWDY  GUYS!!!  Ah, funky day... yea.  Samm's party was crazy (I was called a shit head by a 8 year-old!) And there where many water balloons down the shirt (DIE CHRIS!) We ran around like idiots playing football in short ass shorts and little tank tops (hehe sounds like a Baywatch episode) anyway... yea Chris was a shit head AGAIN (I'm now part of a square love triangle thing.) Because people can't make up their minds (stupid hormones!) You don't see me wanting to hump everything that's the opp. Sex! (ok... Well maybe)BUT yea.  WE HAD AMAZING HOTDOGS! AHH! AND marshmallows all over a small flame (AMAZING I KNOW!) But there was no "Kiss the Cook" shirt for me :( ah well I got my krispy creams one instead (Sized for fat people!) I wonder why... I'll just have to eat more donuts so it can fit. :):):) Ok, it's like almost 1 in the morning, and I'm...Not really tired, but I don't want to talk to you. SO...Go away...  Bye.

      Ah! First post!  If I didn't really, really, really want to comment on Samm's blog (http://simpleplanfreak.blogspot.com/2004/05/schools-out.html) then I probably would have never though of having one of these! (Thanks Samm)  So schools out! I'm a freshman now! (HOLY CRAP!) I'll give you the low down on the last day here in a minute, but right now I have a really big bone to pick with some people! I'd like to call this "really big bone"   LIZ"S CRAPPY LOVE TRIANGLE PROBLEM! (THAT SHE WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH!)  Ok the problem:  Chris when I'm done with this you're probably going to be really pissed at me, but I have to get this off my chest, ok.  I know that you "like" me. And it's really sweet. BUT you've got to stop being so depressed, and because I won't go out with you. There are other people out there (and I know a few) who really, really, really want to go out with you, and I'm sure will be a great influence in your life, much better than me. So as a friend, who really cares about you (Because youâ€™re one of my best guy friends). I think you should take one of these opportunities, and forget about me.  (Are you mad?) Because your friendship means a lot to me and if it means anything to you; would you stop with all the mood swings, and lay off the pressure?   Ok anyway like I said I will tell you all about our last day!  We all went to Anderson Park where again we were given CD's, and lots of cookies! (Yummy) My possy (group)  So I being the retard that I am got sand in everyplace possible had to run to the rest room (with the assistance of Samm, and Dani) tried to clean out (but failed miserable) all pieces of sand (never again will I jump into sand fully clothed)  So after getting over the fact that I had like another 2 hours of walking around with sand in my pants, I joined the group again, to find that creepy college students (well they looked like them, though I'm not sure) were trying to get Krippnar to buy them a bag of "chips" (I'm sure they just wanted pot though.) THAT was really, really weird.  So the game goes on there's a couple of breaks for when Drew gets chased out into the field, and Trent goes to "rescue" him, but really just ends up sitting on him for like 8 minutes (they eventually drag him back) yes the whole way... And the stops for water, playing on the tire (that about made me sick), and when Samm found out that we could all see her "little tushy" (it's ok Samm, mines just as small)  After sweating up a storm (which I know I do, because I seem to have a problem with sweating) we went inside where people began to cry, and say good bye. (My eyes were dry though) Until the stupid graduation song had to come on the radio, then it was all Niagara Falls for me! So yea, lots of drama (and stupid shit) I've got to go (party tonight!) I'll post later (Lord knows their will be LOTS to talk about!)  Love all of you!

      Ah, I saw   Harry Potter and the Prisoner  ... (Long title huh?) I am an obsessive reader so of course I've read the   Harry Potter   books, and I don't know if I really enjoyed the movie as much as I was hoping to. (I just like a lot of detail) I personally would not have minded if they had made it 3 hours. Then at lest we could have had a little more background, and explanation as to why certain things happened (can't say what, don't want to spoil it for anyone.) Though don't let my fickleness stop you from seeing it. I still loved it; I'm just a little disappointed (though I bet I'll ketch myself reading the book again.)  So anyway, This will be my last post for a good while (like a month) unless I get really lucky, and can find time to get on again. (Not that any of you really care considering nothing really exciting happens here.) But if you do care I'll tell you what I've got going on for the next few weeks.  I will be participating in at lest 5 basketball camps (including an amazing one that will take place in the mountains of Colorado!) Good thing I still have my warm clothes from when I lived in Idaho (also an amazing place, and I recommend everyone to visit at sometime in their life!) So I'll be spending my time whipping myself back into shape (me and my good ol' bum knee that is) and hopefully I can squeeze in sometime to work on that fantastic tan that I've been dreaming about for the last like...4 years. (Wow that makes me sound very proactive doesn't it? Maybe I'm just meant to be snow white, white. (Huh?) Oh well.  AH! Before I forget I must tell you about my good friend Nate! I believe he deserves to be mentioned sense he's the only one who's actually made my computer time interesting lately. Nate is a writer in bloom really! He has an amazing story going right now that I was so lucky as to be aloud to read. If I didn't think it would bother him I would share the link with you right now, so maybe if I get comments on anyone wanted to read it I might just try and ask him if he wouldn't mind me sharing it. NOT only is he a very talented writer he is also my best friends boyfriend (they are both extremely head-over-heels for each other) it's so sweet! I have been very lucky to get to know him more over the last few weeks as we mourned the absence of Dani (she was off to God knows where!) j/k I believe she was visiting family. But who knows, I have an active imagination, and I could see her off sailing the ocean with a cat named George. (But that's just me) and I just happen to really want a tabby so I can name him George.  So, it's late, and I really should be packing for my long trip (YEA!) Thanks to anyone who actually reads this stuff (are you really that bored though?) I'll miss you all (aha you would think I was some famous author talking to her fans) All right well you've all I've got for now anyway.  Hugs and Kisses Later Gaiters!

      HEY EVERYBODY!     I'm in Louisiana right now! (Bet you just can't keep up with me!) We're visiting family (yawn) until like....Monday :(  BUT after that I'm home for good (I think...)    God I never though a kid could hate summer, but I do OH SO MUCH! Colorado was pretty cool we won all our games ex. For like 2, and freshman threw Varsity won their Tournament thingys. (Which means we probably won't be going back.) The trip there took forever there where tons of us packed into these tiny vans from the 70's. Allison made it better by building a basketball hoop out of tape and taping to the roof of the car. (Though we never really got around the playing...) On our way home Coach (Mr. Feeney) decided that a hick up a mountain would be a great way to waste 4 hours, and failed to mention our little excursion to me...So I ended up climbing it in floppy sandals. (My feet are still paying for it.)     So got back home Monday morning around 2,  then spent the rest of the day doing laundry, and getting ready for this trip. (I'm all stressed just thinking about it.)        AH! This has nothing to do with what I'm talking about right now, but I must tell everyone! Johnathon! (My baby brother!) has TWO teeth! Not ONE but TWO!!! (He's a big boy now!) *tear* I was so excited when I saw them, but GOOD GRACIOUS that was the worst week ever while those suckers grew in.          Anyway, I'll be home soon (cross fingers) Then maybe I'll be able to see a few of you! (PLEASE!!!!)    LOVE YOU ALL!!!!!!!! later gator

Anyway, so kicked Lucia's butt in bumper cars, but got turned down by a 6 year-old. :( Samm, and I got hit on by Sasquatch (That was scary!) and a bunch of 12 year-old girls asked Drew if he was gay. So...it was a pretty good day I think. I'm heading over to Katie's tonight (SHE GOT HER LIP PEIRCED!) Her mother is a GOD. I think she said something about us having the house to ourselfs all night....PARTY! Anywho I'm suppost to be "babysitting" the little ones so I'll go.  Nice to be home. LATER GATORS!!!
