      Well, fellow Fleetwood Mac fans, what did you think of the concert last night? I played their cds incessantly before going, fought traffic getting to the Coor's Ampitheater with my gf in tow, we got there just in time. M* and I walked quickly to our seats so that we wouldnt miss a single golden second...only to wait for them to start (no warm-up band!) and look around our EMPTY section! Too funny. We were in the special "upper levels", of seating, and gradually inched our way down, until finally, right before the fIRST encore, we were practically near the stage level!   Did you see that fan try to touch her royal shawl-ness? And did you hear her reaction? I thought that was too cute: "His touch was very gentle folks, almost like he was a part of the band".  Highlights of the show: They sang their new song "Peacekeeper", and at the end Lindsay did a little dramatic "thing", that made me cackle and snort. Then Stevie (or should we call her Stephanie?), changed Shawls (from Black, to Gold, to Red), and sang a song, then we got two songs from Lindsay, then a song from Stevie, then another two songs from Lindsay....Is this Fleetwood Mac featuring Lindsay Buckingham?  FM, we will always love you.  Stevie did a Stevie song (at the very end!), "Stand back". As we were being carried along in the undulating, yet-not-dancing crowd, my friend M* was crushed by an eager fan, just as the song "Stand back" was bursting full throttle.  Please...Stand back Stand back!  And she did her little "twirl" wit her skirts and shawls flaring out. Yup, we got our STevie fix. Although at first we were wondering when we'd get to actually HEAR her voice...she sang into the microphone but nothing was coming through.  However, for the most part, the crowd was mellow. I guess its not a band you dance to? Anyone dance to Fleetwood? It was strange not hearing Christine though, I did not realise how many songs she is actually featured on. She was not there...and I grew curious as to why.  urlLink This website  has the answer, I think..  All in all, I wish I had read about the band before going...the've had a tumutluous time of it, and I would have appreciated "The mac" a little bit more, with his bulging eyes, big grin, and electric vest.  We loved loved loved the bongo-playing chinese guy...what was his name? His rythms and Linsay's guitar riffs were pretty great...  And the smell of pot and kettle corn wafted through the air, filling our nostrils. :)  Thanks Mac!

      This seems to be the week where I am feeling happy for everyone else's success! Which doesnt bother me at all, because there are plenty of times when I am commiserating with things that are going wrong. My friend Steve (I can mention his full name because Im plugging for him...) just announced his honorable mentions at the fair via his "click-n-pay" web site, chock full of frameable photos. Some from Hawaii (whales and beaches), and some from China (people scenes, temples), they are all extremely sharp and colorful, but for that extra kick, the composition is EXCELLENT! I think my favorites are from Bora Bora. Steve doesnt know this, but for about a month I used his Bali H'ai pic as a desktop wall paper. :)  My new favorite is the Chinese ladies on a bicycle. ( urlLink William de Kooning , watch out!)  So, 'nuff said, go visit  urlLink Steve Azer's website  already and see for yourself. Oh. And he won FOUR honorable mentions at the San Diego County Fair (did I mention that?), as well as his pics appear on the cover of San Diego Weekly. This is one eye to watch...

      I caught this link on a fellow Blogger site, and wanted to share it with y'all: I feel  urlLink Great with Nutri grain !  Bleh, my narcissistic tendencies shall not be satisfied today - Blogspot is not showing me my published Blog. "Oh, my, just HOW am I to edit my masterpiece of genius musings?" (hand on face, eyes wide, puckered mouth) Could be the internet connection.  Lesson Learned: when in doubt, check yer connections  So, the plan today - clean house, play with my MAN, Jack, eat (love those carnitas burritos with chips and guacamole) watch DVD "Along came Polly", try to foget last nights showing of "Mystic River" by Clint Eastwood (speaking of Narcissistic tendencies...anytime a 70-year old gets jiggy with a 36-year old, SOMETHING  is wrong when said 7?-year old does a film about Child molesting. Wait, what does that have to do with Narcissistic tendencies? Dont know, but it sounded good)  Have a great Sunday, San Diego!

      Hi,  Well this weekend is almost over and here it is - Father's day!  Friday I took off to Downtown for a night of Bitter-sweet conversation, Bitter Apple martinis and a bit of Bitter dancing at the Bitter End. That was fun; I met a few nice people, a few interesting people, lost my disposable camera after having taken pictures of my cousin G* and her friend C*, dancing up a storm with some li'l cuties. Well what happens Downtown, stays Downtown I guess. ;)  Saturday was recovery day (on my advanced years, I cant do all-nighters anymore, darn!) and really got nothing done except read Maxim, and ate some tacos. While watching a DVD of "Carrie" by stephen king, (yikes I was so out of it I got the made-for-tv version instead of the really fabulous one with sissy spacek) anyways, while watching "Carrie", at about 10:00 on Saturday night, I get a phone call. From T*y buttons. He has some really great news, folks. The film company that he works with just won Two Emmys!!!! He was calling me from the San Diego Emmy Awards Party that was being held at the USS Grant Hotel. He had no one else but moi to share it with. I was at home with my boy-toy Jack, on the couch watching some girl get doused with pig blood. What a great evening!!!!  So check out the  urlLink Ortiz Film Works  website, for a list of their credits and accomplishments. And if you are a director with lots of cash who wants to make a movie or music video, hire them! They are hot!  Well, thats all for now. Im am very happy for them, and very very proud of T*y buttons. Congratulations, everyone at Ortiz Film Works!!!!

      I cant believe this! I am clueless in San Diego, thats why Im single in San Diego!!!!!  I have no idea where to go! Can someone out there help me? My cousins want a fun place to go, and they want lots of cute MEN. Not the gay ones, although they can sure dance well and smell divine. So Montage is out. Not on broadway AGAIN!!! please!!!!  Perhaps the "red circle"? I think the bitter end has lost its fun edge...these days. Any help!!!  Thanks, for helping a couple of depraved females...

      Im sorry, but I used to love that song...those were the only lines to it, it had a catchy beat, you blast it as you are driving down 5th avenue downtown San Diego ready to get down and funky...now with today's news, I will be turning it off when I hear it. ugh.  So, ok, I used to be a member of match.com. I thought Id found my match - he was a bit funky and different (Scientologist notwithstanding) and quirky, but turns out that he has this really dark side. Anyways, I blocked him from my work email, I circulated his contact info and picture to all the members of my company security department (I work for a government contractor. We have gates to keep the riff-raff like YOU out), I called the front desk person B*B, and gave her his info, I told my boss, I talked to the Office manager...Ive done EVERYTHING that I could. Yet, he emailed from a saved message I had sent him...he emailed through to my match.com id. I had forgotten to block that! Darn!  So girls and boys, if someone is annoying you, (or in my case threatening) from match.com, you have to block that too!   Well, its Friday, and my best friend canceled on this weekend, my cousin hasnt called or written and my other cousins want to "go out" tonight, and I just found out. How come I always find out at the last minute? Well anyways, it should be entertaining - Ill bring my camera this time. Last time...all the fun stuff was OFF camera. :) hehe.  I have no idea where we are going, but knowing those two itll be fun.

      Well, typically I would be out an about celebrating the end of the week, but here it is - Thursday evening and I STILL dont know what is going on this weekend. Not a single persona has decided to get back to me...ok, what the heck?  So I will pop on over to the Sporting Club one and SPA, do some weights, spin the cycle a bit, and then slink home to do some cleaning and watch the rest of the "Station Agent". Ill let you know what I think. So far I really really like it.

      We can write about anything here online, and so I thought that it would be great to expunge all my bitterness regarding my previous attempt at a normal relationship, here.  I read a quote from one of my groups, and it spoke volumes to me:    "People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them."  This seemed to be the ENTIRE description of what went wrong between K* and I. Besides the "bitter betty syndrome", he was fanatical about Scientology.  So I decided to do some research on good 'ole Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard. Such as - what the heck does the "L" stand for? (Lafayette Ronald Hubbard) So I took myself to the  urlLink Church of Scientology  website, first of all...  Here is what I found out: There are different levels of "enlightenment", called "clearing". Its like Regression Therapy, where you go back into time and throughout your past, and "clear" away all the bad experiences that are holding you back from attaining all your true power. One of those true powers are telekenisis. Didnt they ever read "Carrie"? Only adolescent girls are allowed to move things with just their minds.  So anyways, you pay through the nose for the different courses and learn all these new words. You are required to understand all the different words, and armed with a dictionary, you learn the definition of 'knowing' and 'knowingness'. 'Being' and 'beingness'. Isnt that nice? Just what I always needed to know. I needed to have beingness. (And at the end of the relationship, i was required to learn the definition of the words whore and prostitute. Girls, stay away from this one - email me and I will give you his name...)I learned also that the church of Scientology has been taken over by the American Medical Association, and now it is necessary to create your own "group", to study and follow Hubbards precepts. All his ideas of course are based on Science. I dont know what KIND of science, but well, it all seemed like new-age hokey sh!t to moi. So, I looked for the TRUTH about this religion, and found some interesting tidbits on   urlLink Operation Clambake    An interesting section that I found, was that focused on HOW they obtain reasonable people and turn them into veggies; titled  urlLink Thought Control and Scientology , detailing how they gradually take over your mind through sensory deprivation, and "trance-inducing" repetition.  HA! Sounds like any other religion to me! Just kidding.

      WEll, I guess to be fair, I should write about Gram's 75th birthday last weekend (June 12th).  So...reaching back...  I arrived Friday morning after getting up BEFORE the crack of dawn at aproximately 3:40 am. I woke up in a panic having gone out the night before and neglected my packing. Whew, plenty of time. My buddy-girl C* picked me up in a haze, tried to dump me off at the commuter terminal before finding out that to qualify as a "commuter" at Lindberg field, you must be going to LA. Well, Im way on my way to San Jose! Do you know the way to San Jose? (sorry HAD to do that)...  So I spent the entire day Friday hauling. moving, pushing and shoving, running around. Then saturday spent the rest of the say setting up speakers for Karioke, putting up balloons, stressing ebcause the caterers werent there (they finally got everything set up 3 hours after the party started!!!!)...lets face it - it was allotta work! Oh yah, Dad was miserable about the whole thing, and if he criticises me one more time Im going to scream...  But then, as soon as it was time to "turn on", I took a nice, deliciously hot shower, squeezed into my lime green dress (strapless -  my first one!) with a fringed bottom and lacy overlay, splashed on some makeup, and varooom! out I go...  It was a blast. We all got toasted (including my 16-year-old cousin who was currently taking a "vacation" from school, in other words he was kicked out) and sang karioke while DJ Daddy spun some tunes. Items of interest: JB, the black sheep of the family got accepted to Yale, and is on his way to becoming a doctor. Curious George was all over the girls, and finally drove me away, running and screaming...Darrins baby is exceptionally cute...who is she related to?  So the evening was fun for all. There was not a cloud in the sky, the garden had butterflies flitting in and out, the peace and tranquility of the Prunedale (that just makes your lips want to pucker up dont it?) countryside seemed to imbue all with a sense of calm and cheer.  The location was perfect - Carlos Perez, his house is perched on a hill, off of Garlen Drive in what is affectionately knowns as 'Prune-tucky", outside of Salinas California.  All in all it was in a word, perfect.  The next day we all piled into the dining room of the Hilton Hotel's restaruant, and binged at the all-you-can-eat buffet, chatting over eggs and mimosa. The three girls that had been out on the town all night the night before, they were in a world of hurt, but otherwise none-the-worse for wear. You know the saying, "what happens in Monterey, stays in Monterey....!"  Update: Gram was admitted to the emergency room of the monterey community hospital,  I called yesterday and she was all doped up. Also, mom was given drugs for a nasty viral infection. Otherwise everything is fine.

      People are always asking me why I am still single. My mother, Dad, Grandmother, new propects, etc. I always tell them that its because in San Diego, the men my age all like the 20-year olds. For proof, look on the dating site  urlLink match.com . Most, if not all men who are aged 35, want a woman aged 18-25. What can I do about that? And for further proof, look at the  urlLink Belgian pedophile ring  currently under investigation. Turns out that the corruption goes all the way to the top, through the entire legal system of cops and judges. And they wonder why the guy wasnt investigated properly? And they wonder why I am still single?  I mean, why go out with a 35-year old, educated, fit, attractive, strong-willed American female, when you can go across the border and get a hot little mexican 18-year old tamale?   Dont get me started. So, I am still just hanging out with my cat, listening to Sara McLachlan singing about being stupid. Thats moi...stupid choices by smart women. Isnt there a book out there? Is there a book called smart women, smart choices? Is there a mail-order groom site out there? :)  Lately Ive been thinking about enhancements...its been preying on my mind..."everyone who has them, loves them" I hear. Its not fair!  Speaking of fair, I havent been yet. Im thinking that I should go, but well, a night of battling the crowds as well as my weakness for fried oreos doesnt sound all that appealing. Besides, Ive already missed seeing the b-52's and journey perform, so whats the point?

      Did I mention that I am practically exploding from my sugar high? I just finagled an M&M cookie from hot computer guy, who also brought me one yesterday. :P   I guess that I will need to go to the gym after I pick up my car (which is STILL not ready, hello). While the car guys were replacing the darn battery, they decided to try to force my window up. Its sort of sticky and Ive got a major callous on my finger from having to press really really super hard to close it. So, they broke it and decided that I needed a new window closer, along with the new window. What started as a simple "minor tune and battery" turned into an all day car-orgy!     Thank you Brake Company and Moe from Eastgate towing!!!! Just kidding. Things will work out ok. Did i just say that? I must be a descendant of Anne Frank. You know who she is dont you? She discovered hot dogs. :)

      I just set this up TODAY, and already Im listed on another Blogger site, http://sandiegobloggers.com/, created by Joe Crawford at artlung.com. Check out the other San Diego bloggers!!!  ............................................  Ive got the biggest crush on the guy/boy at Starbucks. He blushes when I talk to him, its so cute! Hes like waaaaaaay too young for me (you know I like the older dudes in their 40's and 50's) but you know, he'd be fun to hang out with. No baggage, no "bitter betty" bullsh!t as my cousin Gwen would say, and no kids or divorces. Ok I am assuming this, we havent gone beyond "I'll have a tall split and a vente ice water. With a STRAW. And a LID. I jogged to work today, stopped by my starbucks at the Costa Verde Center and BOTH the Starbucks Cuties (as they shall be called henceforth as I have no idea of their given names) were vying for my attention. Ok, so my ego is getting big, they were being nice and chatted with me.  Soooo, anyhoo...I jogged to work today because my car is at the shop. The battery died and I thought it would be a great idea. It sounded good at the time. OK. Well my Lungs are now black, but heck, I burned off a few hundred aclories. The hill at Genesee killed me. The cars whizzing by (and you know who you are) almost killed me. I should change this BLOG to "single and uninjured in San Diego". :) haha.  ..........................................  Whoo hoo. I get to go to the Fleetwood mac concert on tuesday!!! Whoo hooo!!!!  ..........................................  Ive also got a huge crush on my friends friend, and the computer guy at General Atomics. They are all pretty cute. And single. Any single gals out there? I could set you up. Computer guy has a dog, so you cant be allergic and have a cat. And mind his roomates/best friends. friend-of-friend is lots of fun and likes to go out to clubs. His travel schedule might be annoying, but he likes to give massages so I guess it balances out. :)

      Wow, its hard to believe , Dear Friends, that I am suddenly single again. It seems like it should be a lot easier to find a mate in a city that boasts over 3 million people. And one Scientologist. :)   ..............................................................   Seriously though, I am going through the depressed-then-pissed-off phase, you know the one...its descibed as a loss that is like death. So Ive been lethargically completing my 30-minute workouts (hey 30 minutes is a long time to be standing up), pull myself home somehow, flop onto the couch with a bag of trailmix in hand and grab the "clicker". In between wonderful movies such as Footloose, and Love, actually, I engage in long, meaningful conversations with my cat. He has such interesting viewpoints...Id like to share.   ................................................................   #1 Playtime is important and superscedes everything else in life - even licking ones butt. #2 Feet, paper, string, fingers, hair - everything qualifies as a mousy-toy. #3 Politicians dont feed you tuna, they feed you bull. Vote for those that promise to feed you tuna and deliver, because they will get tired of you crying for tuna. Eventually. #4 Cats DO like fruit. #5 If you have to ask if it looks good, or if it makes you look fat, then it probably does. I will look at you as if Im interested, but its the same way I stare out the window or look at the wall - it means nothing except that you seem like you want to feed me Tuna. #6 Miss Elephant really likes it.   ............................................................................   Suddely single means never having to say you are sorry - and never having to go for that Brazilian torture device they call a wax. I found this out, one pain-filled day, tears pricking my eyes. If you do decide to 'go brazilian',  Ask for Stephanie at Brazilia Skincare. She will lie to you when you ask if it will hurt, which will make your heart stop pounding in your chest for a little bit. And then she will tell you how much she hated the corporate world and how much she loves her new career ripping peoples hair out. :)   ...........................................................................   Speaking of hair - ever have one of those really, truly bad days, where you come home and hack off all your hair with a pair of cheap drugstore scissors? Well I did recently and boy was THAT liberation at its finest. Talk about washing the man out of your hair? Well I CUT him out of my hair, and now I feel a true lightness. Yes, folks, a total of 7 inches came off somewhere (ok, dont ask ME, IM not a stylist, but it will be a few months before I can face Jennifer. I know she will take one look at what Ive done and grimace like shes in pain. Like she is getting a Brazilian.) Its really a co-dependent relationship we develope with our stylists, you know. They depend on us for cash, and we need them to talk to, make us feel good and help us improve our self-esteem. Like a therapist that cant prescribe anything harder than a shiner or shampoo. As I was cutting, I thought to myself....'wow, Im really going off the deep end arent I? What will everyone think? Wow, how can I DO this?' And then I just said 'F&^%k it, who cares?' The ends were dead, so I put them in their little white porcelain coffin and flushed them down! :)   ..........................................................................   By the way did everyone read the article about dogs knowing more than 200 words? Anyone who has ever had a pupster knew this a long time ago. Everyone has had to spell out w-a-l-k sometime in their lives...I mean ...did they really need to do a study on this? Does this mean they are sending German Shorthairs and Golden Retrievers to Iraq now? Sorry Harlan and Reba, you know Im grinning as I say this...   ........................................................................   Speaking of dogs, I was playing fetch with Jack the cat the other evening after a hefty spin class, and was thinking, 'what if I could train him to go to the bathroom in the toilet?' Wouldnt that be a cool cat trick? So I looked it up on the net and sure enough I found step-by-step instructions on potty-training your cat! So I thought I would share this priceless picture with everyone.  urlLink http://www.karawynnnet/mishacat/toilet.html    Isnt that cute?   ...........................................................................   Speaking of cute, has everyone seen the memorial pictures of Ronald Regan? Poor guy, I think it was time- I mean he WAS 93. And EVERYONE wants to see his poor lifeless body. WHY? The guy was our president, but WHY? High ick factor there.   ..........................................................................   So what has this Suddenly Single been up to lately? Opening day at the Polo field in Del Mar for starters. This is where I was able to watch the horses frolic around a field, stomp the divets and follow the chuckers. If you dont know what that is, youll have to go and find out for yourself. I was also able to learn more about Restraining orders than I ever cared to know. And darn it, but I took notes. You know, just in case the security guards at the front gate, south end and north end as well as the front desk receptionist fail me. :)   ........................................................................   Then there was the Beach Boys concert that same evening - the first concert of the summer at the famed Humphreys. The sky was overcast but it was warm, with a friendly easy atmosphere. They were out of tune, but I doubt anyone cared. I saw 20-year olds singing along to all the favorites like "I get around", and 60-year olds dancing like they were at the sock-hop-by-the-sea. So imagine my surprise when, during a  bathroom break after the concert, I wandered off and met Mike Love!!!! For those that dont know who that is...thats the LEAD freaking singer, man. And for those that dont know who the Beach boys are...and you know who you are...they are most famous for the FIRST version of "California Girls". I guess that means me. But let me remind you, I am a Central Coast California girl. What does that mean exactly? It means that when I smell cow doo dee, I think of broccoli. It means no plastic...er, "enhancements". It means "pale face", knowing the various brands of chewing tobacco, knowing that cold is 40 degrees not 60, and it means trees that arent black and still smoking from the last fire.   Hope every has a great weekend. This Suddenly Single Central Coast 'California Girl', will be flying back to a place called "Prunedale" for her Grandmothers 75th birthday

      Whats new in the land of the Suddenly single? Well, how about a review of the best places to goggle the other supposedly singles, suddenly singles and permanently singles, and see if we can tell the difference between them. Our favorite places are in the La Jolla/Del Mar area, but there are lots more yet to discover, say Downtown San Diego, and Mission Valley.   Cafe Japengos - known for its BUSTling Thursday nights, this crowd is a little more relaxed these days. Here you will see mostly blonde and gray hair - blonde women and gray-haired men chasing them! You can get the best sushi in san diego here as well as the best apple martini. All this after working out at the club/spa sporting club one across the circle.   Epazotes/Cafe Pacifica - Del mar is not only famous for its horses, but its long-legged FILLIES!!! Here you get a much mellower scene, where you can start at Epazotes, stroll across to Cafe Pacifica, then wine-down at the wine bar at Il Forniao. This is my personal favorite, but watch out - here is where you are most likely to be taken in by a beautiful sunset and romanced into thinking a permanently single is just a regular old single (You see there are differences). Here you will be lulled by the sound of the fountian tinkling as you sip a special port or smoke a special cigar. Dont fall asleep, or like a midsummers night dream, you will wake up to find yourself with bruises and not know where they came from!   what else? There is Dobsons Downtown, where I hear the lawyers lurk, and then Gordon Beirsh, the younger business/networking crowd.   This suddenly single has decided that she will not be going to these places anymore, due to an unfortunate incident involving too much, too soon, and not enough from the wrong person! You figure that one out and you win the "suddenly single sweepstakes". :)  When suddenly single, it is generally a good idea to call all the people that you forgot about while not single, and re-connect, apologising and supplicating yourself until it becomes embarrassing for said friends. They will forgive you, but you must try harder next time you are not single to maintain contact or they may forget about you.  Places to take those that you are kissing up to: Art - The Vatican is coming out of the closet - er - showing itself - er - displaying its treasures (oh! I give UP) at the San Diego Museum of art, in a rare never before seen in public appearance. music - the yeah yeah yeahs are playing at Soma, soon. Very high cool factor. duh. For the rest of you yahoos, Friday is the "your 5" concert with Jessica simpson and a bunch of un-altered MUSICIANS. Sports - The rock and roll marathon is coming up - running, drinking and bands - a great event to spend all our suddenly single time preparing for!   When suddenly single, I found that the best therapy was window-shopping for things that any of your exes would not have approved of - open-toed shoes, low-rise jeans, new peircings- this time in your tongue.   Keep to your friends, friends, and you'll never go wrong.

      So the Sara concert (you know, THE Sarah...) was excellent and full of warm vibes all around. But lets start at the beginning shall we?  The weekends always start on Friday, and so naturally I left early and went straight to my apartment to pack. You see, I'd gone out the night before to celebrate the weekend. Thursdays are always fun at Japengos. Friday evning, I dressed in my new outfit, a sporty white denim mini-skirt and a white Guess? tanktop with lace that showed *Gasp* my belly-button. I guess skin is no longer in, but in Vegas I figured it was a requirement. I arrived in a hot, muggy Vegas airport and saw my love, J*, who greeted me with "guess what, I just won some money". Ok, how much I ask. "about 1000 dollars at blackjack". Ok, so our trip has been paid for already!  He whisks me to the hotel room and we wash our faces and pop into the Hard Rock Hotel lobby where there are clothes from the Temptations and Elvis in glass cases.  Then off to a very nice dinner with steak and Champaigne. His two favorites apparently.  Saturday: A day at the spa where I was massaged and trimmed, then worked out (ok, so Ive gained a few pounds since then....) and then off for an impromptou shopping trip at the Bellagio. I am now the proud new owner of a small, black leather chanel purse! Id card and everything! The concert was in the Mandalay Bay Hotel complex, and at the time there were 3 concerts going on simultaneously. Wow. Snoop, Sarah, and someone else...cannot remember who. Well, we traipsed on over in the Hard Rock car, and entered the theater excitedly. The crowd was a mix of older/younger, straight/lesbian/gay. Hushed we listened as she belted/growled/whispered the words of all our favorite songs. J* actually enjoyed her music, and made the comment "her music sounds sort of country"...   :)  Sunday: A day by the poool in the middle of a huge pool-party called "rehab". We had a hosted cabana that ordinarily goes for about 250US$ per day, ordered some Vueve Cliquote Champaigne in a  cold bucket, some mexican food from "Pink Taco",  and enjoyed ourselves as we both obained deep-tissue massages from Michelle - a very talented massuesse.  Crowds of beautiful, tanned, oiled, outrageous people thronged around the pool, a circle of blue water flanked with sand.  At various junctures, waterfalls spilled into this pool, and in the center was a bar and "wet blackjack" tables. In secret corners of this pool, small hot tubs and wading pools gave the illusion of privacy.  The hot, sunny Vegas day, turned cloudy and muggy, and suddenly a lightning rainstorm crashed overhead. It was amazing, as florescent white light cracked the blue vegas facade. The lightning made J* a little nervous, but otherwise we hung out the window like kids at the carnival.  That, folks, was the "softer side" of Vegas. :)
