       I am so sick and tired of the snow, I could kill someone. It is February 25 (My birthday!) and it's snowing freakin hard.   Have you ever seen the movie Superstar? With Molly Shannon? I love that movie. It's so funny.  Anyway, haven't had time to post a lot...been busy, but had to post today because it's my birfday!!

      It seems like every time I turn on the damn TV, that messed up Quizno's commercial is on. Has anyone else see that? It's like these demented looking hamster thingys with poppy eyes and little black hats on...and human teeth? I don't know what those guys were smoking when they thought of that commercial, but it freaks me out. My brother thinks it's the funniest thing ever...so that makes it even more annoying when it comes on, because he starts giggling,  yes giggling , uncontrollably EVERY time. The song is even more disturbing...I have no clue what they're talking about, some new sandwhich, but there's little pop-up "talking clouds" that pop up whenever their freakish mouths open...dancing mexican hamsters...greeeat idea. If you ever want a commercial that caters to people who find amusement in dancing mexican hamsters promoting a sandwhich, hire stoners or crackheads for your advertising people.  But as weird as that commercial is, I can honestly say that it does hold my interest for the 60 seconds it's on...way to go Quizno's! I'm proud to say that I eat sandwhiches from a restaurant that advertises with dancing mexican hamsters...! ;)  Found a picture of the dancing hamsters if you're curious...I'm not exactly sure how to upload or put pics into messages yet, so here's the link to the Quizno's site...sorry - www.quiznos.com

      So I'm sitting here in computer class, trying to find out how to change my stupid blog skin to one that isn't dumb like the ones that Blogger provide...dumb. My computer teacher really freaks me out...hope she doesn't read that. This class is so boring.   We're supposed to be working on profiles for college, but it's a Friday, and I'm thinking I'm going to screw the portfolios for today. I'm surfin the web for pictures instead ;) Websense isn't cooperating though, crap.  My friends and I are making future plans to go to college in Hawaii and become professional surfers...my other friend will be hanging out in the strip clubs she said. She wants to go to New York to visit the Night at the Roxbury club...too bad it's in LA. Now they've changed their minds to Florida...I could live in South Beach for 4 years :P  My friend's trying to figure out where her great-aunt lives..."it's next to Las Vegas"...I asked her if she meant a state or a city; she said she didn't know. I started naming off all the major Nevada cities, then the states next to Nevada...she said no, not any of those. Wait, she's got it figured out...here she goes..."OH! It's Nevada!"...well DER, Las Vegas is IN Nevada...ahh, my friend's brain at it's best. Now she's talking about farting for her "Valedictorian" speech...fascinating.

      Anyone who has seen Shrek 2 will know what the title means...I just went with the family to see it the other night. It was really good, way better than the first one I thought - although it had more stuff, like jokes/humor for adults, so a lot of the people in the theater w/ their kids didn't like it. The best parts were the ones w/ Pinnochio and the little ginger bread guy - those two crack me up. Puss in Boots was so cute too!!...and sorry to spoil the ending, but Fiona and Shrek should have just stayed "normal", because Shrek was a babe...haha, If I find a pic I'll post it, but I can't find one yet...Anyway, I definitely recommend it, it's a great movie :P GO SEE IT!

      Anyone watch American Idol last night? Well, if ya did, and even if ya didn't, it was no big surprise - Fantasia won. I still can't believe that Simon told her on Tuesday night that she was the best finalist that the show had ever seen; I don't think she was better then Kelly Clarkson or even Ruben or Clay. I actually wanted LaToya to win, and I thought she was the favorite with the judges too. I don't know why the Hawaiian girl AND Diana DeGarmo got through the voting, well, and Fantasia too for that matter, and LaToya got voted off. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU AMERICAN PEOPLE?? lol, just kdding,   Anyway, nothing new, just typing my History Final Term Thesis, it's waaaaaaaay cool.  And I was looking through pics on our computer last night and I found this picture, it's of one of the Golden Retreiver puppies my dog had last spring - what a schweetheart!

      Just looked at our school's 2004 annual - pretty lame. I can't believe I spent $30 just to look at the same picture 20 times, just cropped and sized different. Now I'm sad, and disappointed - I should just go buy a cooler annual from another school, and show it to my kids when they're graduating from this piece-of-crap-annual school and say "Don't you wish you could have gone to the  cool  school  I went to?"...that could definitely work.

       From kfty.com...    Stars Try to Save Malibu Chicken Restaurant  Comedian Adam Sandler has backed a campaign to halt the closure of a Malibu, California, chicken store - a favorite of such stars as Meg Ryan, Pierce Brosnan and Barbra Streisand.  After eight years in the business, small surf eatery Malibu Chicken - which also caters to Sylvester Stallone, Dennis Quaid and Jim Carey - may have to close as early as the summer because the lease is up and Chabad, the organization which owns the building, wants them out.  A petition drive has been started to save Malibu Chicken, and nearly 2,000 people, including Sandler, have signed it.  Malibu Chicken boss Sharon Caples tells Celebrity Justice, "Adam Sandler comes in low key with sunglasses on. We all know who he is because he's a regular here."  Just last weekend, Sharon served Jermaine Dupri while his fiancee, Janet Jackson, waited in the car. He also signed the petition on the way out.  Caples is upset because she believes Chabad wants to move in and open its own chicken place - taking her customers with them.  The head Rabbi at Chabad has yet to comment on the situation.

       Found this cool site tonight called "Gadzillion Things to Think About" -  urlLink   - here are a few things on there that are good points to think about...  1. What do you call a UFO after it has landed?  2. Can a person with no eyebrows look surprised?  3. In elementary school in case of fire you have to line up quietly in a single file    line from smallest to tallest. What is the logic here? Do tall people burn slower?  4. Shouldn't the definition of "unless" be more?  5. What does a vegetarian cannibal eat?  lol, check out all the other ones, it'll keep ya goin for, like, the rest of your life -  urlLink

       School is over FINALLY. My god, it took forever. Now I get to go on vacation, to the beach! It's gonna be sweet getting away from everyone, just getting to walk on the beach and do WHATEVER I WANT without anyone to tell me what to do, how to do it, where, when, all that other crap you have to put up with in school. It's going to be cool playing summer league basketball too...Anyway, just had to share the joy of school ending with anyone who reads this (probably no one), but anyway...

      Wow, my television watching experience was awesome yesterday...lol - I swear I have a life  Anyway, first I was just watching boring stuff during the day, ya know - re-runs, syndicated sitcoms, the mix - but  then  I went out to my aunt's house with her satellite and everything...I was flipping through the channels, and flipped on to Hannibal, watched that for awhile, and then started flipping again.  Now starts the cool part: I was looking through the satellite guide, and saw the title of this movie that was on called "Isn't She Great"...I was like, OMG! I've been wanting to see this stupid movie for a loooong time - It has Nathan Lane, Bette Midler, and a whole bunch of other people in it, and it looked/sounded really good - plus I love Nathan Lane, but I don't have satellite so I could never catch it when it was on. So I watched most of that - GOOD MOVIE!  Then I was flipping again after the movie was over and came across the first game in the Lakers/Pistons series...watched that, pretty good game, and then I about peed my pants when Detroit beat the Lakers at the Lakers  homecourt , Staples Center. It was sweeter than a gum drop dipped in frosting! Hahaha  Anyway, that was my good tv experience, not like anyone cares...haha

       RIGHT ON! THE DETROIT PISTONS ARE GOING TO THE FINALS BABY!! Too bad Minnesota didn't get past the Lakers, because I HATE the Lakers, and I HATE Kobe, and I don't hate Shaq but think he's not that great at basketball - but I like Karl Malone...anyway, it's too bad that Sacremento didn't just beat Minnesota, and then waste LA, because then it would have been my team the SACREMENTO KINGS winning the Championship! Anyway, I hope Detroit gets LA, because I really want to see them win rather than the Lakers  Although, I guess it wouldn't be so bad if LA won just this year because it would be cool for Karl Malone to get a ring! And maybe if Gary Payton got one he would just retire for crying out loud, and we could be done with him!

       Today was a Queer day. Watched the Fab 5 for a couple of hours - two pretty good ones, too.  The first one&nbsp;had this 50-something, poker-playing, surfer-dude dad named John S. from Brookyln.&nbsp; He was getting ready to have his monthly poker night, and so the guys (girls?) wanted to clean him up and make his poker night a "real" guy's night out.   So anyway, this guy really did look like a beach bum, or "beach homeless" as Carson put it, and so did his house, so they started like they always do by tearing apart everything. This guy's house wasn't  that  bad, thanks to his wife I think, so they got that done pretty quick, and then headed down to HUGO something er other to get him some non-beachy-bummy clothes. They picked out mostly "earth" toned pants and dressy flip-flops, and some pin-striped shirts and (again Carson) "Ocean's Eleven" jackets.&nbsp; They topped all the outfits off with some casino-ee looking sunglasses.  After the clothes they go and give this guy a MUCH NEEDED haircut. I mean, this guys hair was preeeety awesome, but he looked waaay better with a good trim. Before the cut, his hair was  atleast  down to his shoulders and REALLY messy. The hair stylist cut it back to a nice little wavy style, and it looked really good for John S.&nbsp; ;) Anway, after the haircut, Kyan got him and gave him some hair stuff and some sunscreen, lol, because John never wore any, and he played&nbsp;a lot of beach volleyball...way to go John.   Before the day was out, Ted took him to the Brooklyn Brewery to see how beer is made! What a trip. They got to tast the diff. b/t fermented and unfermented beer, mmmmm, and then they made there way to the Official Brooklyn Brewery Bar, where they tasted some fresh beer right off the assembly line, haha. Then they went back to John's totally redecorated and fabulous looking house (Kudos to Thom) and Ted showed John how to make a club sandwich, and showed John how the new drawer handles in his kitchen worked as  beer bottle openers!  Yay! Actually, no, bad mistake Ted. After the group had left, John drank about 6 or&nbsp;7 beers before the guys even showed up for the poker game.  After making the sandwiches, John went up and changed into his "Ocean's Eleven" look, with only  one  flaw. He put on the nice shirt, the nice pants, the nice jacket, but then put on his "nice" flip-flops, much to the dismay of Carson. It was funny too, before he got dressed, he'd just gotten out of the shower and was going to put the gel stuff in his hair. So he squirts some into his hand, and just as Kyan was telling him to spread it in his hands, John takes the whole mound of it on his hands and plops it into his hair and spreads it around - I thought Kyan was going to cry :P  So then we make it to the final Queer moment - the Poker game. When the doorbell finally rang, it was a bunch "EY OWYA DOOIN?!" like in the Sopranos when all the guys walked in (all wearing nice suit jackets, so John wasn't left out). One of the goals for John was to actually not get drunk and  win  the poker game - the boys even got him a nice poker table to go on his dining room table. So John, already having those 5 or 6 beers  before  hand, didn't do too well. He did ok, I guess, but didn't win it - and he was bummed.   He even told all his pals that he wanted to win the game, just for the guys :( Poor John.  However, John actually  was  a winner, because  he  looked better, his  house  looked better, and his very lovely wife  felt  better when she got home from her "girls night out" with her daughter, arranged by Jai (what a sweety).  Anyway, this guy sort of reminded my of  my  dad (actually just the hair), so I was thinking I should see if the Fab 5'll come down to Hooterville and give my dad a makeover...haha! He would most likely kill himself, or better yet,  me.

       I've never really believed in "dream interpretation" or anything...I've just always thought a dream was a dream. I always just dreamed about meaningless things...things that had to do with what I had been thinking during the day or week, whatever. I've been having dreams lately though, not frequently however, about a guy, obviously a guy who is my boyfriend, but I don't know him.   The first dream I had was a while ago, but it involved a guy who I felt like I knew from somewhere, but couldn't place. The dream had something to do with a pool, I think we were swimming or something, or maybe he was swimming, I don't really remember, but it went something like that. The whole dream, which was pretty short, went just with me and him being together, just talking I guess, with a couple of other friends there at the pool with us. It had an abrupt end (I woke up before it actually came to an end), and when I tried to go back to sleep and finish it, it never "reconnected", so I just sort of forgot about it.   The second dream came just a couple of nights ago, and it had typically the same, err, "plot" if you will. It started (from what I remember) with me standing in front of this huuuuge swimming pool, like, staring at it I guess, and then this guy came up behind me and picked me up into his arms and carried me into the pool with him. The guy was different than the guy in my first dream, but still good-looking, and had some of the same features as the first guy - dark hair and eyes, taller than me. Anyway, this guy carries me into the pool, and then after that, it's like, he just has his arms around me and were hanging out, like, talking again I guess.  The one thing I distinctly remember about both of these dreams was the feeling I had during and after them. I felt totally secure (obviously, with a boyfriend), but it was deeper than that - I felt, so, happy...like, complete or something. Obviously that means that I need/want a boyfriend, but it's weird. I don't ever feel that way when I'm awake, in my "real" life. As a matter of fact, I feel that most guys that would be "boyfriend material" for most girls seem to be just another thing to deal with in my life...I guess I'm one of those people that everyone thinks are desperate when they say "I'm waiting for Mr. Right"...which I am, but I'm definitely not desperate.   Tonight I was desperately bored however, and I was thinking about my "dream guy", and so I googled about dream analysis. I went to this one site, most of the stuff that I had looked at on this site was bogus, but then I looked at this "dream dictionary" and looked under "P" for Pool. Here's an "explanation" for the whole pool thingy from both dreams:  "To see a pool of water in your dream, denotes that you will find much happiness and pleasure in love and marriage. Your social life will keep you busy."  This is what the dictionary said, and so I guess my "dream analysis" for the week is that when, or if, I ever find a guy that I like/love, it will by a happy relationship, which I guess is what I felt during and after the dream. I'm not exactly sure what the whole "social life will keep me busy" thing is about, but maybe I'll find out in my next dream...dun dun DUN!!!
