      Yes, this is the second entry in a day. Bored I am.  I have had a really bad week. Probably one of the worst in recent history. The thing is, it was actually one of the best weeks of my life too. Quite a conundrum. I don't think that's even a fucking word but ask me if I care.  Well, my heart got broken today. Usually I try to stay away from writing in this thing when I am in this kind of mood because I fucking CANNOT STAND when people whine away online about their personal bullshit that no one even cares about.  So let me just say, before I start, that I am aware no one cares.   It wasn't that I was in love with this boy. I haven't even known him very long. He's not the hottest guy I have ever been with, or the funniest, and he's actually probably one of the dumbest.&nbsp; The only thing that we had going is we had an eerie physical chemistry that I have only had with one other person in my life. Being with him took me back to that time which is probably why I am so sad it's over. It's like going back to that time all over again. Painful.  BLAH BLAH FUCKING BLAH.  I miss the past. I haven't been with a ton of people and most of them... Don't stand out all that much to me. Some of them I still talk to, most of them I don't.&nbsp; I have no desire to talk to them. I don't miss them. I don't wonder what they're doing.  But I miss this one. Its been years now and I still think about him every single day. I haven't been able to admit that but it's just the damn truth. No one will ever stack up to him.   When do people get over this bullshit? Fuck.

      Man, what a month fucking July has been.  So I've been drinking Slim Fast for about 3 weeks now. I mean nothing but Slim fast. I have some weight I gained over the winter that is usually off by now but didn't shed as normal so I went to drastic measures to rid my ass of it. And its ALL in my ass, baby. I hate my genetic makeup. Thanks Dad, for the Compton prostitute booty.  I don't have all that much to say. I got a second job to make up for the one I lost about 3 weeks ago. It's waitressing which sucks but it's also SINGING waitressing which is just kind of embarrassing. I hadn't done that gig since my days on The Annebell Lee my senior year of high school. Its money though, something I am in dire need of.&nbsp;   My friend Paige is coming out to Nevada to live with me until I go back East. I can't wait to have her here. We are going to own this town. You know how you have those friends that you feel, when they're around, you can do anything? She is one of those. I haven't had that kind of company in a long while. Life is all about the people that surround you and the people that surround me now are ridiculously flat and dull.  Like my roommates. They ridiculously suck. One of them is 23 like me and the other is 32. Now if I am 32 and I am still living with people in their early 20's in a rented house, how about you just shoot me? My roommates drink wine and read O Magazine. In case you didn't know that's fucking OPRAH magazine. I am too young to be doing either of those things. Wine is not good. I don't care how aged it is, if it's Merlot or Chardonnay or what the fuck ever... Wine is piss. They have all these wine books and they like to go to wine tastings and the Old One is actually taking some kind of wine CLASS. Stupid.   They don't like me all that much either. They talk to me like I am 12 in those high phony voices where the word "Hi" lasts for way too many syllables. I hate how they cock their heads at me when I am talking to them. I also hate how theycall their drinks "cocktails." I don't know, it annoys me. It's a DRINK, bitches. Sorry to tell you but you do not live in New York and you are not Carrie Bradshaw. You are boring and I hate you.  I can't wait to leave this place.  The only other thing that has happened is I was seeing a boy for a very short amount of time but today I found out he has also been seeing someone else at the same time.&nbsp; Fuck it all. There is nothing left to redeem this place.&nbsp; I don't mind so much that he is seeing someone else as I mind that I didn't know about it. It makes me feel stupid.   &nbsp;

      So I haven't written a decent update in a while. These are some things that have happened. &nbsp; 1. I went out of town. 2. I decided after leaving town that it was nice to be out of town therefore I will soon be MOVING out of town. 3.&nbsp; I met a Mormon cowboy and went on the worst date I have ever been on. 4. I was bought a lap dance by&nbsp;an "American Idol"&nbsp;at Spearmint Rhino.  5.&nbsp; I moved in with two heinous bitch roommates that hate me and who I mutually hate. &nbsp; So I've been busy. &nbsp; I have also gotten the chance to catch up with people I haven't talked to in AGES and that has been very very good. This is going to sound horrible but the reason it was good to hear from them is because it was good to hear they're as miserable as me. &nbsp; Let me explain... I have been in a bad mood for a good two years now. I left college and I didn't know what the hell to do with myself. I still am not sure. I am as lost as ever but I have adjusted to this. Most of my friends are now recent college graduates and their lives, thus, are in turmoil. Some of them are amazed that they are stuck working in jobs they could have gotten right out of high school.  &nbsp; IT SUCKS DOESN'T IT? &nbsp; I am just happy not to be living in post-college hell by myself any more. I also feel like the "wise one", a veteran of reality.&nbsp; It's a sad title but I get my kicks where I can nowadays. &nbsp; There is more I want to write but not right now. This first entry blows. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well dammit, it's time to change again. My old journal is still up (heeyjude.easyjournal.com) but they make me pay now and I don't want to.  So here's the hot spot. Right. I will post more later.

      Money, or actually the lack thereof, is ruining my life.  That is all.

      Yeah, I don't write much any more.  I think I am friggin falling in love, dammit. In my last entry I discussed having a broken heart but, fortunately, this was just a false alarm. I have met someone. After a couple of years of temporary boyfriends and horrific dates to the Olive Garden, Alison has finally found a keeper. So far so good anyway.  Blah blah blah though, who wants to hear about that shit?  Rick James is dead.  Now they say it was from "natural causes" but come on... There was NOTHING natural about his death, I am sure. Besides he was 58, I thought you had to be really old to die from natural causes. What the fuck is a natural cause anyway??  I can't believe I met someone in Vegas. Fucking A, this wasn't suppose to happen.  Peace out, boy scout.
