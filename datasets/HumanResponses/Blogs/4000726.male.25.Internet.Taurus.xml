       Back again with my blog. Too busy & too lazy to write yesterday, so I'll try to make it up today.   This whole blog thing has become a daily routinity for me, in the morning I'll read all my blog friends and in the afternoon I'll write my blog. And u know what, it's quiet fun too. Don't u all agree with me ... :D. Hehehehehe.    &nbsp;  Before I continue this, I wanna answer Jus' question. Which part of Olive's writing that inspire me to create my own blog ? The answer is in this sentences : " I think actually a lot of people like to writing, but they don't have time to write, maybe they just doesn't wanna to try to write. It's a pity right? Coz writing can help to heal our mind, help our soul, help us to understand other people."  This is a comment she write when she read&nbsp;one of her friend's blog. Actually I like all her writing but   this lines really "a-slap-in-the-face" for me that make me wanna try it for my self.    &nbsp;  Today we'll gonna watch Twilite Orchestra ... yipppiiiii. Twilite Orchestra, theme of the day. :D Just look our blogs, hehehe. I'm not a really big fan of orchestra, 'cause it always related to classic music with those big&nbsp;and&nbsp;high-pitched voices ... that sometimes wanna make u put something to their mouth to stop them from singing (just in my imagination, of course). hehehhehe. But&nbsp;I do love the instruments' sound, where else u can find lots of instruments played together in such harmony and create such amazing sound except at the orchestra. That's why I'm looking forward to watch this concert. Hope this will be as great as i expect, or I will put something definitely ... :))    &nbsp;  And I have save the best for the last. I finally decided to take the offer. So ... watch out, here i come. Hip .. hip .. huray, hip .. hip .. huray, hip .. hip .. huray.    &nbsp;  Clock is ticking, time to go home now & prepare my self for the concert.    Bobyee now ... muaaah    &nbsp;  Imagination is more important than knowledge

       Just had a yummy lunch, "ayam suwar suwir" & "sambel goreng ati". Slurp .. slurp ... slurp. After weeks of "Jula-Juli" finally we had another place to go for lunch. Fiuuuhhh ... feels so relieved :D Like always, now it's time for sleepy mode. Huahuhaauhuahuahua ...    &nbsp;  Last night my sister came out with a big offer. An offer i surely can't resist. A chance of a lifetime ... hehehehe. Take it or leave it, that is the question.&nbsp;Deep down I'm eager to accept it, but my rational side says don't 'cause this cost lots of money eventhough it's not my money. Money which she had after work hard for years, but&nbsp;now&nbsp;I'll spend it for my own pleasure. Then what kind of person i am that could do such thing (I kinda dramatizing things, am I ? :D).&nbsp;&nbsp;I must give the answer this evening, but i still can't decide it yet :( Money ... money ... money, why everything must be about this thing?    &nbsp;  Had a big question in my mind for last few weeks. About all the friendship things ... What if u consider a person as ur friend but that person doesn't think the same about u ? Should&nbsp;we still consider that person as our friend, although the person didn't ? Or we just ignore it,&nbsp;play by their game&nbsp;& pretend to be friend ? Got to stop right here, or something will come out. :D      &nbsp;  End of my blog for today. Adios amigos.    &nbsp;  U are what u think u are.

       Horeeeey ... finally i have my own blog.   Actually i'm not the one who created this blog,  urlLink Pei Pei &nbsp;(a friend of mine) created this blog for me. I think she had tired hearing all the excuses i told why i still don't create my blog, so she decided to create one for me&nbsp;:D I do appreciate this (thx a lot Pei, muaaaaah ...), but ... Pei Pei can't u find a better name for my blog, "puzzle bobble" what kind of name is that :(( Life must goes on&nbsp;... and I&nbsp;think i can life with that name.    &nbsp;  At first, I'm not to excited having my own blog. There are tons of reasons I can think & mention, but&nbsp; urlLink Olive 's blog (my friend's friend ... & she don't know me at all) really inspired me to create my own blog. Thanx to Olive then (hope u'll read this, i think u're one unique person ... :D)    &nbsp;  Hope this blog could be the place where i can share & express my feelings (i'm a bit difficult to express my feelings ... maybe this blog could be a helpful media), my opinions &amp; thoughts, my ideas, and others, also a place where i can practice my English & my writing skill of course ... hehehe.    &nbsp;  That's all for my first blog, try my best&nbsp;to update it regularly. So stay tune to this blog guys ...       &nbsp;  PEACE be with U

       It's blog time. First of all ... TWILITE ORCHESTRA :D The orchestra was great, really ... really great. WoW, WoooOOOoooW, WoooOOOoooOOOoooW, and WoooOOOoooOOOoooOOOoooW. "Kuereeeen abisssssss dah" (sorry, i can't find the words in English). It turned out to be such an amazing orchestra, it was WOW'er (is this a word ? hehehhe) than I can expect. The whole performance that night was great, except the first performance of the "rocker" (u all know which one, do u? :D). I surely can't hear his voice at all, the instruments' sound is louder than his voice. Me and Pei Pei were laughing when he appears again to perform duet with Christian Abimanyu (here comes the clown, that's what came up in my mind), but the duet and then next the triplet was good though. But again I still consider him as the "less good" part of the orchestra, he acts well but he can't sing well :D Christian Abimanyu not at hist best that night, the woman (i don't know her name) voices was awesome, Rossa was not bad (but not good also, not good enough to be in orchestra), the young man (i don't know his name either) with voice that would make him one of Indonesian Idol's contestant, the funny & amazing trumpet Trio, and of course the irresistable Adie MS that conduct such beautiful orchestra. I knew some of the songs played and feels like watching "Moulin Rouge" movie in live (just the songs though).   Back to the orchestra ... this orchestra was really far from classic and really really far from what I imagine, I think Adie MS had done great to make this orchestra more acceptable for a lot of people and not just for some "hi-class society". I really enjoy the show &amp; like I mentioned in my last blog, I like most when they just playing the instruments without any singer 'cause we can see the real orchestra there. With singer, the orchestra just become a band for a singer; the singer become the center of the attention and not the orchestra. That's really ridiculuos, don't u think ? I wish there is no singer at all & just the orchestra at that night :) And I   kinda upset too when the audience give more applause to Rossa then to Adie MS &amp; his orchestra, I know Rossa is well known singer but compared to the Adie MS & his Twilite Orchestra she is nothing. Sounds so sarcastic, huh ... yup.   Fiuuuuh, i don't know that I can write that much about the orchestra. It surely were something for me, and I am looking forward for their next visit to Surabaya :D (make it soon Adie, plssssss ... hehehheheh)      Spent my Saturday with 2 of my office friends, and the next Monday with my sister. Monday, back to the working activity; it was quiet busy day and we spent the entire afternoon for meeting. And now Tuesday, where I finally can spare some time to write this blog. I read my friends blog in the morning, and had noticed that some of them had changed their blog looks. It was nice but still I was quite disturbed with some of their layout, why they just can't keep it as simple as possible (other definition of ASAP :D). I think u can change/improve your blog's layout as long as it makes ur blog comfortable for visitors (especially me) to read. That's why make it simple guys, just like mine :D It just a suggestion & no hurt feeling, allright. Hehehehhe.      Anyway, about the reading blog thing. It was nice to know that someone actually reading ur blog and even post a comment on ur blog. I myself usually just like to read &amp; forget to make a comment :D From now on, I'll try to be more expressive and not just a good reader ... wait for my comment on ur blog in the 3-4 weeks .... oopss, months ... ooops i did it again, in 3-4 days, OK. It's not a promise but I'm working on it. :D      Got jobs waiting in line, so I must end it here.      "It was not nails that hold Jesus to the cross, but His love for u and me"
