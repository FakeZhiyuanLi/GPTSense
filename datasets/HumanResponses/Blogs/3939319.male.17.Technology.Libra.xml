      So I was drivin home tonight and i realized something pretty cool... this whole time i've been thinking that whitney gets back next wednesday, but i realized that wednesday is the day that she LEFT, so the 9th is actually next monday... so that was a cool surprise... like finding money in your coat pocket... like i should've known that, but didn't think of it at first... yep, anywho... i've seen 4 movies in the last 3 days which is pure crazy... hmm, what else... yeah, i'm trying not to duplicate what tim put in his blog cuz we did the same stuff today... marie's cool to hang out with... she's like one of the guys, just with really long hair ;) ... man, i have spent so much money lately... i'm kinda try to slow down... what exactly it is i'm saving for is beyond me though... well, i'll try to update tomorrow... buenas noches

      alright, i should probably update this once in a while just to keep it alive, so here goes... umm, yeah... hi... how goes it... i won $2.50 tonight playing poker, which is better than nothing i suppose... i got a book today called "why so many gods?" which is like a textbook explaining each religion which i find interesting, plus i'll probably be able to use it a lot in cwp next year... i woke up feeling sick this morning but i feel alright now... hopefully i won't feel sick in the morning again... it's weird, sleep either worsens your cold or makes it better... anybody else notice that?&nbsp; i think it's retarded... like a submarine screen door... ah, random commentness... hmm, what am i doing tomorrow... working from 9:30-6 and then not a whole heck of a lot more... whitney's in peru until august 9th, just to visit her volleyball coach... oh well... more power to her... there's no turning back now i guess... alrighty, hopefully something remotely interesting happens tomorrow that i can blog about... and if not, i'll just blog about something random, which i pretty much do anyways... sayonara

      yay, i'm back and stuff... creation was great and it was around 100 degrees the whole time... i think i'm a little tan, but i can't tell... i got 5 cd's, most of which i already had burned: a couple switchfoot, relient k, kutless, and this new band called hawk nelson... i've never heard of them, but they're pretty good... anyways, i want to post about this instead of commenting just so i have something else to blog about, but there was this drawing to win all sorts of musical crap, like an electric guitar or acoustic guitar, or mics or keyboards and lots of crazy crap... i entered to win a bass guitar and of course lost, but yeah, that would be crazy fun to start a band... ooo, i just remembered, i thought of a cool band name today... "the mailbox spiders"... actually it's kinda dorky, but kinda cool if you're weird like me... anybody else have tons of spiders and spiderwebs all over your freaking mailbox?&nbsp; it's upsetting... anywho, i'm signin off and i'll comment on other ppl's blogs later on sometime... i'm kind of in a gaming mood right now, so that's where i'm heading.... commence comments.

      inspired by tim, here is a list of cd's that i want...   make yourself  a crow left of the murder (the above 2 i already have burned, but i want the real ones)  two lefts don't make a right, but three do... (again, have burned but i'll probably buy it at creation)  the wolf (dunno if it's as good as the first, but i'd like to give it a shot)  kutless (probably a creation buy... i love that cd tent)  beautiful letdown (creation)  yeah, any switchfoot cd pretty much  some cd's that haven't been released but will be hopefully this year: brand new, finch (uhh... i thought there were more.... oh well)   yep, there we go... i think i'll also shop around for a bigger cd holder... i have some cd's laying around my car unprotected, which isn't good cuz they could be exposed to the sun or those annoying people who like to sit down without looking... cheers  (an english guy came in my work today and said cheers when he left... i thought he was cool... more people should say cheers...)

      randomness is life. nothing will ever go as planned. things are only perfect in movies, and even then it takes months of rehearsal to complete them.&nbsp; expecting something is more foolish than continuously lighting matches and&nbsp;thrusting your hand into&nbsp;gasoline. if you don't get burned now, you will soon. cherish the coincidental strokes of luck that pass you by because, well... they're passing you by.

      Ok, last blog for the night, I swear... I just remembered something, though... I had a dream last night that I was talking to my old buddy Ruben, who moved away in 8th grade, and he said he was coming to visit for 5 days... which is really coincidental when compared to Brandon's sudden visit to town... maybe ruben's coming back sometime... that would be awesome... ruben's the man... ok, adios

      Well, dinner was cool... kinda awkward though... I mean, it's nearly impossible to catch someone up on six missed years... Brandon and I just told a few funny stories and talked about our different towns and states and stuff (he lives in Virginia).&nbsp; It was nice catching up a little bit and really cool to see him, but it'll never be like it used to be.&nbsp;We haven't really grown apart, we're still pretty much the same guys... but at times we seemed like strangers... what happened in the past is in the past. There's nothing I'm sad about though... i'm glad i got to see him. that was completely cool and random. i hope we keep in touch.&nbsp; alrighty then.... i'm gonna listen to my new cd and stuff... commence comments. (holy crap, that's an awesome phrase... i rule... DON'T STEAL IT).. ok.. *ahem*..    Commence Comments!

      The most random and crazy thing happened today.&nbsp; I was at work (ok, I'm still at work), when this guy walked up to me and said "Hey, Justin?".&nbsp; I said "Yeah?", then realized it was my friend Brandon, who I haven't seen in almost six years.&nbsp; He looked totally different, yet kinda the same, if ya know what I mean.&nbsp; This is an awkward age to meet up with someone after a long time cuz we've both grown up and changed so much.&nbsp; So he and his family saw my mom at the store and she told them I was working here, and tonight we're going out to dinner with them.&nbsp; It's gonna be so weird and cool at the same time.&nbsp; Man, six years of stuff to talk about.&nbsp; Crazy randomness... It's like in Castaway when he finally comes back and meets his ex-girl.&nbsp; Except I thought that part sucked cuz they weren't that emotional.&nbsp; I was hoping for like a "holy crap, you're alive!" type meeting.&nbsp; lol... when I saw brandon all i said was "whoa....".&nbsp; In other news, I got people to work for me so I could go to Creation.. yay!&nbsp; and whitney's coming home tomorrow... yay!&nbsp; and i finally got the new sparta cd today... yay!&nbsp; nothing can ruin this day...&nbsp;well... maybe if nobody comments on this... that would suck...&nbsp;&nbsp;see ya.

      There have always and will always be people on this earth who think they're better than you. They have a God-given right to be. They're royal and worthy by predetermination, and you have no right to challenge their authority. For they are the incompetent. All hail.  So it's about 6:00, closing time, when this idiot runs across the street towards the store. We groan and hope he doesn't come in, but of course, being an idiot, he does. He looks towards the cell phones, and making our fears come alive, announces his intent to buy one. Steve tells him we close in about 30 seconds, but that doesn't stop the moron from explaining how the last time he came in, we didn't have any free phones, so now he has the right to see what we just got in. So Steve, being the cool guy he is (no sarcasm, Steve's the man), showed the guy what we had and explained them with the best of his ability. Captain Special then proceded to say "I don't want to come in tomorrow and see that you've sold them all. What do I do?". I just rolled my eyes as Steve explained to him the slim probability of us selling two dozen cell phones in the span of one work day, but Dummy wasn't convinced. To shut him up, Steve gave him an info card to fill out to quicken the process of signing up tomorrow, and the guy began to fill it out. Then he paused and said "I'll just fill it out here... unless... you're closing or something...?" Steve said we closed about 5 minutes ago, and after more questioning, Special Boy finally left. You might think that was nothing to write an entire hate blog about, but when you've been working for six hours without eating for seven hours, all you want to do is leave. And you had to have been there to hate this guy. He was one of the people i described at the beginning. We're closed, but oh no, somehow he had a right to be there.  My venting doesn't stop there, and I'll try to keep this brief. By the way, after reading this next story, please comment on how you think I may have been at fault. Anyways, story #2... after eating at the Bayview, I had down time before Whitney got off work, so I decided to go to Quimper Sound. I turned right at the stoplight and saw that all the parallel parking spots by Quimper were full, but there were two ladies getting into their car in the first space, so I pulled up behind them in the Loading Zone to snag their spot when they left. I waited for a couple minutes and finally the started their car. They turned left to turn around, and I pulled in right behind them. I had my window rolled down, and so did the driver of the car, and I heard her talking. She said "Just in such a big hurry... blah blah blah". At the indirect mention of my name, I instinctively looked up and saw she was looking right at me. As she drove away, she yelled "Thanks for nothing!!!"... I just sat there, then I laughed. I have no clue what she was so mad about. The only conclusion I can think of is that me sitting behind them in the Loading Zone pressured her to move out of the space. But was I honking my horn and waving my fist, demanding that she get her ugly car out of the space? No. She was in a 2-hour parking space, and I wouldn't have cared less if she sat there for 3 hours. Quimper was gonna close in like 20 minutes, and if she wouldn't have moved within a few more minutes, I would have moved on to find more parking. I wasn't in that big of a hurry. Nobody held a friggin' gun to her head to give up her spot. She left, I took her spot, case closed. And I had to laugh, because the stupid old lady probably had a crappy day, and for some reason I had made her even more mad, so she had to shout something to vent her anger. And what ingenious phrase did she decide upon? "THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!"... What the CRAP does that have to do with the situation? Whatever. I understand I have no right to judge. Ms. Superior had a right to be randomly ticked off at me, I should've known right from the start. Ugh, superior people. Screw them all. You know what?    I    'm superior, so shut the #!%* up.   "I hate people..." "They're the worst!"

      holy CRAP... i went to the mountain dew site, and the friggin' mini fridge is sold out... why do they hate me... all this freakin mountain dew rotting my innards for NOTHING... ah well... i don't need a fridge anyway... i'll just pick out something else... the wall light is pretty cool... couple 'a duffle bags on there... a blanket... i'll just pick something else out... i've been working for months and literally digging through garbage trying to earn enough points for that blasted fridge, but i won't let it get to me... let's think this through... if i got the fridge, i would have to clean my room in order to make room for it, and i don't wanna do that... the only time i'm ever in my room is the 2 minutes preceding and following my nightly slumber, and i wouldn't drink anything in that time... it woulda been cool for college, i s'pose... but maybe they're already provided... my dorm at CWU had one, and the room was crappy even... i'll pick something else out instead... all is well... at least i can stop drinking the stuff now... i doubt i ever will again... i think i've done the unthinkable... i have gotten sick of mountain dew! blah, and good night.

      ah, the phrase that everybody kept repeating at Boys State while I had no clue what was going on.  Good ol' larry the cable guy.  I wonder... does that guy talk like that all the time?  What percentage of comedian's bits are true stories?  i mean, they claim they're all true, when obviously some aren't... Does Larry the cable guy go home at night to a wife and kids, or does he just sit at the end of his bed staring at the wall, talking in that low, redneck voice to himself all night?  The world may never know.  Speakin of boys state, i'm gonna go to the website and see if they added any more pictures.  if there's anything noteworthy, i'll report.  if not, i'm going to bed..  i feel sick..  adios...  GET 'ER DONE!!!

      yesterday was fun.  tim and i went bowling with our friends paul and timmy.  we saw napoleon dynamite, which is the funniest movie ever.  i am so close to saying it's the best movie i've seen all summer, but i don't know. we snuck in a bunch of snacks in a backpack, and they nominated me as the carrier because i look the "most innocent" or something. they'll regret they said that. oh yes they will. so anyways, i got the nickname backpack which is cool by me.  we also went bowling and i bowled a 172, which i'm going to say is my best game ever.  one time on new year's i went bowling at like 3 in the morning with my youth group, and i was bowling with two other people on a lane.  they both decided they didn't want to bowl anymore, so soon i was bowling as three people, and i got so many strikes. but i never got to finish all three games.  if i was just bowling as one person, i would've had a huge score, but since i wasn't, i won't count that.  so it's official: my highest score is 172.  then other stuff happened.  sorry.  right now i'm super tired and i have a headache and i'm super hungry.  whitney comes home tomorrow after about two weeks of hiding away in the jungles of peru.  yay!  oh yeah... MARIE:  WHAT IS YOUR BLOG URL?  sorry, i'm not shouting... just want to make sure i get my question across :D .... ok then.... i think i'm gonna eat ice cream then play the getaway... commence comments.

      Ok, ladies and gentlemen.  Here it is: The long-awaited list of the greatest CD's ever to be made... in my little world.  If you don't have them, buy them.  If you can't afford them, steal them.  Drumroll, please... *Ahem* In no particular order, here are my top 3 favorite CD's (at the moment)...   Brand New, "Your Favorite Weapon"  blink-182, "blink-182"  Sparta, "Porcelain"   Now don't get me wrong, I like all the CD's I have, but those three are definite standouts.  Which brings me to something else I've wanted to blog about... This year (as in school year, or whatever), I want to go to a lot of concerts.  I definitely want to go to a Brand New concert sometime, and Relient K if they go to the whereabouts of Seattle.  Blink might be a little too crazy, but maybe them too.  I just realized that I like concerts and I haven't been to as many as I'd like.  Hmm, right now I'm gonna go to the Showbox's website and comment on what I see... hold on...  Ok, absolutely nothing in the year 2004 interests me at the Showbox.  Hmm... what other venues are there?  Crap if I know... see, if i went to as many concerts as I should be going to, I would know these kinda things.  I'll research some more sometime.  Right now I'm gonna play poker over at good ol' pogo.com.  Your mission: buy my favorite CD's and comment on my blog.  Adieu.
