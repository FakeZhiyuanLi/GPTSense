      So here I am, at work, hashing out a blog, a blog i say, that means, while im getting payed 12 dollars an hour, I am sitting here, typing about absolutely nothing, while at the same time, I'm bored out of my mind.&nbsp; Any of you have the same problem?&nbsp; I tell ya, im not by nature a lazy person, but for some reason, when I come to work, I go out of my way, and do MORE work, just to get out of the work I'm supposed to be doing, like right now, somewhere in the building I work in, is an airconditioner, and that AC unit AINT working, it could be working, if i went and fixed it, but its not, because im here, bored out of my mind, talking to no one because the only hits i get on this thing are from me lookin at it.&nbsp;   Ok, so now what, what is there that I can type about thats even remotely interesting to people who happen to stumble on this page?&nbsp; Oh, i know, last night, i was listening to "radio lia" on US 105.5, here in central texas, and she asked the question..."Its been entirely too long since you did.....what?"  People were calling in, having a good old time, and right about the time i decided its been too long since i've had sex, someone called in and said "its been entirely too long since i've put my laundry away after i finish cleaning it"...lol.&nbsp; I couldn't help but laugh, it was like this guy was taking the words right out of my mouth.&nbsp; He said that usually he's so lazy, and he only has ONE laundry basket, so he does a load, carries them to his room, and dumps them, and starts to fill the basket with dirty clothes...I DO THE SAME THING!....you have to be careful, and make sure that you get the dirty clothes INTO the hamper, otherwise, you find yourself doing the "sniff test".&nbsp; When lia told him that, he said, "oh not to worry, i have FEBREEZE!"&nbsp; Man, talk about an all time low, the dood takes FEBREEZE, and squirts it on the clothes, then puts em in the dryer..lol...  Well, i dont go to that extreme, but i do usually have a big pile of clothes on my bed or floor....  well thats all for today, i'll hit you up next time..  &nbsp; G~

      So many things in life are simple, like paying bills, thats simple, because if you dont, your gonna be up a shit creek, and im talkin without the paddle.&nbsp; You'd expect alot of things to be simple, like, breathing for example, and well, driving, thats simple right.&nbsp; Tell that to the idiots i had the pleasure of driving home with today on my way from work.&nbsp; Someone cut me off, swerved in frount of me, slammed on the brakes, and was basically being a pain in the ass, because appearently, they were concentrating on breathing rather than driving, all this, while flawlessly applying makeup to the face that could never be hidden.&nbsp; If you ask me, I hope someone with balls gets into office with this next election, someone who can outlaw women drivers.&nbsp; We all know that women are "emotional rollercoasters" anyway, and you think its a good idea to let them be in control of a 3000 pound rolling deathtrap???&nbsp; Well, if it was up to me, women would walk everywhere, they are more fun to look at that way, and plus, while they apply the makeup, the worst they can do is run into a telephone pole, also fun...lol  Ranting is simple, I do it all the time, i think i would go out of my mind if there wasn't anything to complain about, and I do have to admit that if there weren't crazy women drivers, i'd probably go insane as well.&nbsp; I was wondering one morning what it must be like to drive and put makeup on, so i grabbed my girlfriends lipstick, and tested it out on the way to work.&nbsp; Now, before you label me a freak and move on, it was just a dabb, and i washed it off at a gas station before i got to work, im not a total freak anyway.&nbsp; So, my conclusion, its harder than it looks.&nbsp; I found myself constantly ripping myself back onto the road, while keeping the lipgloss on my face, let alone my lip.&nbsp; But see, that just means that women should get up earlier, and if thats the case, WHY DONT I HAVE BREAKFAST waiting for me when i roll out of bed at 7:30am?...&nbsp;   Eh, women, who needs em....Someone argued with me yesturday for about an hour that if there were no women, that we would all die off, and that if women decided to stop "putting out" (her words), then we would all die off, so she figured she was gonna tell me that women are the superier race, well...heh...she dont know me too well.&nbsp; Lets just say that she left with a new appreiciation for men...let alone for being such a prude.  Anyway, enough ranting today, i'll just go watch tv, or something else that makes me wanna stick a gun barrel in my mouth (thats just a joke for all you people that feel they have to tell me not to say stuff like that).....  later  g~

      Any of you out there gamers?...Well i am, big time!&nbsp; I love the rush i get when i sit at my desk and play my favorite PC game, and drinking a ice cold beverage of my choice.&nbsp; For me, its "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3, Operation Ravenshield".&nbsp; This game has it all, its a first person shooter, where you are an elite fighting force based out of hereford England, and you are responcible for maintaining peace throughout the world, with just your team to plan and execute insertion teqniues that rival the SAS, CIA, and any other intelligence agency out there.&nbsp;   What can you do, well let me tell you...This game is fully integrated, you can manipulate anything.&nbsp; In cooperative mode, you and your teammates, plan the insertion, down to what to do at each individual room, such as, "at 5pm, insert side door, Simultaniously breaching frount double doors, proceeding to room 1, crack door, toss flashbang, and clear room, then wait for next 'go code'."&nbsp; And the best thing about this, if you setup "waypoints" for your AI backup, you can change it on the fly, simply by aiming at a door, and clicking the menu button, and it asks you what you want the AI to do, "frag the door, flash the door, open clear and frag room" and they do it...like professionals...if this sounds fun, it doesn't even hold a candle to multiplayer.  I belong to a unit called  urlLink http://www.teamsmokin.squadservers.com &nbsp;(TEAM SMOKIN), and we usually get together at all times of the day, and play this game together.&nbsp; Unlike Ghost recon, Ravenshield only holds a maximum of 16 players, like the old "rogue spear".&nbsp; Combined with the versitility of "team speak" a voice communication program that alows us to communicate, RVS becomes an oustanding source of fun.&nbsp; Voice communication with your fellow teamates, add's a "third dimension" to gaming.&nbsp; Being able to tell your team where someone on the other team is, when you see them, or when they kill you.&nbsp; Its just wonderful.&nbsp; Today i played online for 7 hours straight, and thats a slow night, sometimes I sit and play the whole weekend, then its monday, and I wonder where my weekend went so fast.&nbsp;   Right now im totally psyched, because the first week of september, My unit is having a reunion, called " team smokin bash 2004".&nbsp; basically, one person decides to have the party at thier house, and invites the whole unit.&nbsp; My unit has 34 players, all charater of themselves, and 25 of them will be attending.&nbsp; It was decided that leaving the computers home would just drive us nuts..so we are going to hook them all together, and have at each other for 4 days straight, while drinkin and what not...lol.&nbsp; Also, and this is the big part, we organized a "LAN PARTY" in indianapolis, and invited the entire ravenshield community, which we are very active in, asking who wanted to participate. We even got "Redstorm entertainment" the maker of the game, to sponcer most of the lan party fee. As of right now, the 25 players of my unit are signed up, with garenteed spots to play, but the surprising part was how many people from other squads lived close, and decided to go, and we have a total of 224 people signed up for this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its gonna be huge.&nbsp; Also, Redstorm is developing a new interface for lan parties that can hold a maximum of 150 players in ONE game, with MUCH larger maps that no one has seen, to make it fair..lol  Anyay..enough rambling from me...im out till tomorrow  G~

      I like alot of people, pay my own way through college, if you count the 1000 dollars i get from the army to go to school.&nbsp; But none the less, i pay my own way.&nbsp; Well, when you spend 200 dollars for a class, you expect to go there, learn something, and leave with some information that you may or may not have had when you got there.&nbsp; Well, here at wonderful CTC, i get to sit through "check the block" class's, constantly wondering why i even bother to come to class.&nbsp; I have a class, its 2 hours long, we get a lecture for 20-30 minutes, and the rest of the time, we are supposed to be working on a website, which will be graded at the end of the term...What is it you think we do for the rest of the time we have, well, your guess is as good as mine.&nbsp; I find that surfing the web for different game sites, and trying to find a stimulating "bricks" game to play, as my mouse constantly hovers around the "close window" button, in case he decides to walk past the PC im using.&nbsp; Ok, its sorta my fault, because I already run 3 websites online, and i took a "introduction to the internet" course...lol.&nbsp; So here i am, done with the website we are gonna be graded on, and laughing at the quiz's we have to take, but its like a story i heard once..  A king was in church, and he asked the whole town to donate all they could afford, to help the kingdom out.&nbsp; Well a very wealthy man came with hundreds of bags of gold, and donated it, he didn't mind, he had hundreds of thousand bags still.&nbsp; Then a poor woman came in, she only had 2 pieces of gold, and she gave the king one piece.&nbsp; The king said that the woman had give more, because she gave HALF of what she had to begin with, and it was more difficult to part with what she gave, than the chump change that the rich man gave..  so here i am, with knowledge, and nothing new to learn in the class, and i expect to learn something more by going....pfft..  I think not.&nbsp;   anyway...thats today's blog...it doesn't really mean anything, just killin time really..  g~

      Bloggin, something new, something different, and something supposedly very important&nbsp; to my class instructor, so he's making me come on here and blog about everything that you can possibly think of.&nbsp; Just yesturday, the topic was "submit a blog about cyberterrorism"...lol..this has to be the funniest thing i have ever heard of...cyberterrorism...its like, being at school, and finding a note on your locker that says "i was just in your locker, and i rearanged your books"..lol..I used to have big problem with hackers, i spent ALOT of money on firewalls, and anti-virus software, and adaware, and the works to keep unauthorized people off of my computer, but about a year ago, i put a folder on my C: drive, called "hackers look in here"...in there, there's alot of things that the hackers can mess with to keep them busy, and it works....  Every now and then, I look in there, and some things will be gone, and some things changed, and some things moved around....but they dont mess with my PC anymore...  Its kinda like the old attage, if someone know's something gets to you, they will go to extreme ends to do the things that they know pushes your buttons, its the same thing for hackers...hackers look for a challenge...if they come to my computer..WITH NO PROTECTION, and find that folder, i assume most of them laugh because of that title on the folder, mess with a few things, and move on.....because its not challenge to get into my stuff...  To a hacker, something like changing the way a website looks is challenging, hackin into a server, and making "yahoo.com" look like some porn site....thats challenging, whats challenging about going into my PC and changing stuff??...nothing..  Then you have to look at this, whats the most that a hacker can do to your computer??...delete some system file, forcing you to reformat your harddrive, and you lose an hour out of your day..whoopy...  so becuase of this, they came up with a PC word (cyberterrorism)   If you asked someone what they thought about cyberterrorism 50 years ago..they would laugh at you, and ask you what that little box next to the tv was....  Anyway...in my opinion, cyberterrorism is something in our minds..something made up to suit a purpose, because we needed to call it something.&nbsp; Let them delete all the files they want on my computer...tomorrow, i'll be back online, after having just reformatted..  Anyone dissagree?  G~

      I am supposed to blog about 3 things i learned about this semester in my INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERNET class I'm taking    I learned all about blogging for one....before i was totally reliant on "PHP" forums to do most of my conversing, however, blogging is definately interesting and easy to do...and fast  I learned that The internet is a VAST world of interconnected computers all working together to make sure that I can connect and check my e-mail.  I learning that Thinking about 3 things that i learned is harder to do than i thought.  Though the class was informative, most people can learn all of the course material simply by becoming internet junkies.   Thats it folks...blog done..     Website reviews next week...good luck all     g~

      Hiya all,  Today was a strange day, because, well...lemme ask you, you ever get that feeling like someone you know is, well, i dont know...IN LOVE WITH YOU, and you dont wanna hurt thier feelings?  I have this girl, god bless her heart, in my math class, and after NUMEROUS hints that im not single, and that im not "OUT THERE" and what not, she just doesn't get it..lol.  Ah well, i just dont know what to do, i mean ok, she's a cool person, no doubt, its just not the right time, place, century, universe, area code, time of day, month, year, class, hell i dont know what to tell her.  She keeps asking me to come to her house after school, and asking me if i wanna go get a drink, at first i thought it was like a "after class is over" kinda thing, you know, with a BUNCH of the classmates going....wrong again, she just meant me and her.  Oh well...i guess i'll just have to break her heart, who know's maybe today she'll catch the hint, and give up...but knowing her, (she's very persistant), she wont.....sigh..  thats all for today.   g~
