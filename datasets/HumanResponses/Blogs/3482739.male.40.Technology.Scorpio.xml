      Ok, I suppose there isn't really much point in talking about how much  sex rules  because lets face it, we all know this.  Went and saw  urlLink Cubensis  last night.   urlLink Hot Buttered Bread  (their website is still under construction) opened for them and appeared to be a pretty smok'en band.  I only saw part of one song because I was talking with Tom R. who's my wife's good friend's husband and the keyboard player for Cubensis.  It is so cool to have a local Grateful Dead tribute/cover band here in LA.  They really help make living here bearable.  The thing about that is that while I was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, I realized I could be WAY happier without the HELLISH heat of the greater Los Angeles area summers living in  urlLink Edmonds, WA !! ( The City of Edmonds is located in south Snohomish County on the shores of Puget Sound approximately 14 miles north of Seattle. )  We're living in the South Bay (San Pedro/RPV) now because sadly, its only here in LA that Mrs. Beavis can get the respect (and of course the Money) she deserves doing what she does.  Anyway, got up this morning and realized that I hadn't posted since Friday, so I'm like, doing it now.  ;)  Also while blogging, I'm adding the info files from all the shows I've recently downloaded to my info files folder.  I need to publish them (the new ones) on my web page too, but now that its hosted on verizon, its a bit more of a pain then before.  If anyone out there wants to talk about some trades etc., PLEASE feel free to e-mail me!  Oh, just thought... if anyone wants to chat with me, you can typically find me in #SeattleChat on EfNet. ( urlLink www.efnet.net )  Welp, think I'll wrap it up for now.  Gotta eat some breakfast and watch some more Stargate SG-1 Episodes on DVD.  (Showing em all to Mrs. Beavis to get her caught up.)

      Now that I have the whole world's attention, I should mention that I am in need of gainful employment!  My typical cover letter goes something like this;  In short, I have 16+ years of paid programming/IT experience in a variety of environments, with a diverse range of applications written including (but not limited to) Image Display ActiveX Control, Database front and back-end applications, Voice, Telephony and Communication software, and various DOS and Windows utilities.  I have over six years of [Visual] C++ and five that include use of MFC. I also have about 2.5 years of ATL and the same or more years of STL.  I have about 4.5 years of Visual Basic programming and 2-3 years of Borland Delphi experience.  I also have some experience in UML Use Case, Sequence and Collaboration diagrams and documentation as well as recent experience with MS SQL Server and Crystal Reports 8 and 9.  I have a long history with PC programming. I taught myself BASIC when DOS  was at version 1.1, and in 1987 I taught myself C. I later got a certificate in C/C++ programming. I have taught myself C# and am actually working on a VSS-like Source Code Control application thats been written in 100% C#.  There is not an environment or language that I have not become quickly proficient and productive in and there is not a job so small that it does not get my 110% dedication.  I would love a chance to talk with you about your company's needs, and where my skill set might fit into those needs.  *** end.  The URL to my resume is: http://mysite.verizon.net/mrbeavis/skfsopht.html Which of course contains a link to the Word version.. which I actually need to update.... ok, thats done.  SO, if that looks interesting to anyone, by all means, shoot me an e-mail and lets talk!   Thanks for watching.  ;D

      So Mrs. Beavis went to the Dr. today... found out that what looks and sounds like pneumonia is actually to do with her nasty-ass case of acid-reflux!  She's got the wettest sounding cough you'd ever want to hear and he is saying its all cuz her tummy is all fooked up. I think she's allergic to LA. Heaven knows she was sick MUCH less often in Seattle. It could of course be the stress of her job, which she loves (for the most part).  But of course "just cause you love your job doesn't always mean no stress" as a friend said.

      heh, ok, so I'm now officially a member of the uh, blogging generation or something.  I wonder if I'll have anything really profound to contribute to the world, or if this will all be just a bunch of my mental diarrhea.  *hmm hmm heh*  I said diarrhea.

      As I just said to the channel on IRC, I'm sitting here listening to some Bob Dylan and enjoying my new found appreciation for the man and his music.  Then I asked, no one in particular, what it is about his music that almost always brings tears to my eyes?!  If anyone can explain it, I'd be interested.  I was listening to a song apparently called "Covenent Woman."  Whoa.  Really liked it.  Its sort of funny to me that its taken me this long to 'really' be into Mr. D to this degree given how long I've been into the Grateful Dead, and Bluegrass.  Actually, the realization that I liked Dylan much more that I would have otherwise thought came at the Phil & Friends / Dylan show the the Gorge in George, WA.  I remember being very dissappointed in P&F, but that Dylan had gotten me to straight up crying during a few songs.  It was then that I decided I needed to give the Bobster another listen.  This is actually happening fairly slowly, but has accelerated in recent days as I've gotten some live stuff off the internet.

      Well, despite the fact that I'm still out of work, we're going to fly up to our house in Edmonds over the July 4th weekend!  Mrs. Beavis is going to head down to Anderson Island to hang with friends and I'm getting to go to the Dead shows in Portland and the Gorge!  Well, ok, actually, I may not get to go to Portland cuz my friend thats miracleing me (is that a word? heh.) can't find me a ride from Seattle.  And, truth be told, a ride to the Gorge is still not confirmed.  Still, this mega Kind friend of mine is actually SENDING ME THE MONEY to go to the Irvine show down here in Cali a week from today!  You just can't say enough about people like my pal Iggy.  He's an amazing person.  Period.

      Well, had another fairly weird, if not short dream this morning.  I was at the Topanga Plaza (a Mall in the San Fernando Valley thats probably called something else by now) and it was night time.  Some basketball player/star had given me a rubber/toy basketball and I was bouncing it outside the Trader Joe's entrance area.. then I got another one from another player/star and it was bigger and I couldn't keep control of both of them.  Thats all I remember.  Weird.   I should mention the first really weird dream I had the other day.  This was the first dream I can remember in quite some time.  There was a band playing at some warehouse type place and I think my pal Gus was in it.  I remember being all stoked that FIVE horn players had shown up to play that night... I guess it was kind of a jam session or something, anyway I then went 'out back' behind the warehouse/store whatever (it was like being behind a mini-mall or something) and there were these guys that were sorta sky-writing... but the letters were on strings or cables, sorta like the banner that flys behind a plane, but the guys sorta threw the letters into the air by hand. (very weird) THEN, there was this cute (iirc) chick, getting hasseled by cop(s), and I was consoling her... and she starting to like nuzzle my cheek and stuff and I was all, 'uh uh, I'm married' and I showed her my ring.  I was so proud of myself... I turned her (a cute chicky) down, EVEN IN A DREAM!  Now, on the job front... Had a meet-n-greet @ Robert Half yesterday.  Met with a nice enough bloke and took a Delphi 5 eval test.  I got a 55, which might not seem too good, but if I read the results correctly, the top scores were only 64(ish), so given a/the curve, I think I did great!  They might have a Delphi gig for me.  I'm also still in touch with another Company in Santa Ana and am awaiting a 2nd interview.  There might also be a C++Builder position in Marina Del Rey!  Needless to say, I'd LOVE to have 2+ offers to choose from.  I know there was more I wanted to say, but can't think of it now so will just have to close for now.  Later dudes.  ;P

      Well, its been some time since I've blogged and I'm kinda bugged about that. eh, whatever, I'm doing it now right?   Ok, so on June 24th, I got to see the Dead @ Irvine Meadows (I'm NOT calling it by its bought name cuz f that) thanks to a VERY KIND friend of mine.  Thanks to the same friend, and the fact that even though I was out of work, the wife allowed us to fly up to the Seattle house over the July 4th weekend, I also saw the Gorge show on 7/3!  Got a very cool T-Shirt and everything.  The shows were KILLER and in fact, I believe I'm supposed to be getting the CDs any time now.  Oh, and I got a job.   ...YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY!!!!
