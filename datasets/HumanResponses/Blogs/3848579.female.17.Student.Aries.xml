      "In your seed all nations of this earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice."  -Genesis 22:18     God was speaking to Abraham then. Abraham obeyed God even when it didn't make sence. He trusted God. He didn't question God. And look how much God blessed him from it. Jesus is the one God used to fulfill this promice. God used that promice to bless us today even. What will happen if you obey God? How many people will God bless because of your obidence? something more to ponder... i love you all...

      will they see what's in me?  or will they see someone completly different, than what you want, O God I cry out to you, Why is it me that you choose? You are the only one that understands me, Sees right through everything, You see all my flaws, All the things you want to change in me, Then why do you still love me? It will forever be a mystery to me...  muchos amores amogos, Sara Scara Gaurdian of the HolyFlame

      I was in the crowd the day that Jesus died, and as he hung upon the cross, his mother cried. I saw the crown of thorns he wore, the stripe upon his back, and as the water and the blood ran out, then the sky turned black.  My mind was filled with anger, my heart was filled with shame. This man brought only healing; who could bring him pain? Why does it seem the strong always victimize the weak? Suddenly I found myself, standing to my feet.  And I cried: Refrain "Who nailed him there?  This child of peace and mercy?" "Who nailed him there?  Come and face me like a man." "Who nailed him there?"  Then the crowd began to mock me. I cried "Oh my God, I just don't understand!" Then I turned and saw the hammer in my hand.  I am just a Roman soldier, an ordinary man. I love my wife and children, I do the best I can. How can I have killed him?  There must be someone else. There's got to be an answer.  I just can't blame myself.  Repeat Refrain  "I nailed him there!  This child of peace and mercy!" "I nailed him there!  I am the guilty man!" "I nailed him there, with my sins and my transgressions!" I cried "O my God, now I understand!' When I turned and saw the hammer in my hand.  spoken: [Surely this man was the Son of God]  i don't know why but this song really hit me hard when i was listning to it... so many times do i acuse ppl when i'm hte one doing something wrong? hten i realize exally what is going on and i have to back down and say sorry and really feel shamed for what i was doing... i know i'm not perfect but i'm trying here...
