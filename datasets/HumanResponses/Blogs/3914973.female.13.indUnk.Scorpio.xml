       -FRIENDS.   Someone who says good things about u behind ur' back.   Someone who help u without u knowing it.   Someone who truely adore u.    Someone who is there to give u a hug.   Someone who is there keeping quiet to listen to you.   Someone who is there at the bottom to get u when u'r falling.   Someone who is there to encourage u to keep on moving.   Someone who is there knowin your feeling without saying.   Someone who is there for u.

       Where i end up isn't the most important thing. It's the road i take to get there. The road i take is what i'll look back on and call ma' life. Fear less, hope more. Eat less, chew more. Whine less, breathe more. Talk less, say more. Hate less, love more . . . And all good things are yours. Learn to adapt.Learn to give. Learn to forget.Learn to sacrifise. Man are.. ignorant.Time.. give man to do things. Wealth.. give man to get things. In life-what do you hope for.?what do you aim for.? Create your life with both hands.A glass with a crack is still as prefect to me.
