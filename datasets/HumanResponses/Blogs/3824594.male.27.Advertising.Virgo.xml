       Thanksgiving is the perfect holiday for a charity invite. And a recently-divorced bachelor makes a perfect orphan. An uncle for the day. A friend of the family.  It’s the feel-good thing to do on a holiday free from awkward gift giving.  I was hesitant to accept my friend’s invitation to his in-law’s place.  Foremost, I drink too much for family people. I knew as much.  Yet my other options were too depressing. I knew I’d spend the day alone. In my condo. Carving a bottle of Wild Turkey. Enjoying side dishes of internet porn and college football.  It would be a dark day. I’d spend much of it thinking of the bachelor friend of mine who would be sitting in my place at the dinner table with my wife.  I was little more than a casual acquaintance of the family as a whole.  Months before, I was the minister at their daughter’s wedding.  My credentials were, intentionally, kept brief.  It was one of those things you don’t talk about at weddings. Like the bride’s ex-boyfriends or the groom’s past bout with a social disease.  Yet, I’m certain my credibility was called into question at the reception. A wedding is a celebration, I’d told the congregation in my brief homily.  And there were good reasons to celebrate. If only to avoid conflicting emotions. It’s a strange thing to preside over a wedding in the midst of your own bitter divorce.  So, I celebrated. I finished a bottle of wine during the photographs. And I kept good pace for the next bottle. This following the communal flask I’d emptied before the ceremony.  I was basking in the grace of the Almighty.  I recall a very unsuccessful conversation with the maid of honor. I was following her, slipping on a cord. A bustle was unintentionally groped.  Regaining balance, my face was slapped. Hard.  I winked at her date. I’m known for my charm.  The genetic father of the bride wanted to talk. I’d avoided him at the rehearsal.  Where was my church? What’s the name of the church? How long had I been out of seminary school? What was my religion?  Some questions are best left unanswered.  I’m sort of an Irish minister, I told him. Taking a swig straight from the bottle. It was close. Internet minister would have been more accurate.  Fortunately, the groom saw it coming. He was sweeping me off for the invocation. I didn’t know there was going to be a prayer. There was now, he said.  The power of my ministry amazed me. From the DJs podium I ordered them to bow their heads. And by God, they did. There was no preparation. I couldn’t fall back on the Catholic benediction I knew from my youth. It would be too revealing.  I had to wing it.  It was bad. I made some comment on union. It sounded very pre-coital to me.  I was backtracking. Successfully, I thought. The prayer closed abruptly. I was holding up a drink. The audience was confused.  In my religion, every prayer ends like a toast.  I don’t remember the rest of the evening too much. The tattered fragments I do recall weren’t pretty. I wasn’t asked to leave. But I’m certain a few people sighed in relief when I was driven home.  Your enemies’ enemies are friends. And the bride’s mother found me to be delightful. I’m sure her religious ex-husband’s disdain helped my cause.  Thus, I was invited to spend Thanksgiving with she, her Jewish husband, and their family. By being a miserable cunt, I’d evolved into a friend of half the family. Which, by proxy makes me a half-friend of the whole family. Or something.  The drive to the Inland Empire was long. For someone from the Midwest, spending a holiday in the desert is a bit unusual. I vowed to keep myself hydrated.  We left and arrived late in the evening. Things were on track for a fine weekend. Morning brought new light.  I woke early to a growl, eyes focusing on a smallish rat terrier. Out the window, the sun was coming up over a dirty mountain range.  The growl was louder as I rubbed my eyes. I tried to turn over. There was a bark. The little bastard nipped my finger, tugging the blanket down and off.  He was taking his aggression out on the blanket. Showing me his strength.  Ripping about. Gnawing my scent from the fabric.  Dogs know people on a different level, I’m told. If that’s the case, we had an immediate understanding. One son-of-a-bitch to another.  The mother of the bride was soon in the living room near the couch where I slept. Brownie, she was calling the little fucker. Calm down. You’ll have to go outside. Now, is that how we treat company?  I was invited to breakfast, though I wasn’t particularly hungry. In lieu of scrambled eggs, I had eggnog. And brandy.  I sat next to the man of the house, forcing myself through a piece of bacon.  There’s just something about eating pork with a Jewish man. I’ve always had a healthy appreciation for all things unorthodox.  Brownie watched from outside. Glaring. Snarling if I made eye contact. I guess I’m easily intimidated.  I was, appropriately, tasked with serving drinks. And whenever anyone needed a drink, I needed one too.  It was a fitting arrangement.  I hung out in the kitchen as I drank. The bride’s mother was talking to me about the inherent kindness of her dog. He wasn’t crazy about men. It’s true. But a great watchdog. And loyal.  Her husband had left. He was rolling his eyes. She went on. One of her husband’s friends had tortured the dog. She was sure of it.  It began to sound like a conspiracy. I indulged her a bit too much. The husband was back in the kitchen. No goddamn friend of his had done anything to the dog. He was certain.  Chuck kicked the dog. She’d seen him, the mother told me soberly after her husband left.  After it bit him, the husband reminded her from the next room. I could tell she didn’t like Brownie to be called an "it."  The dog was a problem. Not just for me. For the whole family. I was a minister, the rum had reminded me. Perhaps I could perform an exorcist on this pint-sized demon.  With an authority I didn’t possess, I ordered the woman to go outside and fetch the dog. I armed myself with bacon.  I was trying to remember some guy on public television who was an ace dog trainer. Problem pets were instantly corrected.  I can typically spot when I’m becoming this delusional. Nonetheless, I was ready to prove myself a great dog whisperer.  The newly married couple gathered in the kitchen for the show. The husband watched quietly from the other room. He was covering his mouth casually. His eyes smiling.  The dog was content in its owner’s arms. At least, for the time being. And the audience had given me a confidence I didn’t deserve.  I smiled at the dog, speaking to it as if it were a child. Brownie Wownie want some bacon?  I couldn’t read the dog’s expression. Discomfort? Anger? An experienced dog whisperer might have been able to tell.  Holding the treat closer, the little bastard lashed out. He took the bacon.  Had my reaction been any slower, he’d have taken the tip of my fingers as well.  My credibility was very much in question. It wasn’t funny any more, the bride had decided. Maybe we should just put Brownie outside.  I wouldn’t have it.  Now Brownie, I have more bacon if you’re good. The dog was suspicious. Chuck hadn’t tried so hard to reason with it.  The dog leaned forward, sniffing. Gingerly pulling a bit of bacon from my hands. I sighed in relief. Leaving my hand too close. Good boy, I went to pet him.  The dog freaked.  Teeth gnashing at my hands. Yipping. The dog proved too much for it’s owner to handle, it was on the ground. The bastard was tearing at the cuff of my pants. Ripping. Digging into my leg.  I had no experience with this sort of thing. Certainly, PBS doesn’t show outtakes of dog training gone bad. My solution wasn’t incredibly inventive.  With the dog teed up, gnawing up my left leg, I put my right leg into action. Sabastian Janikowski would have been envious.  The dog was probably only airborne for a couple of yards. The glass porch door stopped him short of his intended trajectory.  I would have to confer with Chuck on this one, but I’m almost certain I hold the Inland Empire terrier punting record.  The dog was shaking it’s head. Yipping. It sounded like a crying child. It was running into the next room, making a wide circle around its male owner.  The pain had subsided and the anger returned to the hell beast. I could see it jumping incredible heights, nipping at him with the veracity of an animal thirty times its weight.  I couldn’t help. I could only hurt things. But in my state, I decided I could help. I walked into the next room, ignoring the ladies’ screams.  DOG! I shouted. Everything stopped. The evil little bastard was shocked.  Now, Dog. What are you doing? I tried to reason in my deepest, most-authoritarian voice. It turned to face me. The dog’s confidence was unnerving. Not thinking I dropped slowly to one knee.  Now, listen. This has to stop. He wasn’t listening. His upper lip had curled high. I heard some bizarre Tasmanian death growl. Slowly the dog lurched forward.  Stop! The dog paused. I realize now, at this point, I was on all fours. My friend and the whole family stood in awe. It was incredibly tense.  In my defense, this might have been a good time to tell the drunk minister to get off his knees. It’s hard to say how people will react in perilous times, however. So, I forgive them their indiscretion.  The dog moved cautiously at first. Sensing a lunge, I did the only rational thing. I barked at him.  The girls screamed when they heard my bark. The dog freaked out again. He tore forward. I had the good sense to catch him in my hands. However, anticipating a much larger animal, I’d fallen to my back.  I was holding him up, like a father might a newborn. Pending, of course, that the infant had massive teeth and was trying to chew the hands off the father.  All the while, I was barking viciously. Trying to communicate to the bastard in it’s own language.  The dog tore left and right, turning it’s head to bite me left or right. I could only compensate and bark louder.  Fluttering around me were the girls. Do something. Do something! They were yelling, screaming. And the man of the house, after a good moment, acted in good conscience.  He picked the dog up at arm’s length. The mother got the door. He gently tossed the beast out the door. The mother slid the porch door shut immediately. There was a thud. The bastard tried to go through the glass.  I lay. Recovering. There were a good amount of scratches. No solid bite marks. But I was wounded. I was panting.  I don’t believe I’d been conscious in that house for more than four hours.  I’d worn my welcome out completely. It was almost a personal record.  Everyone had turned on me.  The adopt-a-bachelor plan had failed miserably. I overheard one of those terse debates in the kitchen. They needn’t get rid of the dog. They needed to get rid of Reverend Drinkstoomuch.  On the whole, the family went about the house as if nothing happened. Silent anger begot the day. I don’t remember anyone speaking to me directly. They sort of spoke around me.  There would be no invocation over the turkey by the good reverend doctor.  There’d be no add-on prayer blessing the guest of the house.  And we wouldn’t be staying that night. As had been planned. I was once again welcomed. Welcomed to leave.  The ones who loved each other embraced one another. But there would be no embrace for me.  The most I got was a smile from Brownie. It’s hard to say if a human will ever bark at Brownie again. But I sense the dog will battle on and on. And before he dies of old age, he’ll likely be stepped on. Accidentally, of course.  Two twisted minds did battle that day. I respected our tactical differences and his subsequent success.  I would not be invited back. Nor had Chuck.  But how much had the nits won? He would live on horsemeat kibble for the rest of its life. He’d been removed of the essential elements of our gender.  Yet, he had proven to be slightly more of a man than I.  And that’s what Thanksgiving turned into. An internal debate. My life versus that of a dog.  The debate continues.

       Youth and Beauty    When I last saw my grandmother, she was in the throws of cancer. She  was dying. Yet, there was a grace. A familiarity about her. She was  still alive. And she lived. And she was beautiful. In her late  eighties, she remained the most beautiful woman I’d ever known.    Returning home for her funeral was one of the hardest things I’d  ever done. Far more difficult than the pains of loss and betrayal I  faced following the recent end of my marriage.    Grandma would not succumb to a public showing at her death. It was a  bit of a controversy for my Irish-Catholic family. She was born  protestant and it was her right to decide what they did with her  earthly vessel.    The last time I saw grandma, she was in a box. It was a beautiful  oak box. The kind one might use to store fine silverware or jewelry.  I’m relieved I never had to look at her pickled and sewn together in  a larger wood box.    I can honestly say for the rest of my life that I never saw  grandmother when she was less than perfect to me in every way.    Not all her wishes were followed. Her ashes weren’t scattered by the  fence where her fearsome Pekinese had, in life and now death,  prowled for mailmen, priests, and squirrels. There were codes and  ordinances.    She was buried in the family plot next to grandpa. I think she  feared his snoring would haunt her afterlife. But she is gone now.  Ashes to ashes.    As is the case often, I learned a great deal more about my  grandmother after her passing than I learned in life. I learned more  of the losses she endured. I heard stories that typified an amazing  person’s evolvement in life. And more about the lives she touched.    Nonetheless, after four solid days of mourning I was worn. My  younger sister and I left our deceased grandmother’s home late after  the funeral. We decided to give each other permission to live again.    For my sister, at 19, the act of living is much more vivid than it  might be for someone nearing their 30s. It was the perfect  prescription for a downtrodden man.    My sister’s zest for life was contagious. Especially over a  six-pack. We were seeing each other on new terms. We were redefining  our relationship.    She had so much more to offer than she had before. Namely,  roommates.    Sister rented a large Victorian home with three young women. Girls,  really. Out on their own for the first time.    It was an emotional time. A good time for bad decisions. An  opportunity to forgive one’s self for the malice and deviance  within.    A seed had been planted.    Using my signature depth and prudence, I carefully quizzed her on  her social life. I wanted to learn all I could of her nubile  co-inhabitants.    Evading her own better judgment, she invited big brother to learn  firsthand. We were heading for a party.    When you are fast approaching your thirties, painful differences  amongst people in their twenties become obvious. I realized quickly  that "adults" under the age of 21 don’t gather in large numbers in  most bars. More likely, they gather where they live.    Upon entering a dilapidated apartment, I saw the life the military  stole from my youth.    It was a humid, largely-unfurnished shit-hole. But within stood and  danced a plethora of college girls. Belly shirts. Short skirts.  Breasts straining against nylon confines. Gravity-defying flesh.    They were drinking cheap beer and listening to crap music and  dancing and hugging and laughing.    The funeral was off my mind. As were other thoughts of grandma’s  wishes.    I chose to ignore the age gap. Even when I saw more than one coed  their drink from my view. Soon, one of them was hugging my sister.    Her name was Laura. She was tall. It was her birthday. She’d just  turned 19. This is your big brother? She was asking my sister.    And where am I from?    Orange County.    The OC?    It was too beautiful to put into words. She was giggling. I realized  I wasn’t being very good about making eye contact.    She was in school to become a fashion designer. I live where she  wanted to be. She’d just turned 19.    And why hadn’t I told her happy birthday. And what do I do in the  OC? And that’s cool. And she’s always wanted to visit LA. And do I  live near the ocean? And why hadn’t I told her happy birthday?    It was as if we were on autopilot. There was no work involved. I  didn’t even have to speak. She was saying all the right things for  me.    For obvious reasons, numbers were on my mind. 19. A number that  still has ‘teen’ in it.    The day before she was 18. Barely legal, as they say. 365 days  before that she wasn’t.    I was nearing my high school reunion. She may have just finished  celebrating her graduation.    In a previous life, I would have been taking mental pictures to  survive a night of lust with the ex.    Now, heady realizations were occurring to me. It was a new reality.  Opportunities were more real. Experience had taught me to second  guess myself.    She would have been beautiful at 20. But she was cresting perfection  at 19 and a day. And the more she talked, the closer she seemed to  stand.    I was in love.    Before I am chastised as a pig, let me remind you that the offending  concept of a "youth-obsessed culture" is far more instinctual than  societal.    Anyone who doubts this can debate the social disdain and subsequent  commercial success of film and print versions of Lolita. Mind you,  Nabokov was a Russian.    Disdain me if you will. Meanwhile try to explain the wicked circle  of women lying about their ages. And why should a female be offended  should an estimate err on maturity’s side?    I was in no mood to judge myself. And objective analysis was a shade  of darkness I had to ignore.    But even the pessimist in me was proving to be wrong. The signs were  there. I couldn’t begin to explain this girl’s poor taste in men.  Perhaps it was my status as a ‘Californian.’ Perhaps I was a father  figure in her mind.    I tried not to ask myself too many honest questions.    After all, girls at her age are allotted a number of serious  mistakes. I was certain that heaven had smiled upon me. And I would  be happy to be an error in her life. Even at the risk of turning her  into a lesbian.    Unfortunately, a small legal problem interrupted her conversation.  The cops were coming. Unfuckingbelievable.    I was one of a handful of people packed in this house who was old  enough to purchase alcohol. I was also the tallest person there. And  the only one with slightly graying hair.    Further, despite no convictions, I had a reputation. I knew it was  possible that a cop would recognize me. I didn’t fear a night in the  pokey. However, this was no ordinary night.    It was time to go. And where were we going? And, for the love of  God, could the lovely Miss Laura come?    We decided to continue the fascinating conversation at another  location. Not that I was listening to her before.    We parted, vowing to meet.    We shuffled past the hushed masses to a side door and left. It was  midnight. I was drunk and pleased with my prospects in life. And I  hadn’t even met my sister’s delightful roommates.    The house my sister rents is nice. Large. Tall ceilings. Big rooms.  It was a pleasantly warm break from a mild winter storm.    In Laura’s absence, I was immediately taken with my sister’s other  roommates. Only one truly rivaled Laura in beauty. Julia. Julia had  a girl-next-door charm to her.    I was also admiring the general décor of the place. Two large  sectional couches were topped with lounging nymphs. Both were  scantily clad in tight shorts and loose tee shirts. Both in their  very early twenties. Sisters.    There were a manageable number of young men there. Boys, more  accurately. Young and still pimply.    Young bucks never respect the condition of females at their age. I  wasn’t concerned.    We were set to play a card game. A drinking game. Presidents and  Assholes, they called it. I was sure to be halfway decent, if only  by virtue of tolerance.    Julia and I were talking. Julia was 19. She had a strange accent for  a girl from our part of the Midwest. She worked at Wal-Mart. She was  also 19.    Julia had been coon hunting the day before.    Coon hunting.    My God, a woman with whom I might be considered a sophisticate.    Yet there was femininity to this angel that forgave her hobby. And a  giggle. High. Playful. Absorbing.    She was tall. Her breasts were amazingly full and high. I wondered  how she had the time to fill so completely in one area without  others rounding accordingly. In my experience, this is often the  case. Her face wore the charms of youth.    She was scrumptious.    So much so, that Laura’s marred arrival didn’t depress me. Laura had  become sick on her way over. Her shoes spoke for her. She also made  a deposit on my sister’s driveway. And the front porch swing.    I asked, honestly, if it was something I said. I couldn’t be sure.  They were laughing. Laura was laid to rest on her tummy. Her angelic  face resting against an empty trashcan liner.    Happy birthday, baby.    I had my turn of being both president and asshole. The kiddies  didn’t realize with whom they were drinking. I was making good time  with Julia. I was intent on weeding them out.    I told the boys I could drink a single beer faster than any man  alive. Which is true. I say this without boasting. Anyone who knew  me in my earlier days would attest to this as a simple fact.    Once, I was tied in competition. But I wasn’t dueling a man. He was  an alcoholic Chupacabra I raced in Japan. We raced four times and  broke even in each contest.    There was a method to my madness. The girls were indulging us.  Setting up rounds. I couldn’t lose. After all, I didn’t have to beat  anyone in a single-beer race. I only had to get the youngsters to a  point where they were making a mess on my sister’s porch.    Then they’d go home. It was getting late and Presidents and Assholes  just wasn’t working fast enough.    The poor bastards kept up with me for the first three rounds. Their  bellies were full. By the end, they were competing only to finish  their drinks.    I had ascended beyond being a president or an asshole. I had become  the king. My subjects were dropping like flies.    It was around this time that I was starting to understand my  sister’s world. The friendlier I got with Julia the more she’d  respond. All the while, the more brooding one of the boys would  become.    He was the smallest of the bunch. His name was Joe. He had the look  and build of a teenage leprechaun. He’d glare at Julia. He’d stare  dazedly at me.    When Julia led cheers following my coronation, Joe made his exit.  Like a pouting toddler, he stumbled outside to the sleet. I guess he  needed to cool off.    I was told Joe was married. He was barely old enough to buy tobacco.  His wife was 17. They weren’t together. Getting a divorce but slow  on the paperwork.    Were they together?    Julia laughed about him leaving. She didn’t know what they were.  That’s how she put it. I surmised Joe thought they were a bit more  than that. Perhaps he was a polygamist. If he had an option to match  Julia, I wouldn’t blame him.    Joe wasn’t the only one in need of air. The defeated incumbents  stumbled out in short order. Somewhere around this time, my sister  was gone. Her boyfriend shortly thereafter. I was in no mood to ask  questions.    Alas, Julia and I found ourselves alone. I had an air of confidence  that I can only attribute to the onset of alcohol poisoning. We were  on the couch.    Sleeping on three sides of us were my sister’s two roommates.  Sisters.    And Laura was there too. Despite the faint smell of vomit and her  makeshift pillowcase, she was still a gem to behold.    Things were going incredibly well. I was riding an optimistic high.  I needn’t take her to her bedroom. There were all sorts of  possibilities. Interesting equations.    My mind was swimming in lust. Julia was facing me, straddling my  lap. Giggling. Kissing. Touching. She was warm and soft and firm in  all the right places.    But the heat of our embrace wasn’t to endure.    The door was open. Banging against the wall. There was a rush of  cold air sweeping in. I pulled my young love to the side to get a  look.    Joe had returned. And he was pissed.    He stormed the couch. I hurled my favorite coon hunter to the side  to evade him.    I was trying to reason with the halfling. But he wouldn’t have it.    Mind you, I am no foreigner to fistfights. And I can typically hold  my own. But the stinging experience of being hit in the nose  repeatedly has left its mark on my psyche.    I didn’t want to fight Joe. I just didn’t want to get hit.    But I did get hit. He was punching eye level. So he landed a good  blow to my ribs. Then he kicked me.    I had to remind him that there were major physical differences  between us. I put my hand on his forehead and cupped his thick  skull.    He was swinging like a ceiling fan. I had a good reach so his  efforts were useless.    The girls were awake. They were yelling at Joe. They were trying to  reason with him too. He might kill you, they warned him. Joe wasn’t  hearing it.    I wouldn’t think of hurting him. But it did occur to me that if this  kept up, something would have to be done. I might pull him over my  lap and give him what he really needed. A spanking.    Maybe I could profit from this. Perhaps wrestle him to the ground  and demand his pot o’ gold.    He was getting tired. Thus, more ruthless. Grunting. Hissing.  Sounding like a cornered rodent. Young Joe tried to bite my wrist  and I let go. He kicked my chin, and punched my stomach.    The scuffle ended as quickly as it began. The coon hunter tackled  Joe Baggins to the ground. I realized Julia was a foot taller than  her boyfriend. Or, whatever he was to her.    He was crying. Sobbing. Balled up on the ground. Weeping. She wasn’t  going to console him. Fuck you, Joe. That’s all she said.    Sobbing. Unable to face anyone. He grabbed his coat and rejoined  winter.    The difference in our perspective ages had manifested itself.    Julia had been embarrassed. She was snapping her bra back on. They  were talking about Joe. About how he still sees his wife. He had no  right.    I realized too late that my pants were undone. Had they dropped to  my ankles, the outcome of the fight may have been very different.    Perhaps that’s what convinced him to fight in the first place. The  smallish tent in my shorts. Wholly unimpressive. Even for an  Irishman.    When the new day was young, I lived in a fanciful world. Ripe and  dainty nymphs drank cheap beer. They gyrated to Top 40 dance mixes.  One could smell the sweet scent of wanting women.    But by 5 a.m., the new day’s afterbirth had started to stink. My  sister asked me to leave. A necessary role reversal.    Perhaps, with some thinking, I may have been able to capture the  moment. Maybe with something more tangible than bruised ribs and  scuffed chins. But it wasn’t meant to be. I wasn’t a part of their  world. Just a visitor.    Youth and beauty are fleeting lovers in the night. They pass  quickly.    Reality is a bitch named Joe.

        I just love that  urlLink Dr Scholl's  Freeze Away Wart Remover "removes warts fast with as few as 1 treatment."&nbsp;   Don't most products work with  one or more  treatments? "If it doesn't work the first time, try again."    Here's another product that works in as little as one use:    The Beretta M9:      Kills&nbsp;muthafuckas dead in as little as one application.  And when you think about it, the M9 could probably remove warts in just one treatment too.

In fact, I consider this whole blog a test bed for the crazy ideas I hope to implement at my job.   Yeah, that's it.

       Below is an E-mail exchange I had with Dan. Sure its another surreal story about Vegas, but I think everyone can take away something from this one.  __________________________________________________________  Dave,  You have sent me, by far, the best links ever.   Working on some stuff for the 'Blog. Hope all is well.   Last night, my Amazon.com order came in. On a whim, I looked up Brandy Miller's name on IMDb.com and found her. Amazingly. So, I ordered "No Angels.com," a strange docudrama she was in. I was amazed that this under-budgeted, crap DVD had special sections and features. The quality was lacking, as one could expect.   But there she was. The stripper who spent hours on my lap. The one who claimed to break a toy with Collin Ferrel. And she had this huge monologue where she told the story of how she danced for the first time.  It was the exact story she gave me.   It's truly a fascinating thing to see her again. Not in a weird stalker way, I hope. It just memorializes the trip. Strange how substances can blur the senses. Brandy Miller is a beautiful woman, but seeing her on camera gives you that level of objectivity that makes bullemia a popular disease.   Brandy is not perfect. She's special, but not as hot as I remember her.  I was thoroughly fascinated, nonetheless. Perhaps on our next trip we'll sit around and watch "No Angels.com." It will be cheaper, by far, than watching Brandy in person.   Dan  __________________________________________________________&nbsp;  Dan,  She might not have been what you remembered, but as an experienced "partaker of the goodness", I can assure you that she was exceedingly beautiful, even by sobered standards. She was probably one of the nicest strippers I've ever met, and I hope that your paths cross again.   As for the mystically surreal aspect of the night, I hope I never forget it. There's a certain disappointment that reality offers after a night like that, but try to forget that aspect of it. I had a similar incident under similar circumstances in Austin one night at a club called the 'Shadow Lounge'. Keep in mind while you read this: I have never cheated on my wife and I never want to cheat on my wife. Nothing (even in a state of "inebriation") was ever going to happen, its just a slice of life conversation.   Behind a curtain with a spotlight behind it, one of the most beautiful bodies I've ever seen was performing dance moves that entranced me for the better part of at least a hour, maybe two. I've never spent that much time just watching a shadow. I had to meet this girl.   And so I did. When she came from behind the curtain wearing her harem garb, I walked up to her and said "I could watch you dance for the next  3 hours." Her response to me was "I'm here for the next 4." I'd like to think that was an invitation to watch her dance for the 4 hours, but in truth it was probably her best attempt at a sarcastic "get the hell away from me weirdo" response. In my state at the time, I took it as an invitation to ask her what her name was.   And so I did. Her name was Cassandra. At the time it was the most beautiful name she could have possibly said. It was the last thing she said to me before she called someone on a cell phone and walked away. I think she smiled at me, but being in the state I was, wide eyed and paranoid, I let the conversation end. I was going to ruin a perfect moment by over stepping my bounds. And that's one of the things you have to understand about experiences like we had in Vegas: The moments following a perceived perfect moment will be awkward and tainted.  Remember your perception of the good moments, and try to forget the rest. Perception is 90% of reality. Ignore the other 10%.   Dave

       In a recent conversation I had with Roman over E-mail, he sent me a part of his family tree. It turns out that his ancestors also lived in the OC. Below is the conversation that followed (for me, it's just a humorous slice of life that could one day be part of a movie script):   Dave: Seems like orange county is the Bercot Mecca.  Roman: I resent the implications that Bercots are nomadic and have an implied need to move around. I also resent that the Bercots have been likened to Muslims, or Muslims unto us!  Dave: My apologies, Head Gypsy Ahmed Bercot!  Roman: I‘m gonna fuck-start your head.

When you look at the photo, you are going to go "Did he load those things into a fucking slingshot?!" No, he didn't. We theorize that he spends his spare time hooking 50lb weights to a small hook attached to the bottom, but we will never know.

       Most of what was said and done during F&L was forgotten in a haze of smoke. Other things are purposely expunged from the records because " what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas ". But of the things that can be remembered here are the best punchlines (in no particular order):   That UPS guy is trying to deliver his brown package.   If I spend 4 or 5 hours pulling a crank in Vegas, I can guarantee it's not going to be a slot machine...   God damn, Mike! Charlton Heston's balls don't hang that low and he's the president of the NRA!

         I had a conversation with some co-workers at a birthday party for one of the few people in my office that I consider a friend. I was explaining to them that I was nervous about my 10 year high school reunion, because I an feel the notion that I am going to get into a fight. No one knows how hard my life was, and the most common response was "get over it". Get over it...heh heh heh.    I have a cut on my right index finger. I got it when I first started working at my firm because of trying to force a dusty piece of aluminum out of one of the old Gateway computers. That was 4 years ago. It still hurts on cold (and more so on wet) days. I've tried scar creams, rubbing it, and various other "treatments" to try to get rid of it. But its still there waiting for the winter to come.    Is it the same? Yes and no. The only difference is I would rather have 50 of these scars all over my body than the ones I carry from my childhood. I say that, but at the same time, I wouldn't be almost unbreakable emotionally. Once again, good and bad.

       Well I wasn't going to get political here, but Dave started it with his remarks of last week.  Maybe you don't like Dubya — you don't need to. What you do need is to understand what kind of scumbag John Kerry really is.  Somebody finally put together something specific showing Kerry flip-flopping on the Iraq issue. Watch the video at  urlLink Kerry On Iraq .  It starts off funny — watching him try to do what he thinks will be popular, then backtrack when confronted by his Democrat peers. But I literally felt sick when I saw him standing in front of the group of veterans saying, " I voted for the appropriation before I voted against it. "  I'm sorry. I didn't realize they took more than one  urlLink vote on a bill .  As president of the United States you need one thing — a pair of balls. That's clearly something John Kerry lacks.  I can only hope Adam Sparks is right when he says  urlLink Kerry Will Lose The Election . It's not a matter of loving Dubya, so much as a fear of what a Kerry Whitehouse would bring.

       	People have a hard time getting “used” to me. My odd personality, my sunken eyes, my morbid sense of humor, my crooked nose, and several other “negative” attributes that give me an air that says “this guy is a serial killer in the making” keep people well past arms distance of me most of the time. I have two positive attributes that I know of. I’m intelligent, and I’m not hollow. Those two attributes contribute to a very unhappy life. I know what’s wrong, and I know that I can never fix it to take humanity to the next level. 	What’s my definition of hollow? It’s a society that’s made people like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears celebrities. It’s the people who watch shows like Joe Average or The Bachelor and make them the national phenomenon of pop culture. I’m surrounded by people who enjoy these shows, and it makes me understand why Kevin Spacey’s character in Seven laughed when he puked on the guy in the subway. I understand. I know.  	What’s my definition of intelligent? Intelligence is not only knowing how to balance your checkbook, fumble your way into the dark recesses of the internet without getting a virus, or working your way through a basic computer problem using the deductive reasoning skills you were never taught in school, but also knowing that we are society driven by a marketing machine that doesn’t care what the populous thinks (or knows that most don’t think at all), knowing that John Kerry is just as bad of a choice for president as George dub-ya, and knowing that the most important aspect of life is having people around you who can talk about more than the chick they fucked last night.  	I know the value of true friendship. I’ve seen it in action, and I’ve seen the lives it’s saved, firsthand. If it hadn’t been for some of the friends I’ve had in the past, I wouldn’t just get high, I would be a junkie. I wouldn’t just be depressed, I would be suicidal. I would have nothing but the self destructive nature behind these bitter bones that would have driven me to pull a Columbine in high school. (For those of you who are wondering, there are two victims of that crime that no one cares to talk about). 	I know I’m different, and I’m finally getting to a point in life where that’s OK. It’s what has set me apart, and it’s probably the only reason I’ll get into places like heaven or hell. Hmmm. Jerry Fallwell or Hitler, I’m not so sure who I’m more scared of. For those of you who read this, and understand yet don’t get offended by the assertions, I wish you the best. You are a rare breed.

       If I ever run for president, I will look for a platform everyone can agree upon. Monkeys for the Disabled.  It’s simple enough. Some might bother with curing cancer. Others AIDS. Others ending war. Others starting war.   But not me.   I want every retard in America to have a chimp.  I want the wheelchair-bound to be able to vicariously swing from vine to vine for groceries, toilet paper, forks, videos and the like.   I want Chris Reeves to have a four-handed friend that turns him from Clark Can’t into Superman.

       I was in traffic school last night. A class of 170 in Newport Beach. I was sitting next to a girl who intrigued me when she talked about playing soccer in college (I've always had a thing for soccer chicks). Someone across the room was questioning the legality of her ticket. I couldn't see her from my vantage point. She had one of those voices that was slightly shrill. The sort of voice that sounds like audio that had been distorted to sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks. Trying my signature charm and humor, I said, "I didn't know members of the lollipop guild could get tickets." She didn't say anything, so I kept going. "Is she going to pay her fine in Lucky Charms?" Still, not a laugh. "Or a whole pot 'o gold?" "Where'd she get her ticket, 'over the rainbow'? " At least I was amusing myself. "Maybe the mayor of Munchkin City can get her a pardon." Now I was confused, this was quality material. The girl was done holding back. "My sister is a dwarf!" "How was I supposed to know your sister was a midget?" I backtracked, realizing too late I was commenting about a victim of dwarfism to one of only two people in the class who I could have offended. "A dwarf! She's a dwarf!" "It's not that big of a deal," I said, thinking the dust had settled. "Big? Big? Ha ha. You're very funny, aren't you?" I spent three chilling hours next to someone who possibly loathed me more than I loathe myself. And back for another four hours in assigned seats next Thursday.

       If I ever got rich, I think I’d make a fascinating philanthropist. I’d hold breast cancer awareness galas and hire Howard Stern to paint my guests’ breasts.   I’d have a casino night where guests can bet and win prosthetic limbs for war veterans. I’d hold races where handi-helper monkeys are jockeys on seeing-eye dogs.  I’d establish a foundation dedicated to annihilating back, ear, ass, shoulder, and tit hair. I’d name it the B.E.A.S.T. AntiHair Coalition.  It would raise awareness and research permanent hair removal alternatives.  If I had all the money I’d ever need, I would truly become the Carnegie of my time.
