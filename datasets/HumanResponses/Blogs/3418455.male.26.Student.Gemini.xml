      Well my sisters birthday party was pretty cool.  My niece was VERY uncertain of things and wouldn't let go of me until her mom (my sister) came.  After all the sneaking around Juli was very surprised.  I had planned on just hanging out for an hour or so, but my brother in-law's brother and girlfriend are just like me so we hung out all night.  We made fun of people drank and all of a sudden 3 hours had passed.  Well @ 10 they left so I got in on a conversation with my sis and her husband and some of her close friends I've known since she's known them.  I got home @ 2 in one piece so all-in-all it was a good night.  Now Juli says she's gotta throw Curtis a party or his feelings will get hurt.  They're stupid!  Well until the next time.  ~opphold negativ

      Well it's that time of year again...my sisters birthday.  Last year, I remeber very vividly, I was in the emergency room for food poisoning.  Very dreadful experience.  I have yet to have crawfish since then, I feel the gurgling of stomach juices just thinking about it.  What does this have to to with Juli's b-day?  Well I missed going out with everyone b/c I had been @ the hostpital and whatnot.  Only good thing that came out of it was that I lost 20 lbs; but it came back...who cares.    Well now Curtis has decided to throw Juli a surprise party (I think she's going to be aggrevated) and I'm going to have to go hang out with people I don't know for who knows how long.  FUN FUN FUN.  ~stay negativ

      I really am at my wits end with trying to get 3d to work under gnu/linux.  It has sucked up all my time today.  I guess it's good I have no responsibilities.  Until the next time I want to talk to myself...

      Yes, that's me.  I was who knows how old...maybe 4 or 5, yet the anger is so evident even at an innocent age as that.  I guess I was born mad at the world, or maybe just jaded by this whole live your life to the fullest but don't be bad or you'll go to hell.  Well I say Uff Da!  remember ~ stay negativ

      I have WAY too many things I want yet no possible way to ever get them.  I am getting some of the "bestest" education possible but somehow doubt that my future career in digital forensics/security will be able to pay the bills.  The one good thing I do have going for me, other than the monthly supply of Klonnopin, is that I have lost interest in relationships.  My reasons: they are too expensive, at least they have been for me, and I normally come out of a relationship a little closer to psychosis.  As always: all your oil are belong to U.S. / stay negativ

      I FINALLY saw all of "To Catch A Thief" with Cary Grant and the so beautiful, so classy Grace Kelly.  I have been in awe of her pure beauty since my mother and I watched "Rear Window" as a child.  Great movie...I really hope there are people out there my age who appreciate these great movies.

      Friday in class I was thinking about the tattoo that I have wanted since high school.  Well I finally scratched it into my skin (not psycho-ly) and it looked awesome!  Though it was red and not green it still looked awesome.  I think I need to get it.

      Well that test I was "worried" about has past and I ended up getting a low b/ high c.  The jigha next to me got 1 point higher than an F...po' fool.  I really do like my teacher.  He's crazy smart, a lot about the historical foundations of mathematics, which I like.  Well, obviousl I am still not dead which Andree will be happy about, thanks for caring!  Ohwella...off to go play with the laptop (putting SuSE on it...maybe).  ~stay negativ

      Well I'm about to take a test, which I think I may do "o.k." on, but that's 1/2 of what's on my mind.  I have heard about the search for the largest Mersenne Prime quite a few times and yesterday in class we discussed it.  Well theres a program you are able to run on your own machines, very similar to the SETI project, but there's a catch!   If you are the person who finds the first Mersenne Prime with 10 million digits you win $100,000.  Well knowing that i've already started!  i can't imagine what the current number is up to since p = 7.1 megs in text format!  p, as in 2^p-1.  It's a long friggin # but hopefully i'll get it and run off to Sweden!

      Well it's Sunday it rained a bit and was overcast so it was okay.  I'm bumbed about the upcoming week since I have a test Friday in the strangest class I believe I have ever taken.  The teacher is quite the Nazi when it comes to the subject.  I am learning it, I think, but who knows how I'll do on the exam...  STAY NEGATIV

      The 3rd day of class has come and gone, but I didn't.  Alas here's the 4th day and I'm wearing f'ing bells.  I'm kinda uff-da'd b/c a guy is downloading something from me @ 8k/s  ...and the file size is just over 4 gigs.  You do the math, I don't wanna.  That means I have to live with this highspeed fan wizzing in my dreams....ohwella it's for a good cause; The propogation of SuSE!

      Well another summer; some more school.  I am taking only 1 class since I am poor and could only afford 3 hours plus they weren't offering much else that I needed.  The teacher seems to be a good guy.  I hope the class is like his last name, Holladay.  The most gruesome aspect is the price of the text...$100, not like I am surprised.  But the real bad thing is that it's a new book so I am forced to buy new!  I hate that!  Ohwell, just ate dinner, going to go take some Klonnopin and go to bed while watching Scream2.    Preview for tomorrow:  New Computer Arrives!!!!

       urlLink    Well last night brought back some very painful memories for me. My MiMi is in the hostpital and just seeing her lying in the bed brought back all the memories from 3 years ago of my PaPa. It was like I saw him there for a moment. Whenever MiMi coughed and winced at the pain in her chest I saw my PaPa react the same way to coughing.  Three years ago was pretty much the time I lost all faith in God, and love for him as well.  There was no need to let my poor PaPa suffer for as long and as hard as he did...yet God allowed it.  I have not gotten over that and don't think I will anytime soon.  PaPa I miss you so much and I hope MiMi comes to you with as little pain as possible.

      Wow!  "The Grid", a new TNT drama series was great.  It finally is going all out on the damn muslims.  I could type forever on my feelings on religion, epecially muslim.  The simple fact that they degrade and limit the freedom of 1/2 of their population (women, that is) is outrageous!  These poor women need to be free to choose what they do...not some crazy funadamentalist clerics.  F THEM!    ~bli negativ

      I am having a lot of luck getting all this great music lately.  I have gotten multiple gigs of music, which isn't strange, the strange thing is that it's all REALLY good.  All I ask is that this keeps up...and the guy whose posting the "My Dying Bride" flood keeps it up.  Update...Still not dead and Lacuna Coil is still my favorite.

           Right now I am watching "The Saint" with Val Kilmer and the beautiful Elisabeth Shue.  Well one of my old roommates sister looks just like her, or close enough for me.  Well we were always dating someone at different times while the other was single.  Mostly she was constantly getting engaged to different guys and I was with this beast.  Well one night when she broke up with her b/f she came over and chilled with one of my other roommates.  Well they ended up getting together a couple of times...all the while I was right on the other side of the wall without any beast!!!      Well we talked a few weeks later about it all, she had already gotten engaged to someone else, and she said she thought I was still with the Amazon and that's why she didn't call me!  For years we were always "talking" about it but there was the chance and poof!      I regret not cheating on the Amazon when I could have b/c she did it to me, but unfortunately I am not like that.  Now I don't believe in that crap anymore....it's too much trouble.        So the moral is "When temptation tempts....give in for you'll probably never get the chance to do it again, plus there will be time to 'repent'".

      A long time ago I was dating this Amazonian "girl" who turned out to be psycho.  Well for her birthday I gave her a laptop, kinda thinkig we were still dating.  Well unknown to me, basically because she never told me, she "stopped" dating me and was doing her thing all over the town while still sleeping over at my place, that is when she wasn't over "somewhere else".  Anyway, time went by and I stopped seeing her all together, THANK GOD!  Well she still had the laptop and my roommate had wanted to borrow it and told him that the psycho still had it.  He got mad and went and got it!!!  He's the shit!  Well just b/c of him I had that computer to be able to let my neice play with and now it's over at sistas house getting used...Thanks Charlie!

      I HATE my sisters computer.  It's my old one from, I believe, 1997-1999.  It's a 400 MHz AMD, Slow as shit and useless!  I can't even put a *nix system on it b/c it can't recognize a hard drive larger than 40 gigs!  USELESS.  So instead of constantly trying to fix it I let em have my old laptop...works pretty well, at least for their needs.  Of course Curtis wants a 3GHz machine but doesn't wanna have to pay for it.  It's funny, my sis has always had a puter; always one of my old ones.  Well F that crap box....i think I am going to ask curtis to take me to a shooting range and we'll take his assault rifle to it.  That should be fun.  Until next time... ~stay negativ

      If anyone out there is wondering where the terror starts it's in Switzerland.  The Swiss take great pride in their shady "no questions asked" mentality to global banking.  I think a contemporary and professional global bussiness should practice more legitimate methods in their trade.  All a terrorist would have to do is create a numbered, anonymous account filled with millions of dollars and their little friends take what is needed.  Thanks to friends like the Saudi royal family and every damn African country, these people have free run to create fear.  I wish the American people would unite, regardless of differences (not unlike post Pearl Harbor) and crush the enemy before they move again.  Time is on their side, not ours!  It is definitely not this administrations, nor the sex-filled admin priors fault for anything happening, they are bound by our own laws protecting the terrorists.  We should seriouslly re-think our form of law, at least for the time being to protect our future.  Yeah, rights will be lost, but they are only "rights" not "lives".  Which is more important to us?  I would gladly suffer any inconvieniences imposed just knowing that those people are feeling the same squeeze, making it harder to do their "jihad"    Fuck your jihad, I'm Rick James bitch!
