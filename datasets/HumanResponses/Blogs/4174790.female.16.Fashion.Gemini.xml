       I'm going to start off with a little about Charlotte. Unlike everybody else in our year she isn't gay. Infact she's quite cool. She absolutly beautiful and has blossomed these last few years after being along with me the only 2 girls in our year who actually looked like boys. But now she is the most chased girl, and so makes the old clueless crew jelous. Charlotte likes Nick and has done for quite sometime.Theyr'e made for eachother and even more he REALLY like her too which makes it hard for her as she dosn't understand why he isn't with her. Charlotte is the funniest and most stylish person i have ever met and isn't affraid to speak her mind. Making her a fantastic person to be mates with yet if your a hainuss bitch that is jelous of her then you probably would'nt no why she's so cool. Talking of Bitches the next passage is about the mongs in our year.

       Hello their, this is brief intoduction to everybody i know that is tremendously gay. Firstly i'll tell you about Francesca probably the most bloody ugly and shamefully lame one of the gay clan. She developed quickly so while the rest of the year were flat chested (and skinny) she was a dumpy large breasted THING who resembled a death scene from the exxorsised. The guys testostorone was flying high by year 7 at school so little miss 'i get any funny line i say from friends' got all the attention making her up herself and had rather young prospects of becoming a slag. Of corse u may be thinking she can't help it if she's a quick developer. But she definatly can help being a bitch all the time. Then there's her follower Helen she's a little quieter than Francesca but still just as manipulative. If they say or do something bitchey and i find out they'll turn it around so they are the victims making it seem like im the bitch in the whole situation. I probably dig myself into it a little seen as i give better than i get so i probably do end up saying and doing worse things but they always start it. Helen is going out with Matt my first love, we're great friends but Helen gets pissed off if i so much as talk 2 matt. Rosie is Helen's best friend, she's ok but when she's not pretending to be the great dictator and sitting on the fence she's actually feeding information back to the motley crew. The other girl who i am a little suprised at the gayness is Lauren, she's jelous of Charlotte my best friend because she's more attractive and lauren's boyfriend Nick fancies Charlotte. Above anything else she is probably the most boring person ever ever ever to go anywhere other than school. She's friends with Holly a girl/boy person pretending to be a punk yet she gets all her cloths from the high street fashion shops it's so sad she looks like her whole outfits where bought from a charity shop giving her the genius name of OXFAM MAN. She can be such a bitch but also does the silent treatment instead of being confrontational. This is even more anoying it's just so bloody rude. Then their is Kusia, she's ok i suppose a complete busy body and can go beyond bitch sometimes but at least she has the decency to be polite her along ith Rosie are the only two who actually chat back when the silence is broken by light banter on my behalf. I always go out of my way to say hello or how was your weekend AND I KNOW i'm no saint i bitch along with the rest of them but i have reason.

         I know it' the big good verus evil debate whether parents have anything to do with how kids turn out and i never used to be fore that motion until i spent a good 3/4 of my lower school life with Francesa and her family. She has a younger brother, Anthony who i think has a form of attention deficate dissorder. He has an obsession with knives and killing people so at the age of 12 you would have thort his parents wouldn't have let him have a whole collection of weapons inc. swords to guns. But you would be wrong, on a trip to Thailand with Francesca and her family last year, Anthony bought back a total of seven weapons bought by his quite similar phycotic father John. Then there is Gina she SEEMS so nice to everybody but then when she gets pissed off a glimmer of where Fran's bitchyness is shown. My parents have been good friends with Gina and John for years so when they go round to their house for an adult evening then they go quite deeply along with Charlotte's parents Angela and CLive and some other friends into adult jokes and chit chat for people below the age of 18 not to know till their about 16 and even then they're too embarresed to admit that they know it. Well insted of being upstairs asleep Gina would let Francesca from the age of about 4 sit for the evening listening to Debbie (another of my parents friends) and Tina talking about there sex lives in great detail.    Francesca's back ground may not be oh so bad and the truth is, it's not but then little things such as what i have mentioned make a child feel more like an adult and so results in her being boring and hating people who arn't.   Helen is another one effected by her family, her mum is a food friek always saying Helen is fat when she is quite skinny making Helen feel insecure so when she sees people who arn't or covers it well she shuts down and has a good bitch.   The rest of them are all just irritating, they think they know everything and think that Charlotte and I are stupid well theyr'e rong we definatly know what theyr'e about and now it's pay back time.

       Next week Charlotte and I will be joining the gay group for an adventure holiday with the school we left a few weeks back but thort it would be a laugh anyway. Well in my next post i will write of how they are bitchy to us but this one is just to know that we will pay them back for making us feel small and stupid by playing practical jokes on them in the ardesche. The can moan all they want but the greif wev'e had over the years i think they deserve to feel stupid for a little bit. Some of the things on my list to do is toilet seat clingfilm, soap on tooth brushes, condoms in pockets and the pieces de resistance im bringing a super soaker with me. I'll post how i got on and their reactions. I would say we cud make lauren and Helen look bad but with faces like that we shud do the opposite and do every1 a favour they are total troles.hahaha
