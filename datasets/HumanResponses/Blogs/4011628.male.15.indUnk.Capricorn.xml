       Michael Learns To Rock - That's Why (You Go Away)   Baby want you tell me why there is sadness in your eyes  I don't wanna say goodbye to you  Love is one big illusion I should try to forget  But there is something left in my head   You're the one who set it up  Now you're the one to make it stop  I'm the one who's feeling lost right now  Now you want me to forget every little thing you said  But there is something left in my head   I won't forget the way you're kissing  The feelings so strong were lasting for so long  But I'm not the man your heart is missing  That's why you go away I know  You were never satisfied no matter how I tried  Now you wanna say goodbye to me  Love is one big illusion I should try to forget  But there is something left in my head   I won't forget the way you're kissing  The feelings so strong were lasting for so long &nbsp;But I'm not the man your heart is missing  That's why you go away I know   Sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere  Don't know which way to go There is so much to say now between us  There ain't so much for you (ain't so much for you)&nbsp; There ain't so much for me (ain't so much for me)&nbsp;anymore  I&nbsp;won't forget the way you're kissing  The feelings so strong were lasting for so long  But I'm not the man your heart is missing  That's why you go away I know

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting for the combined chamber chorus with CSS, VS and TKSS is on the 10th of August. I'm looking forward to meeting my new friends and fellow singers in the chamber chorus. I personally think that the future for this choir is going to be bright. Haha. Come to think of it, the 3 presidents have not thought of a name for the combined chorus. Hmm... Voce Naturae? or Thunderation ( Theodore Teow )? or Requiem ( Mandric Tan [me!] )? Confusing.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is funny. When my sis was around, i'd sometimes wish that she'd never go away. Now that she has gone to the US for holiday (without me!!!!), i kinda miss her. Hahaha. I bet when she reads this she's gonna laugh. Anyway. Feeling bored... Tomorrow's the Geography Class Test and I haven't studies throughly for it. Probably going to fail. :/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And1 Basketball Class Jersey on it's way to my waredrobe soon. Haha. Hopefully it's the Int Street Sweepa Rev Tank Model as that's the ideal model of jersey i'd like to have. Sounds like crap eh? I think so too. Haha. Now listening to 我的心太乱. Sometimes it really describes how i am feeling. Puzzled at what i should do and how do i go about doing it. It helps to listening to this kind of songs. They soothe your worries and assure my dreams. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Life is just like a corridor with many doors, I opened the ****** door and i didn't like what i saw inside" -  Theodore Teow 2004

       YoZ... FiRsT TiMe PoStInG BlOg On ThE NeT... QuItE LaMe BuT I'd LiKe To TrY... LoLx... AnYwAy, WaNnA&nbsp;StArT OfF By PuTtInG A SoNg  &nbsp;:: LoNgEsT TiMe ::  If you said goodbye to me tonight There would still be music left to write What else could I do I'm so inspired by you That hasn't happened for the longest time Once I thought my innocence was gone Now I know that happiness goes on T hat's where you found me When you put your arms around me I haven't been there for the longest time&nbsp; I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall And the greatest miracle of all Is how I need you And how you needed me too That hasn't happened for the longest time Maybe this won't last very long But you feel so right And I could be wrong Maybe I've been hoping too hard But I've gone this far And it's more than I hoped for Who knows how much further we'll go on Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone I'll take my chances I forgot how nice romance is I haven't been there for the longest time I had second thoughts at the start I said to myself Hold on to your heart Now I know the woman that you are You're wonderful so far And it's more than I hoped for I&nbsp;don't care what consequence it brings I have been a fool for lesser things I want you so bad I think you ought to know that I intend to hold you for the longest time
