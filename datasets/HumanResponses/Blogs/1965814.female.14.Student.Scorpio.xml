      It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart Without saying a word you can light up the dark Try as I may I can never explain What I hear when you don't say a thing  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  All day long I can hear people talking out loud But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd  Try as they may, they could never define Whats being said between your heart and mine  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me where ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  That Smile on your face The truth in your eyes The touch of your hand lets me know that you need me

      We all want to be happy. We devise different ways of attaining it ? making more money, going on an overseas trip, finding someone to love, indulging in good food, and so on. We may be happy for a while, but then the emptiness returns soon enough.   Are we destined to spend our lives on an undulating wave, waiting for the next crest, and then struggling desperately not to drown while waiting for the next one?   Can we keep happiness permanently switched on?  Aviee Signing off *toodles*

Yes we were in the wrong but u think it rite to give out such a punishment? u think we enjoy being tortured we come to sch to learn we don't come to sch to run ard the field or do physical punishment like in the army?? wad kind of detention u call this?? but nevermind u based ur punishment on saying we dragged on the rehersal rite?? u made us stay back for about 2 extra periods rite?? but didnt the sch let go two periods 4 the rehersal so y r u making us pay 4 the lost of the two periods by doing stupid punishments in the hot hot sun?? is it fair u tell me?? he juz gives us the punishment but who is actually suffering ?? huh its us!!! why cant he juz get it into his head that this is a sch n not some army camp.. arghhhh juz forget it la but honestly i felt this was kinda unfair but yea the punishment is over soo yea wads the point....lolz... hahaha had great fun dancing to my favourite folkdance song... lol cant wait 4 the day to cum hehhe i m excited lolz hahaa i m dead tired from the punishment lolx wish can take MC lol.... ermmmm so yippeee...

      KID ROCK Living my life in a slow hell Different girl every night at the hotel I ain't seen the sun shine in three damn days Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey Wish I had a good girl to miss me Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways  I put your picture away Sat down and cried today I can't look at you While I'm lying next to her I put your picture away Sat down and cried today I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her  oooooooooooo  SHERYL CROW I called you last night in the hotel Everyone knows but they won't tell But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right I've been waitin on you for a long time Fueling up on heartaches and cheap wine I ain't heard from you in three damn nights  I put your picture away I wonder where you've been I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him  oooooooooo  I put your picture away I wonder where you've been I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him  oooooooooo  I saw you yesterday with an old friend  KID ROCK It was the same old same how have you been  BOTH Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey  KID ROCK You reminded me of brighter days  SHERYL CROW I hoped you were coming home to stay I was headed to church  KID ROCK I was off to drink you away  BOTH I thought about you for a long time Can't seem to get you off my mind I can't understand why we're living life this way  I found your picture today I swear I'll change my ways I just called to say I want you to come back home ooooooooo I found your picture today I swear I'll change my ways I just called to say I want you To come back home I just called to say I love you Come back home
