       Hi everyone, I just started this thing and I have no clue what it is. Since I am so lost and confused, please tell me what to put in here and what I am doing wrong. Feel free to post anything, but don't use profanity unless it is entirely necessary.

       Ok, the politic thing was great, now it is time to come up with a new topic.  With this being a very controversial issue, this next topic should have some interesting responses.  I do believe this might be a little related to the last topic, but only in that it is a decision trying to be made by politicians.

       Bush is by far the better candidate even though his speech skills are lacking.  Besides Democrats are for abortion. That makes the choice real easy.

        Hey guys!
Computer illiterate Susan finally figured out how to do a little bit of this junk! yay for me! as for the candidates, I could honestly careless. I have never been very involved in the presidential elections so I find absutlutely no reason to start now, I can't even vote assumig that even then I'd know anything about politics. Social Studies is definenly not one of my strongest points but as little as I know, the Bushman doesn't seem to have made very good decisions for the past four years. With that in consideration one must wonder if he had some intellectual awakening since his last disasterous term. Kerry, in my opionion would be an interesting president. I can't imagine what the political cartoons would look like. Actually, I'm kind of looking forward to seeing one if he should be the winner. I am not a Democrat and I hate to call myself a Republican when I don't keep track of things, as I have said before. All I would have to say to the winner, is good luck pleasing Americans...they get angry if spilled coffee burn them, as if there was any other way to drink coffee.
Reid out.

       Ok, I think I am starting to understand this a little bit, but I am still a little shaky. I think I should just start with some random topic and see if it attracts anybody. I will post this in a question format so it doesn't seem that I am taking sides, but feel free to take sides.

Since there is an election coming up soon, I think it would be fitting to start by asking: Who is the better candidate for the upcoming presidential election, Bush or Kerry?
