      ~~IMPORTANT NOTICE~~ Please note that this fiction piece comprises of many stories and movies (range from harry potter to matrix and from van helsing to mutant x) so please bear with the various characters.   ~~DISCLAIMER~~ Most of the characters in the fiction does not belong to me, they belong to their various creators, thus I will keep this disclaimer short and simple by saying ALL characters in this story does not belong to me except from Hillary, Kay and Catherine(so much for a short disclaimer)    >  Tom.M.Riddle: Upon the death of his father, he and his brother came to inherit two of the (Lord Voldemort)legendary stones, thus sparking off his interest in them and ultimately                 leading to the bloody war between the vampires and the wizards and the                  death of his wife and his brother. Despite being the eldest brother, he                  not as careful as Tomas, his younger brother and has a tendency of being                 rather rash at times.   Hillary.T.Riddle: Tom Riddle's only child and heir, thankfully for him she is also the                   most loyal to him. Her lust for killing vampires developed when her   mother was murdered by Lestat De Lioncourt in a raid. She is highly skilled with the sword and is even better at curses, her main weaknesses lie in the fact that she drops her guard whenever in the presence in a good looking guy or someone she trusts.She is very good at her studies but the only problem is that she battle strategies only work in theory but not in practice. For a girl of age 13, it is a remarkable achievement that she is an Eagle anigrami.    Thorine.Jacinta.Riddle: Tom Riddle's wife and mother to Hillary, she was a patient woman                         who never bothered about her husband's affairs with other women. She was murdered by Lestat, when he and his band of vampires raided the Riddle's manor.   Tomas.M.Riddle: Tom's younger brother, and is obviously the more calm and creative one of                 the two, making him Tom's direct opposite. He was never into the idea of torturing vampires or any of Tom's "ingenious" ideas, in truth he was quite fond of vampires and was a close friend to Dracula. Upon discovering, that his brother wanted to use the stones to rule the world, he fled to france with the stones that he has stolen from Tom, along with his family, thinking that Tom would never be able of finding him. But he was wrong, within three years Tom discovered his hideout and murdered him and his wife, only letting his daughter live as only she knew the secrect to the location of the two stones.   Catherine.T.Riddle: Her parent's were murdered when she was only six years old while                     she was out at school. Her uncle then took her in and brought her up, telling her that her parents were murdered by vampires, when in truth it was her uncle that did the murdering. The fact that she is the last link to the lost two stones is the only thing that makes Tom keep her alive. Like her father, she is the complete opposite to Hillary. She is a crack shot with the bow and his highly skilled with charms and the transformation of various objects. Like her cousin she is a young amigamis and is capable of turning into more than one creature.   Count Vladislaus Dragulia: Lord of the free vampires of the world and the son of (Count Dracula)            Lucifer, he was the keeper of four of the remaining stones  including the most important one, the map stone which enabled the keeper to discover the location of all the other stones. By accident or by destiny he became the biological father to Kay, thankfully he somehow managed to hold on to a small bit of his soul, enabling him to take on the role as a father while being a cold-blooded murderer on the battlefield agaisnt the Wizards. Being a vampire there is only one creature that is capable of killing him and that is a werewolf, but the venom of a werewolf is good enough to render him unconscious while at the same time weakens his will. If given too much venom, he would become truly hollow and without a will of his own.    KalbÃ»ren Draconis: One might even call her the accidental child, as none ever expected    (Kay)              Dracula to have an "living" child, but none candoubtt her loyalty to her father and his cause. Her mother was able toconceivee her due to the fact that she was the lastdescendentt of Dracula's line and was a half-vampire. Due to direct orders from Lucifer to kill either KalbÃ»ren or his wife, he chose to save his daughter's life. The war between the Wizards and the Vampires led to her being sent to Lucifer for over ten years. There she learnt the art of controlling fire, along with many other skills. Upon returning to the world she discovers the disappearence of her father and goes on an all out search for him.   Cujo Erckson: One of the few vampires that can be considered as Dracula's true friend, he doubles as a bodyguard and a helper in Dracula's house. When the was began, he was ordered to go with KalbÃ»ren to Hell, along with the twins Geer and Veers to protect her if need be. He is the master of stealth and is un-matched with the dagger.   Geer & Veers Webster: Brothers in arms, and best friends to KalbÃ»ren dispite their huge age difference. To KalbÃ»ren they are just friends, but in truth they stick along-side KalbÃ»ren so as to prevent any harm to her. Dispite being over 30 years old, they still have a childish air to them.   Lesat De Lioncourt: The leader of the Rebel Vampires, he has been battling agaisnt Voldemort for years for the liberation of his kind. Now the battle heats up when he discoveres that Voldemort intends to use the stones to control them. He might be a murderer but he still has his pride and honour.   Ameera Raider: Lestat's dierect childe, she serves as is aside and is second in command in the resistance. She was once Hillary and Catherine, but after being sired she has gone all out to protect her kind, even if it means killing her two ex-friends.  ______________________________________________________________________________________     ~~~NOTE~~~ This story will comprise of MANY different stories, the main ones happen to be...1)Harry Potter 2)Van Helsing (movie) 3)Interview with a Vampire

              "Kay, what in the name of god are you doing?" Gracevre asked in disbelief as she was her best friend and one time mentor Kayburen pack up her belongings in her small room in the Vatcican City Underground, headquaters of the Knights of the Holy Order.          "You can bloody well see what I'm doing Grace," pausing for only a moment to look at grasper in the eye, "and if your so thick headed as to not know what I'm doing, you can go ask to find out." A clearly pissed off Kayburen replied and went back to packing her belongings.          "But you can't leave now, not when the wizards are spoiling for a fight, your the best knight the Order has. We need you." Gracevre replied, while moving to bar Kayburen from the door.          "Ok let me get this straight with you before you, I'm leaving for two reasons, first one I can never tell you or anyone else for that matter. Second one is because..."          Before Kayburen could even finish her explanation, Gracevre had begun with her "hairdryer speech" which was so fearsome that it had won grasper the respect of the Cardinals. "For god's sake Kay! There is no viable reason for you to leave the order! And if you have sinned in any way, the Pope himself would be glad to bless you. After the multitude of Udead you have rid from this world any holy man would be honored to bless you!"          With the mention of the Pope, Kayburen's eyes flashed angrily as she turned to face grasper. "Grace just for your information, it was the bloody Pope that passed the verdict to have me exiled from the Order."          A moment of uncomfortable silence followed as Gracevre just stood rooted at the spot as she let Kayburen's last words sink in. Kayburen on the other hand just pick up her bag of belongings and pushed past grasper and made her way towards the exit of the city.          Kayburen knew that she would one day see her friend again but when that fateful day came, Kay could not guarantee that she and her friend would be fighting on the same side. She also knew that there was no hope in anyone trying to coax her back, she and the Pope had made up their minds. Kay did not wish to cause further damage to a kind that was created by her very family, and the Pope would not have a damned soul serving under his command.          Deep within her thoughts Kay did not notice that she had already made her way out of the underground and was in the bright sunshine of Rome's summer. Just beyond the gates of the Vatican, Kay could see her faithful stead still waiting for her, Joust. As she made towards the unknown, she was suddenly stopped by the voice of one she had known as a "father" for so long.         "We found out about your sentence from the Pope and just came to give you a little something that will help along the way." Cardinal Jottel said in his slow wheezy voice, with that he tossed Kayburen a leather bag and turned back towards the Vatican. "Just a little far well gift from me and Giles." He added as he walked off. To any passer-by one would have thought that the cardinal had no emotion for the loss of his friend, but to those who had spent years with the man could sense the sadness within his voice.          Kayburen caught the thick leather bag with one hand, and nodded to the retreating figure of her past mentor, and whispered "I'll miss you Jottel" With that Kayburen swung onto her waiting stead and made her way into the unknown. As she blized past the streets, only the most keen eyed of creatures could see the single tear that slipped down her cheek. At that point of time, Kay swore that she was cursed to live a hard life, little did she know that the Devil still had more plans for her and her family.   _________________________________________________________________________________________  Here's the first chapie....its only a rough draft so please kindly tell me any mistakes or places where you are not happy with.

      StoryOverview: War has broken out between the Knights of the Holy Order and the Wizards (Voldemort Rules over the wizarding world) Now, a group of friends must choose, which side to stand on. For their decision will affect the course of the war itself.   >   Liz Riddle: Daughter to Voldemort and heir to the throne. She, like her father is incredibally gifted at magic and is undeniably the best witch at Hogwarts in her time there, only second when it came to potions, charms and magical creatures, which her other two friends excelled in. She is dead loyal to her father and his cause, and will stop at nothing to gain power and attention. Which means that even those who are close to her are not safe from her wand. The only problem with her is that she has a weakness for "cute" looking boys.(Eagle Anigrami)  Gracevre Van Helsing: Decendent of Gabriel Van Helsing the great monster hunter, she is one of the best knights of the holy order. While at the holy order she was under the watchful eyes of her friend and master monster hunter, Kayburen. But after Kay's departure from the Order she is now left with only Giles, her weapon's smith as her helper and guide. She attended Hogwarts along with Liz and Kay, and is always the one to stop both of them from fighting in their younger years. She is particularly gifted at charms and potions. She is the complete oppsite of Liz in every aspect, but like Liz, is dead loyal to the Holy Order. With the war between the Knights and Wizards on, her loyalties will be pushed to the limit. (Horse Anigrami)   Kayburen Dracon: Daughter to Count Dracula (the vampire), she is the one that is caught in the middle of the war with no clear way out. Upon discovering her family line, the kinghts of the holy order removed her from their service and now the once unmatched monster hunter roomes the streets as a freelancer.Her ego does not allow her to  find her father as she had already killed so many of his servants, but as the war progresses it is starting to become very clear that the only way for her to survive is to go to him for help. While at Hogwarts she befriended her ward Gracevre and her rival Liz, she had always had a thing for magical creatures and her tallent showed during her time at Hogwarts.   Count Vladislaus Dragulia: Father to Kayburen and lord of vampires and werewolves, he had known all along that Kayburen was his child but did not have the will to tell her the truth when he saw the hatred in her eyes when he killed her friend Jet. So he played the dangerous game of cat and mouse, pretending to try and kill Kay while in fact trying to keep watch over her. With Lord Voldemort's constant challenges to his throne, he has to juggle two enemies at once, the knights of the holy order and the Death Eaters, while all the while hoping that his daughter will one day discover the truth of her family.   Tom.M.Riddle (Lord Voldemort): He is the lord of the wizarding world and master of majority of the dark creatures in the existing world, he is also the father to Liz, his only child and heir. He is incredibally gifted with the wand and will not hesitate to kill or torture anyone who displeases him, even his own daughter is not safe from his wand. In his hunger for new land and slaves, it drove him to attack the vampires and werewolves in a bid to enslave them, while attacking the Knights of the Holy order for their land and technology.  Giles Riverwane: He is a genius weapons maker for the knights of the holy and for a long time worked to provide weapons for Kayburen and her ward, Gracevre.

      ~~Disclaimer~~  OK this story is considered as an original fiction, despite the fact that some un-original characters will be chucked into it.   Story Overview:   Every two thousand years, hell is unleashed upon the earth to curb the expansion of its living creatures. The year 2005 is that very year. Now mankind will have to fight the army of darkness, before darkness claims the land they had once ruled over. But unlike the past generations that have fought for their survival, this generation has one major advantage...They have discovered the existence of magic. Despite the fact that only 40% of the population has the ability to wield magic, it still gives them a large advantage. The only problem is that the new Wizards are starting to feel superior to their "weaker" human counterparts, who are unable to wield magic. This will only lead to trouble within the ranks as now the "squibs" are starting to feel that their kind are being used as "Calvary folder" and are being killed without reason. Now the "squibs" must chose their side. To fight for humanity or for darkness.
