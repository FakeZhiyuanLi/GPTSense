      Look,  The next time I hear some talking head saying Nader is going to cost Kerry the election, I am going to puke on my fucking shoes.   The analogies to the 2000 election with Al Gore are tiresome and incorrect.  Ralph Nader did not cost Al Gore the election, Al Gore cost Al Gore the election.  If he only won his home state or Bill Clinton's state, Florida would not have mattered.  Al Gore looked like an idiot in the debates-rolling his eyes, sighing out loud, shruging his sholders, ect.  Al Gore ran away from Clinton's record.  Considering Clinton was popular despite everything that happened, the Al Gore ran from it.  Al Gore abandoned issues that Democrats care about: jobs, education, health care, and the enviornmet.  Al Gore was the one on stage with George Bush bragging how his "plan" would spend more money on the military.  Al Gore and his running mate were the ones who ran around the country with their religous talk, as if GWB didn't talk about it enough.  Face it, the Dems are abandoning their base of support.  They will loose again in 2004 to the most incompetent president in United States history.  Why?  Let's look at Kerry.  It is the same game. The "nomination" process only chose Kerry because they felt safe.  Kerry doesn't represent the Democratic party.  Even if he does, he will not fight for the presidency.  He talks about Democratic values, but does not fight for them.    The Democrats/Liberals/Progressives need to start fighting back.  Hannity, Limbaugh, Savage, and the rest of the blow hards cannot continue to spew their garbage unanswered.   For the intelligent Libs out there, it is time to answer these guys.  It is time to stand up for what is right.

      Vice President Dick Cheney was in Houston last week for a fundraiser.  He took the opportunity to take a few swings at Kerry's "war on terror" credentials, again trying to scare the American people to vote for Bush.  Why anybody would trust this administration is beyond me.  Starting from the top, let's remember that neither Bush or Cheney served in a significant way(we can talk about the National Guard, and that is serving, but in comparision to others...).  I have no problems that they didn't serve.  The problem I have lies how this campaign notoriously smears those who did.  Remember John McCain in the Carolinas?   They portrayed him as a wacked-out veteran.  All of this aside, lets look at their Credibility.  Iraq is a mess.  Before the war began, Bush and Cheney made speeches implying mushroom clouds, millions of dead Americans, massive WMD buildups, and on and on......They stated they could do this war on the cheap, a small force will suffice, and Iraqi oil will pay for it all. They even led us to believe our troops will be greeted with flowers and such(like the liberation of Paris in WWII).  To date, everything this adminstration has said about Iraq is wrong.  From the justification of the war, the execution of the war, and the result of the war, they have been wrong the whole time.  And today they are trying to scare us in to voting for them.  I won't harp on the war forever, but it leaves me with a burning question.  What will happen when US intelligence identifies a REAL WMD threat in the future?  What if there is an immediate threat that required military intervention?  What credibilty does the US have?  I would trust Kerry over Bush on this war ANY day.

      Welcome.  This is my first posting ever, so please be patient as I learn the culture and methodology of blogs.  I enjoy writing about anything, especially politics.  I want this blog to be honest and absent of jargon, cliches, and blind devotion to any party.  With this being my first posting, I want to keep it simple.  The issues I want to address are important.  As U.S. citizens, we need to be aware of two things.  First, the vast majority of us ignore our civic responsibilities, the most important being voting.  Very few people participate in civics, and for our democracy to survive, we must be active participants.  Our national and local leaders are elected by a smaller and smaller group of people, while the rest of eligible voters remain silent.  This must change.  It will only change at the individual level(i.e.  you!).  Second, we are CITIZENS, not consumers.  Corporations exist because we, the people, allow them to.  Corporate charters are granted by the people; corporate charters are not a right.  Elected officials are in office because we put them there.  We have far more power(and responsibility) than we exercise.  This, for the sake of our country, must change.
