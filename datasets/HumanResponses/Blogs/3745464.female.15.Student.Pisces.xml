      soo i dont write much anymore...i guess i forget or i just dont care...i mean after everything that has happend this summer it makes me wonder...i just dont know... I couldn't tell you why she felt that way,  She felt it everyday. And I couldn't help her,  I just watched her make the same mistakes again.  What's wrong, what's wrong now? Too many, too many problems. Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside.  Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why. You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind. Be strong, be strong now. Too many, too many problems. Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside.  Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place.   She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside.

      ok wow this weekend has been one that will never be forgotten... well maybe it will but it was really fun. I went to the mall with lacey and my friend thomas was gonna be in town. So he went to the mall and i met him there and he had terri and ben with him. Terri i hadnt seen scine like last fall or even longer then that. Ben i hadnt seen since the summer when i met him which was like 3yrs ago. Even though thomas acted like an ass the WHOLE TIME!! It was nice to hang out with ben and terri. When i got home from the mall jackie came over and then brent called. Then aroun 4:00ish ben and terri came back over while thomas and his lil hoe went somewhere else... gawd i hate her.... but anyway they stayed until about 6:15ish i think...then they left and jackie stayed the night. Brent came over about 10:30ish and i got to talk and hang out with him. I forgot to say happy birthday SHIT!!! opps well HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRENT!!!! but he was in town of course for his Birthday...then jackie left at 3:00am which i had NO IDEA ABOUT...but anyway we watched the Teaxs Chainsaw Masscure now you who have seen it and dont think its scary FUCK U! lol its soooooooooo fuckin scary i couldnt even watch most of it because it was nasty. And for you who have seen it and think its scary THANK YOU!!! omg it was a good movie just scary as hell!!! i mean come on its based on a REAL FUCKIN STORY!!! and they NEVER FUCKIN CAUGHT THAT DUDE! you wanna tell me thats NOT scary it is... but anyways yeah so now im cleaning my bathroom and my room but i had to let this stuff sit in my shower so i thought id come and post i dont want to get behind on this...well i think its about time for me to get back to cleaning....post more later

      Today: hmm i hung out with jackie for a lil bit because we thought my friend thomas was coming but he couldnt. So then at four i went and got Mc Donlads and rented Teaxs Chainsaw Masscure and The Butter Fly Effect. Then i came home and jackie came over again because once again we thought thomas was coming. Then she left and Kate came over and we watched Teaxs Chainsaw Masscure but it was the old one so i didn't want to watch it. Then i smoked pot. so then kate is staying the night tonight. Tomorrow: I have to go to the mall with lacey tomorrow around 11:00 then i have to come home and call thomas (who now is in town) and then i get to hang out with him eric and terri hopefully. So my day should be fun and exciting! lol i dunno though...but ill write more later im going to go and watch the butterfly effect for the 19th time!

      sooo here i am again and i still cant sleep maybe its because i know now that my friend REALLY is moving today it all seemed like a bad dream it didnt even seem like this could happen and yet it did...he lied to me...i know this but im willing to forgive him because i care he told me he had to leave today he will be leaving from his house in about 5mins he didnt leave today at 10:00am like he said im not dumb this my sound werid but it just didnt feel like he was gone... but now as the time gets closer i know he really is moving. i dont want to talk about this now...what did i do today got to hang out with jackie and kate its cool they got along thanks guys! and we went and i got new clothes then we stayed at the mall for a lil bit then we came home and on the way we thought we would stop and see sam but he wasnt home he was at alexs so we called him and they met us up at the bank then we came back to my house to drop off my clothes and went for a walk then sam left and it was just me jackie kate and alex fun for him huh? yea so then kate left and me and jackie went with alex back over to sams house and then from sams we went to alex's house and watched a movie until my dad called and said jackies mom was looking for her then jackie had to go home cuz her mom wasnt too happy and alex walked me home :) and then i ate dinner and fell alseep for 2 and 1/2 hours it was good because i didnt sleep at all last night which im sure is how tonight is gonna turn out. because already i cant fall alseep soo who knows...i want to go to graften (i think thats how u spell it) with my sister but i dont think she will drive up here then drive back down.. i guess thats why it sucks we live soo far apart...so does my dad have a wedding ring on his finger? good question yea he does fuck u dad i mean marty u suck anyway and u and ur lil hoe can jus go fuck each other sick thought!! but yea u know im not the kind of person where u can just throw some BIG news at them and them be able to handle it fine i cant do that im not good with things like weddings ppl moving death  im workin on it im only a teenage u cant ask for much from me... maybe ill get coffe again this morning!! WHOO!!! yea may sound like im happy but im not jus so everyone knows...so today what am i going to do i know i should go out and forget about him and try to focus on somthing else but its hard maybe ill just mope around the house all day feelin sorry for myslef....maybe just maybe...mike called today..i dunno but that was werid me and him dont really talk our friendships really weird like i know we care about each other but we just dont ever talk...and when we do i dunno maybe that will change no i want it to stay the same...have i heard from byran yet  a question ive been asked alot lately the answer NO!!! i dont know where the hell he is or what/who the hell hes doing all i know is that it sucks we cant have a realtionship hun if we dont talk... think about it. i thought i saw him today but everyone told me it wasnt him...like they know him like me...HA! no soo yeah i got eyeliner in my eye earlier it hurt like a BITCH! yea not very fun huh? well i mean i told u what i did with my day and who im talkin to and i just dont want to think about brent soo maybe sometime when i can handle this there will be a longer post on him cuz all some of u know is that hes moving and he lied! LOSER! anywho... dinner tonight was sick i hate oinion rings!!! they taste nasty as hell and my dad knows that S.O.B yeah hate him but yea i guess as many can tell im running out of things to say and my hands hurt and im going to try to sleep and get my mind off all this shit! so for now keep the chesse going FRCKIN RADDDDD

      Good Morning? its just about 5:30am and yea im really up..scary huh? back to this good morning thing how can someone say good morning you dont know how someones morning is going and you think just because u say good morning everything is gonna be ok NO! it wont for all u know someone they loved could of died or their cat could of got hit by a truck. Its always better and safer to say Morning...they can get to say if its good or not...so many of u are wondering what the HELL am i doing up @ 5:30am let me tell you its been anything but a "good morning" One of my friends is moving today. so did i sleep at all last night no...gawd this really sucks im not good with byes i always cry and i dont want him too see me cry...Marty(aka dad) has asked me to come up and get coffe with him i think at this stage no dad would know what to say to his teenage daughter about one of her friends(a guy) moving. At least hes trying but he said somthing this morning he said "if u want salisa would take you over there" nice offer huh? yea cause i really want the ONE person i REALLY hate to take me to say good-bye to someone i really love ya thats sounds like a plan...does he think im stupid no matter what she does im never gonna like her....its just NOT gonna happen. so i think for a while im gonna be in a pretty shitty mood who knows. Its not like me and him wont see each other again things will just be different VERY different. i jus notice im not sure if my clock thing is right maybe it is *memo to slef check clock thing* Good-bye Funny word huh? just like good morning whats sooo good about saying good-bye...why do we have to put good in front of every fuckin thing we say.Bye sounds much better theres nothing good about saying good bye to a friend to a loved one or to someone who dies...i guess people could say good-bye because they may never see that person again but is that a good thing...maybe some people think it is...so i feel pretty pathic just sittin here complaing about our english system but u have to understand im doing everything i can for just two mins not to think about him...guess it really didnt work...i think im going to finish my coffe and watch whatevers on TV then wait for 10:00 to come for now bye

      so here i am once again waiting to bore you with what i have to say...i guess nothing i mean really ive done nothing with my whole weekend i feel like whats left of my summer is MELTING AWAY!!! somebody save me...somebody anyone wanna go on a road trip(that is if u can drive) i mean i need to do something fun and exciting before my summer ends...yea some would say sneakin out and runnin from cops and tp ppls house and all that shit is fun and i guess it was but i want something a lil more fun is that too much to ask? yeah i guess it is soo im just gonna sit here and watch my summer fall away because next summer wont be fun most of my friends are gonna have jobs i mean we are gonna have to pay for cars and gas and there wont be time for any fun so im saying to anyone whos younger than 15 and reads this enjoy being able to do what u want because it wont last very long. so pretty much thats really all i have to say well i mean sure theres more i want to say but is now the right time to say it? i dunno maybe that will have to wait until next week or even tomoorow or whenever i feel like i should write...btw jus so everyone knows and we are all clear on this my dad DID/IS gettin married to his lil hoe salisa so nowe that everyone knows this wont be a shocker when i say my dad got married...why did he i dunno but u think he's jus enjoy his life but no he hates his kids and doesnt give a damn well what can u do...so i guess heres a quote  "life moves pretty fast if u dont stop and look around once in a while u might miss it"- Ferris Bullers Day Off   so whenever ur running around take a min and stop and see whats around u...yeah that sounded REALLY gay but hey i guess i mean it...i dunno thats it for tonight

      sooo as im sittin here thinkin what do i want to bore u ppl with again i couldn't think of anything...i mean sure theres alot i could jus ramble on about but whats the point in that...im not too sure yet...all i know is this summer has been very different then anyone ive ever had...from my friends to my boyfriends right down to my dad gettin married...so now since the summer is coming close to the end the question is did i have a good summer? is it a summer i can go back to school and tell all my friends about? or is it one of those summers that jus seemed like a big dream and u wonder if anything that happend really did? i dunno but i do know that my summer was a once in a lifetime...but then again since ive moved up here all my summers have been weird where when i was little everything was soo easy i just played outside with my older sister and i didnt mind gettin dirty...but now i dont want to be outside unless its to tann and im worried how i look even if i jus stay in the house all day call me crazy but dont i sound like the average teenage girl? yea i do....but i guess average isnt all that bad...so maybe ur wonderin what i did with my summer or maybe ur hoping that this will end soon but u knoe there is a X button u can press and u never have to look at this again...so back to what i was sayin what did i do with my summer i think most of the time i jus slept till 2:00pm then jus walked around until i found somthing to do the 1st half of the summer was spent EVERYDAY at the pool....so i mean isnt that what summers for jus being with ur friends and realxing because u have to head back to that hell hole they call shcool...but theres alot i cant say on here about my summer but theres alot that i wonder is it really happing? like my friend moving to TN. i dont want to belive it...but i guess its true i mean hes been really cool and im gonna miss him but who knoes....and as for my dad gettin married i pretty much the same why i did the last time i wrote about it...i still think shes the BIGGEST hoe ive ever met but my dads dumb and doesnt care...his fault not mine...(coughcoughLOSERcoughcough)...i might be going to a movie tomorrow jus depends i dunno why i said that....but anyways....                                                     Sip a drink of the alcohol                                              End up kneeling in bathroom stalls                                            Eyes are red and my movement's slow                                                     Too high, got vertigo -  BLink 182 'reckless abandon'  so that my friends is where i leave u once again.....

      i belive that everything happens for a reason...does it? is everything planned the way its going to end up...i mean when ppl die was it jus their time..and when ppl break up and then they get back together is it jus to show that they were meant to be...the way i see it u have two ways u can turn in life right or left...but depends on the things around u at that point in time what way u should turn...i guess when u think about if life was sopuosed to be easy ppl wouldnt fight and ppl wouldnt kill...so here i am at a point were i need to make a choice should i leave my past in the past and go on to find something good out there for me or should i stick around and see what comes to happen...i guess u can say seeing my ex boyfriend the other day made me think...do i still care about him as much as i did...or can i say that ive looked at everything that has happend between me and him and its not worth my time...everyone said we would be together for a long time but not eveyone knew everything about us...sooo i guess im just gonna wait...u knoe what sucks having ur heart broken over and over again and being used over and over again but because u care about the person soo much it doesnt matter to u that they never cared u still want them to hold u in their arms and say what they knoe u want to hear but knoein that one day ur gonna wake up and realize whats going on hurts more then a 1,000 knifves stabbin into you and jus want the pain to go away but it never will because they took a peice of ur heart and they cant jus turn around and say do u want it back because u wont jus be able to take it back and smile and say thanks soo u sit alone wth your pain wonderin whats gonna happen next...                       We said we'd take little time
