Then i wernt to the palce of dwelling and my parents treated me like some kind of junkie.  I hate that. Then Kevin came over. I am Bored. I think that is all i am to write.

      As you all can tell i have been absent for my blogging for a couple of days. This is due to the crappiness of computers. My computer decided to be a bung hole and die on me. It is now re-built and i am back to blogging so, Enjoy.

      Woohoo for shitty Blog titles. Jk, I am on my brothers user and this popped up so i put it as my title. Today was ok. I am really sore from marching band.  what sucks is that i have another god damned week of it.  I am sad though that sarah is not happy anymore. It seems like nothing i do can be or ever will be good enough for her. It is like i am incapable of pleasing Sarah. I am sorry sarah.

      Well, yesterday i went to ozzfest. I am really really sunburnt. Like it hurts to think right now. So, i am not going to type too much more. In my opinion Black Sabbath was the only good band that played. I also Got thrown into the mosh pits, They smell like fucking nasty it was gross as shit. But over all it was pretty good.
