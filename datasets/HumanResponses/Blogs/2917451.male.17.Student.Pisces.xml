      after watching e ex-sec4s got their results, something overwhelming struck me.   how do we maintain a trance where we can be enslaved by revision, studies and homeworks, and yet not turn into lunatics or even e slightest breakdown somewhere in e process. how can we be sure that we`ll do well in e future because we work too hard, and ended up getting a big-time fucking result. do we see that coming? or even, are we supposed to cry our hearts out in devastation? how can all these pressure even keep me safe and sane after i`ve been through it all. well its easy if everything goes smooth. you know your responsibilities, you work hard, you learn smartly, and you jolly well get straight As. but some dont. some work just as hard, sweat as much blood and tears along the way, and they are beaten flat despite it all. how are they supposed to react?   i`ve got a mindset solution to prevent ourselves from going bonkers if we ever fall.   maybe we should stop treating marks and grades with importance. maybe we should stop caring whether others will be affected at all by our results. maybe, i dont know how , we should start treating studies as a form of relaxation, something we enjoy, and something we wont be bothered or pushed off by teachers, parents or grades. to do consistently well, we should take those damn papers as just another buggin` friend that we cannot lose, partially an obligation, partially fun. not a burden, not a thing to ignore. because we regret things that we dont do in the past. and we shouldn`t let studies be one of it.

       your legs start shivering, you cant stand straight, u want to run away, u`re nervous to death! these are some basic instincts one shows when he/she`s needed to perform on stage, compete in a race or even for a simple presentation in front of a few close classmates. why do we bother so much, its just something we need to do right? just like the million other tasks we execute everyday, no?   difference does not lie with the importance of the performance, or how we`ll perform, or how others will snigger, or how hard you fall and how much you screw up. all e panic-button pushing fuss are all created by none other than YOU. yes YOU!! nobody else psyced you or whatsoever, but you did. if you end up screwing up a dance step or slip a tongue, well, its your fault.  its not your fault because u`re not gd enuff, or bcoz u suck, or bcoz others pressure you.   but its your fault for e fact that you stubbornly chose to visualise those negative moments in your head, and so, as you "want" it, you screwed up. it happened. there`s a saying "when you think that you can or cannot, most times you`re right." dis is so true!   in order to do well, you`ve got to totally stop thinking on how it will turn out, how people will see or judge u in e future if you do badly, or even e fact that people are paying attention to every twitch you make. YOU`VE GOT TO STOP CARING!! instead, what you`ve got to do is to look forward to a great result, to all the congrats you`ll receive from others and to all the smiles you will bring to others because you did it. not because you  did very well , but just because you     did it .    you`ve just got to go out there and enjoy what you enjoy doing, do it, and leaves with a victorious smile.   that is all that matters. its that simple.

      it was the perfect weather for a run. the wind was subtle, crowds were moving in, and i was in a trance for perfection. nothing else mattered down there. it was a little cold thoguh, with e amount of clothing i have on. (gd thing got hair)   but then something went wrong. number tags!! where e F*** was number tag? i didnt even realise that every finalist needs a number tag. adrenaline almost had the best of me, but i managed to calm myself down a bit. rushing here and there, asking everyone, trying to figure out how e hell i was supposed to get my number tag. man, it worn me down a bit. or should i say, it was the perfect warm up exercise.   managed to find nirav after a while. got my number tag already, which is good. but f***!!! aiyoyo!!! i need safety pins!!! luckily some da sao got extra, shared `em with me n marcus. den athletes` march n all, with pledge(which was crap)...and then it was the moment of truth.   our race was last in line, so we waited for the other 3 races to be over. someone fell down( which has been a classic hilarious moment), den ismail told us to come over tot he starting line. it was perfect. just like how i imagined and visualised it to be. thinking about it, i was visualising this moment so much that everything felt just like deja-vu, and it was making me sick of boredom. i cant wait for it to be over, the burning ache is killing me.  the voice of the emcee, the wild crowd, the introduction of every runner, ismail with the gun, the subtle wind tickling by. the hot burning rubber track, the tight double-tied spikes, the sweat flowing slowly down, the other runners on the other tracks.man, it felt like forever. i hugged marcus good luck...and the continued with our focus.  and i imagined all these happening 2 days early.  "ke garisan...sedia...BANG!!!!!!!!!!!" it was the best start i`ve ever been. i kept pushing and pushing, and it felt all along so smooth. i never did bother to check right or left. it was my own race. swing swing swing swing, i kept swaying right and left for that maximum speed. then i began to get furious, i was hot i was on fire, i was burning so much to win!!!   never mind if bijendra is already so far ahead, its all under plan, i told myself. keep cool, keep pushing ahead baby!!! swing swing swing swing, i can feel my jaws tightened and my legs numb, it was as if it was the marathon race...i was exhausted.  then, zoom! i reached the finishing line!!!curious, i looked right to see marcus already running right beside me!!! "aaarrrhhhh!!!! brother!!!! waaahoooo!!!" i could not believe it, it was the perfect finish, i was second, followed by marcus 3rd.   to hell with the rest of the world! i was screaming at him!!! and he was screaming at me!!! "suuuuuu!!!!" aaarrrhhhh!! we might not have realised, but after that ppl were calling me crazy and all, jumping like nobody`s business on the track!!! but hey! look who got the trophies, dude!!! we got it!!!! we fatsos got it!!!( ok, i`m e only fat 1...)   man, tiring but, a moment hard to forget. never had i such exhiliration n ecstacy...

      - memories are second chances in life for happiness.  - being evil is the ugliest a peson can get.  - life is a bitch as much as you are.        it will only get better once you bitch less about it.  - more important tha making the right choices, is how you deal with your choice, be it right or wrong.  - only the good feels guilty.  - pain is inevitable. suffering is optional.  - only those with low self-esteem, insecurities and those who feels inferior to the society survive by gossipping, taunting and putting others down.  - the impossible is unattainable only when one starts to doubt the possibilities of chances.

      my mom didnt tell me  was flatfooted (and i am) so i ran anyway. and hey, i didnt suck at it. my dad didnt tell me i was retarded (of cuz i`m not) so i tried my best in exams anyway. and wow, i did pretty well.  the truth is, my friend, what you and the rest of the world say does not affect me. be it you mean it or not, be it for my welfare or not. tell me that i cant, and i`ll buy your words. tell me that i shouldnt, and i`ll have my doubts.  for my sake, gimme ur support and encouragement,  and believe in me doing what you believe i cant. for my sake, motivate me, tell me to go further, and i`ll go ahead to prove ur doubts wrong.  the truth is, my friend, nobody appreciates you telling him or her what he or she cant so have trust in the determination against the impossible,  and be part of one`s success.  and so tell me that i can.
