      "I like to keep my mind limber by a strict regiment of drugs" he said.  "I just don't understand why you just dont quit".  One thing I've learned in my experiences with drug people and drug culture we cant be convinced or tricked even its a realization we come to alone or not at all.  I'll go to rehab but when i get out it'll still be there.  Unless i wanted to go there its not going to do anything for me.  "i just cant handle the fact of thinking that someone else is somehow controlling any part of my life in any way" "you cant even do it for me" "no darling im sorry i cant let someone else reign over my destiny" I have always had a problem with controling people and as a consequence i have had quite a problem with authority figures in my life.  Held up and oppressed by their fascist rules.  My step-father the worst offender.  It turned my life into a vicious cycle of being turned out on doorsteps.  I would think oh itll be better at this place and find myself not even being able to handle the most miniscule of rules.  Then it would start all over again with me testing the waters at my newest place.  I finally realized i needed a solution to this problem when i lived with my uncle for around six months funny finding clarity where the murky water originated.  His parting words of wisdom dont turn your mind into shit.  I spent my first week in an orgy of marijuana mixed with any other drug i could possibly find.  Then i decided it was time for my solution get my own place and live life by my terms.  I went to the medicine cabinet and popped four aderall its an attention defecit disorder medicine when taken in bigger doses it gives a rush like speed.  No where near as pure and long lasting but still enough to clarify my mind.  Now that my mind was clear and not bogged down from its usual concotion of alcohol and marijuana i decided now was the best time to put in job applications.  I went down to a local pizza place sort of like chucky cheese.  I walked in smoothly and unhindered my limbs so full of life they felt like they were floating.  I walked to the register along the left side wall and asked nicely for an application, yes total control i had total control over everything in this situation.  I knew exactly everything i was doing, filling it out was a breeze and later i went over to the taco bell better chances with multiple applications.  Taco bell was more of a last resort i had worked there before and bitterly hated it at that.  Survival was more important than my pride.           work in progress...

      no site is complete without qoutes  i believe in a prolonged duration of the sense - jim morrison  to tell the truth i dont ever remember being born it must have happened during one of my blackouts - jim morrison  if the doors of perception were cleansed everthing would appear to mas as it is infinite - william blake  who is the happier man? he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed safely on the shore and merely existed - hunter s thompson  the possibility of physical and mental collapse is now very real no sympathy for the devil buy the ticket, take the ride - hunter s thompson  we could do that, but it would be wrong - richard m nixon  the best laid schemes of mice and men go aft astray and leave us naught but grief and pain for promised joy - robert burns  the more experience and insight i obtain into human nature the more convinced do i become  that the greater portion of man is purely animal - henry morton stanley  man given free will questions trys to better himself animal accepts which of us is truly free  man in the constant battle for perfection or the animal who simply reacts man is always trying to be the best, and failing the key isnt winning or losing its making the attempt the man is what i ought to be sure its scary but whats the alternative stagnation a safer more terrible form of death not of the body but of the spirit an animal knows what it is and accepts a man may know what he is but he questions he dreams he strives changes grows - chris claremont

      some things i wrote when i was tripping  the clock on the wall is frozen boredom knaws at my mind an uneasy truce quivers the silence to be broken  explosions and laughter all around yet i cant put the past away take the alcohol lure your mind to forget leave it behind better off without it  is home the place where you spend your time live sleep and eat or the place where your soul is at ease comfortable in your chair  or in your head your turned away from home your soul is left to wander comfort is no where to be found  and the past never dies suicide crossed my mind aint worth the time scarred for life  with gone by mistakes  think therefore i am but what if i forget? if everything is taken from a man a man he remains?  and i drew alot of pictures
