                        August 22nd...     I had something that wiil be on my list of the most  memorable moment in my life... Or I can say... Moment when i feel the presence  and the plan He's been working on me...     It all start from Yesterday...      As usually I went to my church for the youth  fellowship every Saturday night at 7 p.m. That day I was told that today I'll  have to be on a meeting with all the rest of the committee in the church... I'll  have to represent the youth commitee since I'm the president. It's a regular  meeting held every three months. That time I said that I'll be on church  tomorrow which is today...     Now the story is getting nearer to the problem..       Later that night around 11 p.m. I received a sms  from a friend asking me to go to Carita beach with him the next day which is  today...     The problem is that I already promised to be on  church to follow the meeting..     That time I was faced with two options... It's  whether I keep my promise to be on the meeting or having fun with my friends  which is a rare thing.. Cause I don't spend much time going out with  him...     I must admit that time I was really fond of going to  the beach.. To be honest I never go there before.. Moreover, usually on the  meeting I only need about 15 minutes to report and the rest 2 hour will be used  on things that have nothing to do with my commitee...     So.. I start preparing the war tactics.. I called my  friend... I told him that I'll be going with him to Carita... I prepared my  report and decided to have my sister to give it indirectly to the person in  charge with the meeting...     I finally finished my report around 12 a.m.  midnight... Even I have to had this phone call from a girl I just knew... I  finished my report and I enjoyed the conversation... (Probably i'll put some  writings bout her)     And the plan worked really well... There was no  phone call or sms asking me to go to church.. But it seems that GOD has  different plan for me...     Suddenly my friend called me and said that we got  new company and this person is the sister of my other friend's girlfriend... GET  it??? Ok then.. Well the point is they can't say no to her.. And I have to give  my place... At this point I was really upset with my friend but I never want to  spend my time cryin' on my lowest mood... I always look on the brighter  side..     SEE.. This means that GOD wants me to do my duty and  wants me to be His servant.. Be at the meeting and do my president servant  job... I must admit that time something 'clicked' in my mind... I realize a  couple days ago I just made my promise to serve HIM more and do more to change  my bad attitude.. Well He placed me on the right track... See... If I still  persist to went to the beach probably my position as president will be  questioned... Even though I want to do my best to develop the youth fellowship  they will still questioned my commitment and this is not a good example for  those who's still in my committee team...      And I realize that moment I was making the report...  I really put all my thought and my concern on church.. I can't let others to do  this for me... This is my responsibility...      Well... Let's spend less time talking... ^__^ the  point is I believe GOD is preparing HIs plan for me.. and I shall follow HIs  path for I put my faith in HIM.. There's only one saviour for me, Jesus  Christ... Amen...

                    &nbsp;    Right now I'm feelin' that I want to write  something in English. I don't know why... it just feels better to write it  down  in English...     Today...     August 16th, 2004  Something happened to me and I think this  will be the one thing that will  change  my life... This is  will change the way I  look over  some things in my  life...              It just happened to me that I went to sleep at    5 a.m   this morning and woke up at 12 or  1 p.m.... I forgot... (see... i forgot the time i  woke up ..   this is the start of the whole things that i want to  write down) Have shower  and stuff ...  and my mom asked  me to go to the nearest  ATM... and I did went there... On my way back... I met my friends while i was  still riding  my Karisma... and just said 'HI' to    each other... And suddenly one of my friends called my up and I only  had a chance to say " wazz up?"    At that time I  didn't really notice that he was taking  someone with  him...   Then... I arrived.. parked my Karisma just in front of my  house... and suddenly he stopped also a couple of seconds after... And I  saw him with a girl... And here's the story begins...  I can't deny that  girl was   gorgeous   and in that couple of     miliseconds   moment I just had my eyes  on her ...      I don't usually look at girls like that... I  know.. Usually when I go out with friends and meet some pretty chicks... I  just u know  admire their beauty.. I enjoy it.... and it goes just like  that.. but this time it's different...  And you know what... I'm a kind of  person who usually get things  when I   'clicked'   with that thing... For example.. I never really  look  for clothes... I usually just walk around shopping places and  when  I find something that 'clicked' my mind ...  and at that  specific moment I know that  "this shirt is the right  one"....  and that's how I got most of my clothes..  And the same  thing goes here... As I said earlier... I never had that  'clicked' chemistry  when I look at girls until this afternoon...   DAMN..          well, the problem is I  don't know whether she's taken or not... I don't know whether she's going out  with my friend..  I think they have been seeing each other for some time...  cause if not so why do my friend bothers taking her home... and I know my  friend He's not so different from me... Still single until now... still  waitin'  for 'the one' and I think he got it......  Well, here's what I  feel right now...  The feeling of   'in  between' ...  The 'grey' side of black and white.... I surely  got that   milisecond 'click' chemistry  with that  girl... And  I am single .. can't deny that... Can't lie that I've  been longing for that someone... That will fill my days with new things...   Someone to share my love that almost overload...   Someone to care about and  care about me more than  just friend..  Right now... I just can say to myself... you know  you'll find the one when the moment comes...   I'll still look and try my  ways to find that someone..  And moreover... I don't want to wait longer to  start a relationship.. I need to make a step...  Luckily I had    great friends   that able to fill my days..  and makes me survive until now... but I think I'm on the edge right  know... I probably won't be able to hold on anymore longer....  For all  this talks... on top all... for now..    I'm all-right..  That's right..&nbsp;     I'm  CHILL...

                       SMS...or...The Old Ways       &nbsp;   Kalo ngomongin SMS kayanya banyak banget topik yang bisa diangkat. SMS itu kayanya uda jadi bagian    yang nggak terpisahkan apalagi buat gue sebagai anak muda jaman sekarang. Hal itu sejalan dengan     adanya HP juga si... kalo ga HP ya ga ada SMS... kalo ada HP ga ada fasilitas SMS juga kayanya ga sreg.    SMS sendiri adalah sebuah fenomena yang luar biasa kalo kita mau ngeliat lebih dalem lagi.      &nbsp;   Ini adalah   salah satu produk yang kalo gua bilang 'change the way people interact'. SMS itu adalah satu bentuk     komunikasi pasif artinya kita bisa mikir dulu kira-kira kata-kata gombal apa ya yang bagus. *hehehe*    Ini dia bagusnya. Kalo SMS mungkin ada yang ketik trus ampe abis tapi tau2 karakternya kebanyakan jadinya     dia balik lagi ke ujung atas SMS-nya trus disingkat-singkat deh yang mana aja yang bisa disingkat.    Satu lagi hal yang fenomenal yaitu gimana kita bisa nyampein 'our feeling' pada saat itu lewat 'smiley'     kaya gini ;P misalnya.     &nbsp;   Meskipun demikian SMS tetap mengalami keterbatasan dalam mengungkapkan perasaan.    Satu 'research' yang dibikin ama orang-orang 'kurang kerjaan' di bidang telekomunikasi      mendapatkan bahwa lebih dari 40% pasangan mengaku pernah bertengkar lewat SMS ato gara-gara SMS, tapi di lain     sisi sekitar 41% dari responden mengaku setelah memiliki HP, mereka lebih mudah mengungkapkan     perasaan cinta mereka lewat sms. Selain itu satu jajak pendapat lagi yang dibikin sama pelanggannya    di Asia Tenggara mendapat hasil yang lebih mengejutkan lagi ato bisa dibilang rada 'gila'. Gua jadi     mikir 'what's wrong with human ?'. Anyway, hasilnya itu 40% dari responden jantungnya berdegup lebih     kencang waktu tau ada SMS ato terima SMS. Dan lucunya lagi, 79% dari responden mengecek HP-nya meskipun     yang terima SMS waktu itu orang lain... Funny isn't it?      &nbsp;   Tapi hal ini juga berarti manusia bisa mengalami kemunduran dalam hal komunikasi aktif dua arah yang bagus    dalam artian kita kehilangan 'sense of spontanity'. Spontanitas kita dalam berkomunikasi dengan orang tu    bisa jadi terganggu apalagi kalo apa-apa kita lewat SMS mulu. Bilang 'good night' lewat SMS,     bilang 'i love u' lewat sms, bilang 'aku sayang kamu' and macem-macem lagi. Kalo gini justru nanti     giliran uda ketemu face to face malah kagok bilang 'aku sayang kamu'. Hal seperti ini bisa-bisa aja terjadi...     &nbsp;   Well, the point is  "even though we got lot of ease of saying       things through SMS or MMS.. whatever you called it.. don't forget the old ways of expressing your       feelings to people surround you, people you love, and people you care about."
