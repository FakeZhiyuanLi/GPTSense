      	Recently, the American people have been "shocked" and "appalled" including, of course, the President.  Why?  The Iraqi Prison Abuse photos.  "How could the military DO such a thing?  How could they LOWER themselves to that?  And then take PICTURES OF IT?  They are no better then the terrorists!"  	Just remember, the military represents you.  	These aren't new tactics, and if anyone believes that the Geneva Convention is being followed to the letter by anyone, then I would like to ask them to pull where ever it is that they have their head, and take a look at reality.  If you think we get information from our prisoners by asking them the same question three times and waiting for them to give in, then you're on more drugs then Rush.  And now, as a result of these pictures an American gets beheaded.  Who's fault is it?  You know we have to place the blame somewhere.  America is always looking to point the finger.  So, where does it end up?  Do we blame the beheading on the soldiers who abused the prisoners?  The leaders of them for giving the orders?  Rumsfeld for knowing about it, and not doing anything right away?  Do we blame the President (whom I believe was told by Rumsfeld awhile ago) for not doing anything either?  Or how about we blame Bush for not apologizing for the conduct of his soldiers?  I know, we can blame Grand Theft Auto, because you know the terrorists had a copy of that game before they even thought of cutting that man's head off.  I have an even better idea that's pretty radical, and I want you to follow along, if only for a second.  How about we blame the terrorists that wielded the knife?  The people that read the statement, before pulling out one of the dullest knives I've ever seen, and actually doing the deed?  Is that too radical?  No, we must blame someone else.   	The lack of personal responsibility in this country is bleeding over into our foreign affairs.  It's a scary thought.  Terrorists attack us, and it's our fault.  Terrorists decapitate an American, and it's our fault.  Don't believe me?  How many people out there want to blame Bush for 9/11?  How many want to blame Clinton?  Plenty.  Yes, it was the job of our National Security personnel to prevent it.  Clarke apologized for it, though no one else did.  I'm still apt to put blame on the people who flew the planes, and the people who told them to do it.  That's just me though.  What do I know?  After all, I'm only in my twenties.    	Point the finger, blame someone else.  I'm overweight, but it's not my fault.  I eat unhealthy food, but I blame the food companies or fast food chains because I have no will power, and I'll be damned if I take responsibility for my decisions!  I blame the tobacco companies.  They told me smoking wasn't bad for me.  Sure, there was a warning, but you're assuming I can read!  I'll tell you this right now.  If you thought inhaling smoke into your lungs on a constant daily basis wasn't unhealthy, then you deserve cancer.  Natural selection, get the dumb ones out of the gene pool.  And I'm saying this as a current smoker.  Someone gets shot, who's the blame?  I know, you're probably thinking the person that shot them.  NOPE!  We blame the people that made the gun.  Why stop there?  Let's blame the people that designed that gun, the people who made the bullets, the people who mined for the metal the gun was made out of.  Because we all know, if that miner wasn't out there, they couldn't have made the gun to begin with.  That's where the problem is, it's the existence of guns.  Not the existence of the twisted violent people who wield them.  A trigger doesn't pull itself people.    	A local woman is suing a beer company because her underage son drank their alcohol, borrowed the car of his girlfriend's mom, and died in a car accident.  See, it's the beer company's fault that they produced the alcohol that her son illegally ingested.  Forget the fact that her son broke the law several times that night, laws that are put in place to protect him and other people...  that's irrelevant.  That's not enough either, she's also suing the OWNER OF THE CAR.  That's right.  Had the young lady's mom not lent her vehicle to her daughter to later lend to the plaintiffâ€™s son...  THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT!  That's right!  The car owner's fault for...  buying the car I suppose.  But why did she stop?  Sue the makers of the car.  Sue the city for putting that pole on the side of the rode that her illegally driving illegally drunk son ran into to.  Lady, you need to wake up and face it.  Your son is dead because he wasn't acting responsibly.  He drank while underage, then drove while drunk.  He endangered other people's lives with no concern whatsoever.  I'm glad that pole stopped him before another moving vehicle did.  His fault.  In fact, I think the city should sue you allowing your son to go to a party which had underage drinking which resulted in damage to their pole.    	Everyone take a look at what's happened to you throughout your life, and chances are, you are where you are because of you.  The decisions you make, and the actions you take...  that got you where you are.  Want to blame someone?  Blame yourself....  It's all you man, it's all you.

      In light of the Iraqi Abuse Prison scandal, and the beheading of the American civilian in retaliation for said act...  I feel the need to address a trend among this nation concerning these specific acts.  I see and hear this everywhere.  The news, the newspaper, magazines, and I don't even go out of my way to read or watch these things.  I remember hearing this on the news.  "Every American should be ashamed for what we did in that prison."  Excuse me there Chachi, but I wasn't over there.  I didn't do shit in that prison, and I'll be damned if I'm going to feel ashamed for something someone else did.  Screw that shit.  I'm getting tired of that.  Political cartoons showing Americans with bags on their heads.  Fuck you.  I'm not ashamed.  Hell, I'm a member of the armed forces, and I'm still not ashamed.  The country likes to do this.  They like to force their emotions on you.  Or force you to feel emotions so that you won't be a problem.  The democrats are spearheading (no pun intended) this one.  They want America to feel ashamed.  Why?  That emotion, that feeling will bleed over into everything else.  Democrats don't care if you're ashamed of the government as a whole, because as long as there's a negative stigma towards government, then the people will want to change it, and that's where the Democrats are happy.  What's sad is that it had to take abuse photos and a decapitated American to show this country that our leadership sucks and Bush is a horrible President.  Now normally I would be happy that it would be ANYTHING that could get that buffoon out of office, but I'm troubled about how the majority of this country is lead and decided on the majority that is occupied by idiots, morons, and ignoramus.  This is a sad sad day for me.  I realized that the majority of our country is stupid.  That's alright though, because if things keep going the way they're going, then we should be with newer leadship at the beginning of next year.  Unless we "find" Usama Bin Laden RIGHT before the election.  I wouldn't be surprised if they had aces up their sleeves.  In fact, I would be disappointed if they didn't.  This administration stole and election, and I'm sure aren't going to go down without a fight.  Also, people want Rumsfield's head on a plate.  After this.  Just this.  Forget all the other things he's been wrong about, forget all the other mistakes that he's made.  We see pictures, we want him gone.  If someone with Rumsfield's track record worked in my old place of employment, he would have been fired day 2...  3 at the latest.  This is completely asinine.    Now I hear of people speculating that the problem was the fact that it was Army Reservists instead of "active duty" and so they lacked leadership and discipline.  My official response to those people are, Fuck you.  A troop is a troop.  A soldier is a soldier.  They receive the same training as you do.  Basic, school, and CTT training.  Most units makes the most out of the one weekend a month and two weeks a year.  This level of ignorance frustrates me to no end.  Fuck those people.  Fuck them in their tight assholes.    Speaking of troops.  Just so you know, I am a troop.  I wear the uniform, and I wear it everyday.  Not a day goes by that I don't see a jag-off with a bumper sticker that says, "Support Your Troops".  Yay!  Words!  I love when people say, "I support you."  Because that helps with the flak jackets and bullets.  That helps pay the bills, and it certainly helps keep me alive whilst in a war zone.  No thanks, your "support" only makes me want to reside in a bomb shelter.  You want to support your troops?  Buy me dinner.  Make my car payment.  If you aren't going to help, take the sticker off your goddamned fuel-sucking SUV (Cause everyone needs a multi-terrain vehicle to take Billy to soccer practice) and shut the fuck up.

      Welcome to The Bomb Shelter.  This is my first post, my first of many.  There have been so many things going on in my mind that I just felt the need to share them.  It's driving me insane.  The complete and total idiocy of this nation as a whole amazes me, and I'm sure makes others wonder just how the hell we became the most powerful nation in the world.  I'm surprised, and frankly wondering when it will end.  Let me clarify that I love this country.  I love everything about it.  The freedoms, the Constitution, everything.  Sadly, the people in the system, and the people in our society (the majority anyway) make me want to punch random people on the street, because chances are they are one of the ignorant annoying bastards that drive me nuts.  More often then not, I run into these people and want to unleash a form of violence so extreme that it will be praised by others like me as an advancement and cleansing of our gene pool.  That should give you a good idea as to what I exactly plan on putting here on this blog.  Everyone else is doing it, why not me?  That's what I say.  I have written many things over the span of a year or so, so understand the random postings that I make.  They were not written at the time of the posting, but I assure you my outlook and thought process on whatever subject it is hasn't changed.  Enjoy.
