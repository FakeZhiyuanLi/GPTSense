      Yesterday about 20:00 o'clock I went to Iduna, cause there were playing some hardcore bands, including For the glory (A portugese HC-band). For the glory came with us; (Miranda, Jelte, Kelvin and me) to Miranda's house (They were going to crash the night there). It was waaay cool! and I had a great time, although sometimes I couldn't understand a word from that Portugese language, I had fun! :)  Today at three o'clock they went to Germany for another show, too bad :( I had 26 kisses from 8 portugese For the glory band members! Haha. Yaaay, I'm not so tired anymore.. Tonight, that will be round 8 o'clock I'm again going to Miranda's place, to watch a movie :) Well, that's all I needed you guys to know.  Byeee

      Parents.. buh, Sometimes I just want to strangle them with my own two hands. But still, they are my parents, so I love them and blah blah bla. But by mom is so damn stubborn about stupid things.. She treats me like I'm an five year old.. And I hate it.   And Woohoo, I finally got me some work! starting tomorrow.. It doesn't earn much (2,47 in an hour) but I'm glad that I can do something in the afternoon and earn money for it! :)  By the way: Hello :)

      My neighbour died sunday.. that's like a big shock for me.. cause I've not even get over the death of Jink yet.. I was really confused and didn't know what to do.. My parents said I needed to talk more but I just can't, it's too hard for me.. My dad asked me if I wanted to come with them to see her one more time.. but I can't and won't.. I just can't believe that someone with that age has to pass away. I'ts not fair, it really isn't. Damn it. Jelte cheared me up that night, he was all conserend about me.. Really sweet :). The funeral is friday, in the same room where the funeral for Jink was, I think that's going to bring up all of the memory's.. Hmf. I really can't let this go :( but I have to, even if it's too hard.   I'll have to miss Jelte today, cause I have to stay at home.. That's what my parents said.. And oh yeah, I got fired last thursday.. buh. stupid people and stuff.  Byee
