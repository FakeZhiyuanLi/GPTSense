        So, our dear Jessika will be leaving Austin and I in Concord, to march Magic of Orlando with the most perfect boy out there (for her). I've had to come to this realization, and now have found a magnificent way for us all to stay "in touch" with each other over the season:      Chels: i just figured out why its ok for you to march Magic Jess: ?? Chels: because Chels: PURPLE is BLUE mixed with RED(for Renegades, who we will march when we're wrinkly) Jess: lol Jess: and magic has red in their uniform.. and black pants, like BD Chels: and we have a purple stripe across our chests Jess: like BDB even Jess: yep, there we go Chels: and and and Chels: i wear a red sports bra Jess: lol yep Jess: i'll buy one for this season, just to tie everything together Jess: or better yet, i'll buy a blue one lol Chels: yay! Jess: haha Chels: now what about austin? Jess: hmmm Jess: uhh Chels: i think i know what his christmas gift will be Jess: ?? Chels: red boxers. Jess: hahaha Jess: and purple ones Jess: well... Chels: no, cuz we've got the stripe, lol Jess: that might be too much Chels: dont wanna put him in that position Chels: i need red panties now Jess: lol yeah Jess: hahaha Chels: lol Jess: and we all have to swear to wear them on the same days Chels: which will be EVERY show Chels: it will be a tradition Jess: hahahaha well that could get kinda gross Chels: we must buy in bulk then Jess: lol yeah Jess: okay we're making this vow, we will wear red undergarments for every show Jess: are you sure you dont want to pick another random color? Jess: i've got red, you guys dont Chels: no Chels: red Chles: well Jess: you could wear red, i'll wear blue Chels: you blue Jess: yeah Chels: yay Jess: okay Jess: but if we're ever at shows together we have to wear the same thing Chels: eh? *cocks head to side like puppy* Jess: ohh ohh we could MAKE special undies Jess: well if we're at shows together we have to wear the same color, but when we're apart we wear different colors Chels: ok Chels: black then Jess: okay Chels: easy Chels: and wont show if we rip our pants like marco Jess: lol!    ...and now presenting....the undergarments of the 2004 BDB Bloggers!

      It is 21 days, 11 hours, 59 minutes and 34 seconds until January 11, 2004, at Noon  No one's posted on here for a while, I thought I'd take the liberty...  The start of B corps is coming up soon, I can't wait to see the gang again. We've all been going through drum corps withdrawals, and I think the short four hours will be just what we need. And it looks like bunches of new people will be there, I can't wait to see what the turnout will be like... 2004 is a big year for BDB!  Not much to say, but that Austin, Chels and I will be unified in our marching days, no matter what color uniform we're wearing, by corresponding our underwear =D I love you guys!  DCI party coming up soon, probably next weekend, IM me for info!

      So I put up info about B Corps camps and auditions on the band room wall today. Pat came into 4th period also, and he got all hyped with me. We were jumping up and down joyfully, and then realized we needed to practice badly...  He's a percussionist, turned brass geek. Well...contra...sooooo he needs some help. Lol. Dun ditta dun! Chels to the rescue!  Sadia is getting super excited too. She loves me, and is my gurl, has been since she was a wee freshman. We have a wonderful relationship, sharing tuna salad or fruit snacks or potstickers in Jazz Band, hiding behind our stands from the sub. She idolizes me, (trying not to brag, honestly), she's told me she does. And that's totally awesome, cuz I'm trying to create a positive female brass player influence for my girls. And for the boys too, so they can see that males aren't the only ones proficient in the brasswinds.   I'm working on building up my trumpet section before I leave, something the juniors and seniors before me never did. So, bringing Sadia along this year, maybe Tyler and Vanessa the next... Vintage has a plethora of talent that just needs to be weeded out, nutured, and kept in partial sun-light...heehee...ok, it's corps... Full Sun-light.   So yeah. Posted info about the percussion camp, and it was respectively left alone. Once I get my DVD's, we'll have a DCI party and get even more hyped.  Woop!   (pardon, I just had a soda... probably should cut back and start taking Gatorade intravenously)

      Whoops sorry Chels about stealing your sunshine on the countdown thing, I don't really pay attention to much of anything I guess. And I was so wrapped up in our recent DCP fun.  Do y'all like the new colors?

      *Sigh* I can't go to the fundraising meeting either, I'll be in stupid Florida =/  And by the way...  It is 3 days, 13 hours, 37 minutes and 57 seconds until December 11, 2003, at 7:20:00 PM  Hahaha thought I'd throw that in there...  I'm getting really really really psyched with all this talk of the start of the new BDB season, I miss everyone like crazy! Wow, I can't believe that I'll be with my family again, but it's kinda sad to think of all the changes that are happening...  I, along with Chels and Austin, am a new returning vet, so I have no idea how it feels to come back to half familiar faces and the other half are fresh ones. Actually, if Meehan keeps his word, it will be more like 70% new kids! Hmm, it's almost like being a rookie all over again. Actually, it's not, at all, so I don't know why I just said that...  It's kinda weird thinking about how empty the season's going to feel compared to last year. I think it will be awesome to get in like twice as much rehearsal time by staying at Mars and not having days off for driving and leisure days after coming home, in addition to the minimal rehearsals we get while actually on tour. So that's the good part.  The bad part is not nearly as many shows. Less chances for improvement in the scores. Less chances to beat the Vanguard Cadets. Less chances for Balls of Love.  Oh well, whatever happens, I know it will be awesome, because that's just how we B corps kids do it ;D  Well, since I'm so obsessed with countdowns, here we go:  It is 34 days, 6 hours, 11 minutes and 14 seconds until January 11, 2004, at Noon (Click  urlLink here  to see it yourself)  I think we should all close with the countdown, since we're all feeling a little like Jessika lately =D

      34 days... Ugh I feel waaay too much like Jessika right now. I've gotta shake that feeling somehow, or differentiate that  I'm not flying to Florida in 34 days!!! Woo!  But there is another date to count down to, that being the fundraising meeting  (that I can't go to thanks to my Jazz concert...)  coming up next week. Lemme know how it goes, guys  (that could be a tongue twister) ! I'm going to cut this entry short now, I'll add more as the date gets closer.

       rockin to: "SuperBitch" -Authority Zero   Yeah, I like doing the "rockin to:" thing. I havent done it in a while, but hey, kinda gives a hint to my mood, I guess. Not the title of the song, lol but this is the most reggae.  YAY!! B Corps is living again! I've had the absolute best day since I last posted. Info on BDB is on the front page of  urlLink BlueDevils.org . The new page of B Corps is now  urlLink www.bluedevils.org/programs/b/ 2004  . YAY!! Oooooh. Ok. I love B Corps.   It's so hard for me to imagine that I'm now a vet. Wow.... people will look at pictures of Blue Devils B Corps and say,     "Hey, look at that hornline! They really put out with such limited numbers"   That's us guys. Wow. I'm in shock...really   rockin to: Chronometry/Chomolomety/Chrononomety- "First Circle/Full Circle" -Pat Metheny   dah dit dah. you know I can play that part perfectly now, Austin? i can play the mello part that accompanies it too...the part that goes to our high Bb.   PLEASE!!! COME MARCH BDB!!!   I think I'm going to cry. I've never been so excited about something. honestly. Last year, lol, last year, when I wrote to Charles asking to be part of his corps, I called it a band. Hah. How naive I once was.  Wow...its so weird to be thinking I'm now a vet. Not a super vet like Taryn or Daphne... but still. Oh wow. It is 35 days, 7 hours, 26 minutes and 9 seconds until January 11, 2004, at Noon.   Eek....Oh I can't wait. Austin and I are assuming they'll have our rep pretty much set, since we need to be more perfect than last year.   rockin to: Chronometry/Chomolomety/Chrononomety-  "Kinetic/Kintec" -John Meehan   Wow. I'm so in love right now. I can't stop smiling. How did I ever get through this excitement last year without Austin?

      Bwaha. thank you DCP...  I figured it wouldnt really be appropriate to mix my corps life with the sexally-charged entries of my  urlLink original blog , and so the creation of this corps blog. Entries regarding camps, tour, fees, and other member's thoughts on said topics will be posted, as we all have a crap load to say, and voila, a forum for such.   All comments welcome, and well, wanted.   First  urlLink BDB  camp on Saturday, January 10th.  (Rick Odello says the 2nd weekend in January, I did the dirty work)  Please, we're trying for a 36 member hornline, we seem to be needing to prove to our own organization that we are a legitimate corps, and should be taken as such.   We're hauling ass, recruiting and finding donations, fighting for the life of our corps (which is, YES, safe for 2004) and then Dave Gibbs sends out a letter, asking for money inwhich this line is written:    "Do not be mistaken. The Blue Devils are not in the red. We run a tight ship..."    Despite the redundant cliches, this offers a comforting message to the Blue Devil patron, assuring them that yes, we are ok. Why didnt you mention the fact that you were considering cutting B Corps entirely to keep the Blue in the red? After that of course, C corps would falter and die, seeing how there was no corps for them to feed into. Surely Mr. Gibbs knew this, and yet, the mailing proclaims everything is fine. Everything is not fine. Just so you know.  I've taken my "Save BDB" avatar off of my DCP sn, because, we're ok for now. We're safe for the 2004 season. But BD is NOT running a tight ship, not if they were so seriously considering cutting a long standing cadet corps and endangering another.   just so ya know.

      My turn.    Man. I'm addicted to this corps. Really. Everyone just seems to click in the hornline this year, the majority of us are newbies or one year vets, so the whole clique issue isn't there at all. Everyone is chill and gets along...having Sadia and Pat there is interesting, to say the least, but I mean it in the best of ways, I can't wait to tour. We're the cool kids, now. The rooks listen to the vets, and the vets get along, so everything is just bo-handy.  Nope, not sure what "bo-handy" means. But you can take it in context and assume away :)   My favorite memory from this camp? When we randomly all burst into Shotgun, a chord progression. Our favorite chord progession, actually, and it wasn't looking like we were gonna get to play as promised.   Sooo the lead sops devised a plan. As soon as Sean, the caption head was outside with an auditionee, I walked around to inform the vets of the plan, and sent Brookie into the middle of the horn arc to engage the plan.  So, small, wee Brookie stands in the middle of our massive horn arc holding her two hands out in a "bang bang" gesture, our symbol for shot gun. I hold out the B, and others join in. Brooke just tells us when to switch notes, and as we crescendo to the top of the chords, the rookies either jump in, or shut up, so the hornline as one reaches the climax of the progression, climbing the tessatura out of the cacophony of individual instrumentalists to a pure, perfect harmony. As we released, Sean opened the door, and stood silhouetted in the doorframe as the gym held the echo for a good 10, 15 seconds.   We giggled. Sean told us never to do that again. :D  Sorry I wrote the description so corny and poetic...thats just how it hit me. We all laughed, and promised we'd never put the fate of the hornline in Brookie's hands again....but fuck we sounded good. I think I took it up to the D...can't remember...prolly did, but...wow.  Look out East...Blue Devils has a B corps.

      Woohoo. Lots of bubbly optimism in the last post, made it sound almost like a dream! Not that my take on last Sunday is scary.  Since a narrative has been done, random thoughts will proceed: -Seeing old faces was a lot of fun. Except for one. Cough. -I was surprised at the numbers of the hornline, namely the, umm, proportions. But seeing as how there was a sudden influx of C corps members, it is understandable. Perhaps a few kiddies will switch to smell-o-phone? -I haven't yet formed an opinion on this year's show music. I anticipate that, like last year, our ballad will be changed.... three times (?). I'm not thrilled with Chase the Clouds Away, and a former BD marcher predicted bad fortune would come of the B corps if it's not changed. I have yet to look at our opener closely.  -Reuniting with my old horn was very bittersweet. After getting more than my share of love from it, I think I'm ready to move on to a case that does not have bus tire marks. Although I did like the fact that my case matched the baris and mellos except for the minor size part.  -While I am confident that a lead position will be filled by yours truly, I was rather surprised at the lack of above-the-staff notes. Once again I hope that music might be changed (or at least that things will be different in the closer).  -I love the idea of going to Oklahoma, not only because tour will be longer but because of preliminaries and more competition and all the benefits of travel. -These DVDs do sound like a must-have. I'll get those within the next week or two.   Okay Chelsea, your turn!

      Hey there Pat. It wasn't until after I had already left that I realized I didn't get a chance to meet you in person. Were you the one who took pictures of us with our horns? I'm sorry, I must have seemed terribly rude. I wont be there next weekend, but we will meet one day =) And as for contra or baritone, whichever you have a bigger sound on. All of us vets know that we need a bigger sound,  especially  on the bottom! And it would be awesome to have a full bari line! (Anyone know the status of Sarah Rudolph?)  The first meeting of the 2004 Blue Devils B was quite a success. Here's my side of the tale:  Me being my usual self was running a little late =/ I get in the car and random memories start floating back to me. I ramble on and on to my mom random facts and memories and other pointless things like that... well, not entirely pointless, because I was smiling the whole way =)  The hugeness of what was happening didn't hit me until we got off the freeway and look over to my right, and see not one but TWO Blue Devils trucks. I squeal for joy as we drive around the school's parking lot.  "Why is it so crowded?" I think to myself. "Are all of these people here for B corps?"  We leave the parking lot and start drving down the street in front of the school, still looking for a place to park, and I look inside the main entrance to the school, only to see a huge mass of people in the hallway. I see the silhouette of Charles, and at this point, I can no longer wait to find the stupid parking spot.  I walk up to the school and into the hallway, and the first face I see, is the one I had probably missed the most. I ran up and gave Shawn a huge hug, I felt reunited with my summer dad. By now the hallway is empty and I can hear a voice on a speaker coming from the gym. I walk up to a table, start signing my name, and then I hear the theme song to "Catch Me if you Can"  That only means one thing, they're watching our show in there! This is all real, it's actually happening. I walk into the gym and it's full to the brim. There are tons of tables pulled out, all of which are completely packed, and there aisles down the sides are filled too. Again, I'm thinking, "Are all of these people here for B corps?"  The intro is playing, everyone goes "chh" along with the pit, followed by a mass nostalgic giggle. I smiled the entire time I watched that show, it was an awesome feeling.  I'm watching the product of the summer that changed my life when I feel a tap on my left shoulder. I whip my head around to see none other but good ol' Andy contra, my running block buddy who would share his life stories with me. I gave him a huge hug, it's so great seeing him again. He's one of the very few people that I told about Magic. He gave me a pouty, teary-eyed look with a "No offense or anything, but I really hope you don't make it."  I knew that I was back with my family now, I missed these people so much!  I hear a familiar giggle from the back of the room, and I look behind me to see Chels and all my favorite vets sitting on a table all rebellious-like. After the show is finished me and Andy start walking back there and I'm greeted by a huge Taryn hug, followed by a Gabby hug, and eventually a Victor, Allison, Christopher, and Brookie hug. I missed these guys *sniff*  After the big group/parent/info meeting type thing, we all go out to the equipment truck and it's there that I'm reunited with my mello =) I spot a rookie trying to walk away with it, but I quickly say "Can I have that one, please?" in an almost teary voice. (...almost!)  The rest of the day was a blur, a typical hornline rehearsal. Not as big a deal for me because I've been to one this season already, but BDB is sounding good this year! It's great to hear all those baris. My jaw hit the floor upon discovering that we had five kids rotating on tubas! Holy cow!  The hornline is a little topheavy again this year, and even more so than last year, but man, they sound awesome. I'm sure with time there will be some more kids trickling into the low brass, but these sops are badass and I can't wait to hear them playing show music.  And yes, the mello line was terribly misrepresented, as it usually is. Only me and Nick showed up, and we got a rookie from Tracy, Chris's recruit. Yep, three mellos present. So far the section has four, because Meghan had a play to be at.  I realized later when I got home, that ALL of our first mellos left for one reason or another (Pheobe retired, Wesley's with BD, and Stephen's "MIA"), and ALL of our seconds were returning... crazy, huh?  Well anyway, the day was fabulous, I missed everyone so much, and I can't wait to see everyone again in two weeks (I can't make it to the next rehearsal).  BDB knows what they've got on their plate. They know that they've been doubted and were almost cut altogether. They KNOW that they need to kick some major ass and show what they're made of. That, along with the fact that our hornline doesn't consist of almost entirely woodwind players as it did last year (heh) is going to make 2004 an incredible season for the Blue Devils B Corps.  Oh, and I can't get enough of my DVD, thanks Chris!!

      Well since the start of the season has passed and I've been exposed to the BDB program I thought I'd post. I don't think I've met you guys formally but maybe next weekend. Im Pat and I was playing contra yesterday but I think that I want to play baritone instead. I had a ton of fun on Sunday I'm rally anxious to meet everyone you all seem really cool. But yea just wanted to say hi I'll see you next Sun. Bye  O excuse the lack of posting skills haha

        A last minute delve into 2003   I opened up the backpack that got me through countless rehearsals today. I found a Styrofoam cup with  Chelsea AKA West Coast Tease  emblazoned across it in teal blue Sharpie. A pair of shorts, sunscreen, a tuner, and the last nine pages of drill completed the ensemble.   I unrolled the drill sheets, and the memories came flooding back as I was bombarded by the strong scent of Banana Boat SPORT (SPF 30+). The pages were cold, and almost damp, just as I left them after the last day of drill learning. In the summer, the sunscreen flavor IS your perfume, your cologne, only to be enhanced by the sickly sweet smell of perspiration.   Staring at the dots on the page, my eyes automatically sought out T3, my dot of honor: Daphne- T1/2, Jeff- T4, Austin- T5, Alex- T6, Travis- T7, Marco-T8, Brookie-T10, Taryn- T11, and Johnny-T12. We killed T9...  It's amazing to think how different my summer would have been if I hadn't marched between those two specific leads. Daphne mentored me in the big sister type way I've always dreamed of. She encouraged me, and molded me into the confident player I am now. She's better than I am, and I was able to compete with her on easy terms, battling it out for the solo, and laughing together when one of us would botch a note. Jeff was a different story. Though we fixed things by the end of the season, I really had to restrain myself from flat out bitching at him. In marching band the precious season, I was section leader, and yelled at whoever annoyed the crap out of me. But, Jeff was a lead, and I was just a rookie as well, so I was in no place to put him in his. Tolerance is a wonderful thing.  In the horn arc, I still did my ripples immediately after Daphne, and Travis followed suit on my left. Austin was after Travis, then Jessika with a K. It wasn't until I started vying for the solo that I stood next to Daphne. Before that, I stood between my two brothers in the best section alive, the 2nd trumpet section. That's where Austin and I giggled together as we hung our heads over and buzzed our chops, and made the bond that will keep us marching together forever. Once we moved outside, I moved next to Daphne, and played next to her the rest of the season. I specifically remember one sweaty, sunscreen soaked hug towards the end of the season with her, wrapping my arms around this tiny screamer, and never having more respect for any other horn player.  My squeeze bottle of Banana Boat is grimy, coated with dirt and valve oil and Gatorade and sweat and the sunscreen itself. I should recoil from the filth, wash the bottle in the sink, and put it in the cabinet for the rest of my family to use. But, you know I wont. This is my bottle of creamy cancer vaccine. The same methodology applies to my Bus Box of Death. The duct tape security system with a list of tour accidents is still there, guarding two 7C mouthpieces, a first aid kit safely secured in a cashew tin, Arrid XX (24 hour protection), and a blue handheld fan that spews the smell of mints and Bugles when its foam blades are engaged. Remember how I'd always run around the bus searching for hair ties because my hair was always down before shows, on the rare chance one of my parking lot victims would see me during visual warm-ups, and my hair bands were conveniently left in the Bus Box next to my Aerobed in the Gym?  Now is the best time for me to compile my thoughts into a coherent essay, as the 2004 season will be officially underway in less than 62 hours. Austin, I need to pee, but I can't go until I finish this. I'm ready to climb into my sleeping bag, sleeping on my stomach with Dashboard Confessional coming through my headphones so I wont snore and wake up the entire corps. I'm ready to run until I collapse, I swear this year I'll never give up. I'm ready to do  side, back, side, front  until my calves feel as if they're going to drop off. I'm ready to hang my head below my knees, buzzing my chops, only preventing myself from looking like an idiot because the rest of the hornline is doing it too. I'm ready to see Brookie, and Omid and Victor again, and see how the old friends fit in with the rookies.   I'm ready to march.

      alright kiddos, I'm updating again!  If you are interesting in marching brass for B corps this year, you will need the brass technique, a sheet of warmups for the brass line. FMM, they're different from last year, so definitely print yourself out a copy to bring to the Sunday rehearsal/camp/orientation/shin dig.   :D  It's  urlLink happening...

      Today's rehearsal was quite a blast, with the second most important announcement of the year:  WE'RE GETTING NEW JACKETS!!  No other details yet, although it isn't "official" yet either. Hopefully there will be something sparkly on them, our current unis are way too bland... Other than that, apparently a few (I think) shows were added to our schedule, including one in Kansas. Apparently I raked in a good amount of dough for the corps, thanks to the freakin FOURTEEN addresses that I brought in (and sad puppy faces that I drew on the insides of the letters). Surprisingly, nothing was said about the announcement of our show title, although plenty was said about good behavior and corps representation on DCP. Aren't there only 3 (possibly 4 with Trevor) B corps members registered? Heh, I never post, Chelsea only brags about us, that leaves one monkey, cough. We'll see if anything changes.  The  most  important announcement of the year? We're going to finals!

         They made up their minds  And they started packing  They left before the sun came up that day  An exit to eternal summer slacking  But where were they going Without ever knowing the way?  They drank up the wine  And they got to talking  They now had more important things to say  And when the car broke down They started walking  Where were they going without ever knowing the way?    CHORUS:    Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold  And It's always summer, they'll never get cold  They'll Never get hungry  They'll never get old and gray  You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere  They won't make it home  But they really don't care  They wanted the highway  They're happier there today , today    The children woke up  And they couldn't find 'em  They Left before the sun came up that day  They just drove off  And left it all behind 'em  But Where were they going Without ever knowing the way?    Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold  And It's always summer, they'll never get cold  They'll Never get hungry  They'll never get old and gray  You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere  They Won't make it home  But they really don't care  They wanted the highway  They're happy there today , today (repeat)                     Ok. So thats one of my most favorite songs, and just today I realized the correlation between the song, and summer, and drum corps. Aside from the lines about drinking wine and such...  I've been thinking alot...and it seems a heck of a lot harder to get into drum corps this season, than it was last year. I guess that song reminds me more of last season, when I was a rookie, thrown into all of this, blindly marching along, giddy to please the crowds.   Now I know what it takes, and it scares me a bit. Am I able to to that again? Looking at our schedule of 9-9s, or 9-10s, I get a mixed feeling of euphoria and utter fear. How the hell did we do that last season? How the hell is anybody up for that? I guess I'm just amazed we were all able to stay relatively intact, and finish the season one step closer to skin cancer, with huge beaming smiles.  I'm excited, don't get me wrong. I'm just kinda numb....how did we do that?

      BDB never ceases to make me smile. Sigh. Maybe my mind HAS been infiltrated by the Evil side...but I still Bleed Blue. Very much so. I was getting a little antsy even, when me and Patrick hit traffic right before our exit onto Hwy 4.   I had to return Sadia's horn today... that sucked majorly. Her mom is a royal biznatch (keepin it clean) and won't give us a valid reason for why Sadia can't march. Honestly? I've never EVER seen anyone want to march this bad...she was almost in tears when she called us this morning, saying how her mom refuses to let her march.   SHE WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO PAY!!!! Me and Pat were gonna take care of her tour fees.  Bah. Stupid people piss me off.   On the plus side, I guess.... We got new music...Awesome music, I might add. The Ballad is a WEE familiar...but...we'll see. You'll like it, I promise

      alrite. my turn. and i wont be a smart ass. wait scratch that, i will actually say something this time. today was rehersal. I was late, mother dearest made me miss BART. transfer train was also late-resulting in my "fashionably late" arrival this morning. its all good, i think i just missed the stretch. I'm glad I got there when I did cause that ummm stretch shawn was haivng us do is very relaxing. Even though I can't really completely do it cause my spine is not straight and it hurts like a bitch to let my head hang-relaxing. Shawn decided to change things up a bit, but thats ok, according to the latest Karlin-Amistoso regime what we did today would be the first and second halves of the B block. Anyways, what am I supposed to be posting? I asked Chelsea but she did not answer. I've been working my arms out all week and it really paid off. haha i mean yeah my bari is still a total bitch but my arms were not shaking as much as usual today:). I've been getting lessons from Phil and its really helping. Today I could actually hit an F (G for you treble fools) For those of you who do not know I believe Victor and Nic (bari not mello) are the only woodwind players in the line now I do not play clarinet anymore. BD is a family show so i cannot say why in here, i think all the people in this blog know already anyway. I dont really have much to say right now, my brain was worked really hard today and I cant really think straight. so yeah next time will be better i promise.

As expected the rookies did FANTASTIC for their first time...haha i remember the good ol days when i came in halfway through and everyone else already knew how to do everything....i was so lost but at least the rookies will get lots of practice. Chelsea and me were talking about just how good the rookies have it since they dont have to go through daily 9-9s. Lucky punks just wait till tour where we're stuck on a bus for 20 hours (ah memories) and Omid bustin out the Gold Bond.....and Axe (that was me). well im done you guys go back to your daily life...unless you're a bari..cuz then you gotta go practice more!

      Guess its my turn now...  Coming from an inexperienced hornline member I didnt really get the excitement of everyone when we were going to play ensemble. When we got in the room with the drumline though, I understood because it was so cool being apart of that, I mean at Vintage we werent even that good at the end of our season. Then we played and it was like "WOW" and thats all I could say.   Marching was also pretty cool because, well I dont know why but it was...haha Anyways The baritones heavy but eventually it was so painful that it was painful anymore and when that happened I felt very accomplished, very accomplished indeed.  So yea guess Ill see ya all next week. Till then.....

      chels "go update for BDB" christina "ok" so. here i am. havent been in a while sorry. i really want to talk your ears off but graduating high school should probably be the number two priority here. number one being rehersal of course. anyways, hmm. yeah rehersing in the sun today!!!! whoopwhoop. finally, i was all ready to go scandel on your asses, but no one else was. and i dont wanna go scandel alone. :( so yeah, ill just wait til the rest of us chickas are ready to strip down, unless next week im tired of wearing a shirt. (shrugs) who knows. so, marching with the drumline-niceness, getting into technique blocks which im sure you all have noticed some people desperately need it. i dunno, for me these marching blocks have been wierd, but that just could be because i've never rehersed without karlin, or amistoso or ian or andres running things....i miss those guys. they taught me everything i know.....now im sad. oh well whatever. new marching guy, charles told me about him, cool guy from what he said. yeah then we met him today, cool guy. music block, hmmm........hmmm......damn, ive already tried to say something here twice and it hasnt worked out cause it just comes out wrong. ok-think of something funny and cynical here but mostly funny and most importantly not offensive, insert it here, and say to yourself "man that christina. shes a funny one". man, im really bad at group blogs, especially ones like this cause i always end up offending people, and im really REALLY trying to not do that as always. but have patience, one day i will have this stroke of genius and will think up the perfect blog and will get out all i want to say.  i had a crappy rehersal today. i mean, i was floating a little while we were marching but id still screw up, and then during music (sigh) my jaw would just not open (i mean come on-my mouth refuses to open what the hell is that????) and also it was obvious that ive been slacking off my practicing which, i mean i know im gonna get back on the good routine but ahhhh i know better than that....heeheehee got a little bit of a belly tan :)

      Soooo it's been a while, no?  Today, well. Today was awesome.   WE HAVE A VISUAL INSTRUCTOR!!!   yeah dude, about damn time. I totally forgot his name, but he's the band director at Glennbrook, our primary rehearsal place. He also taught 'B' corps in like 96, 97, and 98, so it's dandy.   Ummm we spent a whole lot of time working outside in the hot sun...judging by my sunburn, it was a damn good rehearsal. We ran around the entirity of the school, and I returned the favor to all those skinny kids who pushed me during running block last year by running with the kids in the back. Playing cheerleader, not letting em give up. It felt really good, mentally AND physically, being that person, pushing em on....cuz it forced me not to give up myself. I felt better that I ever have, this season is definitely looking better for me, at least, getting in shape is a wonderful thing.  Hornline had limited numbers today, I'm not sure what happened, and where the hell everyone went, but yah ok. We still sounded amazing though. Jessika came, and so did Calvin, and they both said we sounded the biggest they've ever heard. Very exciting. I wanted to get a recording for distribution purposes, but we didn't do ensemble, and we were in the gym, soooo yeah.   I'll try to get the rest of the BDBers in here to update, mine is kinda lame. And away I go!

      Holy Crab Cioppinos... what a fun feed that was.  I was so lucky, I feel very guilty posting about it, but for those who don't already know, lets just say I made a lot of moolah tonight. THANK GOD FOR FERNANDO! Ask me if you need more details.  I got there pretty late, and I barely was able to wait on a table (hey that rhymes). I was nervous, but it was a lot of fun. I got really lucky, the people at my table knew each other and must have bought their tickets in a block so they could sit together. They were asking me to take pictures, to "avoid" certain balding men, get more wine, yadda yadda. I had never waited on anyone before, and it was cool to have feel that someone, somewhere needed you to do something for them. Somehow this whole experience was very inspiring, even before the tip jar started to overflow.   Stay tuned for Sunday's rehearsal...

      Ok. So here's the deal darlings.  We're kicking ass.   We had an intensive visual rehearsal, despite our lack of "official" Visual instructor. Sean is a trooper (heh) for being our makeshift vis dude, making humorous and informative demonstrations on the proper way to march. We've started playing while marching, just A and B block, but it's better than nothin.   I didn't have to hip switch today! Woot! (meaning I did the exercize right lol)  Then, around 2:30, we got to the show music, after a quick run through of warmups. We went down the line doing the slur/staccato chromatics exercize, and in all actuality...we sound pretty damn good. The only issue was probably the mello section, but 3 of the 5 are completely new to the horn. They tried their best, and made us proud :) However. We didn't play good enough, so Sean made us run!!  YES! Running! Oooooh wow I've never been so happy for people to screw up. Running felt amazing, and I really hope we insitute it...cuz Champs are won in the winter months, so lets start winning, people!!  Anyway, we mainly focused on Third Wind and Minuano, with Jeff and I switching off on the Minuano solo. I played everything wonderfully, until the C at the end...somehow playing it in the brass ensemble sucks away my air, and no matter how wonderfully I play it alone...I couldn't speak that C. Anyway. doesn't matter.  Jeff did a decent job...he's got the high notes down, while I've got the rythyms down. Its a CHALLENGING solo. The rythyms are odd, with interesting intervals between notes...definitely not a breeze.   BUT! Apparently they can't make a decision between us two. John, who came into the ensemble rehearsal (battery and bit and brass, oh my!) as Jeff and I were splitting the two Minuano solos, came up behind us, and planted the idea of a duet, instead of a solo.   Hmmmmmmmm!!!   We sounded pretty good, we being the entire corps. We were missing quite a few people, and despite 2 new recruits, the brass line was incredibly reminicsent of last years unintentional minicorps. Missing a tenor, and a bottom bass....we still managed to provide a cohesive showcase for the parents trickling in to watch the last bits of rehearsal.   A good day over all, expect good things!

      alrighty then. our first camp. whoohoo!!! so exciting, right? oi!!!!! friday night, music block. lanzino, one of my old band directors doin what he does best-makin analogies. not necessarily a bad thing, we arent supposed to be posting anything negative right? hahaha i dont really have anything bad to say anyway, he was being hella nice. that swaying got me confused though, i already felt the music but then that madness made my head hurt hahaha. Saturday........baritones should not post about saturday morning because negative things might be said. man o man lots of pain. But, that was a good thing, because it showed us what level we are actually at because there was no where to run or hide. Good learning experience. The rest of the day was not as hard, but trying to recover from the hardest, most ungodly block in one hour is kinda hard, especially since one must eat during that hour. Sunday, soreness; takin Motrin like M&M's. on the way to SF my butt fell asleep so that just added to the wonderfulness, me and kendall were dying. The performance....ok, i you put aside all the stuff that was awful it wasnt that bad. it was loud, and what people did play sounded reasonable didnt it? all things considered we did the best we could and im sure it could have gone worse.    If ya think about it it was a pretty good weekend, we learned a lot; about ourselves if not the show hehe. I think this was a good weekend and would not change any of it.   Hey, i got a nice tan so even better right?

      So me and Chelsea have a concert on Friday that starts at 7. A little out of the ordinary because our concerts are usually on thurs. but as you all know we have a rehearsal on Fri. and me and chelsea being the incredibly strong-minded people that we are have decided that this weekends rehearsal is more important the this band concert, considering LMS and such...Seems that much more imperative to me because prom is Sat. and i have to leave early to make it to Prom and the party bus and such but neways. Chelsea says to Gantt, hey me and Pat have a rehearsal on Friday that we cant miss. And he throws the "Gantt" speech. (  Gantt Speech : An infamous speech given by the pedagogue William Gantt whenever something doesn't seem to work out for him. ) But anyways she got the speech and she was pretty pissed...As for me i realize where he's coming from, i really do. The only difference between me and the normal person is i just dont give a   bleep , so i kinda just was like yea its not an option for me im going to that rehearsal.   Patrick what does this have to do with anything? Well alot because Patrick and Chelsea have just really commited thierselves to the corps by picking BDB over VHSMB. You may not understand the significance but as of now we play very significant roles and being absent from these positions tend to upset people, people that we have to see every single day.   BDB: 1 VHS: 0   SCORE

       Posted by: dare2makemusic Apr 18 2004, 03:08 PM    QUOTE (dans24103 @ Apr 18 2004, 02:29 PM) off topic here, but have they ever considered calling Blue Devil B Corps anything else? It seems that virtually anything would be a better name and wouldnt carry the negative connotation of being on the "b"squad.     I'm sorry, but I don't find anything offensive about being part of "just" the B "squad" Does "B" now stand for "bad" and the "A" in "A" Corps for "awesome"? Last I checked, there is not ONE singular negative connotation with that "B" added at the end of my corp's name. It simply states that yes, we are a different division of the Blue Devils organization. How about the "C" corps? Woo-ee, they must be SUPER bad, I mean, look at that, C is after B in the alphabet.   WTF dude, I wear the same jacket those super A Corps kids do, hey lookie, there goes a C Corps kid with the same exact jacket. Whenever someone asks me if I just aged out of BDA, or "hey, congratulations on your 11 time World Championship" I say, hey, thanks, but I had nothing to do with that. I proudly state that I am in fact a member of the B corps, a PERFECTLY VALID and competitive corps.   The name has nothing to do with it.    [/DCP rant_OFF]

      Memorial Day camp... Sounds like a first taste of summer! I'm looking forward to these 36 hours, holy moly that's the most rehearsal time we've had all season. I looooove how much drill we already have down. I looooove that we just might have a full trumpet section (just maybe?) there. Rookies get their first taste of tour food. I remember last year's Memorial camp so well that it does not seem like it could have ever been an entire year ago. That's when we started to build up our momentum for the season and those (counts on fingers) FOUR days really did set the tone for the rest of the year. (or rather the following SEVEN weeks of the season that we had left....) Here's something to chew on: As of this Sunday, we have, count 'em, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, TEN weeks left until the 2004 season is over. Ten weeks until Finals. Ten weeks until we don't see each other again for another few months. Ten weeks until my summer really ends.   So let's get this show on the road! Remind everone you see at rehearsal that this is the beginning of something big, and while the season has yet to officially start, our time is already running out.

           If you're reading this blog, you're a fan of the Blue Devil organization. You've either marched, are marching, or jumped out of your seat while watching one of our shows.  Jerry Seawright made that happen.   He died on a day fitting, as the founder of the Blue Devil Drum and Bugle Corps. Both Blue Devils "A" and Blue Devils "B" had a camp on Sunday, May 16th, and were wrapping up successful rehearsals as Mr. Seawright passed.   I'm not about to write an entry telling how much this man meant to me, hell, I barely knew him, and I've been brought to tears. I tried on the  urlLink Blue Devils Forums  to express my sadness, and I am in no state to go through that mental anguish again.   Jerry, my camp, my season, my year, my drum corps carreer is for, and because of you. Thank you, for creating the organization you did. Thank you so much, thank you in ways I could never begin to express. I've never loved and devoted myself to any one thing, as I have with the Blue Devils, and I fell I've chose the right thing to dedicate myself to, an exceptional, high class group, your dream.   We're your future, Mr. Seawright, and we're sure as hell going to carry it through. You're the ultimate age-out, you'll never be replaced.     urlLink http://bluedevils.org/about/jerryseawright/

      Family Day was a blast, looking back on it all. Having friends there made it so much more enjoyable, simply because I knew they were lovin' it too. I'm really beginning to dig our new uniforms. They're really beginning to grow on me. The blue with the white and black is great and the mirrors add a wonderful touch.  I don't think I can put into words how much I wanted to stay in that brass circle that we made during our warmups. My ears were being fried by the pure bliss of noise. The anticipation that came beforehand only heightened the sensory overload.    As far as our performance went, I thought we improved upon last year's performance beyond comparison. Maybe it was just me. The show didn't catch me by surprise, which could just be a result of my experience at last year's Family Day. Sure, we ran out of gas. Sure, there were tears. But in all honesty, I went out there expecting that there was going to be a train wreck, as this was the first time that we were putting everything together, in front of our friends and family, wearing the unis, and on a strange field. The train wreck never happened.... I think we're going into this next weekend of shows as a very prepared corps. The fact that we have all of our drill learned excites me. I really want to go out on Saturday, and see if we can't start the season off with a smaller gap than last year's six-pointer between us and SCVC. Which we did eventually encompass, to beat 'em anyways. Hehe.  Everything's falling into place, the stars are aligning, and the wheels are turning for BDB to have a phenomenal season. I'm glad that I'll be a part of it.

      Hey guys, I'm thinking about changing the URL to this site, since we can do it without changing anything....you'll just need to update your links and favorites and what not.   www.BDBbrass.blogspot.com  ^^^is what it's gonna be.   SO get to changin, and I'll transfer our stuff before the weeks out.     ----   On another note, I just have to thank everyone for an incredible Memorial Weekend camp. I was so blown away by our ability to get down and dirty, to focus, to just intesify our rehearsal, maxing it out to it's greatest potential.  Yeah, cheesy, and it's been said before, but really...   like I said to....umm....a lot of people.... how the hornline was running their own stuff while the the DL and guard worked with Ken? :-D Good stuff, homes.   Shawn told us to "yip," to talk it up, hype it up.... Folks, we don't really have to! I've read two unprovoked (meaning I didn't tell em to write it at all) reviews of our weekened, by alums and people in the activity. They see where we're goin, probably better than we do, since they can see it from the judges standpoint.    urlLink Here's one  and  urlLink here's another.  If I'm maxing this season out for anyone, it's for those alums, those who marched BDB in the past, those who believe we've got something special. :)

      I think someone has hired a hit man to take out our kids.   The mello virus from last year (at one point during a rehearsal, we had exactly ONE mello on the feild, instead of our five, because of various inguries or sicknessess) has returned, and now it's spread to the rest of the hornline, and the rest of the corps. (corpse? hmmmmm)  Justin, our top bass, has tendonitis in his "good" knee....the other leg still troubles him from when he broke it pre-season. Nettie, one of our second/lower lead trumpets, rode her bike into a truck and broke her collarbone.  Anthony, one of our 3rd baris, was showing off jazz running in the street, and broke 2 toes. Bye bye backwards stride! Christina, a second bari, was in a car crash, and missed a few rehearsals cuz she has such bad whiplash, she couldn't move. Allan, a 2nd mello, fell and messed up his knee, occasionally he has to sit out of rehearsals Jeff, a lead trumpet, has perpetual shin splints Meghan, mello section leader, is still wearing a brace on her ankle from when she came down with the mello virus last year Nikki, a guard member, cracked her skull open with a sabre, and was on the feild a few hours later for the run through, despite the blood still oozing from her head.  and finally...  Sarah, another one of our guard members, was jumped, and beat up with a 2x4. She was at rehearsal the next day in braces....  And yet they'll all be on tour with us next week, when we leave at 6 in the morning for our 3 week tour towards DCI Finals in Denver. Limping, bruised...we'll be there, and put on one hell of a show.

      Well another Christmas and by far one of the best even due to the lack of presents this year. I realized that it is very dumb for me to take presents before christmas because I opened two gifts and Im really spoiled so Im used to getting lots of stuff. Last year I got a drum pad and a TV and stuff. This year though was really memorable because first of all we are at a really nice resort and second of all knowone was down. In our family at least 5 have died in this month resently so for knowone to be is sad is very good. The only thing that sucked is that my momma was really sick. So when she was opening gifts she would laugh and almost cough op a longue but she will be fine. Me and my sis are the only ones here because we happen to be the only minors and the only ones not at the casino but anyways including presents that I got earlier I got  Laptop(YAY!!!) Music Studio Recording System For Comp Shoes(Nice KSwiss) 2 Wal Mart Gift Certificates $100.00, $60.00 (I know I know walmart but trust me imma come up) $50 biological father $20 brother all in all not a bad christmas   I like I like now im gonna go shoppin with Chels for BD in January

      Well today was kindof interesting (kindof) I got up and found out that my beloved car was ready so I got up as fast as I could and drove down to pick it up. My intent after that was to go home, pack, and be on my mary way all the way up to Nice(pronounced N-EE-ce) California. But when I got home I found that my step dad took my sis to go shop with him which wasn't good because I had to take her with me. After numerous calls back and forth I decided to leave without her so me and my brother left. I felt really guilty for leaving her so I just decided to go get some gas and go home and wait. So that's what I did. When we finally got on the road it was smooth sailing for then on out. We had our dog P-nut we had pillows and blankets and McDonald's and we were on the road we first drove to Clear Lake to meet my grandma and let me be the first to say that that road is not fun so as we swirved back and forthe through the mountains everyone in the car was sick except me and thats a first so I was happy. I went to turn into my grandma's house and the car in back of me either wasn't looking or didn't car so I had to swirve and skid to get into my grandma's house so we got up there and loaded some more stuff and then we drove here to this place in which I have to use a dial-up connection, but its ok because its really nice up here. Well I'm still just as boring but on this day I seem to have alot more to say.

      Yo yo yo things are getting increasingly boring in this household today I rolled out of bed at about 10:30 and put on pajama's. I didn't take them off I put them on. I went down stairs to the lovely sound of court shows echoing throughout the hallways. I then preceeded to get turn on my computer when long behold it wouldn't start so I had to format my hard drive and start all over and estonishingly that was the most interesting part of my day. I got online and knowone was online. So I turned on my t.v and nothing was on. Not a good time for me so I went down stairs and got the chinese food out of the fridge fortune cookies and all and then I came up stairs and watched Finding Nemo on my computer. Its probably not good that I have a laptop because me laying down just gets me tired and even more tired so eventually I just fell asleep. About 4 hours later I woke up to the sound of Marlin yelling at Dory on the DVD title menu so I shut it off and went back to sleep for another 30 min. So I wake up to the sound of music playing in my house and long behold this is my current state I haven't even turned on my light yet. And I just realized that life without a car sucks.

      Aww another day....well things were a bit more interesting today as opposed to yesterday. I woke up kindof angry mainly because I was wakin up by my dear grandpa because I had to take my car to the shop. Im so tired of that car but I love it so much. I think tommorow I'm going to wash my car and wax it just because it hasn't been cleaned in a while....awww *tear realizatiion of the fact that my car will be in the shop until tommorow hopefully I can drive up to my grandma's house to help with preparation for Christmas. But after I rested for a while I decided that I wanted to do something so I busted out the roller coaster tycoon jk actually I did do that, but I also talked to my good friend Leilani and we decided that we both needed to get out of the house and go on a little excursion so it took a little planning on my part so that I could get a car so I borrowed my g-pa's car (not fun too much work old stick w/o power steering) so we decided to go to good old Baskin Robbins 31 flavors were I went in and dominated the ordering because I used to work at Baskin Robbins but after that we sat down and had a long awaited conversation it felt so good talking to her again just because we haven't got to sit and talk for a long time. Then I went over to the chinese food place and my credit card didn't work because the gas station charged 11 dollars when they should've only charged me 6 something so that wasn't a good thing to find out about when your trying to by something. But the good thing is that carma came in and Leilani's little sister Vilma paid for it and it was really cool. I really wish I had enought time for a job because money is sparse nowadays. (wow that was a tangent) but yea all in all it was a very productive day better than some worse than others but I had fun.

      Again I'm in digital media with work to do and no want to do it. Well anyways yesterday I had class at the college and we have a different instructor every day of class. On mondays for three hours we have Mr. McConnell, and on Wednesdays we have Mr, Kujac. Haha yesterday with Mr. Kujac was getting hella mad because these people in our class are so sorry to say dumb and they havent taken math for like 30 years or something so there all like over 30 and in Algebra 2. But hes the funniest teacher because hes like yelling "you have to attack the problem or else the problem with kick you ass" lol that was fun. And then on mondays Mr. McConnell is all nice and stuters and seems like he is more afraid of his students. Then come tues when i have psyc 250 or something which is a child psycology class. Our teacher is so wierd because shes like crazy. She smiles way to much and shes like love everyone there all your friends. So I think that overall my experience at the college on Mon-Wed nights.  Suprisingly im not stressed though, Im a prosecuting lawyer for the Atomic Bomb which is ALOT of work, I have to college classes, forensic science, and digital media, and still im not stressed at all. I think that the reason that im not stressed is because I get to have a little relief on sundays in Concord. Just being in that atmosphere is good for me and the ride there, home, and eating in Taco seems to keep me pretty level in terms of my stress level. Well anyways work time Payce.

      School does seem to have its advatages!!! Seeing as I go to a school filled with mucho computers I have access to my blog 24/7. But anyways I'm sitting here in digital media and I'm supposed to making a cd cover but once again I turn to my blog when things get a little boring.   Well lets see doesnt seem like there is much to write about but I will find something. Im sitting here and I have know music at all. If you went to my school you would find it near impossible to do work without music because the sound of computers keys are really annoying once you've heard it many times. So without my music comes no work. And its dawned on me that since I have about 2 weeks to finish this project I'm actually pretty well on track. And it helps that I am pretty good with photoshop so im not to worried.   What does seem to make me mad is that I dont feel that I can miss school ever. I mean dont you feel that it is a right of passage to randomly be sick and just not come that day? At this school we dont need passes or notes or anything to make our way around the school. But it seems that whenever I have an ample opportunity to leave (which is always) I never take it and I do my work. This may perhaps be the reason I dont get anything below a B but I think im now going to excercise my right more and take my chances. How much harder can it be?  But not today because today we find out our rolls for the new project. What we're doing in my American Studies Class (intergrated english and history) is we're going to be staging a trial. There will be no lines or anything that you dont really go into a court case with. If im lucky ill become a prosecutor for the Atomic Bomb case. Which means I get to charge the US with the mass murder of many Japanese civilians. (fun fun) Im really excited although my teacher said that if I am lawyer then it will be the most work that i'll ever have to do up to and quite possibly through my college career. This should scare me but I think of it like this. If I can get through this with an A. I might possibly get though the rest of my years in high school with A's always thinking "This can't compare to that America On Trial Project" So im pretty excited.  Well I think im gonna get back to work now this may not be the last blog considering its only 8:54 arg another hour in this class. Well Payce

      I swear, weekends go by so damn fast. Well what can I do. Anyways today I had BDB and it was alot of fun. Its becoming increasingly more apparent to me that I dont suck as bad as I think I do. Today when we were rehearsing I could play everything pretty well. I still have to tongue number "5" and have some trouble with "7" but everything else is coming out well. I think in about 2 or 3 weeks ill have everything down and im happy about that. All thats left for me now is to be able to hold my horn up but im guessing that comes with time. haha, Its pretty cool be in an amazing hornline thats extremly loud, its really cool, and next week we get to march.

      Things tend to happen pretty randomly in life. I transition from choir to band in a matter of minutes. On sunday i went to BDB i dragged Sadia along with me because i didnt want to go alone but it ended up being fine. We did some warm-ups at first then as he was auditioning people we had sectionals and the bari section marched and played and we all got in a circle and i got to know everyone and everyone there is really cool. But right after that i had a concert.        martin luther king service       everyone loved us         catholic, jewish, and baptist all in one room       crazy man  that seems to be the overview of my night it was a good service i must say  today Chamber Choir recorded a cd, it was so tedious and long but itll probably be worth it in the end. Plus we took a break and in that break i learned how to do a running round off back hand spring. I got home and tried to do it and it wouldnt work but ill try it again tommorow when im not aching. well g'night

      God school is so damn boring. I'm here now and Im in digital media and I'm not having fun at all. I suppose I could start designing my cd cover and actually doing some work but I'm really tired and I have to more weeks to do it. Well anyways right now I'm really annoyed because well I'm really tired and I'm getting extremely tired of being thought of as a person that people can talk about and walk all over. It seems as though when I dont talk people badger me and ask me whats wrong but when I do talk they want to challenge me on everything I say and critique my work and tell me that I'm wrong. And whenever I challenge what people say they say damn Pat why are you so mean. But I cant help if I speak my mind whenever I need to.   But whatever I'm not going to let people get to me. A good trait about me is the fact that I'm never really down and the fact that I can speak my mind makes it so people know that I'm not a person to be messed around with. Well neways nothing has happened to day, yet so ill go back to tommorow. I had a kinda lousy day first I didnt get to practice after school and I ended up just driving Chelsea home. I didnt want to fight traffic getting home so I just stayed there for a while and watched making the video "Brittney Spears" and she is such a dits its horrible. I mean she's hott and she's aloud to be a slut because she can have anyone she can. But she is so ditsy. Neway when i got home I tried to turn on my laptop and it wouldnt work so I was sitting there hella mad and bored and I couldnt do anything. I had to go to costco and return my comp and get a new one. I lost everything i had and it sucked. So yea crappy day yesterday maybe today, dunno it started out crappy though. Well Payce

      I had so much fun yesterday!!!  I went to concord to attend a meeting/rehearsal/try-out for the Blue Devils "B" Corps and I had so much fun. I've never been apart of a hornline before and I actually have never even been apart of a hornline before and to have it be an all brass horn line was really cool. The only thing I'm really concerned about with the hornline is getting cut because the group of people there seem great and I can't wait to get to meet everyone. I don't think I'm going to get cut though I have a really good teacher (Chels haha) and I practice alot so I'm not   to   worried.   Well sorry for the short post but I got alot of homework. Payce

      So today was very very good as u may or may not know we had a DCI party at Chelsea's so i got to be even more excited and anxious for Sunday January 11th at 12:00pm. So anyways after school today Sadia, Chelsea, Justin, and I all met in the band room to get ready to go over to Chelsea's house to set up for the party. We got all of our instruments together and headed to the car. Leave it to Sadia to do something we were walking through the halway and she flipped backwards over a chair ending up with her french horn on top of her. We all laughed and headed to my car but we couldnt possibly get all the way there without something else happening. Picture this: it's raining and were walking Chelsea insists we stop because she hears a frog so we're standing in the rain waiting for her to find the frog. Long story short she never found the frog. Finally we get to my car and eventually find a way for us all to fit. So off to Chelsea's house we went.   We got there and to my surprise (haha) Sadia was hungry so we got some coupons to Subway and headed there. Sadia loud as usual walked into Sadia yelling "Why are they staring at me? Its because im black." So when we went in everyone ended up stareing at us neway and we realized we needed to pull together money so we left and realized that togos is better neway. So we went there and ate while I talked to some of my former co-workers.   When we went back to Chelsea's house Ricky was there so we started some of the videos while Brenden and Eric walked in. They left and Justin wanted to go with them so bad (Justin wants to be a stoner so bad but he cant find it in him to actually smoke so he hangs out with them to feel cool) It was so funny because Sadia made a comment about them forgetting the leash or something so he couldnt go but she kept like barking and he had know idea. After watching Phantom Regiment we turned off the tv and headed up stairs. I hooked up my laptop and went online while i staired at the pictures of BDB and the drill and stuff. At first we had nothing to do but we then remembered that we had digital camera fun to have so we spent about 1 hr. shooting photos and just laughing (cept Justin hes ashamed of us, he told us) So after this we decided that Justin was getting on our nerves continuously saying "Pat ill pay u if u take me home." so i took his money and we took a ride. The road is really narrow but the ride was fun with us riding on the wrong side and the continuous flash from the camera. When we went back to Chelsea's we sat around for another couple hours and then me and Sadia went home.

      Today i had fun aside from the fact that i was at school for 2 hrs but that was ok after school was done me and Chelsea got together to practice and ended up having alot of fun. We ran around looking for an empty practice room but there were none. So we ended up just opening up Chelsea's trunk and practicing in there as everyone walked by staring. So when we were done we went back in the band room while eating our "New York BlueBerry CheeseCake Ice Cream." So when we get back in the band room we decide to take Sadia over to Chelsea's house to watch Blue Devils and Phantom Regiment. Sadia had never seen drum corps before so it was really fun watching her jaw drop. We then realized that we had to be somewhere in like 5 min so we rushed down to the music room and we ended up not even playing because our "dum major" didnt get his facts straight and go to a second source for correct dates. So i just ended up playing some excercises on the sousophone. But then me Chels, Sadia, and Raja decided to go to McDonalds without actually telling Raja that he was going to pay for all of us but its ok cause were going to pay him back. We went back to Chelsea's house and long and behold we watch more drum corps so that we could show Raja what it was all about. We pretty much summed it in in a phrase pertaining to "A marching band on crack." so he was all shocked and Sadia got even more excited. She wants copies of all the cd's and dvd's now and shes really excited for sun. our first b corps meeting. it was really fun and there's going to be about 10 excited faces at Chels house on fri i cant wait.

      Well at the request of my dear friend Chelsea im updating my blog...Well hmmmm nothing has really been going on we got home on friday. We came in to a horribly dirty and cold house because my g-pa had left the fireplace open and a bird got in and did alot of damage. There was crap everywhere and it ate all the brownies :( but its ok because they were chocolate brownies and it died up stairs in the bathroom because of the chocolate it ate. But o well now its less then a week until BDB tryouts and im getting more and more scared because there might be tryouts for the hornline now which i had planned to do after i tried out for the drumline (my moms making me) but neways this week i have to practice for drums and horns so that i know enough. But if all else fails ill play cymbals i dont have a problem with it id just rather march contra then cymbals and if that doesnt end up working there is also aux. pit percussion or timpani but i do really want to march but ill do nething to march a corps this year.

      Hmmm.   Item 1: Class tonight, tommorow, and the day after Item 2: Hella work to do on trial which is taking place on wed.  Item 3: little time to do it  Item 4: play thurs, fri, sat Item 5: band concert thurs Item 6: Sectional fri  And the sad thing is that all of this doesnt even make up a fourth of my schedule this week, i seriously need like 1 week to do nothing, and i wont be able to have one of those until well until the choir trip which isnt to myself persay o well...  On the plus side, my hard work has paid off because for the first time since well freshmen year first semester, i made honor roll, i also got recommended for a leadership conference out of about 200 people which was exciting, its nice to know that i am being appreciated in some way.   Well the trial is really close and considering what happend today with the other trial im not tooo worried. But still nervous non the less. I never really noticed how much thought goes into the judicial systems, and i also now have a great respect for lawyers because every time they talk they risk being humiliated. I dont know its just really crazy.   Well kids i think ill go study or something i also must go to class in 30 min bye

      I feel a bit guilty not goin to class tonight...hahhahahah  no i don't, i got so much done its not even funny got nap, eat, hmwrk, practice, and i wrote my opening statement kinda...still a draft but all in all pretty good, im kinda skeptical to put it online though because the defense lawyers might get a hold of it although I guess there is nothing that they could really get from it so here it goes:  Can you imagine living in fear? Not being able to sleep at night because you’re not sure whether or not you will ever see your family again. Every day waking up not knowing if it will be you’re last. Its DATE at TIME the kids are anxious and waiting for their breakfast, you are thankful for one more night. You’re child asks you, is it over yet? And you cant say anything for fear of hurting your child. There’s a flash of light and no sound is heard. Then in an instant you’re the only one left. With a pain that will not subside. You look around and there is your child on the floor, his face unrecognizable with burns. He’s not moving, you go to pick him up and his head falls from under his body. You turn to your wife hysterically crying and she cannot hold you because her arms and legs are gone. You move up to her grasp her in your arms and after one last breath she’s gone. It is my duty, in conjunction with knowledge I have acquired throughout this case to lay before you evidence pertaining to the dropping of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki, and Hiroshima. It is not a question of whether or not the bomb was dropped, but is a question of the justification of this action by the United States. The murder of NUMBER civilians is under no means justified, and the prosecution WILL persuade YOU, the civilians, that under no means is the murder of thousands of civilian lives justified. Think of your mother, your father, your siblings, your child, and even your dog and tell me that you would be willing to lose them on the terms of war.   Well kids ill c ya soon

      *tiredness*  dont know what to do...those damn popup window messenger things keep popping up...if you know how to get rid of them tell me cause there really annoying.  i am sooooo tired and stressed and mad...i swear it happens whenever my room is dirty dont know why, but it just is...but i did get a 2 hour nap today and i watched a movie about teen sex with my parents. it was so bad because they took normal high school and multiplied it by like 50, and then there were all the questions on my school now and peer pressure and all of that good stuff, so it was interesting seeing these teens with syphillis and haveing sex and comparing that to me who is one of the most clean kids at even "tech high" so yea dunno.   im having troubles, some of you may know what it is but im not going to post it online, ask me if u really wanna know but i might not tell u so be prepared. its along the lines of you cant always have what u want. and it sux cause you dont know what u want.   but on the upside i am watching my big obnoxious wedding or something, i dont understand how the people are so dumb i mean there are camera's around so obviously something is going on i mean half of the channels on cable are dedicated to some kind of reality show, so when there is a camera where there was never one before, put 2 and 2 together, people these days are just so dumb...

      Yo Yo Yo...Well kids it time to get this blog train rolling again and with not to much to say I think it will stop right in the middle of the track(dont think that made since) but anyways I got out of class about 30 min ago, I think Im starting to like Mr. Kuljac a.k.a Mr. Kick the problems ass...He is really good at explaining things and although I rarely need help(not bragging im just gifted haha) hes really good but anyways I guess the last time i blogged was thurs day Its been almost a whole week well lets see, this past weekend is what comes to mind, i went to san fran with Chels and Sadia the "oreo" and we were with the Renegades all day and to say the least it was incredible I dont think i regret anything from that weekend except wearing black clothes. So yea ummm sunday "B" Corps as usual we got some new songs and things to work on but its starting to come a little routine so Im used to it now... It is still the highlight of my weeks but being with the Renegades on sunday was amazing so i dunno i was kinda drum corps out but i did get a compliment from Shawn on my marching which was kinda cool. But this weekend we dont have to go so by next weekend ill be ready again. (if that made since), so im not too excited about my long weekend, on fri i have mucho music rehearsals for hawaii and for barbershop. FUN? i think not! On sat im singing to people and hanging out with Sadia, (not too excited bout sat, lets just say there something that I really dont want to do to someone) but ill leave it at that. Sun nothing due to the "B" corps break which means ill either sit at home or the "OREO" will strike yet again. Then monday dunno..the story of my life. So yea I will ttyl IM me sometime cya

      Only 28 minutes until Im out of school for the day, and good riddins. I needed a break, its been way to long since I've gotten real rest and today Im going to take full advantage. Actually I probably wont, Ill go home and practice and 5:30 will come way soon and then Ill have to leave again...The story of my life but hey, for whatever reason I get by with less stress then most and with better grades, even with all of my extra-curricular activities, so in turn I'm pretty happy with the way they are...Im content. Until Later CYA

      Well I was planning to start out saying Guess what class I'm in? But I got caught up doing a little extra credit so now I'm in forensic science, we have a sub and I am done with all my work so I turn to mi blogo for a little relief from the boredom that plagues me.   At the risk of sounding like a complete drum corps nerd...I LOVE THE BLUE DEVILS "B" CORPS!!!, there that felt good. Yesterday was perhaps one of the funnest days Ive had by far this year. Did a little marching, a little playing, nothing completly out of the ordinary, but for some reason it was more fun then anything I have done previous to that. We got to play with the drums which was perhaps the highlight of the whole rehearsal simply because I was on the other side of the arc. I still couldn't help thinking to myself that I was good enough to make the drumline...but as for now I am very content being a horn player.   Well today hasnt really unraveled yet so there is nothing really to say...I hate driving in the rain and it is pouring outside, I can't wait to get home today, and do a little practicn' but I hate the fact that I have a college class tonight...But what more can I do? Absolutly nothing. Well until tonight or until I have something interesting to write about Payce....

      Disney Land   Well i left on thurs for disneyland, i was considerably calm a little nervous and really anxious. The bus ride was really fun i slept alot but we also played a bunch of games watched alot of movies and found out some interesting things. We left at 3:30 and ate at about 8:00 or so Marc Havner ate a 16 by 16 from In & Out for those of u that dont know thats 16 patties and 16 pieces of cheese complete with two buns. He finished all minus 3 patties. We got to the hotel around 2:00 and we were out, we had a long day ahead of us... we rehearsed for 30 min. each choir and then we left for some shopping mall place, i dont know which one though. then went to downtown disney. It was really fun we had a good time in build a bear factory making a Mr. Teeters bear. The thing that happened next potentially ruined the trip for me though. A girl named Gina stole from Sephora and got caught. She was so dumb and i dont understand y she did this. But the security guard where following her around the store after they saw her put something in her bag on the security camera. So she was caught and was screaming on the floor and was just all bad. long story short the girl that was with her had to hang out with my mom for the rest of the trip. which was really supposed to be our time together. But this girl attracted a crowd and there were just so many of us so i didnt have any fun for like half a day until my mom was tired and went back to the hotel and kassie had to go with a different chaperone. but yea the whole rest of the time i just decided to leave but it still messed up my whole  trip because i didnt get to hang out with my friends at all. but it was ok because they day of the festival came and we were amazing. We one 1st place concert with a gold, first place chamber with a gold, sweepstakes for high school choir combined for chamber and concert, sweepstakes for higest music score combined for any school, and sweepstakes for best choir for chamber singers. I was in complete aww...ive never been so happy in my life. but yea i think im gonna go goin' to chill wit some choir folks tonight payce.

      those of u that know me understand that when put in a proper environment i can act quite "white." Since i spend all of my time in napa some of u have never seen me in a non-proper setting and yes kids i can be "black as helll"  the story: so its Sadia's b-day, we're having a really good time at the ice-scating rink and our friend falls hella hard and these kids start laughing at him and us. As we walk by we say to eachother stuff like they shouldn't be laughin and stupid shit that wasnt really meant for them to here neway (some of it was however) neways they go and tell there parents that were picking on them and totally fabricate this huge story that just keeps getting built of lies, to the point were two stories arent even the same btw some of the kids.    so the worker comes and talks to us and tells us that we shouldnt talk to the kids and she'll tell them not to talk to us. and i say "what the f*** i got 2 talk to dem 4? and if i want to say somethin i will" (or something along those lines) so long story short we just keep skating. soon after there mother who didnt go into the rink not once the whole time we were there walks up 2 Sadia and my sister and starts yelling at them so my sis cuses her out. so the lady comes in and says "you need to leave the rink or we'll call the cops" so i say "what da f*** u gotta call da cops 4, ill call da cops my damn self its free on my phone." (haha i have so much fun) so we're outside and i ask for my money back because she was kicking me out w/o no reason and raising her voice so i cussed her out. she said she was going to get her manager or whatever and i said "i dont need to talk to that f**kin' hoe" and we left.  i was so pissed the whole time so much that my eyes were like blood shot red and my ears were hot and things that i normally wouldnt say were justa rollin' off my tongue, but then it was so funny and i relieved so much stress that i decided im not going to talk shit from people nemore, and so in closing i've decided ice-skating trips with Sadia, Chelsea, and my sister rock hard!!!

      wow this whole lapse of effective blogging is starting to get old, soooo to fix that i thought i would blog...go figure. Anyway i love my days now. Why? dunno, i think its the lack of rain and cold, i do get a bit restless in class but when i get in my car and take the top down its just...GREAT. So today i went to Jordan Viets house and i have decided that i need to move. his house is so sick and i think im going there this weekend.  I have effectivly portrayed myself and Sadia on the road as well...Crazy. Today we decided that we would bumb some Brittney Spears on the highway and dance around as all the people in the cars stared and we cracked up. Then we bumped it REALLY REALLY loud outside her house and got out the car and danced around the car, it was so fun.   Ummm i then picked her up and we went down to my school for open house which was kindof dumb aside from the fact that we got free food.   So yea i guess the next thing is that i get to leave next week for DisneyLand with choir. the only thing im not looking forward to is that whole 9 hour bus ride thing but its ok cause i can sit next to Britt. But i dont know how long im going to be able to stand people on a bus ride. but ill get through it.   Well i guess thats it until soon, cya

      Arent school days just great...HELL NO lol, which is the reason why I am at home right now wondering how im going to get all my homework done before tonight. I suppose it would be ok to just do it now but im lazy as hell and i have 3 hours before i jump in my car with no gas and head down to Napa to go to chamber choir.   U know what i realized just now, as much as i want to say that life sux, it never will and with all of the stupid shit that tends to make me feel like i should be somewhere else, in a different town with different friends, it never ceases to amaze me that, that never will and never can happen because i would be lost. I think of my life without Britt, Chels, Lani, chamber choir, barbershop, blue devils, and even VHS band and i realize that without all the secrets i have to keep and the different things that make me who i am, i would be no-one and its hard to say that i would be happier if all my problems were gone. Im sure only some of u will understand what im saying while reading this blog. And thats ok with me now more then ever because i DONT need everyone to know me, i DONT need all my problems to go away. If u really want to know me u could talk to me i mean im an open book but dont expect much unless u become a Brittney, or a Chelsea, or even a Leilani.   Wow!!! that totally came out of know where but it all is so true. I mean that Me in a nut shell, well looks like ill be going now comment if u feel need to, o and im extremly bored these days so IM me at pjporche@aol.com  Cya

      Aww...a nice day of working out  today i decided to do some working out as i do about once a week and even that litte bit is starting to show suprisingly. And in BDB last sunday i was able to hold my horn and thats a big feet for me anyway. Its just really cool because im going to get a gym membership soon and with tour and the gym and my workout tapes i will know longer be called a short scrony black kid. Instead ill be a short black kid hehe but yea enough of this...and that not to bad because in hawaii i wont be embarrased to take my shirt off. lol Well I havent sent the letter, but im about to emailed him(my dad) and im going to tell him that i need some spending money for Hawaii which im getting really excited about. and i think that whatever he can send me will help so yea. I think im going to throw my grades in thier 2 because im really really proud of them 2.  P Mult Med Desn A+ ROP Rorensic Sc B+ P Am Lit            B P US History      B P Chamber Choir A+ Teacher Assist    A Community Serv A GPA: 3.52 and theres the college that doesnt give grades out at the quarter Math 94(Algebra 2 at the college) B   but yea in American Studies which is the english/history class i just did about 250 points extra credit on top of all the work due so i have an A in that and in Forensics i raised my grade about 3% which was enough to bump me to an A-, but at the college i think i just failed my test so i probably have a C in that class but i might have to drop it because of a lack of time. but if i keep it up ill have a "4.0" for the first time in my life. YAY!!!and if i drop the class i can get a job!!!

      I read Chelsea's bog a min. ago and I was inspired. I was inspired because it take alot to bring up old things and to realize that talking is the only way to ever get past anything thats plauging you no matter big or small.   Our problem is almost identical, money is getting tight here 2 because my mom is on disability, and even though she says that she can pay for things for me, im involved in 2 many activities at school that I really need to adopt some form of independency. In realizing this i found that the mere 300 dollars a month isnt cuttin' it anymore. And what my dad doesnt seem to realize is that 4 phone calls and 300 dollars a month doesnt make you a father it makes u a donner. Ive been thinking about alot of things that my dad has done to me my mother and my brother. Maybe he didnt know how much they affected me but they did. Its hard to say what im going to do to resolve this i figure writing a letter would be the easiest but eventually im going to have to face it and it wont be easy. but ill get through it and its relieving to know that someone is going through the same thing thanx chels.

      OMG I cant believe its almost over...Its been a long time coming but there are currently only 5 1/2 more days of school. But there is still a lot of work to be done and the only class I really have to worry about is American Studies which conveniently counts as 2 classes. Right now its either kinda slack off and get the B's which would put me at a 3.66 or tuff it out and go for the 4.0 which I've never had before. Iono its really hard at the end of school to be like ok im gone do something and even though I've worked hard all semester everything depends on this last week. Lets count up shall we I've got my President mini-project to do, the video to film, a research paper to do and a portfolio to finish and then finally I will be done and off to a summer of occasional disarray but overall a little less stressful the school.

      U know what FUCK SCHOOL!!! its starting to get really dumb and all i can do all week is wait for BDB on my weekends. I have about 12.5 days left and im at the borderline between getting straight As or as, and Bs its just really dumb how at the end of the year your grade depends on the last project and all ur thinking about is getting out. And then there is another year...my god i dont even wanna go to school next year i cant wait until college and moving out and being on my own for once...arg neway enough of my bitching.  today at work was good all except for that stupid Dan guy but other then that it went well. I got alot done, i got my two good friends a job Chels, and Jean. Learned that my sister got a raise, and i got a raise and got promoted to night manager, all in all not bad somehow i feel very accomplished it feels cool to say im a night manager. And another raise should be coming soon. I love it. I like being good friends with my manager. I have 34 text messages from her and ive only been thier for about two weeks i havent even got a pay check yet. granted i've quit twice and i've really been working thier for over a year. Its still cool iono thats going good.   and tommorow NO SCHOOL its not like i wont be doing anything for it but at least im not going to be thier. Then its just SATs on the 5th and try to get a 4.0 next year both semesters then off to Fresno State so that i can march the bulldog marching band w/ Chris, Jon, Kendall, and Christina, fun fun.   I think thats all i have to talk about, cept IM A SECOND BARI NOW, o yea and Bass section leader in choir, o and Drum section leader in band, wow i feel really accomplished. finally people recognize my hard work.

       Just hang loose  just have fun  sippin on a drink and lying in the sun no use to fight it  it aint no use  cause when you in hawaii  you should just hang loose   This trip was really really really fun. I went into it with a wierd attitude, i was happy to be going but not excited but when i finally got thier it was so fun. I didnt see not one frowning face in our group and anyone that had a negative attitude going into it was completly changed by the end of the second day. I mean the people, the attitudes, the ocean, the weather all worked toward a truly wonderful trip i dont think id change anything about it except the second floor meetings every 2 seconds.  On a sadder note i had to come back and get thrown into everything right away. My mom had to have her surgery yesterday and i went to see her today. I wanted to cry but i didnt because i didnt want her to worry about anything more then she needed to. But thier where tubes everywhere and all these doctors kept coming in because she was in ICU (a part of the hospital where ur in a room where ur constantly monitored by nurses and stuff i believe its intensive care unit or something). It was just a hard thing to come back to first thing.   My grandma is having her breast cancer surgery on fri to get her cancer removed. I dont know it seemed like before i left everything was all right but now its all happening so fast and just the thought of living without my mother and grandmother brings me to tears. but in Hawaii i didnt have to think about it. Again money is tight and it just sucks but im working again and that seems to be relieving a bit of stress and not causing more oddly enough. But i think everything will be alright i hope BD understands how things are and just take a note that if ur one of the people that call me rich and think i have no problems know whats going on in my life before u say anything because im liable to go off at anymoment.   But its all good because for some reason singing that song puts me back in Hawaii with no care in the world so ill just keep on singing it and be alright.
