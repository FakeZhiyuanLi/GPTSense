      Goodness, I finally got G-mail! Well, I actually had to buy it from someone on e-bay, but whatever. It was cheaper then I thought it was going to be. I paid $3.99 for three accounts! What a great deal. I could have lived without one, but I really wanted to get one for Mike seeing that he needs one for his line of work. There are some really funny sites out there with people looking to swap g-mail addresses. What lengths people will go to, to get the name they want. Well, I guess I am in no position to talk, I BOUGHT one. How pathetic! Oh well....

      My stomach is still in knots from having to sit in a room with four cadavers. What are cadavers you ask? Well, THEY ARE DEAD AND PRESERVED BODIES!!! This was by far one of the nastiest things I have had to endure in my life. Man the sight was horrifying, and the smell, don't even get me started. I am taking a human anatomy coarse for summer school. To put it plain and simple, it's KICKING my ass, big time! I am taking a five month coarse in seven weeks, so I guess I should have expected it, RIGHT? NO, nothing could have prepared me for this. NOTHING!! I have been studying all day everyday this past month, and knowing this has to go on for another month is killing me. Oh well, enough of my bitching today.... Save some for tomorrow!

      What happened to boundaries between friends that shouldn't be crossed. Where did the trust go? Hmm.... I am starting to think very little of people and their morals. Would you ever pursue your friends girlfriend or boyfriend or even their spouse. I have come&nbsp;across this situation too many times this past month. Why? Why should I have to see it, not once, not twice but THREE times. What the heck!! It's getting kinda pathetic now. Not just pathetic but sickening.   My mom always said that, you end up finding friends that are like you. Could that be? Am I like them. Hmmm.... Actually they are Mike's friends. I met all of them through Mike, so technically Mike is the one that is like them.&nbsp;I pray to god that he is not like them. But, what if he is! No, he can't be. I trust him, I trust that he has more morals and ethics them that. Actually, I believe that we are together because we share the same belief's.   I have yet again, come across a sticky situation. I have been hanging around a group of people that I considered to be good wholesome people. Was I wrong! No, no, I take that back. They are good people, I'm not sure that they have the same morals as I do though.   I guess the attraction between a man and a woman is just too strong, even amongst good friends. How wrong is that! I would never, NEVER even think about dating any of Mikes friends had we divorce. Not that, that day would ever come. But seriously, I wouldn't even date someone that he was acquainted to. I don't know, it sucks, that's all I have to say about it.   Mike's sister is having her baby tomorrow. Well, actually she is going in to get induced at five in the morning. I wonder if she will deliver right away. They say that the first born always takes a while. I want to go bright and early to see my new nephew. I am so giddy right now. I could hardly contain myself.   I am going over to Lida's house tonight to have dinner and to talk with the gals. I hope there will be no trash talking, that's the last think I want to do. There&nbsp;are a lot of other important&nbsp;crap to worry about. Oh shoot, I have to go cook dinner before I leave. Mike will be home soon.

      I am officially out of summer school as of 9:45 a.m. this morning. I had my final exam today. It was a fairly easy test. I should just shut up before I jinx myself. It doesn't matter anyways, because whether I aced or failed it, I'm getting a B anyways. It kind sucks, because I was sure I was gonna get an A. One freakin' test score screwed my grade. Whatever, I tried. Who cares, anyways it's not like my patients are gonna ask me, "Oh, what did you get in Anatomy?" Screw it!! I should be happy with my B, considering the class average was 68%. Hahaha..... I did it! Finally, it's over. I'm getting plastered this weekend to celebrate. hehe.... I've been waiting for this day. I'm gonna party like there ain't no tomorrow!! Wooo-Hooo I'm so glad Melissa didn't have her baby yet. I would have been so preoccupied with the baby, I probably wouldn't have even pulled off a B, had she had the baby.

      I read a book today called "How to properly care and feed your husband," By the infamous Dr. Laura. This book has shown me a totally different side to this whole marriage thing. I definitely have to say, Dr. Laura's book has changed my life forever. I don't think I will ever look at my husband the same way. Man, I sound like some infomercial!! haha...   Anyways,&nbsp;we met up with the gang last night for dinner at Pepe's. The food wasn't that good, actually, it wasn't good at all! However, the company was good. We had fun just mingling with everyone. At times like this, I am grateful to have such great people as friends.&nbsp;We are getting together tomorrow night for "GAME NIGHT." How fun is that!! We are gonna play&nbsp;Mafia, Cranium, Jenga, and a whole bunch of other games! We're&nbsp;gonna have pizza and beer.... The perfect combo! Yummy yummy for my tummy! *slurp*   Ooohhhhh!!!! I can't wait any longer.....&nbsp;Melissa is due any day now, and we are just here waiting! WAITING!! They narrowed the named down to Brendan and Ryan. I really like the name Brendan.&nbsp;Of all the names they had chosen, I had picked Brendan and Tyler. I want a BABY!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;(&nbsp; Oh well, in due time..... What am I talking about. I can barely survive school as it is.&nbsp; Steve (my brother in-laws, brother) is flying in tomorrow from Seattle to see the baby's arrival. How sweet is that! I doubt my brother would do that for me.   I have to go study now. I'm just sitting here lagging so that I&nbsp;don't have to study. I have two exams left, one on Monday and one on Wednesday! Then I am done with&nbsp;summer school baby! &nbsp;

      Fridays are such lazy days. I wish I could just sleep all day. But of coarse I can't, because I HAVE TO STUDY. Oh goodness, one and a half more weeks of this. I can't wait. Hmmm...... What to do after summer school is over. Janette is planning a camping trip, but we'll see what happens. The last time I talked to her, she wasn't sure if she wanted to go through with it. I hope we go, it would be so much fun.  &nbsp;  Jason called me two nights ago, I missed the call. But, I called him back last night and had a long talk with him. I feel better that I got it off my chest. It wasn't so much that I had things to say, but more things I wanted to say in Yvonnes defense. I'm glad that, that's over.  &nbsp;  Oh my goodness, Melissa is gonna have her baby any day now. I am so excited, I can hardly wait. Wow, I think she is due in like 5 days. But then again it can come a little early or a little late. I'm hoping a little late, because I don't really get out of school until the 28th.&nbsp;I have my hardest exam coming up on the 22nd. So I guess as long as she has the baby after that it wouldn't matter, because I heard the final exam was&nbsp;the easiest of all exams. I&nbsp;hope!! I know this sounds so&nbsp;selfish of me,&nbsp;but I want to be available full time to help her out. Seeing that she might need me&nbsp;look over her and the baby for a couple of days. Hmmm..... I have to go to the&nbsp;Korean market too. I have to buy some seaweed and meat for soup. I guess&nbsp;I will make a trip tomorrow.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I'm gonna start by saying, what a big freakin' dork I am! I should really grow up...... I mean I am a married woman and all. Hmmm.... I&nbsp;have been studying my butt off all this week, so that I can go out this weekend. Why I even&nbsp;bother, I don't know. I like hanging out with my friends, especially when we go drinking. I&nbsp;don't think I am anywhere near being an alcoholic. But at the&nbsp;same time, I am a BIG lush! Once I start, I have to drink until I get drunk. Why, you ask? I feel like that's the whole point in drinking, to get drunk. God knows it's not because it tastes good.&nbsp;I used to hate beer until I met my husband. Beer is all he ever drinks.&nbsp;Besides the occasional&nbsp;shot here and there. Although, I have been noticing that I am getting a BEER BELLY!!! What the hell! No more beer for me... That's for sure.&nbsp;My favorite is Gray&nbsp;Goose vodka,&nbsp;yumalish! Gray&nbsp;Goose with tonic and a splash of cranberry juice, oh and don't forget the&nbsp;lime. How pathetic, I am sitting in the school library writing about how yummy alcohol is. I&nbsp;MUST be a lush.  &nbsp;  A week and a half of school left!&nbsp;Oh God, I&nbsp;thought this&nbsp;day would never come. Almost my entire summer, down the drain.... Argggg..... Oh well, I have to make sure that I&nbsp;do a whole lot&nbsp;for the next month.  &nbsp;  Last night, right before bed, I had a talk with Mike. I felt that it was time, otherwise I would have&nbsp;found myself uninterested in anything that involved him. Being mad at your spouse is one thing, but being frustrated is totally a different ballgame. When your mad you can argue about it, then makeup. But, when your frustrated, that's what it is, frustrating. I mean I am no angel, but I feel like I have been so patient with him for a while now and I see no changes. He's not doing anything horribly wrong, but at the same time he's not doing anything at all. I don't feel that he&nbsp;tries to have a relationship with me. It feels like we have flat lined in our relationship and have been at a stand still for a while. I told him that a relationship was a working progress. I want him to make a conscious effort to build a relationship with me. I want&nbsp;him to have the desire to have a stronger relationship. Seriously though, is that too much to ask for? I know he wants to just come home and relax after a hard day at work. But all night? Hmmmm.... At least give an hour of your time! I'm not asking to go out on dates every other night, or actually go somewhere.&nbsp;But I think the problem is, our relationship is superficial. It almost seems like he's afraid to get into a deep kind of relationship. I felt that we were having progress, but then we came to a halt. I understand that he's just not that kind of&nbsp;person, but at least&nbsp;try. I don't know how many times I've asked him to be more affectionate,&nbsp;but he always answers with, I'm just not that way. If he asked me, as many times as I asked him, I would at least make a conscious effort and just try!  O.K. I feel better now that I vented! I have to go study now.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>: (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      It's funny how we try to stay out of other people business, but sometimes can't avoid it no matter how hard we try. There was a misunderstanding that led into a confrontation amongst our group of friends. We try not to judge, but at the same time it's only human nature. I caught myself getting too involved in a situation that really had nothing to do with me. Well, besides the fact that it happened within our group of friends. The situation was basically about "infidelity."   My worst nightmare is that my husband cheats on me. I don't know how I would ever deal with that situation, had I ever had to deal with it. Already, I have had three friends that cheated on their spouses, that I know of. As friends we try not to judge, but at the same time, what does that say about their character. Should their cheating effect our friendship? Does that not have anything to do with our friendship? This is a question that I have been asking myself this past week. People tell me that it shouldn't affect one's friendship. That this is their personal life and that it has nothing to do with me. Why? Why and how does it not affect our friendship. Am I the only person that feels that it should and that it does. Morally, and ethically, it's wrong. I don't agree, not do I condone it, nor do I want to support the. Yes I am there friend, and should support my friends. But, at the same time does that not mean that I support what they did! Hmmm..... You have to wonder, where peoples morals have gone. It's almost a norm in today's society. How has cheating on your spouse become a norm. Why is it not a big deal anymore. One of my friends called me last night. We talked for almost two hours last night about what one or actually two of our friends. She told me that we had no business butting into their business. Eventually, she understood why we did what we did. But I still don't feel too good about having to explain..... Isn't she in a sense "butting in".... Oh well, it's water under the bridge now.. Whatever!  I trust that Mike would never cheat on me. I feel that I know him well enough to know that he would never. Although, that's what I thought about the person in question! I guess you can never be too sure. You just have keep your guard up at all times. I guess you just never know!

      Well, today is a very disappointing day. I've come to realize that there is just no hope for some people. Some people just don't get it, they are just naturally despicable. Oh well.....  This guy invited Mike and I to his birthday party. Come to find out, Mike's ex-girlfriend is gonna be there. Kinda awkward, but it should be fine. It's not like we've never hung out with her before. We're married anyways, so what. But, I do have to say, it must be bothering me somewhat, seeing that I am writing about it. Whatever....  Man, I have to clean the house today, it's getting kinda dirty. I feel like I clean the house every freakin' day. I didn't say that I did. I said it just FELT like it....   I don't know why, But, I HATE doing laundry. I wish Grace was here, because she LOVESSS doing laundry. (Something about the smell) What a freak!! That's right Grace, your a freak!  Glenn just called and told me that there is some major drama going on in the office. So apparently Janelle and the other two new workers all quit. So who does that leave Doctor with, NOBODY!! Had Doctor treated everyone better when they were there he wouldn't be in this predicament. No one is going to help him out in this situation; Not Jaime, Glenn, Kristy nor I. I can't stand the man. He reminds me of another Hui, so conniving, and always lying. Thinking about it now, I can't believe how alike they are. I wonder if Jim or Doctor is gonna call me to help them out. In which case, I will say no!! He totally screwed Jaime, Kristy and I on our last pay check. Whatever, if being petty about a couple bucks makes him happy, go ahead.   Mike and I invited over some friends for dinner tomorrow. I have no idea what I'm gonna make. Hmmmmm..... I want to keep it simple. I don't know... In any case, it should be fun!

      I love Thursdays, they are Fridays for me because I don't have school on Fridays. I am so sleepy right now, but, I have so much laundry to do. AAHHHH!!!! I need a nap... I can't even imagine how Mike must be feeling right now. We fell asleep at the same time but he had to wake up two hours earlier. Poor baby.... He must be dying at work. I wonder if he's gonna go workout tonight like he said he was. Doubt it.... I'm gonna go lay down for just a little bit.

      AAHHHHH!!!! I can't take it anymore, tests after tests. I can't wait until the end of this month. NO MORE ANATOMY!!!! It's fun and all, but, too much memorizing involved. Not too fond of memorizing anything that involves me having to stay up half the night punching myself. Kinda sad though, my brother will be leaving at the end of the month. It's nice having a family member here. It's so different with him here, I don't feel so empty. I always felt like something was wrong, something was missing. Hmmm... He'll leave and I'll feel like that again...   My brother and I almost got in a car accident this morning! It was so scary. We almost crashed into a semi-truck. I was shaken up for about an hour. I could tell my brother was pretty shaken up too, considering he was driving and all. He seemed kinda mad at the same time, I think he was mad at the truck driver. The driver was a retard, I don't think he even knew how to drive the semi properly. Whatever...   There was so much drama this past 4th of July weekend. The news was pretty shocking. I was sick to my stomach. But, sorry I can't say what it is. But I'll tell you this much, it's definitely Jerry Springer material!  Gotta go study!!

          Man, who knew going into the health services was so painful! This week I had to get a T.B shot, hepatitis B shot, terbuculoses shot, my blood drawn, and my eyes checked. I actually got my eyes checked a couple of hours ago, and I am at the moment temporary BLIND!!! They dialated my pupils, and boy was I hurting driving home. Come to find out, you are actually not supposed to drive until your pupils become of normal size because it screw up your depth perception. But, it's o.k cause' I got home in one piece. Thank God it's Thursday! Seriously, Thank God! See, I don't have school tomorrow, so for me Thursdays are like Fridays for most people. Hehe, Finally got g-mail... Man, was it hard to come by. Well, until I figured out you could buy one for dirt cheap. Well, time to do laundry, whoop-dee-doo!!! I wish clothes were disposable, wear it and throw it out after, so that there would be no such things as laundry!!! I'm being lazy... So what!! The gang is supposed to meet up this Sunday for a picnic for fourth of July, I wonder how the plans are going. hmmmm......       I MISS MY DAD!! I haven't seen him in four months. I actually had a dream about him last night. I wish I could remember my dream. I hate when I can't remember. This girl in my class last semester said that you should have a notepad on your nightstand, and write whatever you remember of your dream as soon as you wake up. It sounds interesting, but when I get up, all I can think about is going back to sleep....       My mom is going to yellow-stone national tomorrow with her friends for three days. I hope she has a lot of fun. She must be so lonely by her self at home. She's been alone for a week now since Hong-mee left for Korea. I hope everything goes well with her I-20 thing. Oh well, we'll have to see what happens.        22 More days left  until I become an auntie!!! My sister-in-law is having her baby on the twenty-third of this month... I seriously cannot wait! I am gonna be the best auntie in the whole-wide-world!
