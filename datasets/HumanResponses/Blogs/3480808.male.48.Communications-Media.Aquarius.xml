      You’re tall. You’re attractive. Sing well in whatever language. Sparse crowd at Café Rendezvous Doesn’t surprise me.  Your solo performance is on. Conversations puncture The cool ambience As I dig into some Unknown Korean munch.  Without a care in the world You’re on a roll singing like a breeze. Wonder how you manage this! Unconcerned and unmoved   Over audience apathy. I keep glancing at you Between bites and some business deals. You’re engrossed.  Believe you’re singing for yourself. If the audience don’t listen, so what? Are you drugged tonite To ignore the tasteless lot?  Don’t know, but can’t ignore. I ponder. An eye contact I try to see your soul. I don’t exist for you, I presume.  Table cleared and bill paid. I raise to leave towards door. Legs motor me to you. A warm handshake  I desire and you don’t disappoint. Neither met you earlier. Nor heard you till now. Just one look and just one song  Is all that needed to change me. Friends search for my  Hands to shake at the gate. I hide them in my pockets.  How can I allow them Rub away your fragrance Etched on my palms On this beautiful night?  Let them think I’m mad. So what? I don’t care. I’m in love with you Till tomorrow morning at least.  Don’t disturb me till then!   RAMESH KUMAR  The writer lives just behind the 12th century Qutub Minar, New Delhi , India.

      I have an appointment with God of death. Know it is certain, but know not when.  This is one appointment I can’t cancel Come what may when the call comes through.  Can’t tell my secretary to put Him on hold Saying “I’m busy in a meeting for the next hour”.  Neither can I complete my power lunch with The visitor from abroad at the posh restaurant.  He means business. I mean, God of Death! His  meter does not stop nor tolerate delay.  Can’t even kiss my sweet daughter at the Dining table as He gently nudges me out.  No way, he can tolerate delay on any count. If it’s time to go, you better go.  It’s unusual that I can’t fix my own Appointment with Him. It’s  He who fixes!  ‘Take it or leave it’ is perhaps his style. Who the hell is He to decide my exit?  Child, my father told before his own exit, The appointment is fixed the day you were born.  I never knew of it.  Neither you will know. But it’s there that we cannot decipher.  The Doctor who wrote your birth certificate Almost saw the writing on the wall, but seldom read.  As the nurse cut the umbilical cord linking you with Mother saw the same. But did not understand.  Every night I sit at desk to write X minus one day On a piece of paper and repeat the exercise daily.  Till I know the value of X, this meaningless exercise Will continue, I tell myself. Mystery is it not?  Know of any mathematics genius who can solve this Puzzle once for all to relieve me from tension?

      It is damp and dark As I roll over  Tangled wire-like stuff,  Kicking and keeling.  No one to my rescue, yet.  Piercing screams through  Parched throat bring no relief.  Written off already?  Cruel, if so.  How I manage in this  Cloistered leather cubicle  God alone knows!  She is restless,  Helpless. Like me.  I feel her, can't see her.  How long? I don't know...  Just a matter of days Before I see light and life. This is one room I can never return to.  She's longing to see me. So am I. It is a long wait  In this damp dark room.  I live on hope, She too. We're linked,  Yet, not seen.  It will be over soon. I wait for two things: A loud scream and A liplock with you, mother!
