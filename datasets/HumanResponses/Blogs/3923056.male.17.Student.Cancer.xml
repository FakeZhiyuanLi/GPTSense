       well this is my first blog, so it'll only be an appetiser..   but basically I just wanted to write about things that the normal joe blogs wouldnt think about..  i would more or less start off most of my blogs with a quote..that will basically sum up, or give a brief indication about what the blog is about..  anyway, that's my style..now for the blog oO   "leadership is not a passion to suceed, in order to lead others; but a passion to lead others to succeed"   i was wondering about this quote one day..and what made me think was the fact that why leaders actually become leaders in the first place? some would argue that the prestige of the title is the reason that they become a leader, which..in turn leads to many other things.  if any of the people that are reading this blog are thinking of becoming leaders, i sincely hope that it is not for the reason mentioned above..   leadership should not be about holding yourself highly above others..for the sake of them looking up to. of course, in most cases, that is given when you become a leader, however that is not what your goal should be once you are 'considered' a leader..   i strongly believe that when you become a leader..one of your main priorities should be to train others to get to where you have gotten! after all, the only reason why one really becomes a leader is because they have characteristics or beliefs that another finds quite admirable.   isnt the whole notion of having a leader come with an ambition to become like them?   i'll continue this much later..i've only touched the tip of the iceberg on this subject.

       read something fairly disturbing in the papers today... there has been an increase in the Department of Human Services (DHS) claims and requests for assistance reguarding child abuse or neglect. A 20% increase since 1980!! Over 37,000 cases. Child abuse or neglect? Is it because the previous generation of kids never learnt responsibility nor about parenthood? &nbsp; this is pretty serious. i mean, 20% increase since 1980. are the morals and/or beliefs reguarding responsibility degrading as time passes? or are we turning a blind-eye to these things? i think, as a society today, we should look at our collective morals and standards... ...urgently.

       You hafta wonder, what makes colour colour? i mean, there are two types of colour, reflected and "light" colour.  "light" colour thingies are the ACTUAL waves of EM going into our eye...but reflected, that's just weird.  if you think about it, say for instance, look at a tree. the leaves look green yea? but the leaves should /technically/ be called _anti-green_...because the leaf accepts every colour EXCEPT for green. that green is then bounced back into our eyes, hits our retina and goes to our brain...then thinking..."OOOH! it's green." but it's not really, just _anti-green_. in that case, everything would change.... white  would because  black  because it's actually accepting _nothing_, and  black  would because  white , because it's accepting  everything ...interesting ain't it? but then, how could we define "anti-green" if we didn't know what  green  was? cuz then every thing would be  anti  and nothing would actually be the real thing.... so that's why i guess we call "anti"-green..."green".  i'll stop now....i've got a headache. signout: Wez [undignitary]

       so, as many people /may/ be wondering....why choose "undignitaries"?. we'd like to attribute that wonderful and exciting name (okay, i may be exagerrating just a bit....just a bit though, mind you) to Tim Hughes song...ermmm...i dunno what it's called. but here are the lyrics!   Lyrics(unknownSong) { I will dance, I will sing To be mad, for my King Nothing Lord, is hindering, This passion from soul!  I will dance, I will sing To be mad, for my King Nothing Lord, is hindering, This passion from my soul!  I'll become even more _undignified_ than this, I'll become even more _undignified_ than this  Some will say it's foolishness, But I'll become even more _undignified_ than this. }  well there you go folks. after hearing that @ Hillsongs, Rusty and I (Wes), have decided to call ourselves "undignitaries", as we are undignified in the eyes of the world for our Lord!  keep it up folks....catchya all laters....and no. not all posts will be this long.  :D  meanwhilst. signout: Wes [undignitary]

        so here i am, talking about leaders again...woooo   usually..i would base the blog on quote..but tonight, i am in a state of quotelessness.. :(      so here i venture forth anyway..      leaders...   what are they there for? to teach? to equip? to assist?   if you said anything remotely close to any of those, give yourself a cookie.   my last blog i spoke about the passion behind a leader..   now i'll try and talk about the conviction that they should have.      first..for those who dont know what a conviction is, it can be defined more or less as a fixed, or strong belief that someone may hold about a certain topic.   in this case, it is the conviction of becoming a leader.      many things cause a person to step out and become a leader. one reason i would like to shine a spotlight on is that they could have seen or experienced something that made them come to terms with reality, and realise that something needs to be done.    now, if you can put 2 and 2 together, what i just mentioned above is the process which leads to a conviction.      when you experience something life changing..something so impacting, it will cause you to reassess what you already know, and lead you to a new understanding and acceptance for the issue. whether it be good or bad, if it was that impacting, it will lead you to a conviction.      this is the cause for many to step out and become different than others, a cause that leads to many different paths, both great and bad.   many leaders of the last century came to be through this way..because they saw something that really impacted them, and felt a conviction that somethign needed to be done. (mandela..lenin..guevarra..etc)      a pastor at my church, nicole conner called all christans to have a conviction such as this, and she called it 'righteous anger' for it was an disasistiaction with the current state of society and a conviction to be pro-active about it and change it for the better.      so why would a leader need a conviction in the first place?   well, remember how i spoke about passion? yeha, well believe it or not, that passion is probably not going to stick around forever, and when it's gone, what's gonna be there to encourage you? that's right, the conviction.   a conviction will lead, or relight the passion that will direct you to becoming a consistent and integrous leader.      i'm starting to repeat and lose focus..so i'll stop it there.   comments and queries welcome..bye for now ^^

       I've been thinking about this for  quite a while now and I've been trying to look at this from as an unbiased view as possible: Is Christianity the logical choice?      Let me  outline my findings so far:   Firstly, if we look at the world around us, from everything big to everything small, it is extremely hard to accept the idea of evolution - that everything we see and are, is just a result of random chance. In fact, chance would be slim. I read somewhere (this is just personal reading) that the probability of the universe being created like this was 10^592. According to some dude's law of probability (name started with B), anything over 10^50 is virtually impossible. So that would point to a creator, correct?   For example, look at atoms. Scientists have actually yet to discover what is it exactly that holds all those same-charged protons in the nuclei of atoms together. As we know, protons are all positively charged, wouldn't that mean that they would fly apart? But they don't. Scientists attribute this force to something called the "strong force" or the "big force" - more technically known as "gluons". What is it? We don't know. We can't see it, nor feel it, nor touch it, nor taste it, nor hear it. It's just there.      This is all i'm gunna post for now.....comments would be much appreciated....part 1 of many to come.      meanwhilst.   signout: Wez [undignitary]
