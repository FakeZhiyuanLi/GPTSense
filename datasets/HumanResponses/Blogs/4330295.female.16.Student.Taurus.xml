						   Due to the school season beginning again, (rather depressing is it not) and things being rather busy at the moment, my time to sit done and write has been rather short. Although I have been trying my best, and to those reading my story, I am working on the next post, so do not fear.  But I thought that I would make this blog so my reader's would know that I haven't fallen off the face of the earth and what not. I'll give updates and bits and pieces of stories  just to keep reader's occupied, in case I don't get the chance to post every day. I just thought it would be a nice touch.    Beware below it does contain spoilers of sorts to the plot of the story. Read with caution!  * * * * *      (Chapter 11)   Dumbledore quickly entered the library of number twelve shutting the door behind him, he seemed worried, upset even. The Order member sat in silence as they watched him enter and place himself in front of them, they’re murmur of whispers earlier, quickly deceased at the look on the face of their leader.  "There has been rumors of sorts floating about the plans Voldemort has acquired in recent events," The headmaster began, Snape shifted in his seat slightly.  "That’s good news, is it not?" asked Kinglsy from his seat.  "No, it seems Voldemort has gained some knowledge of an object that could very well guarantee our demise," Dumbledore said gravely, the old man took a deep breath before he continued.  "I’m afraid Voldemort is seeking the Green Flame Torch."  A sharp intake of breath was heard throughout the room, people turned uncomfortably in their seats, looks of confusion written all over their face. "Surely you don’t believe this rumor Albus, the Green Flame Torch is nothing but a legend, an old myth," said Moody.  "There is no way that an object that can kill thousands of people with a bit of green gas actually exists. The logic behind it is nearly impossible," added Tonks.  * * * *    Keep in mind that it is just a draft so it is not entirely perfect and it is subject to change later on. Enjoy and tell me what you think if you could. And I'm now off to work on the next post.

						    Me, being random and all decided that I needed to start a blog, and here I am doing it. I'm ignoring the fact at the moment that I have no idea what I'm doing, and just going with the flow.    This will mainly be used for status update on my fanfiction's and other related things.  Posting random bits of stories and such, nothing too big.  So after this I'm just going to go and see how this actaully works and all that, because me being me, knows absolutly nothing about computers.
