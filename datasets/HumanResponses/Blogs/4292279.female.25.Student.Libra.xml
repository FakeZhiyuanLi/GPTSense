      I'm not the new Jess Cutler, mainly because I don't get it in the booty, but that brings to me up a man by WSH III, he always tried that, I thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but exit only. He's hot, but not not enough to go up the poopshoot, thanks Scott....you were hot as hell, you only knew it is all.

      3 o'clock and I'm about to go to bed. My best friend in Seattle is funny, puking and shit because of pizza when I'm about to do the same because of wine...ha...ha...ha.. love her though. I hate the fact that it took her forever to leave her shithead man, I'm drunk and will finish this later...

      watching the beginning of 40 days/40nights and he's talking about how "it's" a black hole, a vast emptiness (different context for myself obviously), but the word and quote remain exactly relevant to my situation....my life or just my life with the bfriend. whew, close one, he just came out of the bedroom, better go.

      ....what am I like  60 ? I totally told the b-friend I wanted to stay in, but I lied, I wanna party. This sucks, mmmm....could I ditch, damn, he's already on his way over, guess not. Looks like its chicken, wine, and CNN until tomorrow when I go to see Johnny M in concert...again. Can't wait, I'll just bottle the party fever up until then.

      Hey girlie, sorry I haven't called you back this week, my phone bill has been outrageous. I'm sorry if I was mean to you, didn't mean to be. I've just been resting my foot this week and have been swamped with work. Forgive me! love, me

      8/20/04  I've never done this before, but it sure beats getting out the pen and paper for a traditional diary....so here goes...I just finished picking my cat up from my boyfriend's house, I had to leave him there all week because the maintenance people were coming for inspection and I didn't wanna pay the $500 deposit when I got him. The cat is happy to be back, still can't believe I bought the little shithead last October because he was on clearance, I hate cats! What was I thinking? A friend of mine living in Seattle is mad as hell at me (CF) because I guess I was drunk on Monday night and I think I was rude to her. I really don't remember anything except falling down and breaking my ankle, which I am still limping on in shame from my drunkenness from Monday. I haven't been home in 2 weeks and it sure is good to be here now, especially because my roommate left a note saying she's out of town this weekend. I'm so bored with living in metro DC, it's totally getting to me. I had a shitload more fun being in the Navy out in Seattle. I shouldn't have fucked that up, oh well. At least I got my Bio degree finally... I think I'm happy about that. Then there's my boyfriend that I've been dating for a year, he is totally in love with me and he bores me and gets on my last damn nerve half the time. I think I am just with him so I have someone there and a person to talk to when I come home. Now this relationship is at the point where we're probably gonna move in together next month, and I don't know how to get myself out. It's too late to find a roommate, expecially since I pissed my current roommate (AKA my best friend of 8 years) by saying I am moving in with said boyfriend. Parents and friends love the guy, and I know I do, I just have no patience. I wonder if I'm doing the wrong thing, but I can grow to love this guy as much as he loves me because I know there is nobody else out in this god forsaken earth that could put up with my shit and still love me....hmmm, shrimp is ready....
