      Well I did give you all prior warning that my temper was threatening to flair and flair it is about to. Banks!!!!!...bloody banks and the mystery surrounding charges...I called my bank this afternoon to find out the crater I fashioned during my 'fairly sedate' weekend escapades only to be informed by a very nice if not a little scared man on the phone, that for the month of June I have incurred charges of over 50 pound...HALLOW...That’s 50 pounds people....what the hell is going on?? When you consider for the most part 50 pounds will constitute 1 third of a lowly administrators weekly wage how can this be allowed to happen. I need to know why. Please tell me how the proletarians can get consistently SHAFTED by the entire banking establishment and nobody says a GOD DAMN WORD.  I know that it’s irrational but it just seems that the rich get to skip, fob, scam, bribe and cha-cha there way though banking legalities and yet still come out the other end with a lorry load of their untainted and un-molested cash. I am happy to work for my money this is not the point;, the point I am trying to make in a most un articulate fashion is, how can the banking establishment justify service charges and the elusive ‘administration’ charges when almost the entirety of their services are automated. It’s not like Penny Jenkins from down the road doesn’t get to buy her cat food because I am overdrawn (FOR A DAY) and the bank can’t afford to give her sayings. Administration charges, how’s about you leave us administrators the fuck along and give us all a break for a while and let the OC crew pay their dues for a change!!!

      I think I shall start the day off today with a well chosen quote. I am in a smidge of a bad mood and to tell you the truth i think it's getting worse. I shall maybe pop back in the afternoon and tell you all my woes but in the mean time...yer just going to have to trust me...k? Quote of the day:  Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.  Carl Jung

      It just donned on me how easily my chosen username could be misconstrued as  yet another ‘ I wanna be a bunny when I grow up or a centre fold just like my mom’  kinda sight, well I can assure you it is not. And apart from a couple of stints at drunken lap dancing, this site is all good clean fun. Thought I should let you know, rather than leaving all you tutle neck, peely wally freaks hanging. Ahhhh aint she nice!!!

      Feeling like proper poop today, first of all I woke up an hour early and broke my REM cycle, I had to stand waiting for my late bus in amongst gorilla rain (the really tiny stuff that gets absolutely everywhere and you can't guard against cause you'd look like a poof ), then I got roughed up on the bus albeit by the bus. Actually found myself snarling at the driver, Rocky mountain high wild cat stylie...it has not been a good day. Have to stop going crazy at the weekends as I think my mid week melancholy is probably caused by tail end weekend fall out. Have decided to combat the blues with a strict diet of junk and chocolate, just like the doctor ordered, I lie to myself like this often...you should try it it works. Also Kerry is all PMTing and taking exception to the fact that I raised the conflicting London arrangement thing with her, found out I got the T in the park tickets and they are drink free all day, wine and fodine with the rat pack, hospitality......AWESOME... I agree but completely impossible as you can't leave a fallen man behind and I can't leave Kerry to go to London Baby by herself...PANTS...tis impossible cheese cutting PANTS!! Got a few more things to do before EOP..talk later, thanks for listening:-)  Much love K8

      So it's my first Blog and to be fair i'm not entirely sure what the hell this blogging malarky is all about, but i'll have a bash anyway.   I woke up this morning with the tingleing excitment that could only mean one thing...the weekend had arrived. Of course the weekend had not miraculously arrived 4 days early, instead i had to accept the intractable truth that it was infact Tuesday and the working day was about to begin...iya...believe me it left a mark!

      Why is it that simple dreams of relaxed manual labour is taking over from previous aspirations of becoming a supa doopa popster with gajillings of money in the bank, or winning the lottery or even marrying an old dear in order to inherit their cash 2 years down the line. Why is it that the ‘strive for the sky’ mentality is just not cutting it anymore? Nothing changes regardless of what aspiratory sect you subscribe to, we keep tucking our tails in, running to the weekend only to do it over and over again. Sure we pick up scraps along the way but what we loose, is infinitely more precious, our ability to dream and the belief that things can be different, we can be different, our lives present and future can change for the better. I don't ever want to be one of the sad, who wishes their live away for a 2 week holiday, a new gas guzzler every couple of years courtesy of the 'company'. Where every free day, holiday or spare hour is used to ceremoniously extract the maximum amount of productive time from ever free moment...fuck productivity...what about joy, happiness, contentment, are these now simply forgotten emotions? So un cool now that they don't warrant attention or development, if so, then what a sad fallacious world we have created for ourself.
