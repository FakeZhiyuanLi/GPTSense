         mm in a situation of peril...a person would most likely follow his or hers instinct...being the first  action of relevance towards any given situation...but is following your instincts always the correct?, and does it lead a person towards the most ideal result...? In my opinion i would want to subdue that instincts are in most situations the logical approach...being that it is the first idea in which thoughts revolve around...i think following onez instincts result in a even more perilous situation prior to the decision..         mm recently mm ive kinda fallen for some1 not technically fallen....well yes i guess you can consider it falling...because i doubt anything will happen...not because i dont want it to go no where..but just the fact that i think shes still really into the other guy..which is reasonable...me being the idioit i am followed my instinct rather then thinking logically and told her i that like her in a less straight forward way... mm im hoping that no form of weirdness develops between us because...shez good friend if not more...      I think i should have listened to my friends/advisors   i dont like to assume things but like before i think i find my self walking up a dead end road...meaning i doubt in this situation that she has any feelings for me in this way... which is a key reason why they think i shouldnt have said anything...another reason is that im still very much convinced shes attracted to my friend and vice versa... and i dont want to make things queerer.. though i doubt that i havent already.. like my title says im caught in a pickle    mm life just keeps getting weirder and weirder... though it wouldnt be life without the weirdness or difficulties would it...? mm i guess this is all for now...i guess theres nothing else to do accept watch...Deep

      mm as usuall this post is going to be depressing because ive realized life hasnt really anything other to offer me and there isnt anything i can really do about it...so if you havent already realzied its going to be sad adn you dont want to read anything sad i advise you close the window...      ive managed to move on from eshana but im not saying it wasnt tough...i had alot to go through..i know its not good but i get attached to people when i begin to like them i dont know...im not an obsessive person i gues.../think.. i dont know i guess ive she didnt want to consider me more than a friend than i guess i cant really do anything except put my head down and move on...rite..      well i dont know...whats really going on...i guess i "think" i like this girl but i dont really know...she likes a friend of mine...buh i thought he didnt like her back...i should have known im alwayz wrong at these things...itz just become tradition hasnt it....  ye well a good friend but i dont know... i guess i have a thing for her...shes just unique... but im not going to make the same mistake as last time... im not going to say anything...no matter what and im sure im doing the rite thing...this way atleast they continue to like each other with out any interferance... or weirdness because of me...      just i alwayz make the wrong choices and even when i try to avoide them... i guess im just bound to make simliar mistakes like these for life...i guess itz because i follow my heart instead of my head... i guess i should stop followin my heart...and use my head...i guess i just need to time to ponder now....ive been sayin things but not following em...like my promise to the giant...sorry man...ive done it again...anyways...im gonna go probably gunna avoid her to now...and im probably not gonna go to stc with friends...so ye...i dont know there saying they wont go if i dont but thats not rite...they shuldnt just go for my bday...i dont want that...      any wayz...i have alot on my mind this is all for now..

      Lifes tough.. and technically it just wouldnt be life without the trouble.. but this has been tougher then average been having to face problem after problem.. and it got pretty serious  this year me having to have 3 surjuries done. im ok now or so everybody thinkz but I think itz getting worse..gettin more headaches now..and i fainted which is pretty scary but i dont want make a big deal out of it..Docs probably would just say itz tension head aches..    Todays been really depressing..this girl i like whoz name ill leave off the record for now...has cleared any misconceptions i had.. saying that there is no chance between us any more.. which is just killing me..mentally.. a few weeks ago she liked me but because of my stupid decision to act as a marter for a close friend who liked her aswell  she gave up her feelings for me because she felt i disregarded her feelings for him.. me and her talked it through before and we just talked as friends but i knew that she knows that i like her still... so i decided to ask her...being the stubborn person i am if there was any change from before..and if i had any chance at all with her..n she said she did not want me   i dont know what to do the obivous choice is get over her..buh itz really difficult because i really like her..but i dont think she understands that even though i tried numerous time to explain...she says just forget about everything and move on..simply..i doubt she ever did have any feelings for me..   im back to square one..which some off you know...and for some reason im close to breaking my promiss..im contemplating...once again even though i promissed not to..i feel compelled for itz the only relevant option to reduce my pain...im continuing with my writing..of poetry which i mite post later on in the future...but this is all for now..

      mm once again i have failed to coinclude the obvious and avoide any possible pain...ass predicted by my adivsors who im hoping will hold there " i told you so's" that i would not have a chance at all with the girl i like...mm its not ironic that she doesnt like me ..nor any other girls yet i still feel the pain which is something i have failed to neglect... though i did use a rather devious method i feel it was neccesary...to possibly avoide further vain to me...causing situations to possibly furthur become queer...   mm thanks to feww friends i have been able to discuss but hasnt really...helped...there isnt anything i can do nor any friends as in past situations...and i dont think i should discuss this with her because i think it would only make our friend ship weird....mm i think i fail to see reason for had i been able to think perceptively... i would have listened to my friends... though i understood nothing would ever happen because of her attraction to danny...its does not amaze me to be honest that she continues to thrive having feelings for him...   i think i should move on for it seems the only further logical course of action....though i could wait ...for if ever i had a chance...but i highely doubt it a moment as such would ever arise...i continue to struggle though it sounds very cliche-ish i speak honestly..when i say i feel the pain though im am certian that i shud discuss this with her... though indeed the girl i like is very understanding and very easy to communicate expressively to her i doubt i should create an akward situation... mm once again...my stubborn decisions have put forth problems hence...my pain  hope fully tomorrow will not show any signs that im experiencing any pain ... though i am in pain i do not wish to in any well make her feel guilty or any person at that...well see ..Deep.S
