       Ok I'm a procrastinator. I'm going to put off the promised post AGAIN until tomorrow. But there is yet hope for my underachievement in this and other spheres.  Remember, "The tallest blade of grass, is the first to be cut by the lawnmower."   That was a cool quote. I had to chuck that in.

       I would like to post tonight, as I have many things I wish to write. However, I need to study for my Greek exam. I really want to look at what I said yesterday in a bit more depth, and clearing up any doubts as to what I was saying. I also want to define the word legalism, as I use it, and as I have seen others use it. There is an interesting contrast.   Isn't it surprising how definitions can make such a difference in arguments and discussions? One can label someone else a racist, and they may not be one according to one person's definition, but are according to another's.   Interesting, but I cannot dwell on this at present.  Cherio.

       Here I sit, listening to Brahm's German Requiem, reading my Greek notes and cue cards, with young Jim reading horrible histories (a history series for kids) beside me.  The music is divine, the company relaxing, the temperature comfortable; pity about the Greek! Can I recommend Brahm's German Requiem to you all? Well since you can't reply right away, I will. It's a beautiful work.  Speaking of beautiful works.... Beethoven's fifth piano concerto is amazing. Why do I mention it? Well every morning I stick this CD in the player as I drive out the driveway. I'm beginning to judge how bad the traffic was by where I get up to. This morning was wonderful.  I only just got up to the second movement. The day before was terrible, I completely finished the concerto, and went onto the other pieces included on the CD.  Eccentric?   Just a thought my mother had today, (or was it my sister) anyway, it was a good thought. My mum (or sister) said that the church of today seems to emphasize Grace, at the expense of obedience. Grace is popular, but the obedience and holy living that comes with faith (given because of grace) is almost a no no. When you confront someone about a sinful behaviours, you are being ungracious, and 'legalistic', as if confronting sin has become 'legalistic'. Of course confronting sin can be done in an ungracious manner, but it can also be done in a strong, but gracious manner. Grace does not mean God has saved you and you can go on living in sin, and imitating the world. James 4:4 says that whoever is a friend of the world is an enemy of God. James doesn't really beat around the bush! Anyway, that struck me. It's very challenging.

       Well as Dan has already announced, last night was a sad occasion. The twits that run our country voted in favour of the Prostitution Reform Bill. What a bunch of godless men and women who lead us.  A passage from Isaiah chapter 3 springs to mind.  8 Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD , defying his glorious presence. 9 The look on their faces testifies against them;  they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them!  They have brought disaster upon themselves.   10 Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds. 11 Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them!  They will be paid back for what their hands have done.   12  Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.    13 The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people. 14 The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses. 15 What do you mean by crushing my people  and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.   16 The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles. 17 Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald." 18 In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, 19 the earrings and bracelets and veils, 20 the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, 21 the signet rings and nose rings, 22 the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses 23 and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.   24 Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding. 25 Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle. 26 The gates of Zion will lament and mourn;  destitute, she will sit on the ground.

       Two things made me mad today.  #1: Everyone know on the motorway, where the third lanes goes out the offramp, and it continues for a tiny way, but after that it's two lanes? Yeah that's the one. Well people who drive all the way up that and then push in the queue really hack me off. Obviously their time is more important than anybody else's. Basically it's called selfishness. #2 What is even worse are the selfish people who run red lights. Today, I had to wait two seconds while my light was green, because of idiots who kept going through a red light. (It wasn't as if it were short phasing either!). Not only is this selfish, but it is dangerous. So the person who does this is saying, my time is more important than your safety (and possibly life). Sick. Well it hacks me off.   On a more positive note I wasn't angry all day! I worked from 7:30 - 5:00 with two 15 minute breaks. I was pretty tired at the end. My shift was supposed to finish at 3:30, but the work just kept coming in. I am finding it really challenging, and really hope it will get easier once I'm familiar with things. I feel quite useless at the moment, and to cap it all off, I'm on my own tomorrow, after only three days training in micro. AAAAAAARG! Well at least time goes because there is so much interesting stuff to do.  Jono Camp came around tonight. He is doing the devotional period for youth group on Saturday night, so I was giving him a hand to construct his talk. We had a good time, and managed to fit in a wee bit of counter strike.

       Yay for Tuesday!   Work today was pretty hard out. I finished an hour late. There are so many new things to learn, and it's all swimming around in my head, and I get confused between all the different tests, and sample names, and do-dacky whatsits. But apart from that I'm enjoying the challenge. 'Twas quite funny this morning. On the local intranet, tehy had photos of all new employees at Tip Top, with their names. My photo had 'Bruce Flavell" attached to it. Thus Anita's rather random (notice the alliteration) comment.   Oh man: Today I sampled some of our whares. Very choice. Grabbed a fresh ice-cream crunchie of the production line, and ate it in the lab. My first ever. Very nice it was too. Also at the end of the day, I sampled a fresh 2L Signature Range Chocolate Eclair Ice Cream. And believe me, fresh ice cream (before it's really hard frozen), tastes a heck of a lot nicer than t'other stuff.  Well I'm hitting the ol' hay, because my shift is 7:30 start so........I'm out.

       Well today I started my work at Tip Top. I'm overwhelmed by all the new stuff I need to learn. 60% of the job involves microbiology stuff - which I happen to have never studied. :) hehehe. On the other hand it is very interesting, and time seems to go rather quickly.  It was cool however to see Anita at work. (Pity she was a snob and took off hehe just joking.) Not only that, but I met the mother of a boy I taught at Manurewa Junior School of Music. The funny thing about that is that I met another mum of the boys I teach at Nestle. It is indeed a small world.  Ok maybe depression sounds kind of major. Maybe 'down' is a more appropriate expression. Sometimes it's nothing you can point you're finger at. There seems to be no fathomable reason for feeling the way you do, but you do feel distinctly down. Weord.   Man I was reading the Jacob and Esau passage today. How Esau got done out of the blessing. Hardly what you would call fair. In trying to see God's "The older will serve the younger" fulfilled, Rebekah and Jacob went to deceitful and ungodly methods. It reminds me of Abraham and Sarah, not being able to have a son, and not trusting God in seemingly impossible situations. This reminds me of how often I try to use man's wisdom in getting God's results. 'Tis a no no. Full reliance on God is hard, and sometimes we say to ourselves "What are you doing God", or even worse... "Let me help you out God". But God is sovereign and his purposes are not thwarted. (What kind of a God would he be if they were!)

       It's late, and I'm tired and depressed, so I'll make this short.   Youth group was pretty alright tonight actually. We had a new girl along which was exciting. I should really talk about my vision for CIA sometime, but tonight is not the time!  Monday I'm starting my job at Tip Top, so that should be exciting! I look forward to it.   1 2 3 Read my blog, 1 2 4 Read my blog more.

       Dear readers of my online diary, I wish to apologise for my unashamed (pronounced with an 'id' at the end of the word)  punishing  of the English language in my last post. Special apologies to Alana aka Miss Dictionary.   The only exciting thing that has happened to me recently was going to the optometrist. Oh boy! My eyesight hasn't got worse since I was 18, which is good news. On the other hand, it could't have got much worse.......hehe.  Anyway, I had to get new frames because my old ones were busted. It's pretty expensive, and when you take samples home to show everyone. Nobody likes the ones you like, and they all like different ones, and so in the end, you just go with what you want.   Nato, you don't know how many times I have heard that pathetic joke "It's all greek to me." But ENOUGH ALREADY. It isn't funny after the millionth time. If someone tells you they are learning Greek. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT say "It's all Greek to me". Chances are they won't find it funny, and chances are even higher that your nose won't either.  Well I'm writing my entry one computer away from Jono, and he stole my thunder about TVs.  But I'm so with him. TV is evil to social gatherings. What's also scary is that we are often to gutless to suggest an alternative (like a game) because we think we'll get chopped down, when in reality, most people are just watching the TV because it's on, not because they want to. (There are exceptions to this.)

       Well, we're back. The car survived.    Punish  verb - 1. To completely finish off, destroy, use a thing.  2. To do serious damage to something. I introduce this definition, due to the excessive amount of punishing that went on during our time away.   We punished the track in semi dark conditions. We punished the "Pete and Scott's Hearty Tramping Soup".........(by the way, remember to bring the noodles. it's not the same without them....seriously.) Next we punished James and Malachi. That was awesome. Check out James 4:4. After this we punished a whole coal bucket filled with coal, and then raided some wood from outside, and punished that. Then today we punished Jono's shoes, and his tramping pack. All in a day's work. I think Strong Bad would have a bogus mathematical theorem for this. The amount of punishing that takes place, is directly proportional to the amount of pleasure one feels.  urlLink Bogus Mathematical Theorem   On a more serious note. It was awesome to get away and read God's word, discuss it, and pray. It was really awesome, and I am really excited about doing something like that again. We picked some real gems from James particularly, and it was really challenging. It was great just sitting near the fire, chatting, shovelling in copious quantities of coal. In the end, we decided to sleep in the room with the fire, even though it wasn't the bunk room. The rules stated that we weren't allowed to move matresses onto the floor, and so we had to sleep on the floor. But, better to be warm and have a hard floor, than be cold and have a hard mattress!  Went round to my mate Hamish's place tonight. We are studying Greek together at Grace Theological College.  urlLink Grace homepage  I'm a bit behind in it at the moment, so need to put in a bit more study. I will do some more tomorrow.   Faith and Prayer  Jono and I were chatting about this. If we really believed prayer was important and useful, we would do it much more often. It's a life principle; if you think something is worthwhile, and you genuinely believe it, you will spend time doing it. In the same way, if we have faith that God hears and answers prayer, we would take time to do it. I think it's similar to the whole faith and works thing. In the same way if you're faith is real, and you really believe that Jesus Chirst died for you, obedience will follow.    Welcome  Nice to see Anita, (and Hamish) and Alana on board! (or is it on bored?)

       Well well well!  Last night Jono installed a CD player into my new car. And then we hung and talked, so that is my excuse for no blogging! Very cool to have a CD player in one's car. I'll be cranking up the ol' Beethoven as I cruise around....hehe!  Well today is the day. me and Jono are cruising down to the Pinnacles. Hopefully the weather is only showery. So I went to the shops to get some food for our travels. Peter B and I discovered an awesome tramping mix recipe that is very hearty. Ok let me walk you through the preperations:-   Pete and Scott's Hearty Tramping Soup  Pour in two sachets of continental hearty beef soup for a cup into a billy. Add one thinly sliced onion. Add four cups of water. Heat and stir. Add a packet of crushed up 2 minute noddles, and a 100g packet of dried Continental Mixed Vegetables. Lastly add 150g of diced Verkerks Danish Salami. Continue heating until noddles and mixed veges are cooked. Eat muchly.  When you share this with others, remember it's name. Pete and Scott's Hearty tramping soup. Otherwise it's free to copy.  Well I better pack, because we are leaving when Jono finishes work at one, and that will be pushing it, so I'm going to be ready to roll. Please pray for safety, and also that our time will be used fruitfully in prayer and meditation!   God bless you all.

       I have purchased a new car yesterday! Daniel approved it which was good. Always good to have a knowledgeable person to check these things out. So me and Jono  urlLink jono's blog  are going to cruise down to the Pinnacles, and stay up at the hut there on Tuesday night. Should be a great time. We are hoping to pray heaps! Should be lots of time to meditate, and pray, so it will be super great.    Procrastination  A poster I once read proclaimed:- " Procrastination - Hard work often pays off after time, but laziness always pays off now.  " An interesting thought. Well suffice to say, I have procrastinated abominably this weekend. I should have been studying my Greek, but somehow it is Sunday night, and I have not looked at it period. Why is it that when you need to study something, your room always looks incredibly dirty. and you remember that you need to bake a cake for work, and that you need to play counter strike, and that shucks you could help dad learn a few computer tricks, and install MP3's on his computer. And then you open a drawer........ oh no, that won't do, it's a bit untidy. Oh well I'll just tidy this, and then I'll do my Greek. Oh good that's done, I will go and get a coffee and then i will start my Greek study. Excellent, while I wait for the kettle to boil, I'll twiddle around on the piano. Well I'll grab my coffee and continue practising for a little while. Mate! That's the phone. Oh joy it's great aunt Agatha's best friends cousins dog. Awesome, I'll have an hour conversation. Isn't it sad that procrastination dictates our times to us. I need to discipline myself. I can do it. I will do it nine times......   Seriously though. I am going to make an effort on my procrastination habits.  I will keep you updated... if I don't put it off.   Guy's Relationships  I feel sad that guys don't create deep relationships with each other. I mean, it's true for me. Up until recently, I have tended to make all my deep relationships where I talk about deep stuff with girls. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think that having relationships with girls is a bad thing, but why can't I have friendships like these with my male friends. This is something I want to work on this year. I think this could be a powerful tool for spiritual growth in us males. We need a real close brother to share everything with.

       Oh boy! It's great to have all these comments.... it means that you must be reading!  My job situation is as follows. I finish at Nestle on this coming Monday. Conviently (or perhaps arranged?!?!) I don't start work at Tip Top until the following Monday. Yes exactly! So tuesday avo, me and Jono are cruising down in my new car (subject to Dan saying it's ok tomorrow) to the Kauranga Valley, and strolling up to the Pinnacles hut for the night. Awesome stuff. I love getting away from Auckland. It gives one time to think, and just take things slowly - maybe life used to be like that before computers mobile phones, and so on. Speaking of mobile phones - Who is the twerp that invented them! I mean who wants to be contacted more than they already are! The ways to beat this annoying technoilogy which means we are at everyone's beck and call all the time are as follows:-  1) Don't have a mobile. 2) Have a mobile like my last one where the microphone and hearing piece both didn't work. 3) TURN IT OFF!  Far out! I was reading my passage from Genesis the other day, and found out that Abraham married again after Mrs Abraham died! I don't remember reading that before.   Question: Why do guys find it difficult to make deep freindships.........?  Shucks my mobile is ringing better go........

       Frustration of frustrations! I am having difficulty getting Madden 2002 working with my system. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARG! Some of you who know and love American Football will know and share my frustration. It runs like a dog, which the cheat has beaten to a pulp, and chucked the poopsmith's way. It's not good. Any ideas please email me! It's like you load up the game and it's a slow load time, and then in between menus it's like C64 days again (slow) but once you get INTO the game, she runs like Strong Mad chasing after Strong Bad after a swift kick from Mr Bad.  urlLink Strong Bad kicks Strong Mad  Oh well.   Romans 7:21 - 25 So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. For in my inner being I delight in God's law; but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God - through Jesus Christ our Lord!   Yep, that sums my thoughts up so well at the moment.  :(

       Well my oh my! Look at the time folks. Since the day grows old, I shall make this quick, otherwise the consequences  tomorrow shall be of an unfavourable nature.  Reasons for this tardiness in my writing are few, and good reasons are even fewer.  Reason for taking this long to write:- 1) Had to get a new hdd, so Jono could take back the one he had loaned me.  2) Had to reformat hdd, install dual boot Windows 98 and XP.  3) Had to configure hardware and all that.  Good reasons for taking this long to write:- 1) fhqwhagads was trying to play like - U NO ME!  urlLink Don't get this into your head LouP!    So anyway, hopefully I'll be better prepared tomorrow. On a scale of 1 to awesome.........have a super great day!

       Read this passage from matthew this morning. I noticed a verse I'd never noticed before. After Jesus healed the paralytic, this verse appears:- Mat 9:8  But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men.  It puzzles me. If you don't understand why I'm puzzled, don't worry, because I don't really want to explain it, but if you do, let me know what you think! Is verse 8 from the perspective of the crowd? or the writer?   Man.... today was choice:- At work people kept bringing me samples to eat. I was given a roasted almonds (the ones that later go inside the chocolate). NICE STUFF. Also was given some chocolate almonds - covered with milk chocolate followed by white chocolate, and finally the roasted almond. And then there were the Oompas. I think I'm getting fat! I'm going to miss work.... mainly for the people - HONEST! I really like the company in the lab. There are spme real nice friendly people.

       Ok, a few matters first.  A) Who's the dude that moves to the beat? THE CHEAT, THE CHEAT! Who's the dude that made Scott's blog super great? JO NO JO NO. Thanks Jono - you're the man.  urlLink Cheat Theme Song   B) Got asked for an interview with BOC  today, but I've turned it down, as I'm almost certain to go to Tip Top.  C) I had been seriously considering going to Master institute (a Christian teacher's training college), and I had an interview with them last week. I decided against it, but today they offered me a position marketing, and teaching in their "A Year in the Son" course, which is I believe a worldview course. This would help me pay for my tuition fees, and they said it would lead to the possibility of me being appointed as junior lecturer for the course in 2004.   This all goes to show one thing. God is awesome. I have been struggling to find work, or something to do for months, and when I did find a job, it was at Nestle, doing something that had nothing to do with anything I'd studied. But I believe God has been teaching me patience, and is saying "All things in MY time, not yours."  On the other hand, I have to admit, I don't feel close to God at the moment. I seem to know stuff in my head, but don't feel it in my heart. Another thing I find interesting, on a different but related (hehe) field: What is faith, and how much do you need? Ok let me explain before everyone starts bashing me........  If I really had a full-up faith, I would never doubt anything, but how many people could say that they never doubt? When we doubt, that is a lack of faith, but is it not faith that saves us? So if we lack faith........are we unsaved? My comfort is this:-  Mar 9:24  Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

       Well Well!  I had a rather interesting start to this morning. Me and my mate Jesse had to go down and cook breakfast for the Men's prayer breakfast. So we got down at church at about 6:15, and made stuff. Oh yeah. It was kinda funny when I drove down, because I noticed some writing on my back window. Some lemon had written "0 - 60 1000 minutes". Now I'm quite fond of our old silver streak, so when I finally decifered the code (it was in three lines) I was rather perturbed. It's a good machine..... although not known for it's speed, it still is a cool car. Well, I'm off to get ready for church now.  God bless!

       Just a quickie today folks!  Had serious lack of sleep last night. The neighbours next door (neighbours generally next door, but I was attempting to differentiate between neighbours as in "Who is my neighbour?", and what we generally think of as a neighbour today) had as massive as party. Well it was not so bad on the music front as the bass boom boom boom only went until about 12:00, but it was the yelling and shrieking that was really annoying. The last thing I remember was at 5:20 in the morning a young guy shouting "Help help im stuck in the fu***** window, someone get me out!" Well needless to say, I ignored his cries for help, although I thought of many potential ways I could in fact   help   him. Most of these methods involved pointy sticks, steel-capped boots, fire or directed pressurised water. Anyway that's as maybe. I was consequently late for work, as I slept in, and I think people found me rather grouchy during the day. I really didn't treat people nicely today, and found myself snapping at my family where normally I would have been fine. Hmm, more sanctification to take place methinks.

       Wowsers! Keep the comments up!   Just a quick note to those of you commenting about my early rising. No I did not get up and post at 3 in the morning. For some reason the clock is rather whimsical, and decided that 3:00am sounds better than 9:00pm. Yeah beats me too.  Awesome day today. I got offered a job at Tip Top! So I'm going to give my notice to Nestle on Monday, as the pay is substantially (read heaps and heaps due to very poor current pay) better, and it is a permanent position, unlike the three month contract Nestle has me on. Ok money isn't everything, but when you aren't earning much, and are trying to save for a house, the more the merrier.  Which brings me to a prayer concern. Although I am delighted to have a permanent job, there is a concern for me that I may not be able to go to Japan for an end of year missions trip. I have already committed myself to this trip, and I really feel like I should be going. There is the possibility that I may get this time off, but it is not definite, so I ask that you would pray for that. God is good, and if he wants me to go.I'm already there!   Question...... why do I always turn the radio on when I get in the car instead of praying. Weord.

       Oh well here goes - boldly into new territory.   The question "why" needs to be asked, as it does for everything. For what purpose. What does this achieve? Well I had a think about it through the day, after being persuaded by others to get my own blog.  There is of course what I would call the Strong Bad reason.  urlLink Strong bad's new hands  This could be used as the megaphone to declare 'I am still awesome.............seriously."  On the other hand as I thought a bit more, I knew that most of you already knew I was awesome, so there seems to be no need in that department. (hehe)   Seriously though, as I thought of a purpose for this, I came up with one which I think is good. As well as being a journal for my thoughts, I intend for this to be a spiritual journal. As I discover things, and as God reveals them to me, I will write them down. That way, as I look back, I can see what God has done in the past, and look forward to the future, knowing the God who has been with me in the past will continue to be with me.  As I thought further, I realised that this is not an easy commitment. I'm one of those keen starters lacking in follow-through. Oh well, let's see what happens. I can't promise it will be a thrill a minute, but it will never be a monologue in minute detail of my spectacularly mundane existence. I'll try to keep it as interesting as possible and spare you the pontificating, and pick out the gems.   Well perhaps it's ridiculous of me to expect any readers. But to those of you who do. I wish God's blessing upon you, and I pray that even a little of what I say may help you in some small way.  God is great!

        Mum  I have some disturbing news. My mum has been diagnosed with breast cancer. We received the results of the tests today. So now it is a matter or deciding which surgery option to take. It sounds like surgery will give a good chance of getting rid of it permanently, which is good, so please pray that God will work mightily in this situation. Our God is an awesome God, and can do all things.    This and That  "That shirt I'm wearing is like this shirt you are wearing." Sound wrong? Well at Greek class we learnt about near and far prepositions like that or this. It's something that I had never thought about before, but knew when I heard it done wrong (as above). It was kinda weird to think about it actually.    Snippets from Evidence Magazine No.6   urlLink Maxim Institute   Some of you may not realise that at current birth and immigration rates, the NZ population will peak in 2044 at about 4.64 million, and then start declining. Mainly due to the fact that people aren't having enough children. We are not even replacing our population, and are only growing because of immigration. (What happened to the be fruitful and multiply? Are we selfishly disobeying God's commandment?)  From an article about NZ's population time bomb:-   "......The 16,410 abortions in 2001 alone are equivalent to the current population of towns like Tokoroa or Ashburton. Put another wat, they represent 607 classrooms each containing 27 children who will not be starting primary school in 2006."  "Australian National University demographer Peter McDonald puts it down to the effects of gender equality. 'If women are provided with opportunitiesnearly equivalent to men in education and market employment, but these opportunities are severely curtailed by having children, then, on average, women will restrict the number of children that they have to an extent which leaves fertility at a precariously low long-term level.' "  "The Institute fo Economic Research's April report last year warned: "An older, less productive population will be a principle cause of a downward trend in economic growth."  So much for the rubbish about overpopulation.    Speaking Out   urlLink Dan  is hacked off with Maori claims. he speaks out... a little apologetically, but speaks out nonetheless, and it is good to have him back blogging again!   Lately in the Herald, I have noticed a disturbing trend. When people write in from a Christian, or right perspective, others reply saying that the Herald should not print such letters. I believe we will see our freedom of speech lost unless we fight to protect it.   Why do we feel scared as the Christian right/conservative to speak our mind about things? It is because we are slowly but surely being cowed into submission by what is 'politically correct' and for fear of being branded. Well enough already! We have a right to say what we think, just as much as the hand wringing, pot smoking, sandle wearing sections of the population. And I for one am sick of pretending I agree with people by not saying things like they need to be said.   Homosexuality is an utter peversion of God's intentions for sex. It is disgusting. An affair is adultery, and falls into the same category. The people who voted for the prostitution reform bill are godless, and need to repent, or they will face God's eternal wrath. Radical Maori need to pull their heads in, and work for a living like the rest of the country instead of bleating on about past injustices, when 7/8 of their ancestory was on the side commiting the injustice. Maori and Pacific Islanders do not deserve to get into university on lower grades than people from other cultures. This is racism. People who murder do not need counselling or rehabilitation.  People who use welfare as a matter of choice need a kick up the jacksy, and deserve to starve.   I am fed up with the rubbish we have to put up with in this country, and I will not remain silent about it.  How dare people turn this country into a God-forsaken place. Christians arise!   (I do not apologise for this post and will not bow to political correctness. I am entitled to my views, and you are entitled to disagree with me. But do not ask me not to say these things. it is my right of free speech.) God bless New Zealand!

        The TV Psalm   Given to me by Andrew Macpherson some time ago. I thought at least some of you who haven't seen it would appreciate it.  The TV is my shepherd, I shall not want, it makes me lie down on the sofa. It leads me away from the scriptures, it destroys my soul! It leads me in the paths of sex and violence for the sponsors’ sake. Yea, though I walk in the shadow of my Christian  responsibilities, There will be no interruptions for the TV is with me. Its cable and remote control,  they comfort me. It prepares a commercial before me; in the presence of my carnality; It anoint my head with humanism, my coveting runneth over. Surely laziness and ignorance shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house watching TV to the end.   Allan's Blog  My friend Allan now has a blog.  urlLink Allan's Blog     Time  Is too fast for me. Thus I cannot post. For in 7 hours I must arise, and set about my business. Isn't it amazing how fast time goes. It's not so long ago that it was this time last year! And when you think of it, doing that 70 odd times isn't really that much longer than an hour or two. Life is short. Eternity isn't. Do you know God?

        Person of the Week  This week person of the week goes to none other than Peter Boyd. Had a very encouraging cuppa with him the other day. Was good to catch up and encourage each other about respective ministries. I happened to mention how often all I ever get is criticism of the way thing are done in my particular ministry, and nobody ever  comes to encourage. Pete said that it's the nature of leadership to get mainly criticism, and that we just need to get used to it. He told me a story where a young guy once asked an elder "Am I doing it ok?", and the elder said "We'll let you know when you aren't". It's kind of a funny story, but a sad attitude behind it. The only time you hear from people is when things aren't ok. Well from our conversation, I'm going to try to be more encouraging to people in leadership, because I know how much it can mean to get some positive feedback.  Encouragement  is so important, but so often ignored.   Photos From Guys Retreat  Check em out!  urlLink CIA group site    Petrol  I am doing an analysis of economy of the petrols of different petrol stations. I will let you know when I have some firm results. This could take some months.    Desire to Flee  Lately I have had the desire to flee all obligations, and responsibilities, and go hiking for months on end in the wilderness. I'm sick of things. I want to get away from all the busyness of the city, with the pulls of materialism and worldliness, I am wearied by the constant struggle of day to day life in a heathen country, I want to escape, but I know I must stay and fight and uphold God's standard in my own spheres so people may see Christ. Isolationism is not the answer, although sometimes it is all too tempting.   Procrastination Revisited ...... Finally..... Seriously.  I'm still a procrastinator, and I still don't like it. Example: I've been meaning to clear my desk this afternoon, but I have found many other important things to do. Ask me what those important things are and I can't tell you. A lot of nothing it seems. I don't want to be one, so I'll keep trying to not be one. In fact I'm going to clear my desk now. Later.

         Beautiful America   The man on the television said I need to drink this, and sleep with that, in order to be cool. And you know that I would do almost anything, to be like that guy on  TV. I know that if I had just the right outfit and hairstyle that could be me. Don't you know you can't be cool if you dress dumb, I need to have that 'cause everybody's got one. I think I'll start smoking, that would make me intellectual, that's what I've always wanted to be. I need to lift weights, That would make me more sexual, and that would be good for me. In America it's wonderful, all you have to do is fake it.  Own anything you want, all you have to do is take it. Live for today, don't think about tomorrow, have a good time in AmericaGomorah. What are you looking at, you better not make me mad.  I'll drive by your house and shoot your dog, and mom,  and dad. I don't need you or the Bible or anything to to tell me what is the law. With a good enough lawyer I can do anything in Beautiful America I want to be in America, Okay for me in America everything's free in America for a small fee in America.   I was listening to this song by Five Iron Frenzy today. Maybe NZ could feature in a new verse. 10 points to someone who makes a cool verse that has something about the prostitution reform bill in it. Haha it's not worth it I know, too much time.

        Doctor Visit  I went to the doctor today. I am now $50 poorer ($18 for the doctor $30 for the medicine). What makes me slightly peeved, is that I have been for this problem about six times (or was it nine times) and spent hundreds of dollars on it. I have a bacterial infection, which keeps reoccuring, and is resistant to some certain antibiotics we have tried to use to get rid of it. Not good.   Comments Amok  What is wrong with the comments? I mean Fridays post was registering '0 comments' but had two, and Tuesdays registered '5 comments' and had 3.  Now I'm really cheesed off.    Congrats  Congratulations are in order for Anita! I was reading the intranet news today, and it looks like she's got some kind of promotion. Well done!   Book  I feel like writing a book. At the moment, if I did, it would be entitled:- "In defence of good old fashioned blokes." Or perhaps I could call it "Real Men - A dying Breed". Or even "MOAs - Men of Action - a dying breed - just like the bird, but back from extinction. Or maybe just "Why We Need Strong Godly Men". Part of this is as a result of my frustration with the increasing number of bolshy (read - obstreperous) young women there are around. But the thing is many of us guys don't like confrontation, and just capitulate at the first sign of it. To all those lovely women who read my blog, my apologies. I am not tarring you with this brush, but merely commenting on a trend I have noticed. Weak guys, Strong women. Or should I say strong women, weak men?   Mind Siege  Buy it! Here is an excerpt from a chapter called "The Wisdom of Man".  "Today's philosophy of education is obsessed with self-actualization, self-image, self-love, self-sufficiency, self-esteem, self-satisfaction - self, self, self. .......Traditional Christianity, Mr Rieff observed, made great moral demands on believers. Its goal was salvation; consequently, it exhorted believers to 'die to self'; repent of sin, and cultivate virtue, self-discipline, and humility. Today however, wrote Mr Rieff, 'psychological man' is rapidly shouldering Christian man aside as the dominant character type in our society. For psychological man - the offspring of Freud and his ilk - life centers not on the soul, but on the self.  Psychological man rejects both the idea of sin and the need for salvation. He aspires to nothing higher than 'feeling good about himself.' Mr. Rieff summarizes it this way: 'Christian man was born to be saved; psychological man is born to be pleased.'    Musical Composition  I fancy myself as a bit of a composer. Purely instrumental at this stage, but we'll see. I haven't written much lately, which is something I would like to remedy. Nothing like working out a funky rhythm. I would love to record some stuff one time, and Jono's offered the hook ups with soud gear so that's the ticket. I'll let ya'll know if I ever get it done.

I have been wondering who this person is. I don't know anyone who uses one, and yet they seem to read my blog, making up 1% of the traffic.   Mind Siege  Started reading a good book called Mind Siege. The first chapter was set in 2010, and was scary. It was trying to show what could happen if Christians continue in their 'live and let live' philosophy, instead of getting on in the world and changing things. Will tell you more as I proceed in this book.  God bless you all.

        Collective Ignorance and Meetings  or  "None of us are dumb as all of us."  It's funny I should post this after attending a very useful planning meeting for the Japan Cafe on Saturday. But this is not a criticism of particular meetings, but just a general comment. So ain't nobody take some offence. Anyway, I was thinking about meetings. Seems to me that many people tend to think of meetings as bringing the best ideas and the best of people together, and coming up with a better result. You know the old saying that goes "Many hands make light work." But it seems to me that this need not be the case, because there is the old dichotomy of sayings. One the one hand, "many hands make light work", but on the other, "too many cooks spoil the broth." Could it not be possible that fallible sinful humans meet together, and their worst ideas combine to produce the worst outcome? Sure I hear you say.... look at parliament. Exactly. But then did I ever say I thought democracy was the way to go. We need a Scotocrocy. The rule by Scot. But that is by the by. My theory on meetings is fairly simple really. A short meeting is a good one. Not only that, the fewer people the better.    The Flood  The flood was a localised one. It was not worldwide. It was not even factory wide. It was localised to the chemistry and microbiology lab. Oh yes that's right. The laboratory flooded today. Did it flood at 2:05 when I would have been gone? No not at all. Did it flood at 1:55 when I was just about to go? Ahhhh.... yes. I was washing the dishes when one of the technicians commented that someone had spilt water over near her bench. It soon became clear that it was more than a spill. That became clear when it started gushing out from the bottom of the wall on both sides, and coming out the lino. Yes it was spectacular. Apparently a pipe had burst inside the wall. Well we got an engineer down, who took a look and said. "Oh that's not good." Yes exactly. I can say that and I'm not an engineer. And then he said. "It's coming from inside the wall." Well so it was. But he was actually quite a legend, and managed to shut the flow off by going off somewhere. Well me and one of the other technicians scouped it up in containers into a big 20 litre bucket. We kept a tally, and worked out after the clean up that we had pulled up over 500 litres of water.

       Ok. I need to set a few things straight. My feathers have been ruffled due to a few fowl accusations which have been flying about. These accusations have mainly been centered on the size of the poultry I consumed last night. Accusations have been made indicating the paltry nature of this specimen of poultry. Now I don't really want anyone thinking I'm chicken or anything, so I have a message for those turkeys. It was a big one! So stop hen pecking me.    Hmm I really had to get that out of my system. Sorry. Well I'm about to go to bed, as I'm on the 6:00 shift this week, and as up until recently, 5:00 am hasn't been on my list of reasonable waking hours.   Oh yes. Welcome to Priscilla! Even though you mocked my butter mince.   (Note to self - remember to post about collective ignorance and meetings.)

       Just a quickie tonight. Man I was so hungry tonight. I went to woolworths, and bought a whole chicken and a bread and some macaroni cheese. I got home and punished the whole chicken! I hope it wasn't gluttony, but man I was so hungry. Well I'm on to the Macaroni Cheese now, and then I'm going to do some Greek study for the exam on Monday. So for those of you who remember me in your prayers, please pray for clarity of thought on Monday.   Well the fires a goin, the bean bags a sittin next to it, and the kettle is a singin (well it would be if it had some sort of whistling aparatus attached to it), and the Greek notes are a callin me. I'm sorry folks but I'm a gunna leave you.  Isn't it amusing how this blog has degenerated into fireside chats with Scott over his eating habits. Ok I'll try to remedy that from now on. More other stuff, less food talk.

       I made butter mince for dinner last night. Yes butter mince due to the fact that I had no chicken to butter. Sad but true. But actually it tastes quite nice.  Today was an amusing day. I woke up at 7:05. Well more like I opened one eye thinking shucks why hasn't my alarm gone off yet and looked at the clock. And then was out of bed in a shot. I yelled at Jono (who was in bed) "make me a sandwhich I'm running late! I quickly got clothed, found some glasses, grabbed my key and ran out to the kitchen. There was Jono wrapped in his duvet buttering me a sandwhich. It was comical. I grabbed the sandwhich (telling Jono he was a legend), jumped in the car and carefully stopping at Stop Signs set off to work. Well I prayed to God, "Please don't make me too late", not that it was a real major or anything. Anyway the traffic was amazing, and I only got there 7 minutes late, which was a relief.  Mind you I had to have two of those fancy French Moritz's today since I only had one sandwhich. Gutted. having to eat ice cream, what a chore.   Hey people... you know how there is a comments button? Yeah the thing in orange writing with underline. Well if you click it, you can write a comment. Hehe and SUBTLE is my middle name!  Oh that's right! The whole point of the post. I got transcribed today at work. Since we are a approved lab, we must minimize our transcription errors. For instance today I got transcribed for not writing a dilution factor for some water I was testing. What's funny is that I don't really care about it. But it can be a source of contention, because it is the other lab staff who in fact do the transcribing. So as you can all imagine, an innocent transcriber can become the subject of backlash transcription, and things can get pretty nasty. I was told about an incident where one of the staff (let's call them lab technician #1) transcribed another (let's call them lab technician #2) for a seemingly innocent mistake. Lab technician #2 then transcribed lab technician #1 into next century for various different mistakes. Since then lab technician #1 has not transcribed lab technician #2. I wonder if  my apathy will have the same effect?

       Went for a bit of a tour of the factory today. Saw some bits I hadn't seen as yet. It was pretty weord, because I walked into a couple  of the freezers. In one of them, my nose started to feel funny and I could feel moisture in it freezing which was real weord. I asked how cold it was and was told -40. Wowsers. The people who work in there are only in for 15 minutes and then get a half hour break from work in the freezer. It was so cold that when I went outside, the breeze felt like a tropical one.   Well that's all that was really that interesting. Oh that's right. I had a choc bar, and a Moritz (that fancy weord named caramel one). I think it might be "Glace avec un nom français drôle.".

       I was going to post this last night, but I never got the chance. However, I'm off sick today (cold symptoms), so I have managed to get up off the old bean bag to bring you this post! How's that for dedication to the task?  Well I had some very interesting news, and as I promised honesty as I began this blog, I shall share it with you. I received a traffic infringement notice on Sunday whilst picking my Aunty up from the airport. I travelled left through a stop sign intersection like it was a give way.  So I got fined for it. Fair enough too. Well the police officer was very pleasant, and even let me off for the fact that I din't have my license with me, which I thought was pretty decent of him. Funny thing is that this whole incident got me thinking. As I told a few others, they were like yeah well that's what I do! Others made the excuse that as long as no one is coming and you can see it clearly on these stop signs, you should treat them as a give way. But I think not. It's a law of the land, and not matter what we think of it we should obey it, so in essence I believe it was jolly fair I got pinged for breaking it. Isn't it funny how we look upon somethings as really bad (like I do on the red light running issue) and think other things aren't so bad, like giving way only at stop signs, and driving past ten on our restricted, or driving with pasengers on our restricted. It reminds me of the way we so often (myself included obviously) treat God's law. For example:-  Those who break the commandment that tells us not to murder or commit adultery are somehow worse than those who only break the one about stealing, lying or breaking the Sabbath. Funny thing is that although  we  make degrees of sin,  God  makes it clear that ANY sin is enough to disqualify us from his presence. So that's what that road incident reminded me of.  Well yesterday I went round to my next door neighbour's place. Graham Paton (who was my boss at Red Cross) invited me round to have a chat and catch up with what I was doing. It was so cool. We had a really good chat and catch up about things. he is really a top rate guy.   Today I went past Peter Warner's place on the way home to get some panadol for my headache. I saw him out by the road, and stopped in for a chat with him. We talked about youth in the church, the boys camp at Emmanuel which is coming up, and so on. He gave me a stack of panadols for my headache which was really cool.   Well tonight I'm cruising round to my nana's because it's her birthday, so that should be awesome!

       Alana's 21st was very very cool. She had organised a barn out Karaka way, and we all had to dress up in clothes from the 1920's to 1960's. Everyone got into the dress part..or should I say everyone save Dan. hehe.  Well me and Jono went shopping for our clothes togetehr. The original plan was to get suits and be 1920's gansters, but there was difficulty getting jackets that allowed Jono's muscular shoulders movement, so we gave up on that idea. So in the end we decided to get corduroys. I picked up a pair of trousers for $2. They are brown and are real wide at the bottom. Look really funny. Jono also got a pair (a similar colour). We then got a sort of tight (and I mean ta height) corduroy dinner jackety thing for Jono which was a tad (read a lot) to small. Then I got a corduroy jacket and we finished our purchases off by getting to orange (read LOUD orange) shirts which went underneath the jackets. We decided we must have been visionary 60's people.  Anyway this got me thinking. I realised that I could get clothes for very little. If you're willing to go second hand, and spend a bit of time, you can find clothes that are really nice, and most of us wouldn't even know they were second hand. No I realise the corduroys were obviously old (I will still wear them), but there were heaps of other clothes that weren't like that. I mean one shop we went to had every item of clothing for $2. Well I may now shop for my clothes at Save Mart. Hehe, and nobody mock me about it, because I'm trying to be a good steward!

       Yay for the weekend! Not only that, but it's Alana's 21st! Awesome stuff. Should be good.  Louise and me have just finished watching "A Knight's Tale". It's one of our favourite movies and we watch it regularly. Hehe, we even know most of the dialogue, and facial expressions. Chaucer is soo soo funny.  This morning I got to work early, and read the passage about Dinah and Shechem. The version I was reading it in translated what took place as 'Schechem violated Dinah." The CEV has the word rape. It was a bit unclear as to what actually took place, because later on Shechem is described as "he was honored above all the house of his father." That tends to indicate that either the rest of his family were a bunch of scoundrels or there is more to this than the initial reading throws up. I thought that perhaps it was an example of fornication where the two parties were consenting. Which is judged to be bad anyway by God. It was seen as a humiliation to not be a virgin when one got married. When I looked at the Hebrew dictionary that came with E Sword, the Hebrew word that has been used as rape or defile had various meanings, meaning it was still possible for my idea about this to be correct. If this were true (and I'm not saying it is, it was just a suggestion) then the fact that we wanted to marry her makes him a bit better. Instead of just getting what he wanted, and then sneaking away and buttering off, he proposed commitment. Not only that, but we see in verse 3 that his heart cleaved to her. This suggests not mere lust, but a constant continued affection. He also offers any price for a dowry, as a way of seeking ammends. Interesting. A difficult passage at any rate, and I'm still not sure what to make of it. But God had everything under control, and he did not want Israel to join into a pagan family, so he destroyed them. Even that's confusing. It seems that the writer looks down on Simeon and Levi for their deceit and murder of Shechem's whanau. They justify their murders by saying that Shechem shouldn't have treated their sister like a prostitute. What really seems to make their action evil, is the use of a sign of the covenant of grace to deceive the men and later kill them. There is much more I wish to look at in this passage, but I share just a few of my thoughts about it here with you.  Better catch some zzzzzzzzzzz's.

       Well after all that effort, I receive one comment. And it isn't even about the post. It's just a moan about the fact that ice cream was given to one person and not another! You can't win. I decided to visit the old staff shop today. I came out with all sorts of goodies, which I distributed to my youth leaders at C.I.A, and also Tanya, (because she asked). Sorry Alana! I'll get you something next time. Go the boysenberry trumpets!  It's late I'm tired and drained! Gotta go.

       Ok here we go.   Legalism  Lately in a few of my Christian circles, I have come up against an interesting use of the term legalism. Well as most of you will know, the word is not one which is found directly in the Bible. Anyway, there seems to be confusion over what this word means. This, I believe, is mainly due to misuse of the word, when another word or phrase could be used instead. The word has been hijacked!  To me, and until recently this word meant:-  a reliance on ones works (obeying the law) for salvation. Today some people have hijacked this word, and used it to oppose those people who would confront sin. Those who confront sin are labelled as legalists (which obviously has negative connotations).  The greek word for faith is pistos. Pistos comes from the greek word peitho, which means to obey (among related meanings). Interesting. Faith and obedience seem inextricably linked. Remember also how James argues that faith without works is dead. It is by grace we are saved through faith, which is the gift of God. And with faith that is alive, comes obedience. This is not legalism. It is biblical.  To expect it is also biblical. When 'faith' is not acompanied by obedience, we need to question whether it's saving faith.  1Th 5:14  My friends, we beg you to warn anyone who isn't living right. Encourage anyone who feels left out, help all who are weak, and be patient with everyone.   1Th 5:21  Put everything to the test. Accept what is good  1Th 5:22  and don't have anything to do with evil.    Jud 1:22  Be helpful to all who may have doubts.  Jud 1:23  Rescue any who need to be saved, as you would rescue someone from a fire. Then with fear in your own hearts, have mercy on everyone who needs it. But hate even the clothes of those who have been made dirty by their filthy deeds.    These verses show us that we must warn people who are in sin, that we must have nothing to do with evil, and hate evil. Neverthless, we must show grace in our approach to these tasks. A difficult thing to do, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.   So in summing up:- I'm definately not a works for salvation man, but I do believe works are the fruit of true faith. But nevertheless it is not works that save one. Legalism is not saying something is wrong!    Respect for Church Leaders  1Th 5:12  My friends, we ask you to be thoughtful of your leaders who work hard and tell you how to live for the Lord.  1Th 5:13  Show them great respect and love because of their work. Try to get along with each other.   Interesting, and challenging. I'll remember this next time I'm about to complain and whinge saying I wouldn't do things  that  way.

       Just had an awesome evening with Ethan, a guy from C.I.A. We had a bit of a CS session. He's a pretty good sniper! Very impressive indeed. We also punished a pizza.   urlLink The never updated youth message board!  I really couln't find the time to get the promised post up, but it's coming. I have become really serious about my bedtimes now that I work shifts. I don't want to be feeling yucky when I'm working.   Oh by the way. Cadbury flakes (in shape of trumpets) are very nice. Go and buy yourself one.

        Off Tramping  I'm off to the Kauranga valley tomorrow, so I'll not be blogging again until Monday. Should be interesting because this is the first tme I've gone hiking by myself. Sounds geeky, but I really want some time away to :-  1) Think about youth work and ministry. 2) Look at greek study. 3) Spend time in prayer and reading God's Word.

        Key Quotes   The Church is here to feed the sheep, not entertain the goats	 - Ross Thompson    Depend on it, bad company in the present life, is the sure way to obtain worse company in the life to come.   - J C Ryle    Of Husbands and Wives  I thought since everybody seems to be on fire with this topic. I'd quote a few Scriptures and throw them into the mix. We've had much opinion and what not, but God's Word is what counts, so I'll present it here.   1Pe 3:7  Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.  In this verse, husbands are told to give honour to their wives because they are the weaker vessel, and are (equally) heirs of grace. The greek word behind this translation of honour is timeÌ„. This word indicates an honour that is shown because of the status of the object of the honour. We should honour our wives, because the role that God has given them makes them vulnerable to 'exploitation'.    Col 3:19  Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.  In this passage men are commanded to love their wives. The Bible asks men to love their wives in most passages I have looked up on wives and husbands, indicating that it is an important instruction, and it is something men seem to find hard to do. Pay it heed!   Eph 5:25  Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;  Eph 5:26  that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,  Eph 5:27  that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.  Eph 5:28  Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:   Another passage that emphasizes the depth of love that a man must have for his wife. His concern is to b for his wife's physical and spiritual state. He is to love her like he cares for his own body. It is a sacrificial love, a love of servant leadership. If a man does not love his wife in this way, he is a slack reflection of Christ.   Tit 2:4  that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,  Tit 2:5  to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:   And to the women. They too must love their husbands, and their children (it is assumed that it is natural for a marriage to produce children). They must be 'in subjection' to their husbands, so that God's Word may not be blasphemed. The Greek word that is translated to subjection here is from hupotasso, which means to be subordinate, to obey, be subject to, and to submit oneself to. If a wife does not do this, it is not her husband she sins against, but God she blasphemes against.   1Pe 3:1  In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;  Again the Greek word hupotasso, is used here. In this case, the woman who is married has an unbelieving husband. he may be a slack or harsh leader, but by her very actions of submitting to him, she can win him to Christ. What a glorious thought!    Eph 5:22  Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  Eph 5:23  For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.  Eph 5:24  But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything. Once again hupotasso is used.  Marriage again is seen to reflect Christ's relationship to the church. Jut as the church submits to Christ in all things, so the wife must submit to the husband in all things. This submission should occur in the same way as submission to the Lord occurs.   Eph 5:33  Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.   Here the husband again is told to love his wife AS himself. Tough stuff guys. Specially if you love yourselves lots hehe. And the wife must fear her husband. This comes from the Greek word phobeo. It can mean to fear, to be in awe of, or to revere.   And lastly a word to the guys:-   1Ti 3:12  Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.  If we want to be a leaders in God's church, we must be leaders ub our family.   A lot of tough stuff in there for both sexes, but it is the Word of God. Isn't it funny that God's word picks out the things that each sex has the most difficulty with and hones in on it. Men can be very callous and unloving, and they are commanded to have a  the  most sacrificial love. Women find it easier to love, but difficult to come under the submission of their husbands.   The muddied waters of secular education   (from Maxim Institute's Real issues newsletter  The Ministry of Education has funded the building of a mosque at Hagley Community College in Christchurch. With 120 Muslim migrant students, Hagley will provide the country's first purpose-built mosque in a public school.   Is it reasonable to use taxpayer's money to invest in a place of worship for a particular religion? To do so would appear to contravene the 'secular' basis of state schooling going back to the 1877 Education Act. There are of course, options for parents seeking religious schooling. The Integration Act of 1975 provides for special (religious) character schools to receive state funding for operations and teacher salaries; and there are private or independent schools, most of which are linked to Christian churches and specific denominations.   In the interests of preserving a clear separation of all churches and religious expressions from the state, the secular clause makes sense, especially when there are the options of integration, independent schools, and an amount of local discretion eg. ('Bible in School' programmes). Funding the Hagley mosque goes beyond these options though, and muddies the waters of an important constitutional separation.

        How Far We Have Come  I was reading the other day that Germaine Greer was arrested in the 1970's for saying bulls*** and f*** in the Auckland Town Hall. She was taken to court and fined. Isn't it amazing how far we have come since then? That makes it sound almost positive. Perhaps I should say "Isn't it amazing how far we have sunk into the mire since then?"

        Person Of the Week  Amy is my person of the week! Awesome to have a bit of dialogue and discussion on the ol' blog. Has sparked quite a bit of interest, which is all G double O D. So keep it up it’s good stuff. Nice to have your comments! :)   Book of the Month  I’ve just completed “Thoughts for Young Men” by J.C Ryle, which has been somewhat of a kick-up-the-backside for me, which is good. I’ve learnt heaps out of it, and will include some thought-provoking quotes from it soon.   CD of the Week  I’ve been listening to Elgar’s  Cello concerto this week. A very beautiful, perhaps melancholy piece. Jacqueline du Pré does a most brilliant interpretation of this piece, which leaves me shivering at times. If you want to borrow the CD let me know!    Of Tax  As a little introduction to this whinge. Let me begin by saying a few things:- I do not come from a wealthy family. I come from a hard working family, who live in the suburb of Manurewa, and we could probably be classed as Lower-middle-class. My Dad is a Christian School teacher (so don’t think State School pay rates!) and up until recently my mum did not work. So this is not a rich kid moaning about how unfair it is to pay tax. Our family has worked and saved for what we have. Ok?  Ok I’m not a happy chappy about this situation. here’s the problem.  19% income tax. 12.5% tax on every item one purchases.  High rate of tax on petrol one buys. High rate of tax on tobacco one buys. High rate of tax on alcohol one buys. Secondary tax (if you have more than one job) of 33% (yes one dollar out of every 3 you earn).  But my real problem is this. If I pay so much tax, why can I not expect a police officer around at my house when I get burgled, in 30 minutes rather than the whopping 19 hours average that it takes in Counties Manukau. Why cannot police investigate when I get burgled, or when someone rams into my car and takes off? If, (as I believe it is) the job of the government is primarily to protect it’s citizens and their property, then why the heck can they not manage it with taxes as weighty as these.  Why is 1/3 of government expenditure on the ridiculously named “Social Welfare”.  Why should the government get 12.5% of the money I spend on food, and necessities... come to think of it anything at all. Why should I pay more tax (33%) for being a hard-worker who has two jobs?  Is this creating incentive to work hard? Why should I be taxed at a higher rate if I earn more than a certain income? Since if I earn 100,000 I will still be paying a heck of a lot more tax even if I pay the same percentage of tax as someone earning 20,000. This is so wrong. It is a disincentive to do well for oneself. Not only that, but the government will tax you on the interest you earn in your bank savings! A disincentive to save! And you can’t even die dammit without your inheritence money being taxed by the government. Yes! You're taxed for dying already! “Oh I’m sorry sir, we’ll have to take some money off you, please don’t die in future.” Well at least it used to be this way, I’m not sure if it there still is a ‘death dues’ tax. Maybe one of you brainy people could find that out.  I am by no means arguing for no tax. But give us a break! We should pay income tax. But all this other stuff is becoming ridiculous. It is the result of moving away from God. When the church does not flourish, the state must provide for the needy (the deserving and the undeserving), and taxes will have to rise as a result.   Story of the Week  Via Anita comes this very topical tale. (Please note the alliteration.)   A tale for our times??. Classic Version: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool, and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The shivering grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.  The Modern New Zealand Version: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool, and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others less fortunate like him are cold and starving.  The TV crews show up to provide live coverage of the shivering grasshopper, with cuts to a video of the ant in his comfortable warm home with a table filled with food. New Zealanders are stunned that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so while others have plenty. The Greens, the trade unions and the Coalition Against Poverty demonstrate in front of the ant's house. TV1 News, interrupting a cultural festival special from Ngaruawahia with breaking news, broadcasts them singing "We Shall Overcome." Dun Mihaka rants in an interview with Pam Corkery that the ant has gotten rich off the backs of grasshoppers, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share." In response to polls, the Labour Government drafts the Economic Equity and Grasshopper Anti-Discrimination Act, retroactive to the beginning of the summer. With the help of United Future and Jim Anderton's mob, the bill is quickly passed into law. The ant's taxes are reassessed and he is also fined for failing to hire grasshoppers as helpers. Without enough money to pay both the fine and his newly imposed retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government. The ant moves to Asia, and starts a successful agribiz company. The TV stations later show the now fat grasshopper finishing up the last of the ant's food though Spring is still months away, while the government owned house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he hadn't maintained it. Inadequate government funding is blamed, Margaret Wilson now is appointed to head a commission of enquiry that will cost $10,000,000. The grasshopper is soon dead of a drug overdose, the NZ Herald blames it on obvious failure of government to address the root causes of despair arising from social inequity. The abandoned house is taken over by a gang of immigrant spiders, praised by the government for enriching New Zealand's multicultural diversity, who promptly terrorize the community. Who says we don't live in a democracy?   Of Our Recent Discussion  Amy as I have previously mentioned has got this blog going! Great to have some discussion. Anyway I was getting sick of posting silly little comments on it, and it’s turned out to be quite an issue. I have thought about what has been argued, and have some stuff I would like to throw in the mix.  As I mentioned in one of my comments, Jonah was commanded to go to the Assyrians, to tell them of their impending doom. God here was sending Jonah to warn these people that there sin was an offense to Him. The result was repentance, and the turning of God’s wrath.  Peter at Pentecost convicted the people of their sin, by saying that they were responsbile for Christ’s death. Obviously because of their sin (not many of them would have personally banged the nails in Jesus’ hands since they came from all over the known world.). His speech convicted them to repent.  Paul did a similar thing in Athens. He spoke to them about the statue that had to an unknown God. he talked to them about the true God and said “In the past, God forgave all this because people did not know what they were doing. But now he says that everyone everywhere must turn to him. He has set a day when he will judge the world's people with fairness. And he has chosen the man Jesus to do the judging for him. God has given proof of this to all of us by raising Jesus from death. As soon as the people heard Paul say that a man had been raised from death, some of them started laughing. Others said, "We will hear you talk about this some other time." Here Paul talks of God’s coming judgement, and warns the unbelievers about it.   Our actions should match our words, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t say things. To warn people of their sin, may convict them (like it did in the three above cases) and save them by God’s grace from their sin. This surely is reason enough to speak out against wickedness in society. The time of grace is now. Let us warn people now before the time of eternal judgement comes!

        And the Winner Is....  Amanda McGrail, St Heliers.  Although I hardly expect she saw the challenge I gave on my blog yesterday about writing a letter! Here is her excellent letter.   "Why would Jane Norton criticise Samuel Carpenter for wanting to honour his wife? Erotic advertisements for women's lingerie do little to encourage women and everything to play with men's minds.  I am thankful that there are some young men around who want to tell their wives that despite the smorgasboard of sluttishness they face every day, they want their eyes to be only for her; that they took their wedding vows seriously.  I am sure Samuel Carpenter's wife felt honoured and adored by his letter, certainly not exploited. The increasing sexualisation of our culture is doing no one any favours, except advertisers whose creative flair seems stuck below the waist."   And to that I say "Amen and Amen."  Just as an aside does anyone know why one of the first results of the fall in Genesis was man trying to clothe himself, and then God clothing him? (Serious question, I have my own theories, but I'd like to know what ya'll think.)

        Letter to the Editor and a challenge  Today Jane Norton has a letter in the Herald as a reply to my one. I will post her reply; not because it is worthy of being posted, but so that you can see the total lack of clear thinking coming from many feminists.    "I thank Scott Kennedy for pointing out to me that Samuel Carpenter's statement about women being the viewing property of their spouse only is simply because of Mr Carpenter's concern at the exploitation of women. It would appear that private exploitation, in the form of a husband owning his wife, is acceptable but public exploitation is not."   Ok, I'm not even going to talk about the clumsy first sentence, but rather about her big flaw. In this letter she is admitting that the posting of billboards is public exploitation, but instead of saying "No that's wrong" she uses a most flawed argument.  She seems to insist that since there is some private exploitation (and we'll come to that) it's OK to have public exploitation.  It's actually not at all clear that she knows what she is arguing for. Have I convinced her that public exploitation is wrong, and now she is moving onto defeat private? Either way she is jeopardizing her first argument, that the billboards are fine, and it is repressive to get rid of them.  Now I'd like to look at what she called 'private exploitation'. She labels the monogamous relationship of marriage as exploitation, where a husband 'owns' a wife, and she is his 'viewing property'. Well I say a hearty "Amen" to this. As it says in  I Corinthians 7:4  "A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself, and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself." This kind of relationship is a wonderful protection for women. Instead of being a restriction to women, it protects them from undesirable occurrences. God is not a feminist (I think that's the name of a book), and He ordained marriage as a mutually beneficial relationship of committment, which directly reflects Christ and His relationship to the Church. Feminism does not empower women. Instead it makes them more vulnerable to exploitation than ever. Here we have a feminist who attacks marriage, and sees no problem with women being plastered around on big billboards for all and sundry to oogle over. Posting women naked or semi-naked on big billboards encourages a superficial and shallow view of women to be adopted by a society. This more than marriage reduces women to a commodity, an object which can be compared to others, and rejected on basis of aesthetic qualities, rather than the qualities of a gentle and quiet spirit, or a love for the Lord. So in reality feminists are degrading women, and we Christians must arise to protect them.  So having said this (and I could say much more, and maybe will do so in a future post), I leave a challenge. Let's not all sit on the fence, and say "That's nice" or "That's interesting". Arise, get your pen, and paper (or your email) and write letters to the editor, exposing this attack on marriage for what it is! Stupidity. Marriage is the foundation of a society, and if it is attacked we Christians must defend it. Let us protect our sisters, and expose this nonsense for what it is.  PS I will post more on this when I get some time.

        Letter to the Editor  Today is a good day! I got a letter to the New Zealand Herald in in reply to a feminist bashing a guy of integrity. She said he should be made to live in Saudi Arabia, because he objected to billboards of semi-naked/nude women being displayed in public places. She called him a repressive type. Again, another instance of what I have been talking about. If you don't agree with the anti-Christian agenda (and I believe there is one) then sod off and go to another country, or shut up. You are not allowed to have an opposing view. And as I have already said. Enough already! Speak out (or letter write).   Of Trogdor  His majesty increases. There is less of his piteous hiding behind the heater or filter tricks these days. Today I fed the fish. Now he being the only bottom feeding creature was given a little pill like piece of food for his consumption. When the top feeding fish had demolished their meal, they started to eat Trogdor's. And Trogdor smote the fishs, and all was laid to burnination. Seriously though, he was not amused at this invasion of his own nutrient supply, so gave chase. In the end he got really ticked off and just randomly chased fish around the tank for the fun of it.    Breakfast  Ethan (a guy from C.I.A) and I went to Macdonalds for breakfast this morning. 'Twas a very interesting experience. We both ordered a 'massive' McMuffin breakfast. Well, obviously massive means something different from what it did when I went to school. It was quite peturbing. Here I was (after looking at the picture) expecting some monolithic muffin with such imposing bulk that I might not be able to quite finish it. Instead what did I get? An impoverished indigent item which one almost had to feel sorry for. The egg if it could be called an egg, (and believe me I was highly suspicious about it's origins when I depressed it and it bounced back like some kind of rubber) looked highly processed, and was in a most unnatural looking shape. Thank goodness it was the fellowship we came for.   Happy Birthdays  Hamish! Happy birthday.... sorry I forgot! God bless ya heaps, and I'm sure there will be many more.   My mum also is having a birthday today, so I'm taking her out for coffee. But I won't say happy birthday here, 'cos she'll never see it. Hehe.   Democracy   A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government.  It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves  (money) from the treasury.  From that moment on the majority votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with a result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy followed by a dictatorship.  The average age of the worlds greatest civilizations have progressed 200 years.  These nations have progressed through the following sequence:  From bondage to spiritual faith From spiritual faith to great courage From courage to liberty From liberty to abundance From abundance to selfishness From selfishness to complacency From complacency to apathy From apathy to dependency And from dependency back to bondage.   Alexander Fraser Tyler (1748-1843) The Decline and fall of the Athenian Republic.  I would be interested to see where ya'll think we are on that road the qoute talks about. God bless you all.

        Fishs  I got some fish today. I've named a few of them.  urlLink Trogdor  is this really cool black one with a red tail, and he has fangs (and majesty). He kinda hangs out at the back of the tank underneath the filter, or between the filter and the heater. Then there is "Arrowed" (a male guppy) and "Sworded" (the pregnant female guppy).    Real Issues - Maxim Weekly Email   This came out in real issues. Ms Turia is the type of 'radical Maori' I was talking about in a post a few days earlier. I refuse to be called a guest. I am tangata whenua. I belong here, and this is my country, as much as it is any other New Zealand citizens.    Are Pakeha guests in New Zealand?   Are Pakeha merely guests in New Zealand? Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia has made it clear she believes that to be the case. She wants the name 'Maori' to be replaced by 'tangata whenua' - the people of the land - to emphasise they are the hosts.   Ms Turia is a member of a government trying to promote Maori and Pakeha as partners. But we can't have it both ways. What she is implying in talking of 'hosts' and 'guests', is, that the host is in charge and guests have to comply with their way of doing things. This is not a partnership. The question remains: are Pakeha guests, settlers, or conquerors? Historian Michael King, who has strong links with Maori, offers another perspective in his book Being Pakeha Now:   "Like the ancestors of the Maori, [my ancestors] came as immigrants; like Maori too, we became indigenous at the point where our focus of identity and commitment shifted to this country and away from our countries and cultures of origin. Again like Maori, our culture - mainstream Pakeha culture - altered here in response to a relationship with the land and its flora and fauna. Ultimately that culture was transformed by interaction, history and experience into something whose proportions and combinations bore only a distant relationship to the original ingredients. People who live in New Zealand by choice as distinct from an accident of birth, and who are committed to this land and its people and steeped in their knowledge of both, are no less 'indigenous' than Maori."   Also, like other ministers, Ms Turia is attempting to change the language shaping our understanding of present and past issues. In a Civil Society, however, both our language and grasp of history needs to be clear, objective and accurate.

        Work  It's 10:53pm, and I just got home from work. Feels weird. But I'm happy because I got my Pray For Rain (PFR) cd's today.  urlLink Jono  also received his. Funny thing is, he ordered his a week before mine, and paid extra for 'fast' shipping, whilst I used 'economy'. Oh well, I guess economy is the way to go!    Fishs  Tomorrow I am going fishing for  urlLink fishs . I'll probably grab me some plants as well. I might even post a photo somewhere so ewes can check it out in all it's  urlLink majesty .

        Request for Recipe  Yes it's coming! The recipe for Scott's Butter Mince Curry will be posted after my final test and adjustments. Be patient... I know you want to try it! Anita has told me specifically that she can't wait. Haha joking.. I think it wasn't as positive as that.   Of Fish  The tank is set up. It's 55L, and I got some gravel, a filter, a heater, thermometer, chemicals and am just getting the pH and temperature issues sorted before I introduce fish. I hope to add some plants and fish tomorrow. Should be good. And then you can all come round and have a look..... maybe we could crack open the jelly tips... or maybe even the butter mince.   Procrastination Issue  I have been working on a way of solving my procrastination issues. I will probably finish my plan today. Then all that remains is adhering to it. I will demonstrate it when I finish it completely, as long as it does not take me away from important tasks. That's what procrastination is really about. Not doing something you could be, but rather doing something that is unimportant.

        Tropical Fish  I feel the urge to set up a tropical fish tank in my room. I think it would make for a great hobby. I will investigate the pet shop on the morrow. I don't start work until 2:00pm tomorrow, so I have a free morning, which will be good to utilise.   Prayer Box  I remember once, somebody talking about a box they had with a slot at the top. They would write down prayer concerns or worries they had, and insert them in the box, and pray about them, committing them to God. I have constructed my own little prayer box out of a 'punished' memphis meltdowns box (not the three pack... we're talking about the big packs here...). Well the person who mentioned this said that after a few months of inserting prayer needs into the box, they would crack it open, and read what they had prayed about. Apparently it was such a blessing to see how God had answered so many prayer concerns.    Jono's Blog   urlLink Jono  goes hard on the topic of men. Go Jono! Sock it to 'em. Truth is truth, and while it should be said with Grace... it should be said; period.    1000  On the 12th of August, you guys are going to make this blog tick over the 1000 visits mark. Wish that were comments already!

        Scott's Butter Mince Curry  I made this for my family on Friday night. They live yet.......so I have called my recipe experiment a success. It is now fully customized by me, and I will release it after just one more trial with some different people. Tastes very nice. You may mock now, but I assure you this time I'm really on to something. It's not just another one of my soups. Although some of them wern't half bad you know.    Young Men's Bible Study  We started our young men's Bible study today, amidst memphis meltdowns, pies, fish cakes (and maybe some kind of  urlLink fish sauce  from the market too), and of course the beautiful apple cake from Mark. The food was awesome, and was punished by all concerned. We also studied the Bible!

        Lack of Posting  This week my computer has been playing up somewhat. Me and Allan dealt to it last Saturday, but it kept on being a mongrel. Perhaps by saying I have reformatted 5 times will make you understand why I have not had the time to blog. I was almost tempted to get the old GT500 back up on the internet by nicking the modem from Veyron. Ah well, Veyron is now fully functional..... I think.   Jono's Blog  Jono's blog is like a cat. It has nine lives. He can start it up NINE times.   Person of the Week  This week, I have a couple as people of the week. Simon and Anne Camp are my people of the week. They have been running a series at C.I.A youth on "Preparing for Intimate Relationships." It's great to see people serving young people by sharing their wisdom with them. They have put so much work into what they are doing, and it really shows.    The Bible  This quote comes from the front of the little Bibles they hand out at university, and is very good.   The Bible contains the mind of God, the state of man, the way of salvation, the doom of sinners, and the happiness of believers. Its doctrines are holy, its precepts are true, and its decisions are immutable. Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe, and practice it to be holy. It contains light to direct you, food to support you, and comfort to cheer you.  It is the traveller's map, the pilgrim’s staff, the pilot’s compass, the soldier’s sword, and the Christian’s charter. Here Paradise is restored, Heaven opened, and the gates of hell disclosed.  Christ is its grand subject, our good the design, and the glory of God its end.  It should fill the memory, rule the heart, and guide the feet. Read it slowly, frequently, and prayerfully. It is a mine of wealth, a paradise of glory, and a river of pleasure. It is given you in life, will be opened at the judgement, and will be remembered forever. It involves the highest responsibility, will reward the greatest labour, and will condemn all who trifle with its sacred contents .   Encouragement  My goal this week, is to be more encouraging to those whom I meet. Encouragement is so important. I encourage you all to encourage your pastors and elders.

        Butter Mince  I made butter mince again tonight. I have slightly refined my recipe, but it still needs refining. Will let you know when this process is complete. It's getting very nice. So to all those who mock.... watch out, because butter mince is coming to a restaurant near you.   Person of the Week  Jono is person of the week this week! Very thoughtfully invited me around this week, when I was feeling down, and we just hung. Was real good. Thanks Jono, you made my day.   Wuthering Heights  Have just begun reading Wuthering Heights for the 5th (I think). I really enjoy... hehe. Really?!   Bill English  I was really impressed with Bill English and his stand against Euthanasia. It's a pity that we have fallen so far in this nation that  a decent moral bloke cannot get support, while a godless (and anti-God) woman can take the country down a road to the devil. While I'm not saying Bill is a Christian (although he may well claim to be and is a Catholic). I am trying to differentiate between leadership which leads directly away from moral foundations, and leadership while not Christian, still has a moral conscience. Examples of both can be found in the Old Testament. I'm probably not making much sense as I am really tired, I'll try to explain next time.

        Butterflies  Butterflies are insects. They have four wings covered with tiny, shingle-like scales and by mouthparts that form a hollow, flexible tube like a drinking straw. Most butterflies eat nectar of flowers. Butterflies have small bodies and large wings, and a pair of antennae on their heads. Butterfly (singular) is also a type of swimming stroke. Muhammad Ali could "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." I like butterflies. They are cool.

        Politics, Racism And Suchlike  After tomorrow is over, my blog will take a break from politics race and suchlike. I know some of those less interested in these things must be getting bored, so on Wednesday I will talk about butterflys or something equally contraversial. So look forward to the break from contraversy!   Allan's Blog and Racism - edited with help from Nato  1. Racial Discrimination (a form of racism) is dealing with people according to their race, and not according to their actual circumstances. (For example one could say “All Asians are bad drivers so Mr Chang being an Asian cannot have a drivers license. However Mr Chang may in fact be an excellent driver, and should have a drivers license.)  2. To allow people of Maori or Pacific origin into a computer course for free, but to charge those from other backgrounds is racial discrimination, since it deals with Maori Pacific Islanders as if they are all poor and in need of help, and Pakeha as if they are all rich and able to help support others and help themselves.  3. Racial Discrimination is wrong  Conclusion:- It is wrong for Maori and Pacific Islanders to get into a computer course for free when other races cannot.   To disagree with the conclusion this you must disagree with one of the premises, since if you agree with the premises, the conclusion follows logically. Perhaps you might like to argue that even if the premises are correct, some racial discrimination is not bad. In that case you will need to spell out in which cases, and why. Otherwise, I would tend to think that this case we discussed in Allan’s blog is bad, and is something that shouldn’t be happening!   A better way of arguing this would is summarized by Nato “race isn't an accurate measure of need. Need is the best measure of need”   Extract From My Essay On NZ Society  As a nation we have scoffed at the idea of absolute truth, and embraced relativism. We thus make ourselves hypocrites, because we want a society where people respect each other, yet we have rejected a basis for absolute standards of morality that can produce such a society. Not surprisingly, the government, representing us, has pulled the plug on civil society; it has rejected virtue, just as it’s citizens have. Society has elected to run with ’values’ which are subjective and personal, and now reaps the consequences of the ‘freedom’ sown. By rejecting the boundaries of absolute morality and personal responsibility, we have opted instead for the shackles of increased state control and responsibility over our lives. Edmunde Burke, hit the nail on the head when he said;    “Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition  to put moral chains upon their own appetites.........Society cannot exist unless a controlling  power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without.”   Government social policy has tried to legitimatize and subtly supported alternate forms of ’family’ other than the traditional marriage based family. It has done this through laws such as no-fault divorce, through the legitimisation of homosexual relationships, through the welfare system, and through education. Government welfare programmes created disincentives for families aiding their members, and in the long run have encouraged family break down. These programmes have made it economically viable for women to have babies outside of marriage, and for fathers to shirk responsibility in favour of government income assistance. The very fact that we support these lifestyles gives those who live them reason for doing so.  In the research for this paper, I read the 1998 Business Plan for the Department of Social Welfare. (Does anybody else find it strange that a department which ideally should be reducing it’s cliental is creating a business plan as if it were a growth industry?) Inside the front cover, it proudly stated that Social Welfare handled one in every three dollars of government expenditure. This is shocking. One third of tax payer money is being used to support lifestyles many of which are proven to be disastrous for children and society, producing tragedies such as the death of Michael Choy and his youthful murderers. Furthermore, these lifestyles are uneconomical. We are too busy focussing on poverty, by giving handouts instead of looking at one of the primary causes of poverty, which is found in social policy hostile to marriage. Thus we are continually exacerbating the problem. The welfare state itself discourages families from staying together, as it offers finance for other lifestyles. However, the very lifestyles that this promotes leads to further poverty, both physically, and morally.      Personal Responsibility  Does society owe us? Do we have a right to money from other people if we are poor? These questions are not the same as "Should society help those in need?" A problem I think we have is that we confuse these questions. No person has a right to another persons money. It is not some God-given right. Here is a further extract:-     "It will also be vital to create a strong independent voluntary sector that can offer an alternative to government welfare..... As we reduce government welfare, less tax will be required, and people will have more disposable income to give to charity. Volunteer organizations are a major component in building social capital. They enable people to publicly practise the virtues that should be learned in the family. Family and friends are important in temporarily supporting others in need, but when this is not possible, voluntary associations provide the best alternative, not the government. When assistance comes from real people, and not some monolithic state organisation, face to face relationships will result, and people will respect the aid that comes to them, not as a right, but as a gift. This will decrease the likelihood of dishonesty and abuse of welfare. Voluntary institutions will flourish in a society that loves virtue, as the government steps back and allows them to fulfill their proper task. These institutions create a context for rights to be matched by responsibility, and hold back the power of the state."

        Rock Of Ages  Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee; Let the water and the blood, From Thy riven side which flowed, Be of sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt and power.  Not the labours of my hands Can fulfil Thy law's demands; Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears for ever flow, All for sin could not atone: Thou must save, and Thou alone.  Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Thy Cross I cling; Naked, come to Thee for dress; Helpless, look to Thee for grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly; Wash me, Saviour, or I die.  While I draw this fleeting breath, When mine eyelids close in death, When I saw through tracts unknown,  See Thee on Thy judgement throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.

        Of Wasting Time On Unimportant Things.  Police:- Go catch crims already. Like the ones who burgle, rape, murder etc. Why is it that heaps and heaps of burglaries go unsolved, and yet we waste time on  urlLink this?    The Great Turia Tells Us There Are Many Racists In New Zealand.  Check  urlLink this.   Let me alert you to this woman's own racist ramblings..... (all articles from the Herald online)  1)  Government minister Tariana Turia says Maori should be on gambling regulatory bodies as of right to ensure they get their fair share of poker machine profits to replace money generated through traditional fundraisers such as housie, raffles and two-up.    2)  Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia has labelled the word as "Pakeha" and says the people native to New Zealand want it changed to tangata whenua (people of the land).   - I assume white folk are not people of the land even though they have lived here all their lives? Piffle as Dan would say.  3)  Figures showing Maori are twice as likely to die of cancer than non-Maori show there is active discrimination in the health system, Associate health minister Tariana Turia said today.   Presumably since we have a public health system that makes Maori pay triple what everyone else has to pay, and does not pay their doctors extra for having patients of Maori or Pacific lineage.....  4)  Opposition parties yesterday failed in their attempts yesterday to paint Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia as a Government rebel breaching collective responsibility by supporting the Waitangi Tribunal oil and gas reserves claim.   Thought I'd throw that in. Haha yeah well THAT's definately in the treaty.   5)  Tariana Turia, the minister responsible for Maori family welfare, says campaigns to help Maori solve social problems such as family violence undermine rangatiratanga.   "Tangata whenua get frustrated when official agencies tell us how to solve 'our' problems," Mrs Turia writes in a regular online column, Beehive Chat.   "We are the targets of campaigns to prevent family violence and neglect, to improve our health and education.   'These campaigns can further undermine our rangatiratanga [variously translated as sovereignty or self-reliance]"    Presumably in the same way that lower entry grades into university, and free computer courses etc do as well?   But alas, enough already before I die of uncontrollable laughter.  And now for a highly respected and intelligent man.  Sir Apirana Ngata had criticised the Labour Government's move towards a social welfare programme in the 1930s, saying it would bury Maori initiative and create a culture of dependence.     Amen and Amen. And he spoke a true prophecy. If we cannot agree on the fairness of these 'benefits based on race' we must agree on their lack of success. The more that is given, the worse the dependency becomes.

        Excerpt From Real Issues  The smacking debate   The tragic death of 6-year-old Coral Burrows has prompted calls from the Prime Minister, Social Services Minister, Steve Maharey, and the Commissioner for Children to remove Section 59 of the Crimes Act. This section allows parents to use 'reasonable force' when disciplining their children.   But let's be clear: Section 59 does not advocate smacking; it allows for reasonable parental force, which may include smacking. Obviously, responsible parents use a range of measures, and in no way is it a licence to beat children. Moreover, there is a consistent failure among child advocates to see that family dysfunction is a cause of abuse and that smacking and violence are poles apart. There is no evidence that smacking leads to violence, and the law is quite clear about the difference between the two.   When used properly, smacking is a quick correction to bring a child's behaviour back into line; it seeks to restore the parent-child relationship affected by the child's unacceptable behaviour. If done in a context of stable and committed family relationships, it is motivated by love and a commitment to the child's best interests. As children develop, most parents naturally use it less and less.   Abuse, however, is belting, punching, or beating. It is motivated by anger, frustration, revenge or some other volatile desire to 'get back at' the child. Abuse aims to inflict pain, revenge or humiliation. It is often associated with parental neglect, dictatorial control, indulgence and incompetence, and unstable and uncommitted relationships. Making smacking illegal will criminalise responsible parents, but will do nothing to stop abusers.

        The Treaty Continued  Let us all imagine for a moment that I travelled to Italy. And I had an accident. (I had enough of doing it in New Zealand). Now let us imagine that the fault lay with both people, and the nice police man came and wrote up a report in Italian, and translated it into English, which I sign (assuming the same is said in Italian.) The version of the incident that I sign says since the fault lies with both of us, I will only need to pay $100 and the man who banged into me will pay me $100  and will take his car to the panel-beaters. The Italian version says I must pay $100 and the Italian man must pay me $100 and I must bring the other mans car to the panel-beaters. Since I signed the English version I have different expectations to the Italian man who signed the Italian one. The document cannot be made a legal document, since neither party was aware at the time of signing the true obligations he was expected to fulfill.  In a similar way we have a problem with the treaty.  Now I come to a more important point. How long does this 'legal' treaty last for? Is it a treaty that lasts forever? And if so what kind of special powers does it have? Does it use them for good or for awesome? no but seriously guys, what other treaty lasts forever?  Let's investigate:- 1) Versailles, Treaty of, peace treaty signed at the end of World War I between Germany and the Allies. It was negotiated during the Paris Peace Conference held in Versailles beginning January 18, 1919. .....By the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was required to abolish compulsory military service; to reduce its army to 100,000; to demilitarize all the territory on the left bank of the Rhine River and also that on the right bank to a depth of 50 km (31 mi); to stop all importation, exportation, and nearly all production of war material; to limit its navy to 24 ships, with no submarines, the naval personnel not to exceed 15,000; and to abandon all military and naval aviation by October 1, 1919. Germany also agreed to permit the trial of former emperor William II by an international court on the charge of "a supreme offense against international morality."  2) Locarno, Treaties of, series of seven agreements designed to promote the security of western Europe at the end of World War I (1914-1918). The treaties were signed by representatives from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Poland in Locarno, Switzerland, on October 16, 1925, and signed in London, England, on December 1, 1925. The first of the Locarno treaties guaranteed the common boundaries of France, Germany, and Belgium. The Rhineland, an area covering parts of Belgium, France, and Germany, was established as a neutral zone. The British and Italians were involved in the guarantee, but they did not have any new military obligations to ensure the implementation of the treaties. Although France signed security treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, the treaties did not offer the same frontier recognition to the countries on Germany's eastern borders. There were, however, agreements providing for the arbitration of disputes between Germany and its Belgian, French, Czechoslovak, and Polish neighbors. The treaties were to operate within the framework of the League of Nations, which Germany joined in 1926.  3) Charles the Bold (1433-1477), last duke of Burgundy, the son of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, and Isabella of Portugal, born in Dijon. In 1452 he became count of Charolais. When King Louis XI of France forced Philip to cede some towns on the Somme River, Charles formed the League of the Public Weal, an alliance of noblemen. League forces threatened Paris and defeated the king at MontlhÃ©ry, near Paris, in 1465. The result was the Treaty of Conflans, by which the towns on the Somme were restored and the counties of Boulogne, Guines, and Ponthieu were granted to Charles.  4) The Treaty of Frankfurt, signed on May 10, 1871, ended the war between France and Germany. The treaty provided that the French province of Alsace (excepting Belfort) and part of Lorraine, including Metz, were to be ceded to the German Empire, and that France was to pay a war indemnity of 5 billion gold francs ($1 billion), submitting to occupation by German troops until the amount was rendered in full. This heavy obligation was discharged in September 1873, and during the same month, after an occupation of almost three years, France was at last freed of German soldiers.  Just a few examples here. Note how in each case the treaty is formed in a certain situation. Now that this situation is no longer applicable, the treaties are irrelevant. (Check for example the standing army of less than 100,000 for Germany).  A treaty may be terminated by reliance on the principle rebus sic stantibus ("things remaining that way"), that is, when the state of affairs assumed by the signatory parties (when they signed the treaty, and therefore the real basis of the treaty), no longer exists, and a substantial change in conditions has taken place. Is this not the case?!   (Information courtesy of Encarta 2000)    urlLink Allan's  brush with Racism   Check this out, i was really angry when this happened.

        urlLink Our land and house is safe though... isn't it?    Giving Back Land  There seems to be some confustication over my views. I do support land that was stolen being given back. As I said  "Where land has been taken unlawfully, it must be given back."   And the main point I believe is as follows:-  "Let me also remind you that this document is beginning to be viewed as a legal document. But how can it be? If the English version significantly differs to the Maori version, then the Treaty surely is invalid, since neither side can be reasonably expected to know what the other sides version of the document says. And therefore are signing different agreements! If it is invalid, then it must be done away with entirely. "

        How To Get People to Read Your Blog  Please go straight to next heading for ideas.   Irrelevant and Outdated Piece Of Paper?  The Treaty of Waitangi is a document for a specific time and place. The time is long passed and the place (19th century New Zealand) is now gone. Let me illustrate that with quotes from the treaty of Waitangi.   From the first article:- "the Chiefs of the Confederation and all the chiefs who have not joined that Confederation give absolutely to the Queen of England for ever the complete government over  their land". This comes from the Maori version. Question:- Where is the Queen of England now. Sovereignty has again been ceded in all practicality to New Zealand. This document is now outdated, since the sovereignty that was ceded has now been placed back into the hands of those living in this land.  From the second article:- "The Queen of England agrees to protect the chiefs, the subtribes.....and all the people of New Zealand in the unqualified excercise of their chieftenship over their lands, villages and all their treasures." Where the heck is the Queens protection now? Once again handed back to us. This is the Maori version, but the English version seems to indicate even more obviously that what is being said here is that Maori (and others) will be protected in their ownership rights. In other words what you own cannot be taken by force by another more powerful tribe, which was what happened until British law and order was introduced.  The second article English version:- "........undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess as long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession..." Obviously here we are talking about property rights.   The third and last article gives all people of New Zealand citizenship of England. Ha ha. Well those days are long gone.   When the tribes of New Zealand, the Confederation of Chiefs and the British Crown signed the treaty, morality based on justice replaced morality based on might, and British law entrenched the concept of permanency of claims to land, where previously, land was owned and occupied up until it was forcibly taken by a rival tribe. Queen Victoria's promise that all people in New Zealand would be granted the rights and duties of British citizens, changed this situation, and ownership became permanent. What is being protected by the treaty  are property rights. Property rights to land, and other property. It has nothing to with getting into university with lower grades, being able to fish introduced trout without a permit, being able to raid the coastline without heeding laws about how many one can take. It has nothing to do with camping out on a spot of land you like, and refusing to pay rates (when you do not even own that piece of land). It has nothing to do with allowing you your own special members of parliament. It has nothing to do with forcing other New Zealand people to consult with you about whether they can do certain things with THEIR own land. It has nothing to do with Maori getting special rights to the airwaves, coal, gas or fishing at depths that they never could have fished at. It has nothing to do with.........need I continue?  Where land has been taken unlawfully, it must be given back. Where it has been sold at foolish prices the case becomes more difficult. Plenty of people sell cars and houses at very low prices today as they are in need of the cash, but their ancestors cannot come back later and say "hang on guys I should have got more for that." Where it has been sold it should not be claimed back. That is as far as the Treaty goes and should go. To take it further than this is to take it out of it's original context and to twist it to suit politically correct purposes.  I am not at all even sure that any of the treaty should be considered valid. Since it is clearly outdated due to the fact that some of the parties in it no longer exist. Further to this, property rights are already protected under New Zealand law. We have broken away from England, and the monarchy in all but a technicality.   Let me also remind you that this document is beginning to be viewed as a legal document. But how can it be? If the English version significantly differs to the Maori version, then the Treaty surely is invalid, since neither side can be reasonably expected to know what the other sides version of the document says. And therefore are signing different agreements! If it is invalid, then it must be done away with entirely.  As I said earlier the Treaty was written in a specific context. Take it out of that and try to apply it today, and you get madness.

        Trogdor Strikes In The Night!  I had 19 fish. Now I have 18 fish and a skeleton. I found Mr Fish dead on the bottom with a hole through him yesterday. Shortly afterwards, I saw Trogdor feasting upon him. Trogdor strikes again.... with majesty!   Mum  Needs another operation, as the first one was not completely successful. Keep praying!   Question  Of interest and importance:- Do Maori deserve special privileges or have any more rights in this country due to the fact they were (debatably) the first inhabitants of New Zealand. I say no. Until this is spelt out and understood by all there will be racial disharmony in this country.   Smacking Children  I was troubled by the death of Corral. It was so sad. Unfortunately, with the death of Corral, cries for the outlawing of smacking have been heard. Bizarre. Did she get a smacked bottom and die? No; someone murdered her. The argument against smacking ones children is that it produces a violent society. Interesting! So how is it that in times past, where smacking was more acceptable, we had lower rates of murder and violent crime (and other crime) than we do now when fewer people use physical discipline. Once again stupid people are using unjustified arguments to attempt to bring about daft legislation. Give me strength!

        Mum  As many of you will know, my mum had her breast cancer surgery last Wednesday, and she is doing fine. We await the results to see if everything is tickety boo. Thanks for all the prayer.   Car Accident  Some of you may also know I had a car accident on the motorway last Tuesday. God protected me from harm, and I am now back at work.... somewhat poorer, and transportationally deficient.   Alfa Romeo  Dan and me went to look at an  urlLink Alfa Romeo  tonight. It is a replacement for my Mazda 626. I am really thinking of buying it. I'll keep ewes posted. Thanks for helping Dan!   Mafia  Awesome night on Sunday. Heaps of the youth from church went round to  urlLink Jono's , and we played Mafia. A good night was had by all! If you haven't played this game, get in touch, and I'll let you know when the next one is.    Lack of Posting  Anita has commented on the lack of posting on all blog fronts recently. In fact Dan has been the only one who really has been. What's going on? I've been too busy, but really want to get back into it. I just don't really have much to say though. Maybe I'll have an issue to bang on about tomorrow. Until then God bless ya'll.

        Nice - Go Maxim  A confused risk management culture    In every area except sex education, our young people are mollycoddled by a risk management culture. According to educational psychologist, mother and former teacher, Maria Schmetzer, when it comes to sex, "Young people are left in the position of making dreadful choices as there's no rules." Speaking at a public seminar in the South Island last weekend, Mrs Schmetzer added that "Children were making decisions they were not equipped to make at their age and parents had been made to feel incapable of guiding them."   Increasingly, childhood is being politicised through demands for more child rights, advocacy and safety. Risk-taking is no longer allowed as part of childhood - except when it comes to sexual expression and experimentation.   Today's children are growing up in a sterile and politically correct ('harm minimisation') culture largely bereft of risk, and managed by more and more state regulation and rights. Empowerment and participation rights have replaced former notions of protection, the role of parents is diminished, and the difference between 'child' and 'adult' continues to shrink.     Save Mart Clothes  Jono, Alisa, and cruised to Save Mart today. Ok this place rules. I bought 4 dress shirts and a pair of nice jeans for $35. Jono got more shirts for about the same. T-shirts are about $2 or $3. We then cruise to Rebel Sports just to check out something, and found T-Shirts (which just happened to have little famous brand labels on them) for $50 and more. Haha. Sucked in. Amazing how much you can save when you step down a little bit. Don't get me wrong, our shirts and stuff aren't gross, just not necessarily labels. Jono also did an amazingly cool good deed today. Check his blog to see what he did, when he decides to post about it.   Gold Nescafe Spoon  Ok this comes in as wackyness for the week stuff. I got a letter from Nestle the other day, with a gold (coloured) metallic spoon, which they told me was so I could have the perfect coffee when I used Gold Blend. Cool man. It said that "Your friend Mr Peek" had recommended me for it. Shot Mr Peek! Awesome stuff. Why did he recommend me? Was it because I was a stirrer? Or maybe because I like coffee....?

        The Hike  Absolutely amazing time. I went up the Billygoat track, which is very scenic. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Whilst up at the hut I read through II Timothy and Titus. Great books, and I was very encouraged. Shall tell you some stuff I learnt from them later. Anyways.... so much for assuming a peaceful and tranquil time would be had in preayer and meditation. There were 50-60 other people up there, so it was quite hectic, However, on the good side, I met a non-Christian guys, who was stoned (and possibly drunk by the amount of vodka he was consuming) and tried witnessing to him. he came from a Catholic background, and assumed that it was good works that save you. Well I didn't get far, but I pray that questions were left in Andrew's mind, which God will later use to bring him to his knees in repentance and faith. Further to this, I met a Christian youth group from Warkworth up there, and was encouraged as I talked with the leaders, and shared with them.  Isn't it funny how things turn out. Here I was hoping to have heaps of time to myself and God, and what did I get? Lot's of talking with others. But it was good for my soul to get away and see the beauty of the New Zealand bush, which is God's.   God taught me many things. One thing I really remembered. On the way up, I felt rather lonely, and also felt (10 minutes into the tramp due to asthma which made me sound like a sick cow) like going back to the car and forgetting the whole excercise. See, tramping is a bit like the Christian walk. When we make our faith individual, and try to 'go it alone' we often feel depressed, and downtrodden, as there is no one to encourage us to keep going. This is where Christian friends come in. They are there to encourage us to keep going, to rebuke us when we become slack, to laugh when we laugh, to cry when we cry. And of course we do the same for them.  Perhaps the Christian walk should not be done alone. Of course we do have God, but he has provided us with fellowship and a body so we can spur one another on.  On the way back, I took the Billygoat track, and as I set out, I made up my mind I would do it as quickly as I could. So I set out and blitzed the track in 2 hours. I was so stoked. The track is a '4 hour track', so I  was really happy, although my heels were pretty gashed up at the end of it. (Maybe something to do with the fit of jogging that came upon me for a little way).   Letter to the Editor  Very happy today. I got another letter in to the New Zealand Herald.   Here it is:-   Thom James tells the religious to stop forcing their opinions on others, by complaining about advertisements which are offensive to their faith. Then he contradicts himself by telling us, that those who are religious should just put up with the opinions of the secular society they live in, and should adapt accordingly. Why is it ok for the 'secular religion' to impose its views on everyone, when it is not ok for Christians to speak out on issues they feel strongly about. It couldn't be double standards could it?    Once again we are being told to shut up because our views do not conform to so called 'norms'. Once again "Enough already". Now let me predict a number of atheist/secular humanists writing in and saying that secular and religion don't go together. And then cue  other  Christians to write in and define religion (system of faith and worship), and then tell them they are religious. Yes that is a hint already.   Wrestling  Had a great evening before Greek last night. Me Hamish, and Paul checked out this funny as wrestling game for Playstation II. It was very choice. I can't remember it's name though.

        Criticism  I don't like criticism! It can be so discouraging. Sometimes it's fair and other times it is not. Nevertheless that is not why I am writing. I found a great quote today. I shall share it with you.   To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.  - Elbert Hubbard  Criticism is part of being a person of opinions ideas and action! If you want to be loved by all people all the time, wake up, or have no opinions, and make no contraversial decisions. It's also a sure-fire way of never being famous/successful/useful to society.

        Reformed Churches  Our Japan team went to Pukekohe Reformed Church this morning. Very nice to visit a like-minded church. While it was different in some respects, it was good to hear the Word preached faithfully, and be amongst friendly and welcoming people.    Mum  My mum has her operation this Wednesday. Please be a praying.

        The Question  If the question is "Why?" what is the answer?   Jeremiah  I have lately been reading through this wonderful Old Testament prophecy. Some great things I have read.  Of the prophets... 23:28-29 "Their dreams and my truth are as different as straw and wheat. But when prophets speak for me, they must say only what I have told them. My words are a powerful fire; they are a hammer that shatters rocks."

        Imagine  (John Lennon) Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try, No hell below us, Above us only sky, Imagine all the people living for today...  Imagine there's no countries, It isnt hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace...  Imagine no possesions, I wonder if you can, No need for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one, I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one.   Comrade Helen must have been listening to this kind of claptrap for too long.  Verse 1 - Get rid of religion, be secularists, and live for today. Verse 2 - World Government (by the otiose UN and various 'cheeky darkies'?) Verse 3 - No Possessions? Suspiciously like Communist Russia, the state owns everything. Like what we do with redistributing the money of the wealthy/hardworking in New Zealand. Of course greed and possessions go hand in hand, leading to hunger....  He's a dreamer! But unfortunately he is not the only one. Helen and her merry band of Commie's are gradually (?) changing this democracy into something more sinister (a dictatorship?). How dare they make major constitutional change without a mandate! They are arrogant, and all they are interested in is ploughing ahead with their dangerous agendas. Democracy is dying. They pay no heed to the people. They tell us what is good for us. They become parents to all of us. This country is rapidly going down the plughole.  I predict that unless there is a major change in thinking in this country we will lose freedom of speech within the next 30 years. It is already starting. Paul Holmes is an example of this. We will be arrested/shutdown for calling things like homosexuality a sin. We will be silenced for criticising governmen/other religions (with the exception of Christianity). Evil will be called good, and good will be called evil.   If we don't want this to happen we have some serious work to do.   I am scared.

        Raaaa  Raaaaaaaaaaaaa! I needed to say that!   Supreme Court Bill - an abuse of power   (from Maxim's Weekly Email Real Issues)  In a rare front-page editorial, the New Zealand Herald today described the passage of the Supreme Court Bill as an 'act of breathtaking arrogance' and 'nothing short of an abuse of power'. Certainly there is no mandate for this outrageous constitutional change that could be law from next week.   A 63 to 57 vote in favour of the bill (a 52 percent parliamentary majority) is not a sufficient benchmark to pass a law of this importance. Earlier this week, United Future decided to oppose the bill claiming a lack of consultation and public support for the legislation. The Greens are supporting Labour because they share that party's desire to deconstruct the foundations of our Westminster system. In the private sector, the Companies Act requires a 75 percent majority of shareholders to change a company constitution - but no such checks exist in parliament.   Attorney-General Margaret Wilson claims New Zealand is the laughing stock of 'mature' nations, but we need a more robust basis for change than this lame and vague call to 'grow up'. We are witnessing an ideological steamroller in action to sever a 162 year-old right of appeal to an esteemed independent and international court.   There were 315 submissions to the select committee; 40 percent supported the new court and 54 percent wanted to retain the status quo. Among 38 submissions from Maori interests, only 4 supported a Supreme Court. 85 out of 86 local authorities opposed the move, as did 75% of the 103 oral submissions.   Margaret Wilson - a list MP - will control the appointment process. Direct political interference is likely, as is some compromise of the critical separation of the Executive and Judiciary. The court would also make us vulnerable to pressure from a human rights-driven agenda and international law, and will nudge us closer to becoming a republic - perhaps the real motive behind the bill.   Concerned New Zealanders should voice their opposition directly to MPs and in letters to the editor. Maxim's website www.maxim.org.nz has a letter wizard with links to the editor of every paper in the country as well as contact details for each MP. A Citizens' Initiated Referendum has been started which provides a final hope for the public to have a say - we encourage you to sign the petition which is available at: http://www.act.org.nz/action/campaigns/privycouncil/privycouncil_petition.pdf You will need the free Acrobat reader programme to view the petition: you can download it from http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html

       Our family seems to be feeling God's hand heavily at the moment. Everything seems to just be getting worse. It's like you wake up and think, what can make today worse than yesterday. And I don't like living like that. I just want to hibernate and get away from everything.  (Maybe I shouldn't say God's hand, although I do believe in God's sovereignty, it seems that he is allowing our family to undergo many trials)  Well anyway, I'd like to register my sincere disapproval if that counts. I know it's meant to be good for you, but right now it feels very not good.  ok thats me for today.

Abide with me (fast falls the eventide) 3. Rock of Ages cleft for me (let me hide myself....) 4. The battle belongs to the Lord. 5. Lift high the (your?) cross. 6. Man of sorrows. 7. Take my life, and let it be. 8. Make me a captive Lord. 9. God moves in mysterious ways. 10. O God our help in ages past..  Maybe you guys (and girls) have some more suggestions....?

        TT Super Coffee Solution  At Tip Top we use a coffee solution to flavour some of our Ice Cream Products. Anyway it has a reputation for never getting bacteria counts in it. Yesterday I conducted a test on it. I innoculated a straight (and diluted) solution of it with  urlLink Enterobacter aerogenes , and then plated it with various agars. Violet Red Bile Agar (VRBA) takes 24 hours to incubate, so I was able to check my results to day. There were no colony forming units on the VRB plates, which means that the coffee killed the bacterial solution that I added to it. needless to say, I am conducting further tests, which I will brief you on as results come to hand.    Prayer  Today I left my Greek notebook in a plastic bag in the lunchroom. Last time I did this (yes I had to write all my vocab out again) it got chucked in the bin. I only realised I had done this  at the end of the day when I cam to collect it from my locker. I quickly walked down the corridor heading for the stairs to the lunch room, praying as I went. I prayed that God would have preserved my vocab book, as I was praying, a guy came out from one of the side doors and said "Hey Scott" and handed me a plastic bag containing my notebook, and my keys! God is so good. He answered my prayer as I was praying it. I was so grateful.

        A Good Quote from 'East of Eden'  As I mentioned, I am reading 'East of Eden' by John Steinbeck. An interesting read. Here is something that struck me.   "When our food and clothing and housing all are born in the complication of mass production, mass method is bound to get into our thinking and to eliminate all other thinking."    Save Mart  Jono and I have been to Save Mart twice this week. Go second hand clothing man! It's great. Dad reckons I'll never find a wife with my second hand clothes. Haha! Well maybe not one that's going to fritter away precious money on clothes eh?! No but seriously, you can get some nice as clothes very reasonably.   Finally  I'm real busy with preparation for the Japan missions trip. I will be away from 5 December to the 26th, so feel free to steal and borrow the Alfa if you are over 25. Please make sure it has a full tank of gas when I get back. Man it's real stressful, trying to get everything sorted before you go. Aaaarg! Greek has fallen by the wayside. Make sure that you do not totally dessert this blog site. I will be back, and this is not my final post before I go, and neither will my final post before I go be my final post, if you understand what I mean. Finally I must go to bed.

An email went round at work today saying that a silver nissan pulsar had left it's lights on. Anyway at the end of the day I went down to the carpark and attempted to start my car, and found that I had left my lights on. The lights of my kinda silver Alfa Romeo 33ie! Jono being the kind and wonderful person he is did not hesitate to come in from Manurewa and jump start my car. Jono you are a legend of a friend. Thanks.

        Affirmation  Pete has been at C.I.A teaching us about relationship building, and how to get to deeper levels in conversation. All very good stuff. He also showed a way of telling a two minute story from your life with a lesson point to it. Everybody  did one in front of the youth group, and we all 'affirmed' the person who had done it with clapping, and mentioning bits we found enjoyable. I know it probably sounds a bit  urlLink weord  , but it seriously is a good teacher to young people to be encouraging to others. It is also noticeable that they have become more encouraging in other areas! Yay!   A Wise Father  Well I was gutted for my Dad. His letter was cut and edited and stuck in Saturday brevities. Well I shall now unveil them in ther entirity.  1. Happy Families For the Social Development Minister, Steve Maharey to claim that sole-mother families are just as good as the traditional 'nuclear family' of mum, dad and the kids is to deny logic and the overwhelming body of evidence to the contrary.  I am surprised that the ex sociology lecturer from Massey University has allowed his research skills to become so rusty. A study entitled "Why Marriage Matters" co-authored by 13 leading social science scholars conclusively demonstrates that the 'nuclear family is more successful than other 'family' forms'. This is just one of many such reports and studies available to the minister.  Mr Maharey's assertions are both untrue and dismissive of the evidence. International research is clear that the two-parent married family remains society's greatest weapon against poverty, depression, child abuse, crime etc. No amount of politial correctness or spin doctoring can change the facts. S M Kennedy  2. Take your Partner So glad that Charlene Aplin has found another partner. I hear she wants to complete a hairdressers course and then train to be a social worker. What I'm not so ecstatic about is how the Charlenes' of this world and our dopey government expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their 'loose' definitions of what constitutes a family. If Mr Maharey and his government mates continue in their PC stance that all family forms are equal, then Charlene and her newly aquired social worker skills will be in hot demand in the future. S M Kennedy  Nice work Dad.   Quote of the Week  Winnie you get it mate. I was almost rolling on the floor with this one. I know I quoted it before but it's classic.  Mr Peters, well known for his late-night socialising, replied most of her [Turia's] Labour colleagues would be  "three sheets to the wind on a wine biscuit".     Person of the Week  My sister Lou! The bestest sister in the world! You are a real legend! A great encourager, a loyal friend, and the occasional kick up the bum when I muck up. Very good.

        Apologies  I have offended someone recently with my over strong language in some of my recent posts. This person had the grace to email about it personally which I appreciate. So I apologise for any offence caused, as it was not intended. I just happen to feel very strongly about the way things are going at the moment.   Dad  Dad wrote two letters to the NZ Herald today. Keep an eye on the papers, because they are real good letters. Here's hoping that one gets in.   Camp  I booked Tawharanui for the C.I.A camp in 2004 today. Looking forward to that! Memories man.    Fountain Pen  I have purchased myself a reasonably cheap fountain pen. Oh the joys of writing! It's amazing. I actually go to write hand writen letters, and notes now instead of using the computer. I'm almost tempted to chuck the blog, and start a written journal!   Reading  At the moment I am reading:- Jeremiah, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Stupid White Men, East of Eden, and "The Christian Ministry". Having trouble getting through it all though. I think I need to concentrate on one.   The Assasination of Common Sense File  I have just finished reading "Standing Tall", which I have found quite inspiring. Steve Farrar (the dude that wrote it), has a file which he calls "The Assasination of Common Sense File". This will be a new feature of my blog. My first entry into it is  urlLink this.  Well that is the last time I give to these IHC, and CCS! Is that or is that not scary?! It is a very silly idea.

        More Madness I  Check  urlLink this .  And for the lazy:-   "United Future had accepted from the outset that there was a diversity of families in society, and one would not be privileged over another.  "They're clear that they obviously want what they would argue as the traditional family - mum, dad and the kids - as part of the mix.  "They're not asking the commission ... set about to try to make that the preferred family form."  Mr Maharey said traditional families tended not to "hold together all that well in New Zealand". "   United Future you are gutless wonders. If that is all you have achieved in your time in parliament, you have been a waste of space. You are compromisers, and compromisers achieve nothing for the cause. I hope you enjoy Jacob's stew.   More Madness II   Our beloved Turia is  urlLink off her rocker again!    Social issues played a role in Maori health, she said, but people should take a broad view and accept that racism also played a part.  "I have not said that conventional Western medicine is absolutely not appropriate for Maori health. However, I also believe that there are other ways of improving health."     Mr Peters said a sound diet and housing were most important for Maori.  "What racist element in our society is forcing people to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken or Pizza Hut or McDonald's and have Fanta and Coca-Cola by way of refreshments."  He asked if Mrs Turia would accept herself as evidence of what he was saying.  She replied: "I do not think I need to account to Mr Peters for my eating habits, nor do I expect him to account to me for his drinking behaviour."  Mr Peters, well known for his late-night socialising, replied most of her Labour colleagues would be "three sheets to the wind on a wine biscuit".    1. What part of our health system makes it harder due to racism for Maori to get access to it. The word 'tripe' comes to mind. 2. At least Winston has a bit of humour.   More Madness III   Check  urlLink this    Chinese women may be using abortion as a form of contraception, a new study suggests.  Research by Auckland University health academics shows there has been a large rise in the number of Asian women seeking abortions.  "Abortion may be used for family planning rather than as a back up for contraceptive failure," researchers said in a report published in the New Zealand Medical Journal today.   1.

        Steve Maharey   Read  urlLink this . For those too lazy, I will quote some of the significant bits.   " Families are great, says Social Development Minister Steve Maharey, but sole-mother families are just as good as the traditional "nuclear family" of mum, dad and kids. "   "I know of no social science that says a nuclear family is more successful than other kinds. It's whether you have a loving, nurturing family."   "A sole-parent family isn't inadequate, it's the result that matters, so we are not going to reinforce any particular kind of family structure."    Mr Maharey. You are a fool. You are deceitful, and you are talking codswallop. Your words are blatantly untrue, and you speak rebellion against the Lord God Almighty. It is He that has instituted the family. He says what is right; not you or your evil scheming friends. All children need a father and a mother who are committed to each other in marriage fullstop amen, end of story.   Sole-Parent "families" are not ok, and should not be seen as just as good. They are not. Economically and emotionally they are inferior to God's standard. Economically, because the tax payer very often has to compensate for the lack of the father. Emotionally, because all children need a dad to be a role-model of masculinity.  God save us from these idiots.

        So much to tell you!  I have had some cool thoughts recently about what I want to post, but it is late, so a few at a time eh?   Defence  Ok I just watched the Aussie NZ game. Defence seemed to win the game. Ok I am pretty rugby illiterate, but from my perspective the Aussie defence was impregnable. Defence is so important. You might be an average team with offence, but if you have superb defence, you are going places. Well tis a thought anyway. May not be true.   Bible Society Touch Tournament  Jono and I went and played for Trinity (yay go Trinity!) at the Bible Society Touch tournament. The team played quite well, but were thrashed in all games we played. We weren't bad at all, just struggled putting  things together at times. It was all good fun though.    Person of the Week  Steve Farrar author of "Standing Tall - How a Man Can Protect His Family". I will quote some extracts from this wonderful book for men. In fact I will do it now. I can do it. I will do it nine times. Actually I will just do it once.   Quotes of the Week  From the book mentioned above:-   "... a community that allows a large number of young men (and women) to grow up in broken families, dominated by women, never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority, never acquiring any set of rational expectations about the future.... that community asks for and gets chaos."  - Patrick Moynihan as quoted by Steve Farrar.   "A society cannot survive without male leadership. For when male leadership ceases to be a reality in the home, we are only one generation away from anarchy in the streets. This is the direction that our nation is going. If we lose male leadership in Christian families, then this country is finished for sure."   And lastly:-   "I believe that when you look at every major pressing social issue in this country; whether it's teenage pregnancy, child abuse, drive-by shootings, teenage suicide, or the divorce rate, and reduce each of those problems down to their lowest common denominator, you will find in each case the same root cause. That cause is a lack of male leadership."    Men  Men, we really need to put our heads up and start being leaders. But to be leaders we need to be worthy of following. Let's get to it! It's our God given role, let's fulfill it in a godly manner, and start to reverse the social chaos we find our country in.

        Tomorrow   Tomorrow is a very special day. It is so because I am declaring it to be so, and with your support it will be. Tomorrow I propose we celebrate one of the results of diversity. One of the sections of society that is not often given a lot of positive thought. This section of society is one which is directly responsible for all the ills we now face in New Zealand. It is responsible for abuse of children, and women. It is responsible for Maori unemployment and crime. It is responsible for the ill-health of Maori and Pacific Islanders. It is responsible for women having lower pay. It is responsible for failure in education. It is responsible for everything bad, from the toothpaste cap not being on properly to the fact that university education is expensive. In fact blame everything on this group. It might not be true, but at least they’ll sit there and take it, and still pay taxes and be a mainstay to the infrastructure of this country. Of course I am talking about the Middle-Class Heterosexual White Man. Yes Middle-Class Heterosexual White Man. Tomorrow is a day in honour of him who is the root cause of sin in the world. The real story of the fall is as follows:-  God created the world. It was full of mainly women (especially black lesbian women) and few men (but no white men). There was peace harmony and tranquillity with little talking (as indeed there can only be when women rule). Men (and they were mainly black with a few Asians here and there) dutifully followed the directions on home improvement, and gardening, of the head woman Helen. One day Satan tempted a man (named Jim) suggesting that if he decided to take initiative, and do his best, and even try to overthrow Helen, he would know everything. This man fell for the temptation. Instead of knowing all, he found his skin colour had changed to a pale reflection of what it used to be. It was white. Somehow this man multiplied and there became more of these pale skinned sinful creatures. So forever more, white man was a sinful blight on the rest of sinless society. And here we are today still struggling with the sin of Jim, negatively effecting the sinless sections of society.

        Frazzled and Frustrated!  Just finished a hard day at Tip Top. Started at 2, but things got hectic, and thus finished late. I hate finishing late on the late shift, because it puts my sleep patterns funny. I know that if I finish at 10, and get home soon after and go straight to bed, I can continue pretty much as normal. But on hectic days, brain won't slow down when I come home. Oh well.

        Person of the Week  Dad wins! I was having a real good conversation with him the other day. It's great to have such a wise father. And I'm not greasing, because he won't see this!   Quote of the Week   Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.  Oscar Wilde   A Good Woman  Well I'm sure that caught 50% of my readers attention.   I have noticed and read with increasing interest, the letters to the New Zealand Herald editor written by Amanda McGrail. She has some very good things to say. I have already quoted her on my blog. Check this letter out:-   Alexis Stuart's call to dissolve the Ministry of Women's Affairs is right on the money. What makes a few women in Wellington think it is their noble task to define womanhood for the rest of us?   That's exactly what they are tring to do, lest too many women make the "wrong" choice - like being a mother, for instance; or even worse, being a wife.  They want me to choose power, but I'd prefer love any day, and I suspect most honest women feel the same. Bring on the privatisation of female identity I say. Ruth Dyson can keep her "economic autonomy" and her emotional wilderness all to herself.

        George Bush  I constantly hear of his lack of intelligence (IQ), his illiteracy, and various other attacks on his character. Isn't it so easy to dismiss someone by throwaway lines like these. I would suggest that if he was illiterate and stupid, he wouldn't be where he is today. Furthermore, IQ does not equate with 'thinking'. I know some very 'intelligent' people who cannot think. And then I know some people of average/below average intelligence, who are thinkers.   What I admire about Bush is his strength of convictions. See  urlLink this . Here we have a man who is willing to commit possible political suicide, for what he believes is right. God bless him, and may he continue in power to a second term.

        Being Straight Up  Today we are in an age of beating around the bush. I am attempting to speak my thoughts (in a gracious manner) and not lie by pretending I think things are ok when they are not. For example, at work when people start bagging George Bush (whom I unashamedly admire) I intend to tell them what I think of him. It's kind of something I don't really do with people other than my friends, but I intend to start being honest with all people in all areas. (I think my usual silnce is to do with wanting to please everyone and wanting everyone to like me... which explains why I don't have a problem speaking my mind with friends, because they already do like me.)

        Tip Top Touch Team  Well we got thrashed. 6 - 0. We had heaps of subs which was good, but most of us only got 5 - 10 mins max. One of our real dumb moments was subbing when the opposition was on the offensive. Oh great! Give them a hole so they can score. But we weren't the types to let one failure stop us from repeating the same mistake! Oh no!   I had 5 minutes of glory on the field. My first minute on, I gave away a penalty, and in my last, I scored the try that wasn't. Gutted. I had cut through the defence, and got to what I thought was the line, and touched down. But no! The cones did not mark the try line! No way, they marked the 5 metre line. But on the whole quite a positive outcome. It means there is only one way we can go..... well; here's hoping anyway.

        So Much To Do  There are so many things I want to do, but I just keep getting put off by the big list, because I can't ever see me getting it done. I'm intimidated by what I want to do. I feel like I am achieving next to nothing at the moment, and at the same time being so busy I am physically drained. It's very weird. I want to be useful/have an impact on society, but feel powerless in the face of such evil. Perhaps smaller targets or at least smaller projects are easier to attain, thus giving more satisfaction and sense of achievement when they are attained. I think investing time in people can pay huge dividends. I've already seen this in a small way through leadership in C.I.A youth. Not only this but I have seen God's power and his faithfulness in answering prayer. It is easy to become despairing as we see the battle raging and being lost on all fronts. But there are pockets where truth is being upheld and is winning. And it needs to be remembered that truth cannot fail. In the end there will be victory, for God cannot be shaken, and he scoffs at evildoers.       (I just re-read that paragraph, and there is a lot of hopping round in it; but that's ok. I'll leave it like that, because it explains exactly how I feel.)

        Trogdor  Trogdor seems off his tucker at the moment. Perhaps this could be to do with the fact that I am missing four fish? I don't know but he seems to be more active chasing others round but less hungry.    Quote of the Week   Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all.  Sam Ewing   Speakers in the Alfa  The speakers that were originally in the Alfa I just bought are 'lacking........at best'. This intolerable situation will soon change. Instead of two 'Ark class speakers' I have purchased four speakers off the blogger (or is non-blogger more appropriate) Jono, and will probably install them at some point in the next week. Jono has already installed my Blaupunkt CD player. Cheers Jono. Soon Brahms' Clarinet quintet will be pumping in the Alfa! Yay!

        Agendas  Everybody has an agenda. That's what dad says to me. It's an interesting thought. What is my agenda? Why am I writing this? What is your agenda.. why are you reading it? Why do you do the things you do? I wish I could see everyone's agendas. That would make life so easy.   But I can't so I just wonder. And I think about it often. What really makes the people I know tick?  I want to conform my own agendas to the only worthwhile one. That of God's. I want to see things as they really are. I want to be caught up with his good news so much that I can't help but tell it.

        Of Japan  It is seriously hard to get at the computer here. Sorry.   Last night Kensuke (the youth pastor here) Rosa, Lou, and one of the Japanese guys from Chiba (near Tokyo) and myself had a bit of a jam session in the church. It was pretty cool. Kensuke is an awesome pianist. We played many of the old favourites, like `Shepherd of my soul, `Saviour like a shepherd lead us`, etc etc. Rosa taught some of us a Samoan slap dance. It was the jams! Although Lou being the hard out she is ended up with bruises all over her hands. Hahaha....lemons.  On Friday we travelled up to a fishing village on the coast which looked out to Hokkido. Freezing weather, snow right up to the water. On the way back we had a massive as snow fight. We were in the front van and we asked Martin to stop the van so we could have a snow fight. Lou, Rosa, Geraldine, Madeline and myself were in the van, and we decided to work as a team and punish the other guys. Martin stopped our van on the side of the road, and went and told the other vans who stopped behind us some cock and bull story about the van overheating. Meawhile we had all got out of the van and were secretly stockpiling and manufacturing snowballs at the front of the van. Janet came at us with a lone snowball, and beat a hasty retreat after being pummeled with copious quantities of snowballs. Others faced a similar fate. Anna looked much the worse for wear after her brief encounter with our `blitzkrieg`, as did Jesse. It was with a great sense of satisfaction that our team regrouped in the van.  God bless ya`ll and have an awesome Christmas. Scotty

        Crotchety  I am a little crotchety today. Things are starting to get to me. Partially because I was kept awake late last night. It`s taking a big effort for me to be pleasant to everyone! But I will be pleasant to you my long suffering readers.    Rest Home  We sung at a rest home today. It was sad. Here before us were people standing on the edge of the precipice `Christless eternity`, and they didn`t know it. If this doesn`t make you sad,what will?

        Raaa  This computer has a thing for Japanese characters. The Japanese below should read `avoid`.   Pleasantaries  It is very nice weather over here. The snow has almost all melted now. Aomori is quite a nice (see post on nice) place. It is built on a large plain surrounded by about 270 degrees of hills/snowy mountains. The harbour and sea surrounds the rest of this large plain. It would be even nicer if it houses and man made structures didn`t fill up the whole valley. Oh well.   Missing Home  I am really missing the wide open spaces of home. One of the first things I plan when I arrive home is a hike in the bush. There is nothing like that here seemingly. Even the `country` is pretty built up. What was scary were the train rides up from Tokyo. Looking out the window, so much of the country was built upon. I need some space, and the beauty of God`s creation.  Oh yeah.... I miss you guys too!

        Hello!  Gidday peoples. Finally I get a chance to use the computer.It is in reasonably high demand, when it is actually working. A few important things have happened since I last posted. Yay for the Americans! They finally caught that evil wretch Saddam. Good job. All of Iraq celebrates! Well all except Saddam`s home town.  In Japan news, things are ticking along nicely. We are now in Aomori. Things are starting to get quite busy, and some of us (including yours truly) have a had a bit of sickness. Nothing that a bit of sleep and overdosing on Vitamin C can`t cure. There was quite a bit snow on the ground when we first came up here but the weather has been real warm, and most of the snow has melted.  The team is getting on reasonably well, with only a few injuries from fights.    Quote of the Week   `I will show her who is the man around here`  from film Bad Attitudes （ａｖｏｉｄ）

        Sendai  Well we're off to Sendai today. We have a concert there tonight, and then we are cruising up to Aomori. Apparently it is a bit chilly there, and there has been snow recently.   We went to Disneyland on Monday. I must say it was a pretty good experience, and it was amazing just seeing the lengths the designers had gone to to make you suspend disbelief and feel as if you are in another world. On the down-side, the wait-times for the rides were prohibitive. Most rides took over an hour of queing, which was frustrating. However we sang songs to pass the time, which seemed to amuse the people around us.   The night parade was especially spectacular. Lights and sound and (you get the idea...), but all in all, if you want good rides and fun go to Rainbows End! Haha.   C.I.A  It's great to have a little break from C.I.A, but I am really rearing to get back into it. I have some ideas which I am enthusiastic to implement. Breaks always do that to me, althought generally I don't complete half of what I want to when I get back, because of...procrastination.

        Saturday  Interesting incidents:-  1) We met a man biking down the road shaving. As he past us he did the Japanese 'bob/bow thing. You had to be there but it was terribly funny.   2) The 1st concert went very well. I think we really exceeded our (realistic) expectations, which was really nice. We talked with some really cool folk, and one couple are coming down to NZ next year. Another guy I was talking to gave me a couple of Japanese cd's which was pretty cool.    Sunday  Church was really different. It was quite formal, and had sort of a more ritualistic feel. For example there was lighting of candles at the beginning of the service and snuffing them out at the end. Also there are nice stained glass windows, and the building has a real 'church' look.   Peter preached and was translated as he went. So that was a new experience. It breaks the sermon up into bite size sentences. Sometimes the Japanese is much longer than the English, which does make you wonder what extra apologies/corrections/explanations/"what he really meant was' etc are going on.  We went into "Electric City" today. Wall to wall people, and so many good goodies to buy, but unfortunately it was Sunday, so I had to restrain myself. We talked to a couple of people. One was an older man who was trying to learn English, but found us hard to understand because he was learning in an American accent. Another was one of the girls handing out tissues. For those of you who haven't heard of this, there are people over here who are paid to hand out little packets of tissues. Some of our team members kept coming back, and some had 8 or 12 little tissue packets. Also we went into this lift which said it could hold 9 people, but we had it beeping with 6 of us on board. Fatties.  Please remember "if it's supposed to be possessive it's just i-t-s, but if it's gunna be a contraction it's i-t-apostrophe-s." ..........."scalliwag"

        Japan  Blogging to you from Ichikawa. Te flight over here was long, but not too tedious. First impressions of this country are all positive, although as Jesse rightly puts it, it is a bit of a sensory overload. It's funny seeing advertising with Japanese people in the pictures. Also of note is the nature of the Japanese people we have seen so far. Amazingly polite describes them. It's quite unlike walking around in New Zealand. One guy in a suit carried my sister's suitcase down a flight of stairs, and another carried Madeline's.   Also the streets are really different. They are sort of a cross between a street and a footpath. Really funny.  The food so far has been super great. We had these sort of bun things, with custardy cream in them. Oiiiiiii! Jesse and I are sharing a room. We have matresses on the floor. Really comfortable, and the duvets are reeeeeally warm.   OOOO! I forgot. The trains. At each station, there is this cheesy music kinda like "do do do dee dee da" (if ya know what I mean), and then this voice in Japanese and then a real cheesy american accent telling you what the next stop is, and to get on the train before the doors close. The trains arrive on time (!) and are clean fast, and comfortable. Gotta say I like the nice backside heaters that the seats have. A nice touch.   Over and Out!

        Life Changing Events  Is there such a thing as a life changing event? I can think of one, although when it comes to others, my mind goes blank. Is any single event (apart from the one) something which is enough to completely change a life? Is not the changing of a life, one small but determined step at a time. Never go to something expecting to be changed by it. Go to something, and then change yourself because of it. We are the product of our decisions (to a point), and each little decision we make, creates the person we are. So I would probably say there are few real life changing events. A changed life is more about sweat and determination rather than a single event.    One Man  Can one man make a difference? I was discussing this with a friend some time back on a bush walk. (Incidentally bush walks are very good for conversation.) Are we in a world in which it is increasingly more difficult for one man to make a difference? In past times, we had our Napoleon's, our Washington's etc. Is it harder today to make a significant difference in the world? I don't know the answer, but I feel swamped, and powerless to make any difference in this world, except in the small sphere God has placed me in. Hopefully there I can be of use, and maybe if all of us Christians do the same, some headway may be gained.

        Stuff I meant to post but I didn't but now I am.  Hmm that title reminds me of a song. "Somebody told me that you're so stoopid, but I didn't believe them, but now I believe them." But anyway today I am going to post stuff I should have already posted.   Work  An interesting thing happened the other day. Not that something interesting happening is something of note. My existence is interesting and I don't like the concept of boredom. Perhaps I should say something unusual happened the other day.   Anyway. I went to my locker one morning, and found that my combination lock was gone. Weord. Especially weird since I had definately locked it the night before. Since I don't keep anything of value in my locker, I thought little of it. However the next day I went to my locker to get my overalls and found that my combination lock was on it again. "Oh good" I thought. But it was not all good. The combination had been changed, which is easy enough to do with these locks. Thankfully I got help from an expert lock technician (read locker thief unless you are PC) who showed me how to work out combinations. Very interesting.   Taumaranui  Jono is now back. He drove up from Wellington on Tuesday. I decided to drive down and meet him. It was a beautiful trip. I loved the scenery. We met in Taumaranui and had dinner. Nice litttle town actually. I wouldn't mind living there. I even picked up a hitchhiker on the way down. The Alfa seems to manage hills better than other cars I've taken for drives. It effortlessly tore up hills even in 5th. Nice. Jono had a minor accident on the way to meeting me, but thankfully, both him and the car were ok to get back. God is very good.   Tennis  I gave my little brother James (11) a game of tennis the other morning. Wowsers. He is good. I did manage to win, but he is an excellent player for his age. I'd actually like to play doubles with him. If anyone wants a game let me know!

        Grand Canyon  Check A12 of the Herald, and then read on.   Don't be lazy now.....   I read Andrew Gumbel's comment about the creationist book on the Grand Canyon with great interest. I loved the way that it 'scientifically' dismissed the creationist perspective without providing any evidence or reason for it being an 'absurd theory' and ‘anti science’ other than it disagreed with broadly accepted interpretations. If the theory is so absurd as he and many scientists would say, why do they bother to publicly attack it and attempt to discredit it? Perhaps it isn’t as absurd as they are telling us. The only 'anti-science' viewpoints that I could see in the article were the viewpoints held by 'rationalists' and 'scientists' who seem to think their theory is fact and above all criticism. That's not science guys.

        BBC's silent treatment  urlLink here    14.01.2004    The BBC is to broadcast a live radio performance of an orchestra playing four-and-a-half minutes of silence.   John Cage's seminal work 4'33" will be the highlight of a concert on Radio 3.   The piece consists of four minutes and 33 seconds' worth of nothing. In readiness for the performance, Radio 3 bosses will have to switch off their emergency back-up system - designed to cut in when there is an unexpected silence on air.   The work has never been performed by an orchestra or broadcast on national radio in Britain before.   The BBC described Cage's piece, written in 1953, as "ambient silence".   It will be broadcast as part of the station's annual Composer Weekend.   TV viewers will be able to tune into BBC Four an hour later and watch the orchestra "performing" the piece.    Well for goodness sake. The words 'lost' and 'conned' come to mind. Presumably you'll have all the snobby musicians attending/listening, and talking about it as if it were some great work of art. "Oh I liked it better when the London Symphony performed it." Yeah go on.

        Quote of the Week    Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.  Mark Twain   Goals  For those of you who don't know me, and couldn't tell I wasn't serious in my last post......I think goals/resolutions are a wonderful idea. Getting around to them is another thing. However when you've got Dad on your back like I did, they better be forthcoming. So I have come up with my list of goals for 2004.   My English teacher once wrote on an essay of mine "Say more with less". It was a great help. More delving, less froth. Less width more depth. Well that is a maxim that can be transferred from my writing to my life. Do less, but do it better. So this year I am cutting all the things I have been burdened with in the past year. I am refocusing on where I think God has called me, and I will put the time that I have gained (by cutting out other activities) doing a better job of the things I am doing.  Here is my goal list for 2004:-  Spiritual ·	I will read through a minimum of 12 good solid Christian books this year. ·	I will aim to read and study a book of the Bible per month. ·	Every month on the last day of the month I will crack open the old prayer box. Intellectual ·	I will aim to get a good understanding of Excel. Work ·	Work my hardest to God’s glory, not for men.  ·	I would like heaps of opportunities to share my faith, and I want to take the opportunities I get. Physical ·	At least once per week I will go for a walk of at least 30 minutes. Financial ·	I aim to add $x to my term deposit savings account. ·	I will keep an expenditure record to insure I stick to my financial plan for 2004. C.I.A. ·	This year I want to see the C.I.A touch team set up along with T’s and weekly practices. ·	Continue the relationship focus of C.I.A, but get to deeper levels with the young guys ·	I want to see C.I.A become a more servant focused group. ·	I want to see friends of the young people beginning to attend regularly. ·	This year I want to encourage young people to attend evening church. ·	To find two young people and begin to train them up for leadership. Other ·	I will continue writing my personal journal.   All attempted relying on God's grace.

        Happy New Year  Happy New Year everyone! God bless you all.  As yet I haven't made any New Year's Resolutions. I am finding this difficult. You see, the trick is to set these resolutions with low expectations. To many people forget this. They try the biggies, like stop smoking, exercise three times a day etc etc.... and  when  they fail they get depressed. Why not be easy on yourself, and set low expectations which you won't be so upset about when you constantly fall short of them. Like "This year I hereby declare that I shall at some points of time not smoke".   Alternatively set such vacuous resolutions, that you can't help but keeping them. For example "This year I plan to watch less TV." That my friends is a very sneaky resolution. Less TV eh? Less TV than what?  Or how about "This year I plan to be more proactive." More proactive than what or whom? No matter what you do you can be assured that you must be keeping it.

        Breaking Up Is So Hard To Do  The split was acrimonious. I wanted some space. I needed space. I got it.  However as time went by I realised that our differences were few, and we really couldn't part just like that. We'd been together for over 6 months, and although there was the occasional cross word, generally we agreed on things.  So the long and short of it is that after a bit of counselling, me and my blog are together again, and stronger than ever.   Letter to the Herald  In  urlLink this  perspectives piece, Jane Norton (whom has frequented my blog and caused a stir previously) tells of Noah being raped by his sons in the Old Testament.  Here is my letter:-   I would have thought that as an Auckland lawyer, Jane Norton would ensure that she gets her facts straight, however, not so. In her perspectives piece on censorship, she tells us of the Old Testament tale of Noah being raped by his sons. One wonders if this is the "Norton" translation of the Old Testament, because it sure isn't in any of the translations I have. It is great to have free speech and dialogue, but it is important that we also get the facts right.   Scott Kennedy Manurewa    Alfa  Has been running like a goat, but has had a bit of a tune up and is purring. Look out for it in a town near you.    MRI Scan  Mum's MRI scan results were given to us today. They had thought the cancer had moved into the spine, but fortunately they were wrong. Praise God.

        Dad Attacks the Humanists  ‘Religious’ Schools   I am amazed that Paul Litterick, Secretary NZ Association of Rationalists and Humanists, fails to see that public state schools are also ‘religious’ in nature. So called secular schools espouse the humanist belief that man (individually or collectively), not God, determines values, and that these values are based upon prevailing circumstances. Humanists enthusiastically, dare I say even ‘religiously’, seek to remake the world in man’s image.  Nobody thinks without making assumptions. Those assumptions are a person’s religion. It makes no difference whether God or man says those assumptions are true, as long as people accept them without question. No religious leader ever spoke more dogmatically than humanists speak. Yet in the name of church – state separation humanists have largely censored from textbooks all religious doctrines but their own. Not all religions are institutionalized in churches. Not all sectarians believe in the supernatural. Not all catechisms are theistic.  The real problem is not one of ‘religion’ but choice. All taxpayers contribute to the funding of education and should therefore be entitled to send their children to a ‘religious’ school that supports their beliefs.   Shane Kennedy (in reply to a member of the rationalists and humanists association who said that only state schools are free of dogma and should be supported with government funding.)

        Quote   Those who live by the sword... get shot by those who don't  I got this one from Hannah Leslie.   Dan and Michelle's for dinner  I did not as the heading suggests eat Dan and Michelle's house. However I did attend a dinner at Dan and Michelle's house. And a very good cook is Michelle. She made hamburgers, and potato wedges. Very yumy. Me and Dan got to a lot of interesting talking. The results of which will probably be published on one or both of our blogs in the near future.

        Brash - from Maxim "Real Issues"  Special rights for Maori - and the UDHR   Don Brash's Orewa speech has sparked discussion about Maori rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), written in 1948, assumed that human rights are universal. They apply to everyone equally. They are not a means to right past wrongs but to prevent future ones.   If some Maori have been treated unjustly by the state in the past - and they have - those injustices must be put right. The Waitangi Tribunal was established to achieve that. But we still have a problem. Human rights theory has become about the protection of groups, particularly if a group is believed to have suffered past injustices. The Prime Minister adopts this position in an article on the Treaty in The Press (19 February).   The traditional view, and certainly Dr Brash's view, is that the law is about protecting individuals. For hundreds of years that has been the basis of common law. The Prime Minister confuses individual equality before the law with group identification. Dr Brash, following his understanding of law, claims that people in need are more justly treated as individuals than members of a group.   Underlying the debate between the leaders is a huge philosophic and legal problem. Groups are political constructs. Group identities might seem real enough, but they are shadowy formulations and deeply at odds with our cultural imperative to treat individuals as individuals, regardless of their ethnic background. The fixation with "group identity" is, in fact, an attempt to create a different kind of society - one where dignity resides in group identity rather than in our understanding of common humanity as envisaged in the UDHR.    Brash's 'Lucky' Break  I was thinking (strange I know) that Don Brash was mad to go to Waitangi. And then I heard the news about mud being chucked on him, and I had hope. Here is a politician who has a brain, and might just have a chance against Helen. Excellent work brother. And no I do not think his speech is divisive. It is naive to call it so. To treat people equally has never been divisive.    Maori Affairs  From  urlLink here    "Back off, back off," a policeman told the protesters. "Tell your people to back off."   The eyeball contact continued as protesters harangued police, telling them to "f... off, this is our land".   As the confrontation continued attention was diverted to a lone protester who had climbed 40m to the top of a tree where he lashed a Maori sovereignty flag.   He drew cheers of support from the protesters as he waved at them from the tree top.....................  He left the flag tied to the top branch and when the protesters were told it was flying far higher than the New Zealand flags on the pole, there was resounding cheer from the protesters.      And that my friends is why there will never be peace in New Zealand. The more you give the worse it will get. What they want is something I will never give. This is my country and I ain't leaving. I belong here; it is  my  home.  One fellow rung up talkback the other day and said that there was nothing good brought about by colonization.... nothing. Presumably he forgot about the telephone.   Colonialism  It's not all bad. Schools might have brainwashed us to think so, but it's not that black and white. More on this later... maybe.   Brainwashing In Schools  You know, recently I have become aware of how brainwashed some of my aquaintances have become. Not all mind, but some, especially the ones who have gone only to state schools. I think my dad is responsible for the way I think. In saying this I mean that I believe the reason I have a Christian worldview is because dad taught me. But it wasn't mainly through a sit down and write down what I say method of teaching. It was through conversation and discussion around the table or in his office. It's great to have a thinker for a father. He really 'sees' behind the obvious into the underlying.  Peter Boyd also has a role to play for helping me fight the university brainwashing. Indeed I never wrote one essay to please my markers in my time at uni. I always wrote from a Christian perspective. Fight against the world! Everything is a spiritual battle. Every movie, every article, every speech is part of it. It is either for or against God. Everyone has a message, and it's either for or against God. Who are you going to serve? It may be the devil or it may be the Lord but you're gunna have to serve somebody. Thanks Bob.   Touch   urlLink Dan  Jono (I'm not linking him because he doesn't blog anymore) Dwaine, James, Mark, Matthew, Boss, George Cain and myself played touch at hillpark today. I felt faint after about two minutes on because the sun. But in the end it turned out to be a cracker game. Try of the day had to be Dan's run away (after sneakily running through the defence) try. The game for me and James was topped of by a sour chill (recommend these for a hot day) (thanks Tip Top I'll have a raise), and cold coke. Mmmm. And that my friends is what Waitangi day should be about.

        As Promised  Good old Dora  wrote to the Herald about focus on NZ Idol, when other musicians had been honing their craft for years. Yes. Well this folks is what I want to talk about. Why is it that the public finds mediocrity (in this case the people on NZ Idol) more interesting than brilliance. Now some may say I am biased, and that those in NZ Idol are brilliant. I find it hard to compare this 'brilliance' with brilliance that is trained to the milli-second, the kind of brilliance that takes 6 hours a day for years. Why is it that people will hear  Chopin's "Minute Waltz" and apathetically say 'oh yeah', or even worse 'boring'; but they will hear Robin (who's tuning is lacking at best) on New Zealand Idol, and go wild? Is there more to the modern music scene than music? It seems so. Now to qualify this. I am a fan of some modern music, and listen often to contemporary Christian music, although in complete honesty I find that my mind and emotions are far more stimulated by classical music, particularly by Beethoven and Brahms. I challenge you if you have not really tried before to start listening to classical music. It takes an effort at first. Perhaps that is why it isn't popular. But the effort you spend listening to it eventually becomes less and less, and you open up to yourself a whole new world of possibilities which can provide many hours of stimulation, soothing... or riling up if you choose the right pieces!

        Prayer Meeting  Just been at the Covenant's monthly prayer meeting. Hmm. There were about 20 people there. Max. Ok I'll count. Bother, lost count, but it wasn't higher than 20. I was the only person between the age group of 12 to 35. This in a church that is over 200 people. It's quite sad.    Letters to the Editor   From yesterday's Herald:-  Palestine caught in a corner  Palestinian threats of retaliation against the killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin are empty and hollow. It's not that I think the Palestinians won't kill more people. They've already got a written declaration of war that demands the destruction of Israel and the annihilation of Jews everywhere, so what have they got left to threaten?  If Israel had not killed Yassin, Palestinians would definitely have killed more people. So what has Israel got to lose?  This has nothing to do with whether you support Israel, Palestine or neither. The Palestinians have boxed themselves into a corner where any further threats mean nothing.  Leonard Bloksberg, Remuera   And my comment: Indeed.   Young musicians amaze  In a packed Auckland Town Hall we attended the Young Musician of the Year Grand Final. Fourth row from the front, we were surrounded by TV cameras all focused on three amazing young soloists, two violinists and a cellist.  Kate Hawkesby introduced the judges and said that if we, the audience, "lobbied hard enough" then the performances might be shown on TV One. Why should we have to lobby? It was amazing and deserved a direct broadcast.  Why do the arts still take a back seat to sport? Why do we have so much focus on NZ Idol when these musicians have been honing their craft for years?  Even viewers not interested in classical music would have been mesmerized by these performances. My two young students from Papatoetoe Intermediated were.  Dora Whitlock, Remuera    And again I say: Indeed. More on this later.

        Israel and Palestine  Israel has assassinated Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. Naughty naughty Israel. And bad America. I don't know why, but we better say bad America because they are always bad for some reason. And ohh why not bad Mr Bush too while we are at it. Tut tut tut. Israel; you need to learn to live in peace with your neighbour.  For those who would agree with that last sentence, check  urlLink this .  According to this Herald article:-  " Palestine lost her spiritual father," said Khaled Abdu, one Gazan among an endless stream of mourners. "We lost a great hero and an irreplaceable leader ".   So who was this man? Again the Herald says:-   Yassin joined the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic movement dedicated to the spread of Islam, while a student in Egypt. In 1987, he became the spiritual leader of Hamas, the Brotherhood's Palestinian military wing, sworn to Israel's destruction.   In 1991, Yassin was sentenced to life in prison for the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers.    In the paper version of the Herald today, we read of Yassin:- that he said it would be " acceptable to establish a Palestinian state in the West Bankand Gaza, to be used as a temporary base to destroy Israel. "  This man is seen as a spiritual leader of Islam and of the Palestinians. Well there we have our problem. He is no hero at all. What hero can be leader of an organisation that incites people to encourage their children to be sacrifices in their bloody war against other innocent civilians who happen to live in Israel? This question brings another similar one to mind:- What parent would encourage their son or daughter to kill themselves and others, and be glad when it was done? When will Israel and Palestine be at peace? I suspect never unless Israel is wiped out.

        Assassination of Common Sense File  Thursdays entry belongs to this file. I should have introduced it as such.   Alfa  The Alfa is back on the road again, with the rust being fixed most meritoriously by  urlLink Auckland Panel and Paint . I was very happy with the work done, and particularly that my car was vacuumed and dusted inside, and the tyres were cleaned. Very good service. The guy that owns it, is a friend of Malcolms, and goes to Buckland's Beach Reformed Church. So anyway, it should now get a warrant when it's due (next month), and shouldn't (please God) cost me too much money for a while.   The Plan  The plan is to gop hiking in a couple of weeks time. Should be good. Haven't been away for a while. It's the Hunua's, or the Kauranga Valley that's calling, I can't quite make out which at this stage.    Book of the Month  I am half way through Reason to Believe by R.C. Sproul. 'Tis a good book, and a very easy read. Not only that, it's about a 7 on the  'put a the the book a down scale' , where 1 is 'This book is best used as a paper weight on my desk', and 10 is 'This book's cover has been grafted into the skin of my fingers'.

        Choke Gasp Aaarg   - from Real Issues, Maxim Institute  "Sing-a-long" a mockery   A tax-payer funded "sing-a-long" course raises issues about the accountability and strategic direction in New Zealand's tertiary institutions, as well as providing a good chuckle.   Tairawhiti Polytechnic in Gisborne has reportedly been paid $11 million of tertiary funding to provide a free eight week course to "enhance learning of Maori language". Students once enrolled are given their own waiata songbook and then asked to sing along with songs on the radio from the comfort of their own home.   Who is going to check that students sing? How will we know if they have sung correctly? What will constitute passing the course? No problem. There is no qualification at the end of the course, no external regulation, no record of pass rates and no record of whether people even complete the course.   An estimated one quarter of Gisborne's population was enrolled in the course last year. Minister for Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey has stated that he will act on these kinds of issues as soon as they come to his attention. In light of the projected $115 million "blowout" in funding for community education this year, the end of the "sing-a-long" could be near.

        June 27  I will be preaching my first 'in church service' sermon on Sunday the 27th of June. This is a good step on the road to ministry. Please pray for me as I prepare this.    Trogdor's House Shift  Trogdor has moved house. Or rather Trogdor's house has been moved. Matthew and I moved the cave to one corner of the aquarium, and put lush vegetation on the outside of it. He has taken this to be his new home.    Quote of the Week   Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.  Martin Luther King Jr.

        C.I.A  I often come back from youth group on saturday nights really upset or down. As leader, you tend to have to deal with things that others might not know, that can just make you really wonder what God is doing. I feel so upset sometimes for the spiritual state of some of the young people. I really hurt inside for them. And it seems that even though I cry out to God for them, that he doesn't answer in the way that would seem best to me. But I am not God, and God knows best. I just wish that not one of them would depart from the path that leads to life, that all would be saved.

        Alfa  The Alfa is going in for rust repairs next week on Monday. $1222 . Hmmm. I must love my Alfa. It's the only rust on the whole car, and it's in the boot of all places. The rest of the car is sweet as, so I don't know what the deal is with that. I'll keep you informed, as I know you all love the Alfa as much as I do. I suspect this is the last major work that will be needed on it for quite sometime, but that statement in itself could be asking for trouble.   Restoring A Relationship  This is from "A Purpose Driven Life".   1. Talk to God before talking to the person. 2. Always take the initiative. 3. Sympathize with their feelings. 4. Confess your part in the conflict. 5. Attack the problem, not the person. 6. Cooperate as much as possible. 7. Emphasize reconciliation, not resolution.  Good stuff, and stuff I want to use in my life, and suggest others use. I have been aware of many interpersonal conflicts in the church recently, and from now on, I am going to suggest this as a way of sorting things out. Sometimes people don't want to sort things out, but this is an un-Christian attitude. We must always want to restore a relationship.

        Dry Ice  We had some spare dry ice floating round at work the other day. So........... we utilised the opportunity like preschool kids. Here are some cool activities you can try when you come across some:-  1) Stick some down the drain and then put the plug over the top. You get sudden bursts of 'steam' lifting the plug up and down, much like the lid of a pot with boiling water.  2) Stick in a beaker, add water, add detergent. Check out those MASSIVE bubbles.  Well there was plenty more to try, but I won't bore you with all the variations on a theme.    Amazing Grace  Dwaine, Jono and I performed a "NZ idol" attempt at this on Monday night after everyone had left the church. It actually sounded pretty good even though we were mucking around. For your information I was NOT singing, but rather pianoing. We were just going hard, because there was no one to be embarassed in front of. Sometimes when you muck around it sounds better than when you are serious.

        Bible Verse  Rom 12:2   Don't be like the people of this world, but let God change the way you think. Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him.    Probably quite relevant to the discussion of men in leadership. If I'm being to cryptic, do tell me.   People  It's all about people. The Christian life that is. For how can we become more like Christ, develop the fruit of the Spirit, and live for others if we do not demonstrate these things in our relationships.    Touch  Twas a great game of touch last night. Some beautiful tries. Jono scored a most impressive one, as did Mark. Also impressive was the speed of Methane Ethan. The defence however was lacking...... at best.

        Plain  It has been a concern of mine for a long time. Chocolate is a flavour, so is Caramel, but Vanilla is labelled as plain. This is a travesty of justice. How dare we do vanilla such a disservice. I demand reparations for the damages done. Vanilla ice cream is not plain ice cream. It's not as if chocolate is vanilla ice cream with chocolate added to it IS IT!? NO! Raa. Vanilla is a flavour in it's own right. And it is my favourite flavour. So don't anyone dare be calling it plain. There is nothing like freshly extruded vanilla ice cream. Mmmm. And by the way. Hokey Pokey ice cream is  not  vanilla flavoured ice cream with bits of junk in it. No. It's hokey pokey flavoured. Raaa and don't you forget it.   Jobs  I am looking at finding another job. I'll keep you posted.   Time for Men to Lead  I am heartened to see young men in our church starting to take things seriously. The lack of male leadership in  the church  today is something I am really concerned about. And by  the church  I mean the church in the Western world.  A side issue is the lack of male leadership in the family. What does please me though is a number of guys I have talked to lately wanting to do something about it, but not only wanting to, they are doing things about it.  Great.

        BBC  As in  urlLink Berean Bible Church . Well a letter arrived for me containing some of their guff. However I don't know who sent it to me or why. However, I have been told that the NIV is bad, and I shouldn't use it. Don't tell them I occasionally use the Contemporary English Version - they may have a paroxysm. On the other hand the King James Version is God's word without error.   Anyway.. the guys who made up these pamplets which I got sent are really abrasive. Let me give some examples:-  "The Greek text from which the NIV comes was produced by a couple of Mary worshipping Catholics..." "By the way, all you "Russelites" (Jehovah Witnesses to the uninformed)..."  It always worries me when a group sets themselves up as right on something, and everyone else has it wrong. To define a group by what it does not agree with sets off warning bells. Maybe there is something wrong with me, but it worries me.   What does make me laugh though, is that on the sheet I was given, they tell me three things about them that should make me want to visit them. Firstly there is no religion, then there is no tradition of men, but the third just takes the cake. There is no denominationalism. However by saying this they are making themselves a distinct denomination. They are defining their 'group' not so much in terms of who they are with, but who they are not with. Quite ironic.  Pity for them that some things they said were true and good.

So I will be careful....  The organisers of the Hikoi did not think too carefully. Perhaps if they had, they would not have organised the walk across the Harbour Bridge. This has probably cost Auckland into the millions in lost productivity. Not only that it has ticked off many people who may well have otherwise supported the protestors. As I understood, the walk was fairly short, and buses transported the group to a place not far from the bridge. Why could they have not bused across the bridge and carried on from there? Grandstanding perhaps? Well I think (and hope) it has backfired.

        Hello All My Chappies!  Yes it has been a long time.   In answer to some of your questions:-   1) The walk took between 2.5 and 3 hours. I don't know the exact time. But I wasn't aware of it feeling a long time. It was pleasant so I wasn't thinking of the time too much.  2) I would love company Dan! We must work something out sometime. Also haven’t done Clevedon with you for a while. Let me know if you want to cruise there sometime.  3) And in answer to the perplexing question of the "About Me" being empty on the side there. I have nothing to say about me! No seriously though, I am aware of this issue. When I first put that there, I tried to add stuff about me, but it always ended up in a huge font, which was bigger than the 'about me', which seemed rather inappropriate. So I gave up in the end. But since I have a bit of time, and you have asked, I shall write what I think would have been there if I could have ascertained how the damn thing worked.  General Information:- I’m 23, work as a labbie in an ice cream factory, my trousers are becoming tight. Spend much time involved in Covenant Presbyterian Church Manurewa. Drive an alfa romeo 33ie, wish I had a brace of them. Want to buy a house very soon, single, when that changes would like to study at theological college to train as a pastor.   Likes:- The forest, the mountains, an orange sunset across an uninhabited plain. Bach is a legend, as is Beethoven. Brahms is the man. Bob Dylan is choice, Simon & Garfunkel are super great. Love to write music, and wish I spent more time doing it. Love to teach stuff to young people. Have a great passion for working with young people. CS enters high on the list of leisure activities. Enjoy writing spreadsheets which do things to save you time. Books on the list include the Bible, He is there and He is not silent, Lord of the Rings. Favourite movies include Braveheart, LOTR, and the original Star Wars trilogy. Enjoys reading other people’s blogs. Like tropical fish, especially now that they aren’t dying all the time.   Dislikes:- Ugly buildings, concrete jungles, rap music  and heavy metal music, (and I use the term music with a loose definition here), those who compromise on beliefs which they know to be right, people who argue against personal responsibility, the ridiculous farce which the treaty of Waitangi has become, the people who use this same treaty to rid themselves of responsibility for their own lives, dishonesty and disloyalty, arguments based on personalities rather than reasons, people being labelled in a derogatory fashion by the PC brigade in order that their views will be shut down.   Of course I am not a product of my dislikes and likes, but they do give ya'll an idea of where I come from. Also that's not a comprehensive list, but that's the general idea, you'll pick up the rest as we go.

        A Walk To Remember  Yesterday I walked home from work. Yep. Mt Wellington to Manurewa.   Along the way.....  In Mt Wellington it was loud. Trucks and cars screamed past me as I strolled along the foot path.   In Onehunga I saw many Pacific Island children playing cricket in a residential centre. I became hot and stopped at a dairy. There I purchased a Sour Chill and some sweets. A mad man at a bus shelter performed a wild dance as I came towards him.   In Papatoetoe, I stopped at the Orthodontists, and got my teeth seen to. If I don't take out my back brace, I don't need my wisdom teeth out, as they will never make it to the surface. I wonder what I should do?! Further along I saw two young kids crossing the busy Gt South Road away from a pedestrian crossing. Thankfully a young male driver stopped to let them across, and after he yelled at them to cross from the middle, they did. Where were the parents I wondered.  In Manukau, I stopped at Dick Smith, and also visited the mall. I resisted temptation to buy any PC games, but browsed nevertheless. One lady was harrassing a Dick Smith sales guy over digital cameras. It's amazing how rude someone can be to another person when that person cannot really do anything about the situation they find themselves in.   As I approached Manurewa, I followed the Puhinui stream upstream from Gt South Road. I saw fish in the water. This is a vast improvement from my 6th form days, when I did a project and the water was so bad that nothing seemed to live in it.   It was a pleasant walk. I would do it again. In fact I want to walk New Zealand. That would be cool. Imagine that! Passing different areas, each with their own unique character and peculiarities.

        Assasination of Common Sense  -  urlLink NZ Herald   New York teenager Stephen Pappadake, 17, was driving at 130km/h in a 50km/h zone and passing cars on the wrong side of the road when he crashed and died. Now his parents have filed a lawsuit against the last driver that Pappadake passed. They said the driver veered to the left, causing their son to leave the road and crash. The lawsuit, said the White Plains Journal News, made no reference to police conclusions.    All I can say is Yeah GO ON. What ever happened to personal responsibility?

        Jono's Blog  It has risen from the dead. Check it out ya'll.   Touch  Well the weather outside was frightful, but it turned out so delightful. And so we played touch. And it was good. And many tries were scored. And there was much forward passing. And man was it a cool game. And we made the field quite wide, which showed how shocking our defence could become. And I twisted my ankle, but it's not to bad, so that's cool.   Cricket  What is wrong with test cricket? It is the same thing as classical music. If we can't have something wrapped into a 3 minute sound / video bite, we won't bother. Why is a game like rugby more popular than cricket? Is not part of it at least that we have time for it, but to take a whole five days out of our modern timetables is just beyond the pale? Some may say that cricket is boring and rugby is not. But that is playing into the hands of my ideas on this. We just don't have the time to become interested in something that takes so long, and has few moments of 'excitement' and many moments in between the few exciting bits like outs and sixes. Thus the highlights become the game. As an aside, isn't it weird that we should find rugby more interesting than cricket (I'm talking statistically here) when in essence, cricket is a much more varied game, in that rugby is basically about getting a ball over a line, and stopping the opposition from doing the same. I have nothing against rugby, in fact I quite enjoy it, but I find that cricket is much more strategic (and therefore stimulating for me) than rugby. I'm sure some would argue that this is not so, but I argue from the sheer fact that in cricket there are many facets to play. The skill involved is also great. I mean imagine a ball travelling toward you at a speed of 150km/hour. Over the small distance of a pitch. And now hit it. Wow.   Back to Basics  I feel away from God at the moment. I haven't been wanting to read the Bible, or to read the Christian books I have started. After I have finished this post I will go away and force myself to. I don't need to feel close to God, because no matter how I feel, the fact is, He has rescued me from sin, and He loves me, and no matter what He will keep me. Nevertheless, this whole feeling has made me depressed.    News Flash  I applied for a Forensic Technician job at ESR, and have got an interview on the 26th of April. Please pray for this. I am not sure if it is a good move or not. It could have repercussions for my effectiveness leading the youth. At Tip Top, I am close to home, and the shift work means I can be quite flexible in meeting with people, because I never get caught in traffic, and sometimes don't have to go in until late, so can meet with the guys for breakfast. ESR on the other hand is in Mt Albert, and apparently if I get the job I will be on call for scene attendance around New Zealand.   Music  Currently listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D major. Highly recommend. Get it! Also tonight I shall write some music. I haven't done it for a while, and I really feel like doing it. So 'roll over Beethoven'. Haha. Yeah GO ON.

        Nato is close  Nato you were on the right track in both of your comments. I'll leave this for a bit more thought and will post on it soon.   Hike  I took some of the young guys from C.I.A hiking (in the Hunua ranges) on Saturday and Sunday. We tramped through from the east coast near a place called Wahirau. Please correct my spelling as I cannot find the correct spelling anywhere. We then traversed west up onto a ridge and followed this south/southeast. We stopped Saturday night at a little clearing, pitched a tent, and made a shelter. Sunday morning we continued south and came out to a road near Mangatangi dam. There were no major injuries. We did try an alternative route out, which led us down a steep gully, and to a stream. I followed that down for about 2km, and hadn't reached the road, so we had to back track up the gully, and take the better known and easily followed route. Oh well. Next time.  Gotta love getting out into the bush. Beautiful!   First Aid  Work sent me onto a first aid course. It ran on Thursday and Friday. It was pretty boring, and I reckon we could have covered all we needed to in one day. Much of the learning was 'figure it out yourself and then report back' nonsense. A little more direction and teaching (Wow teaching to aid learning? How novel!) would have made the course much better. We also marked our peers. Hmmm. Need I say anymore? Or shall I just call it nonsense and wait for someone (you know who you are!) to tell me I need to explain why it is nonsense?  However, apart from that, I can do stuff I couldn't do before, and feel better prepared to handle an emergency situation. So that is a positive.

        Walking  I went for a lovely walk through the Auckland Botanic Gardens last night. It's amazing that such beauty is on the doorstep of my house, and yet I hardly ever wander it. And further to this. To walk, or to drive, that is the question. My goal this week is to walk more and drive less in situations when God-given original transport can cope.   Promised Post  Cricket and Democracy will be posted about soon. Watch this space, and see if you can guess how they are both related to my last post.

       Hmmm so much for the weekend. I left for work at just after 5, did my thing there, and came back. Had a shower and now I need to get ready for teaching at Music school from 8 - 12. After that I am looking at a house around 1. At 2:30, I'm helping out at the cafe fundraiser, which runs until 5:30 I believe. After that will be tidy up and set up for youth group. Youth group will start at 7, and will run until about 10. Sigh. I'm going to take a weekend away very soon. Just for me and God. I want to spend a whole weekend by myself, with my Bible, and silence to contemplate. I don't know if 'want' is the right word. 'Need' is probably more appropriate.

       I've been back from looking at houses.  urlLink Jono  came for the ride. One house was in Weymouth Road. I quite liked this one. The area is good, in that it is close to church, shops, trains, buses, video store, Repco, and lots of takeaway shops. The house needs a bit of a tune up however. Like a clean for instance. The carpets are old, the wallpaper is old, the paintwork on the outside is ok, but with a few issues. Drawbacks of the house include the flats behind having a driveway that goes past the three bedrooms, a small dining room kitchen, the laundry out the back door, no fireplace, and aesthetic issues (which of course can easily be sorted).   The second house was really nice inside. Really. But unfortunately it was in a bad area. The house next door was appalling. And the dog which tried to kill us as we went up the drive was definately not welcoming. The area put me off looking at what would otherwise have been an excellent house. Much better than the first.

       I have signed a petition. You may like to as well.  urlLink Check it out.    House Hunt I have been on and off house hunting lately. Everytime I get serious about it, dad tells me to wait a few more months.  Anyway, tomorrow I am looking at a couple of houses. One is in Weymouth Road, right opposite the car wash place, and the other one is in Greenmeadows.   Manipulating Language - 'surplus' (from Maxim) The word 'surplus' used to mean a genuine mistake by the Government in taking more tax than what it spent; 'what is not required for the purpose in hand'. Now it means a calculated scheme of money collection for redistribution in election year. Finance Minister Michael Cullen has been sitting on a $7.4 billion surplus, the biggest mountain of spare cash a New Zealand Government has seen (up from March last year when the figure was $3.4 billion). The Treasury said the record surplus arose because the accounts were running $1.5 billion ahead of forecasts in the first nine months of the financial year. Income from GST was up $225 million and investment income by Crown entities had swollen by $548 million.   The $7.4 billion surplus is a record both in dollars and as a proportion of GDP. For every $100 spent in the economy, $5.60 is spare cash for the Government to do with as it likes. Dr Cullen has boasted of his tight-fistedness in previous Budgets, but today he's delivered an old-fashioned spend-up, despite a refusal to lower tax rates.   What we're seeing is a Government creating all sorts of bureaucracies to distribute public monies, but it's only austere tax policies that enable it to create a 'surplus' and present its actions at budget time as 'compassionate'.

       Check out  urlLink this  all you Moore lovers. How do you know when this guy is telling the truth? He is at best a sloppy journalist, and at worst a man with an agenda who will not stop short of lying to promote it.   One  urlLink Moore Lie     Fred Barnes on Michael Moore:  A few years ago Michael Moore, who's now promoting an anti-President Bush movie entitled Fahrenheit 9/11, announced he'd gotten the goods on me, indeed hung me out to dry on my own words. It was in his first bestselling book, Stupid White Men. Moore wrote he'd once been "forced" to listen to my comments on a TV chat show, The McLaughlin Group. I had whined "on and on about the sorry state of American education," Moore said, and wound up by bellowing: "These kids don't even know what The Iliad and The Odyssey are!"  Moore's interest was piqued, so the next day he said he called me. "Fred," he quoted himself as saying, "tell me what The Iliad and The Odyssey are." I started "hemming and hawing," Moore wrote. And then I said, according to Moore: "Well, they're . . . uh . . . you know . . . uh . . . okay, fine, you got me--I don't know what they're about. Happy now?" He'd smoked me out as a fraud, or maybe worse.  The only problem is none of this is true. It never happened. Moore is a liar. He made it up.

        Marriage  Why is it that so many young men and women see marriage as a sort of holy grail that will solve all the problems in their lives. Many seem to have the attitude that they will fix stuff when they get married, or even worse, that the problem will just disappear. I look at some people who are single, and they seem to do absolutely no preparation for marriage. If you got problems before you get married, those same problems will continue when you are married. I'm sure married people will tell you this. In short, don't wait around for the perfect person to turn up, they may never show up, and if they do, what makes you think it's going to be you they want. Work hard to be the sort of person you would like to marry.  Ok that sounds harsh, but it was as much for me as for anyone else who is single.   Fish  I bought some fishssssss today. And a breeding net, and some other gears and plant make biggerer stuff. So that was good. Trogdor has some more friends to terrorise.   Other Matters  Where  did  I put that  urlLink millstone.  Seems like Mr Goff is doing a bit of backtracking and knees bent retreating tactics now eh?! What an absolute shocker. My brother is 11 now, and I  know  that no 12 year old in our society has the emotional maturity to cope with having sex. What's more, it's wrong. And this is what we get, when we get away from the idea that sex is for inside marriage only. The secular humanists cannot complain about this idea for a law change. If kids want to do it, they should be able to. Why draw the line at 16? There is no reason that can be argued. And so, why the public outrage? Come on Christians, show the folly of this thinking. Maybe it can be a chance to witness to non-Christians.

       There seems to be a wee bit of talk recently about gay marriage. Excuse me, I mean homosexual marriage. I don't see what the big argument is actually. Why are we talking about Homosexual marriage? The whole phrase is a misnomer. There is no such thing as Homosexual Marriage. There never will be. By definition, marriage can never be homosexual. This is not homophobic or down on individual homosexuals. It is nothing to do with that. It is entirely a matter of definition. Marriage is about a man leaving his father and mother and being united to his wife. The two will become one flesh.   But I pretend to be naive. Of course this is a big deal. Allowing homosexual marriage (even if it is a misnomer) is another attempt to normalise behaviour which is contrary to God's order. Enough said I think. One day I might get arrested for these statements.   Ok, completely off the topic, but just back on to the mandarin topic. How long do they actually last? I can swear that it's longer than a week, because they are still looking sweet as, and that post was a while ago, and they were about a week old then. Hmmm. I might try one of them now. Wait on for a second or two please. Ok, that one tasted perfectly acceptable. So it is definately longer than one week. I shall continue this experiment and let you know the results.

        Obituary  On the Death of Common Sense. Today we mourn the passing of Common Sense who has been with us for many years. He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as knowing when to come in out of the rain, why the early bird gets the worm and that life isn't always fair. Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you earn) and reliable parenting strategies (adults, not kids, are in charge). His health began to deteriorate when well intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place. Reports of a 6-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition. It declined even further when schools needed parental consent to administer aspirin to a student, but could not inform the parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion. Common Sense finally gave up the ghost after a woman failed to realise that a steaming cup of coffee was hot, she spilled a bit in her lap, and was awarded a huge settlement. Common Sense was preceded in death by his parents; Truth and Trust, his wife, Discretion; his daughter, Responsibility; and his son, Reason. He is survived by two stepbrothers; My Rights and I'm a Whiner.

       How can we expect to have a Christian worldview, when we spend more time listening to secular music, viewing secular shows on tv, watching secular movies at the theatre, and reading secular books? If we spend more time in these things than reading the word, praying, and studying Christian books, then I would suggest we have a very serious problem. Where you spend your time is where your heart is.       As was quoted to me recently (and it went something like this:- "If you spend more time listening to, watching, and reading about a lie, than you do listening to, watching, and reading about the truth, eventually you will begin to see the lie as truth, and the truth as a lie."  Food for thought chaps. And I believe that this is one of the key reasons why the youth of the Church are so weak in faith. Did I say believe? And I am convinced that this is one of the key reasons why the youth of the Church are so weak in faith.

       I was kindly invited to  urlLink Dan  and Michelle's for dinner last night. Well in short I had a fabulous evening which involved good food, conversation, fire, and blog re-arranging. Lomo is cool.   This morning I went for a walk with  urlLink Jono  and  urlLink Alisa . We walked around Totara Park. It's beautiful in the morning. I just love the smell of the bush. It's grand. Isn't it funny how that even with such beauty at my door, I have hardly walked the paths of Totara Park for years. A sad reflection on my laziness.   This evening Matthew T and I continued our weekly Wednesday night Bible studies. We had a smashing time. We had a look at ol' John 14:15-31. This is where Jesus promises the Counselor, and tells his disciples that the prince of the world is coming, but that he has no hold on him. Now we were wondering about this. Was Jesus preparing his disciples here for the fact that he was going to die, and that it might  look  like Satan was winning, but he was really doing what the Father wanted, and He was in control. Check it out for yourselves.   Serving I'm struggling with a concept at the moment. I work shift work 5 days a week, and work half of Saturday. I spend most of my Saturday avo's (after work) preparing for C.I.A. and doing admin work for it. My evenings are taken up with meetings and working with people in youth. On Saturdays I often play piano for church. Now I realise it is important to serve. So when people ask me to do things, I generally say yes. Sometimes I am asked to organise the youth and help do cleaning up jobs or manual jobs. Other times I personally get asked to do things. I feel really drained and tired. I need to know what I should and shouldn't be doing. I'm almost at the point of wondering should I just generally say "no" to most things, and assume I'm busy with youth. But the difficulty with this is that I want to teach them to serve. I don't know. I'm confused. Should I say that my service is youth admin and relationships, and rule out most other stuff I get asked to do? What are the general principles that can help here?

       That the NZ Teachers Council now deems a code of ethics necessary is symptomatic of our society today where trust and professionalism are lacking. In a climate of moral relativism where – ‘you have your values and I have mine’ codifying values is seen as a solution. Imposed codes of ethics, however, have the capacity to create an environment where more and more restrictions are required. Real freedom comes out of a voluntary acceptance of a shared and universally accepted ethic not imposed codes of ethics and conduct.  As a Christian school we would find it morally offensive, culturally insensitive, and professionally unacceptable to be in a position where Christian teachers in our school were required to sign such a code of ethics.  There are three main grounds for our strongly held objections: -  1.	Commitment to Truth.  At the heart of any code of ethics is a concern with ‘what is right, fair, just or good.’ 1.  The draft document correctly points out that ‘sets of values or principles…. may or may not be the same as those of each individual in the profession.’  2  As Christians and as a Christian school we are committed to a Biblical worldview where God is Truth and He has laid down absolutes and precepts that are not negotiable. In teaching a Christian worldview we believe that any instruction that does not begin with the fear of the Lord, and the centrality of Jesus Christ as the basis for understanding all of life, cannot properly be said to impart truth, wisdom or true knowledge.  Secular schools (the vast majority of schools in NZ) by their very nature exclude God as the author of truth, instead place man at the centre where he becomes the meaning maker of truth and the arbiter of what is right and wrong.  In other words a humanist worldview prevails in most of our schools where truth is viewed as evolving and ever changing according to what pleases man. In the draft code of ethics under the heading ‘The principle of truth’ it states that teachers are to be ‘committed to the quest for truth however elusive and provisional that might be..’ 3.  For the Christian teacher this is religiously offensive and competes with our God’s claim that He is Truth. Man does not define or construct truth he only discovers what God has already declared as true.  A commitment to God’s truth as revealed in His Word is very much a part of what it means to be a Christian teacher in our school. To have to adhere to or sign any code of ethics that does not acknowledge this would be both culturally and religiously offensive to us.  Paul Rishworth, associate professor of law at Auckland University, correctly highlights some of the dangers by asking the question ‘where does the freedom of belief and expression for teachers intersect with legitimate interests of the school?’ 4.  I would add another question – whose view of truth is being upheld?   Rishworth presents a number of possible scenarios; one in particular of topical interest, regarding a teacher who outside of class is a Moslem spokesman making statements in support of Al Qaeda. Applying a code of ethics becomes problematic. The dilemma of cultural pluralism is whose truth is being promoted and whose worldview is acceptable.  Each teacher in our school signs a Statement of Faith where they unreservedly accept and promise to uphold the precepts detailed in the document as a testimony of their belief, and a declaration of a personal faith in Jesus Christ as their Saviour, Lord and God. Every teacher, is, if you like, bound by God’s Word (code) and His declaration that He is Truth.  2.	Morally Offensive  Your attached abridged article by Hall and Bishop ‘Teacher Ethics, Professionalism and Cultural Diversity’ states that ‘effective teaching requires both technical skill and a moral purpose.’ 5. Here is a statement that, I like most people, am readily able to endorse. Where the difficulty and offence lies is with the presumption that the ‘moral purpose’ of all schools is the same. To imply that our Christian School has the same moral purpose, as any state school, is to ignore the very reason why private schools like ours were set up in the first place. We do not teach the state school curriculum; rather we teach a curriculum based on a Christian biblical worldview. A common code of ethics seeks to suggest that we have the same moral and religious purpose as all other schools. This is incorrect as well as being both morally and religiously offensive to us.  3.	Professionally Unacceptable  The draft code of ethics is professionally unacceptable to our Christian teachers on at least two counts. As alluded to above, our primary aim in Christian education is fundamentally different from that of secular schools. Under the heading ‘Learner Identity’ in the attached paper by Hall and Bishop, the primary goal of education is stated as ‘the achievement of rational autonomy and self determination’. 6.  Our goals are very different. As a Christian school we aim to honour God as we help parents nurture and teach their children within a biblical framework. Our primary goal is to prepare a new generation of effective, strong, mature Christians able to give godly leadership influencing our culture and society for Christ.  Secondly for our Christian school to be bound by a code of ethics that sets out to ‘define the boundaries of professional obligation’ within a secular framework is again culturally and religiously offensive to us. I suggest that we have a totally different understanding as to the role and function of a Christian teacher in our school.  The Christian teacher is first and foremost to be a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. In his capacity as a teacher his service to God is paramount. The teacher is to serve the parents of pupils who under God have been entrusted to him. He is to love and serve the pupils being a Christ-like example to them in all his instruction and teaching.   4.	Conclusion.  While acknowledging the sincerity of purpose of the NZ Teachers Council in wanting to produce a code of ethics that is an ‘aspirational and living document’ we have grave concerns and reservations regarding its impact on Christian teachers and our school. The failure to recognize that not all schools have the same moral purpose is a fundamental weakness that undermines any attempt to obtain consensus on a code of ethics.  As Christian teachers the document ‘Towards a Code of Ethics’ lacks credibility because it fails to address the dilemma of diversity. It is offensive to us both philosophically and religiously. The draft code is a concept at war with itself as it seeks to do the impossible – that is to declare a set of ethical principles as a ‘one size fits all.’ Clearly some schools and teachers operate on a philosophical and religious basis that is not supported or expressed in the draft document.   5.	Recommendation  That if the NZ Teachers Council is committed to a Code of Ethics it becomes binding and applicable only to state schools. (as defined in the education act)  Thank you again for the opportunity to respond to this document and to be part of the consultation process.

       When I was driving home from work tonight, I had this illumination. A semi-vision type experience. Well I'll bet that caught your attention. And you must read on. I was cruising along the motorway. It was dark, and I could see the lights on the hill east of Manurewa. I was listening to "Solid Gold FM", which I do when I am sick of the classical CD which I have in the car. And I was thinking about how these guys who were good singers are hardly thought of anymore. They were once 'idols' of their time. They would have run to and fro doing this and that. And it would have all seemed important to them. But now, they are hardly thought of, barely remembered. In but a few short years they have become ink in history books. So I thought of my life. Here I was driving down the motorway, with thoughts of work churning over in my brain, taking everything so seriously. And yet, all of this is going to be forgotten soon enough. My life and it's pettiness will pale into insignificance as time marches on.   Ecclesiastes 2:16 "For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!  Isaiah 40:7b-8 "Surely the people are grass. The grass whithers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever.  But what really makes no sense is this:- God loves me. God loves me; finite and insignificant though I am. He loves me not for who I am or what I can or will do, but He loves me inspite of these. My mouth is open, but I cannot speak. Like Job I will put my hand over my mouth, because I cannot understand God.

        Work Outing  I shouldn't have been such a grumpy bum about it. It was a really awesome day albeit a long one. Go-Karting is super great. You can really hoon around in them things. Although you need to be careful that you don't drive like that once you get back onto the real road. Yes.   Muffy and Adele's Engagement Party  Had a smashing time there. Lots of cool people, lots of food, nice venue. A good time.   Mandarins  Does anyone know how long the average Mandarin lasts before it goes off? If so let me know.

        Check it out   urlLink Nato  gives us his thoughts on the latest events to hit the news with respect to Iraq.   urlLink Jono  tells parents to start taking responsibility.   Two very good posts. A good read. I recommend you take the time to read them!   Save Mart  Jono and I paid a visit to Save Mart today. I picked up a nice brown short sleeve shirt, and a styly woolen jumper. Total cost : $18.    Tomorrow  Tomorrow work is taking the technical services team to see where they make the Puhoi cheese, and after that to do Go-Kart racing. I suppose I should be grateful. It's just that I don't see it as fulfilling the stated aim of team building. Let's hope I'm wrong. It will be fun nevertheless.    Joel  I'm currently studying Joel at the moment. It's quite fascinating. I am struggling with it. Trying to put it altogether in my understanding. I have many questions. So far however, I have refrained from the commentaries. I may even preach on this on June 27. We'll see.

        Job  I didn't get the job. They interviewed 3 people. They asked if I wanted to know why, which I did, so they said it was due to my lack of knowldge and experience in the instrumentation they were using. However they really enjoyed the interview, and thought I was really enthusiastic. Oh well. I asked God to make it obvious to me what I should do. Couldn't be more obvious than that.   Stay Tuned  In the next few days, there will be a post of great moment. Wait for it.   Immigration  As an introduction to what I am about to post. I do not apologise if this offends you, because I believe it, and I don't believe it is said in an offensive way.   I was listening to the radio the other day. An Iraqi man rang up. He asked the host what he would do if his family had been in the pictures of the Iraqi prisoners who had been humiliated. This was in support of the Al Qaeda man who had beheaded an innocent American (I understand)civilian working in Iraq, and posted a video of the beheading (with a knife) on the internet.  This makes me suggest that we need tighter rules as to who can come into New Zealand. We do not need or want people who cannot assimilate (and I mean assimilate) into the Western culture. We cannot have people who think like this man in our country. It will eventually destroy us.  The mindset, the worldview is so viciously different, that common ground for rational discussion is hard to find. This is evidenced by the fact that this man thought that it would be self-evident to Leighton that the killing was necessary if he asked him "What would you do if it were your family who had been humiliated by the American army?". (That last sentence was paraphrased.)  Be warned New Zealand. Clay and Iron feet will crumble.

        Presenting Mr Michael Moore  As you probably know... I do not have much time for Michael Moore. His views enrage me, as do his methods of getting people to think like him.   Now folks.  urlLink Here  is why I cannot stand the guy.    Less than 24 hours after accusing the Walt Disney Company of pulling the plug on his latest documentary in a blatant attempt at political censorship, the rabble-rousing film-maker Michael Moore has admitted he knew a year ago that Disney had no intention of distributing it.   .....  In an indignant letter to his supporters, Moore said he had learnt only on Monday that Disney had put the kibosh on distributing the film, which has been financed by the semi-independent Disney subsidiary Miramax.      This guy is a fraud! He cannot be trusted to be truthful. His deceit carries through into his 'documentaries'. Can we trust anything he says? I suggest not. He has an agenda, and he will not stop short of lying to promote it. Treat his work with suspicion, or treat it as fiction.   Petrol Prices  Yes they are on the up and up. So much so that I am planning to ride to work tomorrow if the weather is fine.

        Potluck Dinner  We had a potluck dinner on Friday. I wonder now... isn't the name potluck a bit of a misnomer for us Christians? Should we not instead call it a potprovidential dinner? Anyhow we had one to celebrate my 24th birthday. The food was great, and the company was great. The company was better than the food, which in no way should detract from the merit of the food, which was sublime. We played a bit of Mafia. Andrew introduced us to the suicide bomber, and we also intorduced a bomb disposal expert. The suicide bomber (any of the Mafia can be this, but only once per game) can at any time (day or night) let off. In so doing he kills the persons on his right and left... and of course himself (that being where the suicide comes in. However if a bomb disposal expert is sitting next to him the bomb is defused, and no one dies. It sure did add to the excitement.   After Mafia, we chatted about politics and Christians and stuff like that. It was pretty interesting. It was nice to be able to talk at a deeper level with people. Not just to talk about things that don't really matter. But to start to scratch the surface and see the challenges of living in a world which is against us.   I do fear for this country.

        On Congregational Singing  Pity the poor pianist.   That massive conglomerate the congregation can put fear into the boldest pianist's heart. They refuse to be led, yet they refuse to lead. They ignore your most obvious attempts to keep them in some sort of known time signature. And what pray is this strange idea the pianist has that everybody should start singing at the beginning of the piece. Why isn't it a known fact that you start a few beats later, so that "Lord we lift your name on high" becomes "lift your name on high".  And isn't it just downright rude of the pianist to go onto the next bit when the congregation is so enjoying that soaring high note.    What It Comes Down To  I teach music. Mainly to children between the ages of 5 and 13. And kids being kids, you can often get into conversations about other things with them. And I just love this. Sometimes it's about holidays, other times about God and so on.   Anyway, recently, I was teaching a girl of about 9. She was looking tired when she arrived at the lesson. She told me she had moved in with her Dad. Previous to this, she had been living with her grandmother. Previous to that she had lived with her Dad, and again before that her mother. I asked her about this, and I found out that she doesn't know where her mother is. Her dad had let her stay up all night the night before playing video games and watching tv. She's a lovely girl, but I have had difficulty helping her in her music. She hasn't progressed as far as I would have liked. She has never seen commitment in her life, and therefore cannot give it to her music. her family structure is negatively effecting her education.   Now this case study is one that I could repeat over and over again to you. Different kids, and different scenarios, but with the same problem at the heart. With the breakdown of the family there is a breakdown in many other things.   You see, poor education, crime, poverty...our negative statistics.... these are linked to breakdown of the family, which is the defiance of one of God's first ordinances.

       Why parents are surprised and outraged by the Edgewater College condom fiasco is beyond me. The peer sexuality support team is just part of a secondary health curriculum that actively promotes and supports the message to our teenagers that sex is okay at any age, at any time and with anyone as long as you use a condom.  Mr Vester’s school, like many other state secondary schools, peddles this advice under the guise of keeping our young people safe. Wake up parents – what happened at Edgewater College is consistent with the philosophy driving the Health curriculum in our schools.

       Helen Clark’s criticism of Cardinal Williams and her own trite utterance ‘that people should show tolerance to other views’ smacks of gross hypocrisy. Our PM shows little tolerance for any view that crosses her own, particularly when on the subject of morality.  It seems the PM has forgotten her comments in an interview with the ‘Express Newspaper’ in February. When answering a question regarding the supposed levels of homophobia shown by ‘religious groups’, she is quoted as follows: ‘It’s a very small minority point of view and I think through continuing to set the tone of tolerance, acceptance and diversity you just have to further marginalize such people. Hopefully one day nobody will think that way.’  Ms Clark’s comments are both instructive and hypocritical. It is all right to marginalize a position you don’t agree with when you are in power. It seems that tolerance, acceptance and diversity are defined and have meaning only in terms of this government’s agenda.

       On 4 March 1966 The Evening Standard published an interview in which Lennon said,  Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first-rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.    How sadly mistaken he was! God's kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. It was before the Beatles were thought of, and will be after they are thought of no more.

       Ok, the people have spoken, and I have heard them.  3 Bedroom weatherboard house, with tile roof. Master bedroom, medium sized, with tv aerial cable, phone port, and lots of power points.  2 smallish bedrooms, one with tv aerial cable, the other with phone port.  Kitchen is a good sized kitchen, with a large pantry. Stove (a nice brown colour) is oldish, but in good condition. Kitchen has good bench space also.   The living area is largish, with windows on three sides, so it gets plenty of sun. It contains a cool fireplace thingy with the tube bit that goes up through the ceiling.   The garage connects through to the hallway, which is handy.   The bathroom is smallish, but it has enough room for both a bath and a shower. The toilet is separate.   Other features include aluminium joinery, a nice small back section with roses and two lemon trees. Thoroughly appropriate I thought. It also has an alarm, and room for not a few cars.   Detracting features include the dump of a house next door, and the long driveway. Oh, and that it's close to church! Hehe no excuse for being late.   Mandarin Update It still lives. Are you scared?   Sermon Update I'm preaching on 4 July,  and  11 July. Just so ya'll know not to be at evening services those nights!    Butter Mince Nato, was just reminded of your comment recently. The full and final recipe will be available soon. Once I live away from home I will be able to try my finishing touches without the mocking of the Philistines I currently live with.

       Richard Randerson seems to think that if homosexuality is part of a persons’ nature, then judgements on it are incoherent with the gospel of love. This view is biblically wrong, and the dean should know this. It matters not whether homosexuality is by choice or by nature. The Bible says that we are all by nature sinners, and objects of God’s wrath. That sin is part of our nature provides no excuse for it, but rather becomes the very reason for God’s wrath towards us.  Randerson’s understanding of the gospel of love is severely limited. The true gospel of love presents to us the holiness of God’s character, and it contrasts it with the sinfulness of mankind. Only those who repent of sin, and put their faith in Christ Jesus for salvation from the coming wrath of God will be saved.   It does great injustice to the intelligence to say that the Bible teaches anything other than homosexuality is a sin. Since God in his word to us, tells us that it is a sin, and that all sin leads to eternal destruction, it is right for a minister of the church to plead with people to repent from it. Indeed, it is the only loving thing to do.

       This morning, on a leading radio station, Helen Clark expressed concern with the Bishop’s stance on homosexuality. She said that homosexuality has always been around and we need to have a tolerant, accepting and inclusive view on the matter.  It seems the PM has forgotten her comments in an interview with the “Express Newspaper’ in February. When answering a question regarding the supposed levels of homophobia shown by ‘religious groups’, she is recorded in print as follows. ‘It’s a very small minority point of view and I think through continuing to set the tone of tolerance, acceptance and diversity you just have to further marginalise such people. Hopefully one day nobody will think that way’.  The PM’s answer is both instructive and hypocritical. It is all right to marginalise a position you don’t agree with when you are in power. Tolerance, acceptance and diversity are defined and have meaning only in terms of the government’s agenda. We must demonstrate tolerance and inclusiveness towards homosexuals but apparently this does not extend to those of us who along with the God of the Bible say that the practice of homosexual behaviour is a sin.

       Peter preached a sermon which really challenged me about my prayer life. So I have started praying more. I set an alarm for 15 minutes, and fully concentrate on prayer for that whole time. Today, I hadn't finished after 15, and was able to keep going. I feel really encouraged when I pray, it's just a matter of discipline to actually do it.  Prayer is powerful. God hears us. It was amazing. On Sunday I really prayed for opportunities to share at work. Today I was able to get in to a really good debate with one of my colleagues about morality, God, and relativism. She has similar morals to the Christian. However, she thinks it doesn't matter how you get to those morals. And I attempted to demonstrate how you can't get to the morals we are talking about from the beliefs she has, without them being arbitrary. She was forced to admit this, but countered with a relativism argument, which I challenged with the standard challenges to cultural relativism. The discussion got her thinking, and I hope it will lead to a sharing of the gospel.    Mandarin Update  It is still on my desk and looking good.

On the other hand, my taxes are compulsory (try not paying them),  and they go to people like you who I do not support. So people in glass houses shouldn't through stones eh what! I mean you have an absolute cheek to even bring up the issue of Maxim's funding. Your pay, the pay of your secretary and all your office is from the people of New Zealand. Sort out your own backyard before you go digging in another man's. Start being accountable for what we pay you. It ain't really your business where the finance for the Maxim Institute comes from, suffice to say it is voluntarily given by people who do not like the way your government is taking this nation.

       Check out  urlLink this .  Bush has failed in his recent attempt to get gay marriage (a misnomer as I have said before) banned. I am sure he will not give up the fight here though. Pity the other crowd see it as an unimportant issue.   There is a battle folks! Wake up! There are those (included in this article) who would attempt to distract us by saying these are minor issues, and others like health are far more important. They are wrong. And I say go Bush. Not guts, no glory. You take that stand, and you go hard. This Christian is with you.

Yesterday I went to the supermarket to set up my kitchen. Ouch. $200 dollars later. But shouldn't need to spend that much for a very long time.

       My immediate family went to my nanna's house for supper tonight. It was her 70th birthday, although you wouldn't know it to look at her, as she seems about 60. Anyway; she attended church last Sunday evening when I was preaching. This is very unusual for her. But even more so that when we came around tonight, she was asking many questions, about the sermon, and about Christianity in general. Dad was able to talk about what it means to be a Christian. It was very encouraging. Unfortunately in the middle of the conversation the phone rung and it was her son ringing to say happy birthday. How often does that happen when you are sharing with people or praying. Raa!

       Tomorrow night (18:00) at Covenant I am preaching from I John 2:15-17.   So I am polishing it right now. It's really different to doing youth group talks, because it feels like it needs to be more formal. So no throwing in the odd reference to Monty Python, Homestarrunner, or various other inappropriate but humorous allusions. Oh well.   House It's all mine. Eh hehehehe. I paid my deposit on Friday, and in two weeks I can move in....and pay the rest. Ya hooo! Ya'll are invited to my house warming gathering, when I get around to it. I'll let you know time and dates.

       Yes that's right folks. Finally I have reached my 200th post. Pathetic really, but at least we got there. Thank you oh my long suffering readers!   Cooking Well one of the benefits of living away from home, is experimenting with cooking. I have now fully developed my own recipe for butter chicken curry. None of this cheating by using packets. Raa! I will at some stage post the recipe so you may tantilise your tastebuds.   Sermons I am preaching another two sermons on the 19th and 26th of September. I may have a look at Romans 9, because recently I have been reading it, and used it at a youth study on Saturday. When I read it, I can't see how anyone can argue that God is not sovereign in salvation. It actually seems to me that those who would argue about this generally don't do so from Scripture. They tend to use humanistic arguments of 'fairness'. It doesn't feel right that God would not let us choose him, and still hold us accoutable. As humans we tend to think that responsibility and freedom to choose are inextricably linked, and thus in various criminal cases, we see people pleading not guilty because of insanity. I believe the whole issue is misunderstood because of a false view on two things; God and man. When we view God as 'smaller' than he is, and man 'bigger' than he is, we founder on this sovereignty issue. But when we see God for who He really is, we begin to understand who we are, and then we will have no problems with God being sovereign in the area of salvation (as indeed he is in all areas.). Once upon a time, when I tried to rationalise the fairness of it, I had a problem with God choosing to save some people, and indeed with him letting sin into the world. (I believe God could have 'not let' sin into the world if he had wanted.) But now, I have become comfortable with 'big God', and realise that while it may seem unfair on the human level, God is the sovereign creator. He made everything, and it is his right to do as he chooses. And everything he does, he does for good - his glory. Praise God.
