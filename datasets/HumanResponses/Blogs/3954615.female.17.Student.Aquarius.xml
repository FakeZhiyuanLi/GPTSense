      just got home. yesterday was burning mid-night oil trying to absorb all the differentiation formulas. and today my mind was blank. forgot how to differentiate "lg x". screwed up my tests. it wasn't my first time anyway. well, that wasn't my main point.   after the lecture test, huiqi wanted me to accompany her to her house to get her literture review. then she changed her mind about letting me go into the house. so i waited downstairs for her. there must be something secretive about her. she doesn't allow anyone to go into her house and she doesn't talk about her mother. most of the time, she said, "my dad this this that that". and when i asked about her mum she did not mention much about her.  at whitesands we went to macdonalds. there was not a single seat in sight. huiqi suggested that we sit with her friends. they were mengyang and shaowei. talking about the shaowei, we seemed to have met before. there is something familiar about him but i could not remember. i wondered if he was from my primary school chongzheng. huiqi added that he lived around my area. well, maybe we met each other before. maybe he was not from my primary school. if there is chance i shall ask him. :)  we went to huiqi's favorite popular. haha.. just in popular alone we stayed in it for about an hour, and we went back.   i took bus 17. was standing quite at the back when i noticed a tall guy looks like kiangiap. he has similar spects as kiangiap. when he turned i looked closer, to my surprised it is kian giap. my eyes are failing me uh. we smiled. he wasn't that dao afterall. at least he bothers to "da zhao hu". that kinda change my impression of him. and when the bus came, he went right to the back. i wanted to sat beside him and just have a chat or something like that. but after second thoughts.. umm.. better not. after that horrible incident (well the incident is still not over yet), i guess i should keep a distance from guys. being too nice to someone gives the wrong impression sometimes. i don't want anyone to be like "HIM".   arghx, back to the topic. i used to think kiangiap is the proud and the arrogent kind. the type of people who would not say hi when he sees you. but when i alighted the bus he waved and immediately looked at somewhere else. my impression of him change again. i guessed he is not that friendly.  nothing much to update today. got to practise my clarinet. I WON'T LET THAT MS SIA TO DESPISE ME. i shall practise harder and play louder. i want her to feel that she is wrong about me. must improve myself. otherwise i'll be made fun of by ms sia again.

      haiz.. second time i have to type this in. something happened just now which deleted all my efforts. ok.. back to the topic. nowadays, i have no idea what is wrong with me. mood swings from end to end, i get pissed off very easily. this is totally unlike me. then whenever my mood swings, i vent my anger on my friends. i feel so bad. they are always the one who suffer from my mood swings. this is not good. but i can't seem to control myself at times.   like today. after chinese lesson LHS told me to ask a guy to help me carry the chinese files to the staffroom. i didn't know who to ask. i didn't dare to ask. all the guys of my class look so ungentlemen. the kind who would not want to help me. then HE loitered around the files. Sini saw HIM and asked HIM to help me carry the files. HE READILY AGREED TO IT. ARGHX! i was so infuriated. because i just told Sini about HIM the day before and now she is like trying to make fun of me? i was so angry with her. i didn't talk to anyone until we reach the staffroom. but it is really sickening. why must HE keep on pestering me?! HE is like a thorn in my eye. i can't wait to get rid of HIM. HE doesn't seem to be able to get my hint. i have been very cold towards HIM and whenever HE is around, i'll give the very "buay song" look. furthermore recently i have been sitting in between my friends, not at the side, so that i can make sure HE is not around me.   but alas, HE is getting quite smart nowadays. HE always seemed to be able to predict where we are going to sit and will sit around that area. and yesterday during maths, when i sat beside kelly, HE was directly behind me, as usual. i purposely said loudly that i wanted to change seats with kelly because i have not done my tutorials. and the very next thing that happened. HE changed HIS seat as well. nearer to me. make me feel worse. and just now, HE smsed me asking me what time were we supposed to report. sometimes i wished i can muster up all my courage and screamed at HIM "STOP ALL THIS NONSENCE!!!! THIS IS ANNOYING AND U ARE MAKING VERY IRRITATED WITH YOU!!" but i can't. no matter what HE is still my classmate. i don't want to make things embarressing and awkward for the both of us. one and a half more years to go. but i really cannot stand HIM anymore. situation is getting out of hand. my goodness. HE is also one of the reason why i am getting pissed easily nowadays.  i don't what to do.  and today is yanting's birthday. i was surpised that the class actually remembered. we sang a birthday song for her at the canteen. it was weird. and after a while the guys left. if i was yanting i would have felt disappointed. the celebration lasted like only 10 mins? she looked happy. but somewhat i felt that she was just putting up a brave front. well, at least we celebrated her birthday. i hope that from now she will not feel so left-out.

      wheeee~ today at least there are something to be updated.. :) had interhouse competition today. i joined floorball and netball. but unfortunately, we were trashed by the calisto ppl and atlas ppl. my goodness! calisto girls are so rough and violent!! haiyo..   there were 6 ppl who signed up for floorball. 4 out of 6 were frm s209!!(yay!)! haha.. and 3 of us were injured by them(me sisuan and an indian girl)!! someone knocked on to me.. (or did i knock on to her..?) and i fell. ew.. my knee was scratched. ugly scars. wasn't really painful though. then they wanted me to be the goalkeeper. having to knelt on the floor, i guess it made my injury worse. but anyway it wasn't serious. it was not as serious as sisuan. so i shouldn't complain. furthermore, i couldn't catch the ball. i made the group lost. and i was like so lousy? run only like 1 min i was already panting hard. visions blurred. perspiring profusely.  i thought floorball would be fun. it was rather disappointing. 3 players against 3! and the game is lk only for 10 mins?! quite pathetic uh. very different from what i imagined it to be. floorball always reminded me of my ex-209. it was so fun to play with them. it was like 11 vs 11 people. so u dun need to do so much running. the whole of p.e lesson we were playing floorball. don't know why i enjoy their company more. perhaps we are more bonded together that's why.   i still miss them a lot. i always see them around in school but sad to say, we are not as close as we used to be. there are not many topics to talk about. sometimes i feel rather extra when i am with them. still miss the good old times, although it was barely three months. in contrast to my current class s209.. haiz. this class kinda sucks. the guys are really not fun to be with. they don't talk to the girls. when they teased boonluan, it gives me an impression that they are not trying to have fun at all. i don't really like them. they are mean. mean guys. my goodness. reminds me that i have not watch 'mean girls'. and even if i want to watch it, movie theatres are no longer showing them.   mjc is ridiculous. giving us loads of homeworks, making us have remedials after school. and futhermore cca ends so late!! there is no life in mjc. i don't seem to be able to enjoy myself. i don't have any free time. sometimes i feel trapped. but still, it was better than sac. back in sac, i was like suffering in hell?! tt's i don't miss sac. i prefer mjc though life is getting monotonous. it is still not as hectic as sac. i get to slack once in a while. i hope life gets better. if only my class is bonded together. yanting's birthday is on this coming friday (30 july). wonder what they will do. i think the class has completely forgotten abt it. poor yanting.

      finally got down to create a blog!! haha.. waited for like a year? had so many thought racing through my mind and felt like penning it down. yes!! let's get started!  there are so many things i want to say. firstly.. hmpf.. ok.. i always envy other people.. like.. xiao jun? haha.. because i know there are many guys who like her. makes me feel kinda inferior.. she always says "ke yu bu ke qiu.." which i didn't understand. i thought it was fortunate to be loved.. 4 guys like her my goodness!! haha.. makes me sounded a bit desperate.. haha.. but i am not horx..  heex.. my current 04s209.. i suspect there is a guy carrying a torch for me(  my group of friends and i.. we always stay together.. and in the LT, we would sit together as well. if i am at the side, which means that the other side of me is empty, the guy would sit beside me! oh my goodness.. and during tutorials, i noticed he will sit somewhere near me. and whenever i send sms to all my classmates to remind them of what they are supposed to bring for chinese, he would be the ONLY one to reply my messages. at first.. rather happy of course.. haha.. but now.. i feel that he is like a 'pest'(as quoted by tiffany) i want to get rid of. this is getting annoying. whenever i log on to msn, he would be the first to chat with me. or whenever he logs on to msn, he would click on me first. and when our conversations are getting boring, he continues to chat. sometimes i rather not talk to him at all. at least i would not be bored by him. that sounds abit hurting, but.. it's a fact. and this is not all. i remember just a few weeks ago, before morning assembly started, i went to my class and look for my friends. but unlike usual, they were not at the front. so i turned and wanted to go to the back and look for them. as i walked to the back, i saw "him" taking his bag and already taking a step to the back as well. oh my goodness. then i could not find my friends at the back, so i went to the front again. i found my friends as they just reached. we lined up as assembly was going to start. i was behind all the girls. and after assembly, i turned and saw that "he" was standing right behind me. ARGHHHHx.. so irritating. now i finally understood what xiaojun meant. if i have a choice, i would rather not want anyone to like me.   he is not ugly or anything. i just don't have any feelings for him. and he mumbles to himself. he is not the type i would go for. he is not dark, he is not tall. he is kinda slack too. i like guys who are serious at his work, or rather, who knows when to get serious. i like guys with intelligence, and who have a sense of humour. he doesn't fit any of the criteria.  he likes me because he thinks i am sweet(i guess..) but i am not!! haiz. only my close friends know me. my 04s209 ex-classmates will know. i seem quiet to the guys because none of the guys talks to me. the guys from my ex-class used to bully me and call me ah-lian.. but i didn't mind that. we had alot of fun at least. this current class.. quite boring i suppose. the guys don't take initiative to talk to the girls. most of them are ungentlemenly as well. expects the girls to carry the benches after p.e lessons!! tsk tsk tsk. well if they were to know me better, i am sure none of them would fall for such a violent girl like me. they don't know me yet. i am not QUIET nor am i SWEET(that's what some people say i am). oh please. wake up. don't bother me anymore.   i always says 'never deny your feelings for someone just because you think ur fear of rejection is too hard to bear'. this doesn't apply to "him".

      yo! it's me again. decided that since i have a little bit more time today, i shall update something more.  i am getting tired of school life. i dread tutorials. i am failing my tests. and my class is not at all united. i don't really like my class. the guys don't talk to the girls and the girls don't talk to the guys. 5 months have passed and there is not any improvement. i hate being in such a class. but fortunately, i have a bunch of good friends whom i often hang out with. but sometimes, i feel abit out of place. the group always talk about people whom i don't know. so i couldn't join in the conversations. and they like to talk about gossips, like who and who are now dating and what have they done. if those people are the ones whom they are not close to, i feel that they should pry into people's privacy too much.  although i often look happy in class (sometimes very dead of course), this was sometimes a front i tried to put up. there is no one who truly understands me. my life is quite sad i supposed. in reality, i don't have a close friend. my way of doing things is quite different from the others. and i have a habit, whereby i cannot tolerate someone if that someone makes some mistakes which i cannot accept. well.. so much about myself, hmmm i think it's time for me to write down about the people of my class.  1. Cai Yingning:             Saint Anthony's Canossian Sec  2. Chan Boon Luan:           Temasek Sec got to know her in first 3 months of MJC. didnt know her very well at that time. well, she is always with rebecca and not joining us. i didn't know it was a blessing or my misfortunate to be in the same class as her again. because in the first 3 months we never really talked to each other. but now, i got to know her better and she is now one of my closer friends. this girl is forever complaining that she is fat and wants to go on diet. and her diet is always going start the next week! well in my opinion, she is not fat. i think it is because of canoeing that she trained herself to become like this. but size doesn't matter. in fact i think she is quite pretty.  3. Cui Yan Ting:             Balestier Sec yanting is a very quiet girl in class. but sometimes i feel that this is not what she is supposed to be like. because she occasionally says some lame stuffs and make people laugh. and from her testimonial, i got to know that she was the band major in her sec sch. that is very very surprising. because to be a band major means that she is one who voices out her opinions and controls her people. she does join our group sometimes but i can sense that she feels that she doesn't belong here. i want to make her feel welcomed by our group, but i don't know how to go about doing it. i hope i get to see the other side of her soon.  4. Lee May Yin:              Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' Sch a nice girl she is. the first impression she gave me was someone who is very "dao" and only makes around with the guys and the cool people. so i didn't really want to mix around with her too much. however, as time goes by, i realised she is actually quite friendly, and sociable. a very smart girl too. 8 points for L1R5. like to bully me sia~ haha.. but i kinda enjoyed it and i know it wasn't intentional.   5. Low Si Ni:                Tanjong Katong Sec didn't really like her in the first place. the first time i saw her was during orientation, where she was the OGL. she was alex's dance partner. then saw her again first day in class. she sat at a row at the corner with all the guys. then a few days later i saw her again, she was late for physics lecture. again she was with another guy. this led me to thinking that she is some kind of flirt. haha, but this is totally untrue. i got to know her better, and found out that she is just being very friendly and sociable. but recently she got a boyfriend, and her results were quite bad. i guess her relationship kinda affects her studies.. which inspire me to strive harder and not to think of guys. =)  6. Lua Si Suan:              Tampines Sec SiSuan..... hmm. got to know her through Puileng. they were in S208 in first 3 months. i think she has nice hair. haha.. that's not the point. okok, she is very hardworking and diligent. this frequently gives me stress and makes me frustrated. she is also in my PW group. i was rather happy in the first place. but sometimes, i feel that the ways we do things are so different that sometimes i cannot stand her. but having her in the group is really a fortunate thing. she is like our leader, motivating us. she is like the facilitator, and she is the one who provides the most information to our project. most of the credit goes to her. she is also nice, in that she shares her secret with people, regardless of who they are. that is very nice of her.  7. Peh Kai Li Kelly:         Compassvale Sec a maths genius. she often helped me with my school works. in the beginning, i didn't like her as well. haha, that was because at that time, only me, boonluan, sisuan and tourmaline were good friends. then she always appear out of nowhere and join in between us. come to think of it, it was quite hilarious. i got to know her better, and see her as someone whom i think i can confide my problems with. she is someone who is the trustworthy type and u'll feel that your secrets with her is kept totally confidential. saw her that time at the mass dance. she looked so different from the way she usually looked like. that day, she wore all black and look like those kind of people whom u see in the street and think that they are the cool kind and u wouldn't want to offend them.   8. Seet Wei Leu:             Chung Cheng High (Main) 9. Sukhpreet Kaur:           Bedok South Sec (i think) 10. Tan Cher Min Tourmaline: Temasek Sec 11. Cheng Ying Hui Isaiah:   Temasek Sec 12. Foo Thong Seng:          Anglican High Sch 13. Kok Hoe Ming:            not yet found out. 14. Law Sin On Jackey:       Ngee Ann Sec 15. Lim Kai Fong:            Damai Sec 16. Lim Ming Hao Wilfred:    Tanjong Katong Sec 17. Loh Xun Yong:            Temasek Sec 18. Niam Chao Wei Mark:      Tanjong Katong Sec 19. Ong Shi Hao Joseph:      Temasek Sec 20. Ooi Aik Chong Shawn:     Montfort Sch 21. Siah Wei Sheng Vincent:  Maris Stella High 22. Tan Kian Tong:           Temasek Sec 23. Tay Kun Xiang:           Anglican High 24. Yeo Kian Giap:           Temasek Sec 25. Zhang Zhi Yang:          Temasek Sec  i think the rest i shall continue another day. there is too much to be said and i have go off for my dinner now!!!! =)  [Love is like a knife. It can either stab your heart or it can carve out wonderful images that could never be forgotten in a lifetime.]

      haix. i guess i have to retype everything again. my computer is so getting very sucky, and the internet connection is weird.. and slow. and yesterday, while i was in the midst of updating my mass dance, something popped out of my screen and the whole thing went blank! what a total waste of my efforts.  okok. back to what happened three days ago. on saturday, i went to orchard with huiqi. it was very anticipating for me. i haven't been dancing for a long time. however, all my hopes of enjoying myself that day were dashed. when we reached the outside of the paragon, there were like only less than 20 people around. that is how pathetic it is. fortunately, more people arrived. then the dance started. the music was pathetic as well. only a small portable radio was used. the music was that soft that when u stand at the entrance of the paragon u find it very difficult to make out the music. but i guess that is a good thing as well. in this way, nobody will find out that we have been dancing the same 3 dances for the 6 hours.  huiqi is a nice partner. i am glad our "mo qi" has improved by leaps and bounce. that time while we were rehearsing in the hall, we could not coordinate with each other. yucks.  as time passed by, i grew very much tired by the dance. but as i dance, i sort of want to keep it going. perspired alot. eeeeeew. my red t-shirt looked so wet that it disgusted me. decided to change into xiaojun's house t-shirt.  saw many people there. met thongseng at kfc in tampines. at orchard, saw kelly, boonluan(doing cip again), and joseph with his girlfriend jessica. saw joyce ting too!! but sadly, our conversation died out very fast. i haven't seen joyce for a very long time. so happy when i saw her. tried to engage a conversation but it couldn't last. how sad that is.  i am beginning to love dancing. regret that i never got the chance to learn dancing. i think being a ballerina is captivating. when a ballerina dances, it mesmerises people. and i am the kind of people who wants that kind of attention. i want people to envy me, give me all their attention.. to notice my presence. that's why i strive hard to excel in areas like music. but there is always someone who is better than you. in band, i am like someone very insignificant. my presence there is as if not at all important. this is so different as compared to the past, where i was still in SAC.   in SAC, i rose up from someone who knows nothing about clarinet to someone who is qualified to play the first clarinet.. in a very short period of time of about a year. i was one of the better players there. in sec 3, i was appointed to be the student conductress of my band and to be the section leader. i am proud of my achievements, even though i didn't do my part very well as a conductress.   in MJC, there is alot of competitions. i am like one of the lousiest player around. i can't be compared to the TKGS and the VS people, whom they had all already been very familiar with some basics, like double tonguing. i can't sightread as fast as them, and i played it very softly. this is due to my lack of confidence in playing. i often console myself that there is nothing to worry about being the not so good players in my section. moreover, i only started playing the clarinet when i was in sec 3. i wasn't given a post here as well. well, this was in fact a relieved. if they had given me an important position, i wouldn't have been able to cope with my studies and i wouldn't be able to lead as well as the leaders now. i would probably screwed everything up and make everyone hate me.  ok.. that's about it. this entry kinda sucks.. all thanks to my internet connection. otherwise i wouldn't have to retype this all over again.

      ok.. haven't really had much time to come online and update about my life. so here it is..   two days ago.. i finally agreed to join the mass dance. met huiqi and we had breakfast at kfc. when we reached the outside of paragon, i was astonished to see that barely twenty people were there. my goodness. this is pathetic. i thought there is going to be many many people dancing. but........? well, my hope of wanting to enjoy myself were kinda dashed. so huiqi and i went inside the paragon and take a stroll. it was quite empty. at the supermarket, i found the chocolate whereby sacians always give during valentine's day. the chocolate wasn't really that superb. but i like the way it is being packaged. the chocolate in the shape of a heart. cool. =) but it was so expensive. i guess.. i may want to treat the class to chocolates next year valentine.  ok. the dance finally started. it wasn't really that enjoyable. there wasn't many people dancing. and the music, it was that soft whereby people standing at the entrance of the paragon would find it very hard to make out the music. 3 dances were all we knew. anyway, since the people could not hear the music, they wouldn't realise that we have been dancing the same steps for like 5 hours. it was very tiring. but as i dance, i got the hang of it and want to carry on dancing. huiqi is a nice partner. but we kinda lack the "mo qi". hahaha.. i could still recall the times in the hall while practising for the couple dance. i was trying to hold her hand while looking downwards at my steps and i guess she was doing the same thing as well. we couldn't find each others' hands. lolx. this time it improved. by heaps and bounce!  as time goes by, my shirt became wet and stinky. i am kinda disgusted by that. so i changed into xiaojun's house t-shirt. well, i lost my triton house t-shirt. what a waste. i barely wear it for 5 months. i swear i am never going to dance in my red t-shirt ever again.  saw joseph and his girlfriend jessica. saw joyce, kelly and boonluan. it was nice to see your friends around. i always wanted to prove myself that i am better than the others. well, not in terms of studying. in terms of music, dance, sports, like volleyball. i am beginning to like dancing. i think people are attracted to someone when they see the other side of her. as in when they see that someone they know can actually dance, it kinda mesmerizes them. like clara. i think she is beautiful when she dances.   okok. stop crapping about. then it was the finale. the battery died out. we were like dancing in a soundless music. all ms lai's fault. she didn't want to lend them the amplifier. what kind of principal she is? when first she agreed to letting them held the event but later not supporting them by not wanting to lend the amplifier? without loud music, how could we attract crowds? she is one who doesn't have brains. she believes in results but she doesn't want to show people the right way to do it.  hmm. dinner is at kfc again. getting sick of kfc already. went home with huiqi and cherri. i noticed that the trumpet section is quite united. how i envy them. if only clarinet section can be like them. but it is kinda impossible. clarinet section is too big to unite everyone. and with huiqi her biasness towards that person, haiz.. --------sadness.   hmm.. chatting with kaixiong right now. he is now in the same class as huilin. that is like so coincident. glad he still remembers me. today is yanni's birthday. 2 days ago was kianleong's birthday.

      i miss orientation!!!!! i had so much fun then.. there was no worries about schoolworks or anything.. there are so many friends around.. i made so many friends in the short 3 days..   huiqi asked me to join the mass dance at orchard. i said no. that was because none of my classmates joined. i thought it might be kinda boring if i went alone. then today, cherri told me she is joining too. i know wenqi and benny are also joining. that kinda tempted me. at least there are people i know who are joining. then while accompanying xiaojun waiting for her emmanuel, they played the mambo no.5 and the hey mamma song. realised i haven't dance for a long time le. kinda like dancing. it's a pity i didn't get the chance to learn ballet. even if i were to join dancing class, it would be kinda late to learn dancing now. moreover, i don't have the time. i must use time wisely to study and complete my homeworks. i must not continue to be so slacked anymore. this is ludicrous.. ridiculous. I WILL NOT RETAIN!!!!!! YES! haha.. and here i am spending my time typing out all my innermost thoughts. my priorities are just not right.   oh yes. today.. had to pair up during chinese. my partner was sisuan. realised that our way of doing things is totally different. she has her own ways which i sometimes find it hard to accept. like the literature review and the chinese summary. i don't know what is wrong with me. that is definitely something wrong with me. i wasn't like this in the past. i was very tolerant, and i don't get flared up easily. nowadays there is a change in me. whenever sini they all started about the "pest", i'll get pissed off and started diao-ing everyone. then i'll began shouting here and there if things are not done the way i want it to be. this is totally unlike me. i can't seem to be able to control my tempers like i used to do it. and this is getting annoying. even if the people around don't sense it, i do. and this is irritating me. enough of this.  and in band, things are not any better. i am kinda influenced by huiqi's and benny's view about....... ok.. i better not mention his name. in case anyone happens to come across this blog and tell him about it. i can sense their biasness they have towards.. THAT GUY. and sometimes i do agree with them. there was once.. well, ms sia was teaching puileng on what she should do with the timpani, and the way puileng played the timpani was kinda weird. THE GUY and his gang of people, well.. maybe only one of his friend.. they burst into silent laughter and began to imitate puileng. that was the first time i see the evil side of them. and during sectionals, it is not that i am against him or something like that. but i don't like the method he approached. he often asked everyone to play one by one. this seems very unproductive and very time-consuming. sometimes, he also give me the impression that he thinks he is the best of all. but it is not the case. ok, he may be the best when it comes to playing, but he kinda sux at theory.. he used to tell us.. play concert Bb major, 2 scales. erm.. hello? 2 scales? ok, he meant 2 octaves. no one corrected him, but everyone understood what he meant. but now he changed already.. which kinda surprised me. i still think yanqing can teach better. she is more into detail and she uses the correct term. oh dear. haha, now it is so obvious who THE GUY is. i shall not harp on it anymore. time to bathe and work on my tutorials. Good night!

      today....... went to sini's house for a bbq. arghx.. spoils my determination to study again. i can't seem to start studying even though there are 5 days of holidays this week. oh dear, how am i ever going to catch up with my schoolwork?!! i am still in my slacking mode especially after exams. this is getting out of hand. i must not continue this anymore!!! should get down to work some day.. maybe tomorrow.  today was a long and tiring day. first we met up at bedok interchange to buy food and stuffs like that. then we headed for sini's house! took 25. her house is super big and spacious!!! terrace somemore. wow.. wish i can have a house like hers.   anyway, we began to start the fire. it was time consuming and very exhausting. it took us about 3 to 4 hours before we could get the fire started. and the pit was very small. not much food could be cooked. i didn't know what to do. i never had experience on bbqing food. so i can only stand around.. staring and stoning. it was kinda boring for me. and furthermore.. practically all of them were paired up. 3 out of 5 girls have boyfriends. but i don't have 1. and I RATHER NOT HAVE ANY. guys.. yucks.. i don't think i am ready for a relationship yet. to start a relationship requires alot of commitment. and it affects studies. my studies are already like so horrible, i don't want to be expelled or to be retained by the school. like sini, i think sini and yanzhu are suited for each other. but it kinda affects her studies. i heard from boonluan today that sini is being black-listed by the school. if she doesn't do well for her end-of-year promos she could be expelled by the school. see, that's the power of love. it makes u neglect everything which can lead to undesireable consequences.   ok, back to the topic. the food was quite alright. but having to wait for a long while spoils my appetite(  after watching singapore idol, we thought it was getting very late. we tidied up sini's house and left not long after, leaving yanzhu to clear the house. well, whatever the case is, he had to please his future in-laws right?! so leaving the job of cleaning the house is just right or him! =)   we decided to take bus 25 back to bedok interchange. but the bus was full even though it was a double-decker bus. it dawned on me that those were the people who left the national stadium. many buses were packed too. the waiting was long and terrible. in the end, we took 854 and transfer to no.8. i finally got home. was so sleepy and sticky. but still decided to update this blog!! meanwhile, that irritating guy chatted with me again. this was the content (from what i could recall..)  - hullo + hi - how are u? + fine - did u watch NDP juz now? + no - no? why not? + went to sini's house for bbq (this was answered 10mins later) - really?! sounds fun - why didn't u invite me? - are u busy now or what? - considering you take 15 minutes or so to reply. haha  i can't be bothered to reply him anymore. can't he tell that i wasn't at all interested in this conversation?!?!?!?! and look at the way i reply him. most of them are all one word answer. and considering that i took about 15 mins to reply him. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT I AM BUSY. there was no need to ask. *duo1 chi3 yi4 ju3* i have never seen such a dumb guy before. this is my first encounter with such an irritating guy whom i can't wait to get rid of. he is a thorn in my flesh. the sight of him irks me. if only i didn't get to this super smart class, i wouldn't have to meet all these weird people. my class sux to the max. it is so boring to be in this class. everyone is just not participating and not being enthusiastic.   and there is ms lim, forever giving me unnecessary loads of things to do. sometimes i really hate her, and i used that pissed-off voice to talk to her. i guess she is not very happy with me already. this lands me in a dilemma. i want to be a good and responsible chinese rep. yet i want to be part of my class. if i were to be on ms lim's side, the class would definitely hate me. yet on the other hand, if i were to be with the class and oppose to ms lim, (which i always wanted to), this would not do me any good. i still want my pearl's points. no matter what i am still the chinese rep. if i were to make ms lim detest me, things will be very awkward if she wants me to do something for her. she is actually not that bad afterall. i can understand her good intentions. but the class don't seem to be able to see her point of view. i have no idea why but it seems that chinese teachers are meant to be detested and hated. well.. the world is unfair isn't it?

      haven't been updating this for some time. 2 days ago..  -supposed to meet clarissa and huiqi at the interchange. -couldn't find them when i reached. -walked around, saw boonluan instead. -bought a $2 badge from her out of kindness. -saw sisuan and her bf..  -saw clarissa, asked clarissa to help boonluan buy a badge. -huiqi finally reached interchage, 3 of us went to mac. -saw cheryl (sim), she was alone. when i asked her to joined us. huiqi looked unhappy. well, i didn't mean to upset her, but how could i leave a friend alone eating right..  anyway, we went to rollerblade!! yes! i haven't been roller-blading for quite some time!! i remembered the last time i roller-bladed was like more than a year ago. couldn't really balanced. but i didn't fall. that was a relieved. this was clarissa's first time roller-blading, and huiqi's many time already. ok, huiqi seemed like an expert. well, not quite actually. but at least she could blade faster than me.  as clarissa didn't know how to blade, huiqi and i held her hands one on each side. haha.. she didn't dare to move her legs. she fell quite a few times, and we were stuck like only 10 metres from the place of rental.. for 15 mins. we had to drag clarissa to the empty space whereby she can learn at least how to balance and not to hold on to anything. i could sense huiqi's impatience and she left without us not long after, telling us that she would go back and get some help. at the so-called-"park", i finally got quite familiar with roller-blading and could go a few rounds while clarissa was still stuck at the same place.. LoLX!  ok.. another half an hr passed. clarissa managed to go a few rounds. but she still had to hold on to something. huiqi was finally back, but without anyone with her. she said all the guys "mei liang xin de" which I TOTALLY AGREE! meridian guys are never gentlemen enough to help girls. that totally turned me off.   we thought that 2 hours will pass by very quickly and we had better drag clarissa back to the pit and come back to return the roller-bladers. and YES!! I FINALLY COULD OVERCOME THE BARRIER OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE HUMPS!!!!!!!! hohoho!! that's a major major major achievement for me!! lalalala~  we finally managed to successfully drag clarissa back to the bbq pit. it was a very very long way. and there, i met xiaojun and she wanted me to pass something to christine so christine could pass it to yixiang. it was yixiang's birthday. xiaojun looked very tired and not like her usual self. then she wanted to go back home alone. how could i let xiaojun go home on her own right?! what if she faints on the bus.. or she gets kidnapped or bullied by some gangsters?! she looked so small and innocent it was very unsafe for her to go home alone. i managed to persuade her to stay and gave the sweet sweet smile which tempted her to stay. haha..  then clarissa didn't want to blade anymore. i guess she was very tired and she felt that she was not as good as us so she didn't want to slow us down. ok. a girl named wenqi wanted to blade too. so clarissa gave her bladers to wenqi. i had a mixture of feelings. firstly i didn't know wenqi, and i had no idea what i should talk to wenqi about. huiqi was saying that hopefully wenqi is not another clarissa. haha.. and she was wrong. wenqi can roller-blade on her own but she fell many many times. ouch.. that hurts. we finally reached the place of rental and returned the bladers.  by the time we reached the bbq pit.. it was pitch-darkness(wonder if i used this term correctly anot..) and manx.. i was so hungry. i was glad at least there are still alot of food around. i told myself i have to eat!! i must not let my $8 go to waste!!! but there are not much variety of food either.   felt kinda guilty. i asked xiaojun to stay and yet i went away to return the blades for like an hour. so i accompanied her throughout and we had some chats. late at night the winds became strong and we felt chilly. we finally left the place and took a cab home.  i realised guys like to wear the same thing. haha.. tt time at the VCH mjc choir concert i saw yixiang and fuquan wore exactly the same thing as at the bbq.  lastly.. -i hate dogs- they made me scream and shriek which i thought that made me sound irritating to people.

      cherri and i went to mr quah's wake today. band ended at 8+ and we took about an hour to get there. it was at lavender. i didn't want to go. i didn't like mr quah. he was the most horrible teacher one can ever get. i got him as my p.e teacher from sec 1 to sec 3. he can make everyone obey his commands. nobody dares to defy him. he is fierce and strict. i still remember once he made me cry in front of the class, just because celestina wanted to borrow colour pencil from me.  however, i do see the his kind side of him. he often crack jokes to liven the mood. but most of the time i don't find any of his jokes hilarious. i thought it was 'cold' and wasn't funny. i wonder why does everyone laugh at his jokes.   time is flying. i can't believe mr quah has already passed away. i didn't want to go to his wake. there seems nothing worth remembering about him. but cherri wanted to go, and i didn't mind accompanying her. band ended very late, at 8+, and it took us for about an hour to reach lavender.   i couldn't recognise him -- he became old and shaggard. his hair all turned white, and his eye brows were.... there were no eye brows. he face were full of wrinkles. he wore a suit, which was very different from his usual t-shirt and shorts. sister cecily was there. sister jo and mr tan were there too. the mood was very solemn. it was very sad. there were people crying. i couldn't cry. wo hu bu chu lai..  i guess SAC is going to miss mr. quah. miss his loud voice, shouting across the blocks, and making people frantic and run for their lives. he is probably one of the few teachers who can get things done in the fastest time. he is one who can help maintain discipline in school. even though i used to hate him to the core, i think.. he is actually quite a nice teacher.   well.. enough of all these sad stuffs. hmm.. saw cheryl today, in her st. andrew's uniform for the first time. she looks quite smart i guess. i haven't been seeing her for a very long time. and let me think.. about 5 months already. the last time i saw her was when she came over to meridian to appeal. didn't have much of a chat with her. quite sad too. i wonder when is the next time we get to meet again. it may probably take many more months. we may be so busy with our school works that we have no time to meet up. by then we may not even have anything in common to talk about. like today. we didn't talk much. i didn't know what to talk to her about. it was.. occasionally weird. we used to be close friends. we could talk about anything under the sun. well.. it is still about the same. but there wasn't much time for us to get down for a chat. very sad. today was a rather sad day..
