      Well this is the first time i'm ever posting anything...such a weird thing posting a blog without knowing if anyone will ever read it but yourself. It's soothing in a way that I know I'll have a record of my own thoughts but at the same time you battle the knowledge that all these private thoughts have a  possibility  of becoming very public. I googled a friend once and lo and behold, a blog came up from one of his friends giving a complete record of his life for about 3 months time!! It's 3:27am here now on 18 July and I just got back from a night out with Juho and Mika. Juho I met while at a bar in Manila, and Mika is his cousin. These guys are very cool, and have helped make my stay here in Finland all the more comfortable. Since Juho works for a local paper, and Mika is part of the intelligence community here, you can imagine the little nuggets of knowledge I gain from them about local culture everytime I see them. They went out of the way to show me Eastern Helsinki, about 10km away from the central part where I live. Apparently this is where all the blue collar workers (or the "ordinary people" as they call it) hang out. I didn't see that much of a difference between those who hang out in Central Helsinki, but they told me that the difference is quite clear to locals- Central Helsinki bars cater to the snobbier people, and bars in the suburbs are more geared towards ordinary working class people. Pretty similar to most cities that I've lived in. Interestingly enough, the difference is so miniscule that no outsider can really ever see it! Everyone dresses the same, acts the same...I guess you really have to be a local to truly appreciate the class difference in Finland. One thing that really surprised me when I first moved here in early May was the deep contrast between the "business" face that Finns put on during the day, and the wild frat boy drunkenness they display at night. More than one exec I've met with here has likened themselves to the Japanese business culture- quiet and reserved yet extremely efficient. However, at night Finns  definitely  put on a different face. I've never seen so many drunken people passed out on the ground and urinating and puking in public as I've seen here on the weekend. Combine that with the added disorientation of the sun being up at 3:30am, and I become one confused motherf*****. One thing I can definitely say tho is that Finns love themselves. They are proud of their culture, and damn proud that they fought off the Swedes and Russians at 2 different points in their history. Who can blame em?? Silence truly is a virtue here- they don't need to say something at every moment. I definitely admire the Finnish culture for that.  Anyway that's all for my first post...

      he just got a fight...again!  It hasn't even been 5 full days since he arrived back in manila and already he beat up a white guy and got his throat cut by a beer bottle in the process.  He's in the hospital now, but sounds like he's in good spirits and should be out pretty soon.  For such an intense stoner that he is, it's amazing that he gets into so many fights.  Last year, he got into or was part of 3!  Man I can't believe he's in the hospital- probably can't wait to smoke a joint.

      I woke up today after a pretty intense dream about "Mrs. the doorman".  I'm not too sure why I had a dream about her- as I thought I'm pretty much over her considering I'm all the way over here and she's in Hoboken.  Pretty weird dream because i think it's the first time that my dream contained mental thoughts- as in I was thinking to myself INSIDE my dream.  I don't really remember that ever happening in other dreams- mostly my thoughts turn into actions.  Anyway because of that I woke up really confused- cuz it was so close to reality!  Basically the dream was us having a conversation and her saying she was sorry for everything and she finally realized she made a mistake...blah blah blah same ol shit I've dreamt about a billion times before.  It's just the inner thoughts that totally had me believing this one was real.   Anyway- yesterday I got back in touch with AP after about 2 or 3 years! I found her on friendster while checking out Juliet's page.  Turns out she's getting married on Aug 17!  I'm real happy for her- to be honest I think she would make an awesome wife.  She's very down to earth and doesn't make decisions on the fly, so I know for sure this one is a well thought out decision.  One of the few from the years I was in ISM that I actually believe is making a decision that's logical (this is based, of course on one email we exchanged).  But there are others from IS that i'm just like...what?!  What are you thinking?  23 years old, and girls are getting pregnant for the sole reason of getting pregnant, others are getting married for such DUMB reasons.  One of my all time favorite reasons is this one girl's- she had been seeing this guy for less then a year when he proposed to her.  Because this guy's older brother was getting married next year, and it's considered bad luck for brothers to get married in the same year, they decided to get married already instead of waiting that extra year!  What does it matter what year you get married?  Propose, move in together, spend some time getting to know each other, THAN get married.  Why rush something you know will be a life-altering and lifelong decision?  Sheeesh that's why Filipino men can't be monogamous.  They rush into things too quickly and have to find an outlet for their mistakes later on in life.  wow anyway enough ranting about that- Angela invited me to the wedding, but unfortunately I won't be able to make it as I have to be in HK that week.  I definitely want to see her the next time I make my way over to the US.  Plus it's a great excuse to see Utah...  Jesse and I have been coordinating Belgium- it looks like he's coming by the last week of August to hang out and we're going to head over to francorchamps to watch the Belgian GP!  I'm definitely excited to move to Brussels...  2 1/2 weeks to HK!!

      I took a helicopter this morning (Copterline) from Helsinki to Tallin.&nbsp; Wasn't too expensive- round trip came out to 118 Euros one way helicopter and return on the Nordic Jetline.&nbsp; I've never been on a helicopter before and it was awesome crossing the Baltic Sea in 20 minutes flat- I always imagined the Baltic to be much bigger.&nbsp; In any case, after a little bit of a stressful encounter with the Estonian immigration official (she freaked out because I didn't have an Estonian visa- they're in the EU now, hello?) We were well on our way into Estonia by about 10am.&nbsp; We found the Old Town right away, which is absolutely gorgeous. It's basically a walled city that used to be the center of Tallin in the old days.&nbsp; Architecture is gorgeous, and I was genuinely surprised at the amount of foreigners in the area.&nbsp; You have an eclectic mix of Americans who have no idea where they are or what they're doing, to Finns who are drunk off their minds because booze is so much cheaper there then in Finland.&nbsp; I'm convinced that Estonia is the American equivalent of Mexico.&nbsp; Finns go there to get drunk, buy cheap booze to bring home, and go to strip clubs. It's a great city, as they have just been acceded into the EU very recently (May I believe), you can see the changes as capitalism take s a hold on the city.&nbsp; Juho mentioned that the cars are the biggest indication of this advancement.&nbsp; One year ago, he was there and did not see one new car.&nbsp; Now we walk around and there are Nissan Zs, Benzs for cabs, and markets that sell everything from amber jewelry to Nazi Germany medallions and old military equipment (SS helmets, etc.)&nbsp; They don't really believe in the mindset, I think they're just trying to capitalize on a novelty.&nbsp; I played around with the idea of buying Ken an old SS pin, but for personal conviction, I decided against it and bought him an old Soviet Union pin.&nbsp; I think he'll appreciate it.&nbsp; For Anne and Patti and my mom, I bought them amber bracelets, which I hope they like.&nbsp; It just seems to prevalent everywhere in Tallinn, and I thought it'd be cool to give it to them and be like "Estonian Amber! How can you go wrong!" After some shopping in a random market mall where there really was not that much stuff to do (I've seen better in Greenhilss in Manila), we headed back to the Old Town to eat.&nbsp; For lunch, I had this great pork grill..I forget the name but it wasn't like the typical pork that's dry and sinewy.&nbsp; This was juicy and tasty- bery much like steak but at last 2x better. We were tired after that meal, so after a quick cup of coffee at a place called "old estonia" in the main square (the front door girl was AMAZINGLY hot), we headed to the park where the Independence Monument is and slept for about an hour.&nbsp;  After waking up, we decided to hit a random strip club.&nbsp; Since it was only 430 in the afternoon, the girls were not exactly the best they could offer, but I got a private lap dance anyway (just to say I had one in friggin Estonia).&nbsp;&nbsp; She was cute, but she kinda ripped me off.&nbsp; It was 300 kronos for the private dance (which is like 20 Euros) and to be honest it realy wasn't worth it.&nbsp; She was attractive but not that attractive.&nbsp; Apparently as well, normal strip joints in Estonia aren't just strip joints, you can do all kinds of other stuff.&nbsp; Didn't appeal to me that much, so I had a couple of Jim Beams and we headed off on our way.&nbsp;  After that, we did some shopping at the harbor and I proceeded to buy a case of beer for 185 Kronos- which is a little more than 10Euros.&nbsp; That's CHEAAAAAAAAAAAAP considering hereit's about 13 Euros for a 6 pack of tall boys.&nbsp; Now I understand why Finns buy in MAJOR bulk.&nbsp; 2 women standing beside me for immigration had 4 cases EACH piled on one of those old lady trollies.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; The Nordic Jetline was a 1 hr and 45 minute trip in which Erki and I played the country game (last letter of the previous country named is the first letter of the next country) where he proceeded to kick my ass. Luckily, Nordic Jetline docks in Katajanokka, and I only had a 2 block walk to my joint in Kauppiaankatu.&nbsp;  Got home, took a shower, spoke to Mon for an hour, and now I'm going to head to bed.&nbsp; Good times with Juho and Erkki.&nbsp; 3 weeks left and I don't regret a minute of this day trip to Tallin.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Since I'm coming to the end of my stay here in Finland- I thought it'd be a good idea to start a series of blogs where I post my thoughts on the cities I've lived in for a significant period of time.  Vancouver, BC, Canada (Birth-82, 87-96, 2003) What locals call it: Van-city, the 604  One of the most beautiful cities in the world- one side is in bordered by the Pacific Ocean and the other is surrounded by mountains that are skiiable in winters.  Great place to grow up because it's peaceful and people were generally friendly back in the day.   There was a certain feeling that you were in a small community and that continued until I left.  However, with the HK handover plus the lax Canadian rules on immigration, the city's population swelled and with it the crime rate.  There was a point in time that I remember we didn't even lock our doors. When I moved back in '03 for a short period of time, I got my car broken into in my own garage, and there was a sexual assault in my builiding- all within the same week.  And this is in the middle of downtown in what was supposedly a super safe and secure high-tech building.  My ass.  The mentality of Vancouverites changed as well while I was gone (or maybe I just began to notice it when i moved back)- there's an air of pretension when most people don't have anything to be pretentious about.  I just wanted to tell some people to GET OVER THEMSELVES.  It's not all Vancouverites, but if you stay long enough, you begin to feel like they really do believe that it's the center of the world.  And that they are the center of that center.  That seems to be a trait of the young generation though.  On the other hand, you also meet these people who are super nice, that you actually begin to question their hidden intentions!  They usually don't have one, but it had been so long since I was exposed to such nice acts, that I actually got suspicious!  Definitely a melting pot and not a mosaic of people.  Generally, you'll encounter two main types of people- your upper class WASPS and your 2nd generation minority (again, this is more with the younger generation).  They may dress different and act different, but the mentality is still there- Vancouver is the center of the world.  Kinda lacks in the nightlife scene, but I may be biased cuz I was easily annoyed at the previously mentioned mentality.  I mean, cmon, I understand if I had to wait 20 minutes outside a bar in NYC- but in Vancouver?  And we get in only to find that it's completely empty and that the line was just a ruse to get people in?  Stay away from Caprice- that place is notorious for that.  Best place for Sunday brunch- Zen Cafe.  They have the best Eggs Benedict in town. Best place to start a night out/just chill with a few beers- Subeez.  Very open layout and never that crowded but it's still got good music. Best place to chill out and read a book- Stanley Park.  nuff said Best burger in town- White Spot.  Everytime I arrive, it's the first place I go. Best Japanese- Tojo's on Granville.  Just awesome and a great way to entertain yourself by reading the star's notes to Tojo, and see a great view of downtown Vancity.  Basic summary: Great place to visit for skiing and outdoor activities as a whole.  Good place to retire, because if you try to work there at a younger age, you'll get all the energy sucked out of you.  It's that relaxed there.

      S-dawg's opinions have always been funny even with the most boring topics- in the course of one messenger conversation that happened earlier he was able to provide me with these nuggets of wisdom:   On racial harmony in entertainment:   Funk says:  DUDE i watched dawn of the dead  S says:  its not as good as the original but you get see them fuck up zopmbies which is always entertaining  Funk says : yeah the zombie baby was a pretty interesting twist  Funk says : kinda gross...it was half black half zombie  S says : seriously wat were they trying to imply a minority half dead breed baby? shit something to call rev.jesse jackson for   On social interactions between males:   Funk says:  i talked to chris T online kanina and said you guys hang out once in a while...  S says:  we went out a month ago and he introduced me to some hot chicks man i got to say....but chris is a total metrosexual  Funk says:  HAHAHAHA  Funk says:  dude he totally is  S says:  like all he talks to me about is the clothes he is buying and wats new in fashion....i don't mind nice things to wear and all that jazz but come on...dudes should not be talking fashion to one another all the time, dAMN

      Bought a new necklace for myself today- my old cross that I bought from H&M was getting tainted and dirty and in addition I just didn't feel right wearing a mass-marketed piece of crap to symbolize my religion.  I'm definitely not the most religious person in the world, but if I'm going to wear something that represents a spiritual connection, it may as well mean something, right?   So I went across the street to a tiny little Bible store with two little old Finnish ladies working the shop.  I saw that they were selling these necklaces which pendants looked like a little scroll with some sort of script on it.  When I asked her what it said, she looked it up with the accompanying card, but unfortunately it was Finnish.  The ensuing 30 minutes was absolutely HILARIOUS.  She started looking for the verse in the English Bible, but couldn't seem to find it.  So she asked the other little old Finnish lady who was working in the back, and she started looking through the Finnish Bible and cross referencing it with the English Bible.  I was just randomly flipping through another Bible hoping I'd run across it.  And then, a young guy in his late 20s walks into the store, and sees the three of us scrambling around looking for the damn passage!  He browses for a while, and I guess curiousity got the better of him and he asked what was going on.  After Little Old Lady 1 told him, he started looking too!  So the 4 of us are looking for this one damn verse, and another guy walks in- looks at all 4 of us, and walks right back out!  Finally, the young guy found it, and I think it was worth it.  I wound up buying one for myself and I think I'll buy one for Mini-max.  "May the Lord bless you and take care of you; May the Lord be kind and gracious to you; May the Lord look on you with favour and give you peace." Book of Numbers 6:24-26  Nice, huh?

      Thought I'd jot this down before I forgot-   We were leaving confusion and nonsense behind and performing our one and noble function of the time: move  -  Jack Kerouac      You see things and you say, "why?" But I dream things that never were and say, "why not?"   -  George Bernard Shaw      A beautiful girl can make you dizzy, like you've been drinking Jack and Coke all morning. She can make you feel high with the single greatest commodity known to man--promise. Promise of a better day. Promise of a greater hope. Promise of a new tomorrow. This particular aura can be found in the gaze of a beautiful girl. In her smile, in her soul, how she makes every rotten little thing about life seem like it's going to be okay .-  Beautiful Girls    There are several quintessential moments in a man's life: losing his virginity, getting married, becoming a father, and having the right girl smile at you.   - St. Elmo's Fire

      Continuing on with my cities I've lived in series of blogs, I thought I'd write about Manila a bit.  Manila ('83-'86, '96-'99) Locals call it: Well, um...well, Manila  It's definitely now the place I consider home. Since both my parents are there, and most of what I like to consider my lifelong friends are either there currently or from there, there's a strong emotional connection.  Definitely a misunderstood country. Granted the city of Manila is overcrowded and poorly planned, but there's just something vibrant about Manila that I've only felt in few other cities. There's the air of promise (sure it comes in the form of incredible smog, but it's really there). I've written about the Philippines before and had it published, so I don't want to go into it too much again now. But basically despite the poverty and widespread corruption and lack of a strong education system, there's one thing that can't be taken away- and that's the Filipino spirit. It's amazing to see someone smile at you despite the hardships that they go through to get by everyday.  There's a HUGE disparity between rich and poor, and admittedly I am as guilty for turning a blind eye as everyone else. But acts of generosity and the search for common ground also take place everyday. One of the largest universities in the Philippines, Ateneo, has an "immersion" week that is required before anyone can get their degree. What that means is that all kids must live in a poor neighborhood and live with a family for that week. It changes people- I've seen people come back with a totally different perspective on life.  Night life is absolutely insane. It's a different kind of nightlife then anywhere else in the world, because every night has a specific bar to go to that  all the same people go to . So I can go out to 7 different bars on 7 different nights and run into the exact same people every night. Why is that? Trendy bars are few and far between, and the social culture in Manila is so miniscule that everyone knows each other anyway. It's good and bad- good cuz I get to see the same beautiful girls every night. Bad cuz I only see the same beautiful girls every night. And after day 3 or 4, "how are you doing" just doesn't cut it for bar talk anymore cuz you see the same person every day even though you're not close to them. BUT people are very welcoming there, and everytime I arrive at the airport I get a rush like no other.  For tourists, there's a few interesting places to hit up. Admittedly, I don't get to sightsee that much as I sleep through most of the day to recover from the night before/get ready for the coming night, BUT what I have seen is great. Corregidor is nice- the last stronghold for Filipinos and Americans alike before the Japanese came and occupied Manila. Intramuros is beautiful- old Spanish architecture in SE Asia- who'dve thunk?? And of course there's no way I could talk about places to see in the Philippines without talking about BORACAY.  Located about an hour and a half flight south of Manila, this is tropical paradise. It's a tiny island that has a great mix of wandering backpackers, Korean tourists, and Filipino socialites. Soft, talcum like sand to roll around in during the day and an absolutely insane nightlife. Best kept secret in SE Asia hands down. I would fly there just for the sunset (see pic). I would love to go more often now, because it's slowly losing its small island charm and beginning to give into commercialism. Check out Cocomangas and try the popular 15 shot challenge. Get a free t-shirt and your name on the wall! I did it when I was 19- I don't think I'll ever do it again.  Ok wow I've really gone way overboard in this post! Brief rundown of places to go/see: Best place to people-watch: Starbucks in Greenbelt 3. Best burgers: Hotshots Best place to check out cute girls: Legazpi Village- Peligro, Azzuro, and Yaku. Also V-Bar on Thursdays. Best place to read a book: Inside where there is airconditioning.
