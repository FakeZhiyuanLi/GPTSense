      I was just listening to the L7 song "She Has Eyes", yes, that's the same one that gave this blog half it's name, and I started thinking... I know, odd for me, huh...?? The chorus to this song is "She has eyes made for crying"... that gets me thinking about both Loren and Hailey... they have both been supposedly heartbroken too many times... so I guess that means that they have eyes made for crying... well, now that song's over, this one's called Wargasm, also by L7... about war and how it turns them on, I guess... not really relevent to the current topic, I just like the name of the song...   Check ya laters...

      If anyone is confused as to why I created this blog, it's mostly just to seperate my political opinians from my love life, so the other one will still be there, just a little less used... umm... shyea...

      I haven't seen Loren in almost three days, and I already miss talking to her, even though I've only done such twice before. I dpn't know what it is, but I feel like I can tell her anything, just open up to her. When I'm around her, I don't feel as depressed or helpless or angry, unless she's feeling that way... I just can't get her out of my head... Loren says that she one day plans to join the armed forces, and that's probably the only thing I disagree with her on...  I think I'm developing feelings for Meganess... not intamate feelings, mind you... kind of... i guess you could say   protective feelings... Even though I don't know much about her, her poetry and writing has touched me in the very depths of my soul (if I even have one, that is, and I'm starting to think of her as a... guess you could say little sister (except she's older than me >  Shtill Shmokin Till Next Time...

      I just woke up maybe an hour ago to the horrid sound of my dad yelling at me to clean my room, or something... I  dunno, I don't listen to him anymore. His egotistical, selfish, right-wing ways just piss me off to the point of blocking out his voice altogether. I just ate lunch too... frozen pizza... I'm not supposed to eat those, because they rape up my bowels, but i'm honestly beyond caring... I'm supposed to go to Steven's house later... with Ryan and Shara and Kevin... Harrison and Meganess aren't coming, I guess because Steven dosen't really like them being together... Hmmm... man, I'm still kinda tired... didn't get to sleep last night until at least five... pondering different ways to bring down the controlling machine... how to convince others that they're just being brainwashed and they need to kill the opressors... Hmm... thinking about Meganess' LJ... she's really unique... I hope she sees that she is, or else she just might continue down a path of self-destruction... I'm not gonna pull a Harrison and say that Meganess is god's gift to the Earth, but she is specially unique, like myself... in the place we live, these things are truely hard to come by... so unique... so special...

      I'm officially sick of Television. T.V. is the most evil thing on the planet. It exploits other peoples lives for our entertainment. So-called "reality shows" like the Real World, Road Rules, and, god forbid, Big Brother are all full of the smae types of people, the stereotypical piss-and-moan-life-is-tough-cry-about-every-little-thing American Rebuplican, just wrapped up in different outsides. I hate syndicated sitcoms. I hate brainless cartoons. I especially hate MTV. The "Music Television" network that has done everything in it's power to ruin music as I know it. They put the Beastie Boys on their "All Things Rock Countdown"... what the FUCK was that?? T.V. is the most evil thing in the universe, children are being enslaved and raised by television, believing everything they hear and see on the news. As for the "reality" show "stars", LIFE SUCKS SO GET A HELMET!!!  Shtill Shmokin Till Next Time...

      I just got back from Java Jacks with Ryan and Shara... Java place closed about an hour and a half ago, so we've just been wandering the streets for no apparent reason. It was just me and Ryan at first, but we got bored, so we took an hour and walked up to Shara's house and brought her back with us. Shara's a pretty nice person, overall... but I get the feeling that she dosen't like me very much, or at least being around me... I like being around her, though... the fact that she LOOOOOVVESSSS Nine Inch Nails is one of the main reasons I wanted to meet her so badly, because where I live, that's a rare thing to come across. We walked over to Krogers, and I had to hide my face because that's where my dad works, and I didn't wanna get recognized and ratted out by his co-workers... even though I'm still probably gonna get yelled at for coming in so late... Me and Ryan were reading the tabloids while Shara was trying to find some Make-up for some strange reason... I still think that Meganess is gonna ditch Harrison for someone else, but just in case either of them read this, I'm not gonna name my prediction on who it's gonna be... Now I'm just sitting here watching the Grahm norton Effect... Humorous show, really. Quite thought provoking, though not as thought provoking as Tough Crowd...  I really like Comedy, as long as it's good comedy, though you probably can't tell from my posts here... I'm through being all nice and shit around people for their comfort when I'm really bleeding on the inside, I'm not gonna do it anymore... I'm done being fake, false, and faux... that's my three "f's"... I hate them to no end...  I'm starting school again in a little while... maybe a week, I dunno... really looking foreward to seeing Loren again, maybe getting to talk to her some more... heh, listen to me, missing someone I hardly know... I really do wanna talk to her again, though...  Smoking alot of Wowie Mauie... Till next time...

      You know that song "Hold On" by the FudgePackers, I mean Good Charolette?? It's total BullShit... If you feel like commiting suicide, then you should do it. Don't follow what a band (Especially a shitty band like GC or LP) tells you to. Hell, if I did that, I wouldn't be writing this right now... I'd be passed out in a gutter, sleeping off my heroin high... I'm told by my friends (few that they are) that I listen to alot of weird bands, as you can probably tell by my 100 favorite bands post a while back... It kinda pisses me off that some of "friends" actually like bands like Slipknot and Pearl Jam, but that's mostly just because of my wide musical expierience... plus those bands really SUCK ASS!!! I really hate musically retarded people that can't tell noise from melody... course what do I know?? I like Nirvana, after all... not really much melody there... Nirvana... even though they're one of my favorite bands, I think that they're so over rated... Kurt Cobain was probably them WORST guitar player ever... but a true poet nonetheless... the real reason that so many... umm, how should I put this... BASTARDS listen to Nirvana, is 1)They don't know what the lyrics really mean, and 2)Since Kurt suicided young, he will be forever renowed as a tortured musical genious, and therefore, the Bastards are bound to like him. But wait, there are certain flaws in this theory... like 1)So many other musical geniouses died early (ex- Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, and Jim Morrison), but none of them are nearly as popular with the High School Scene as Kurt and Nirvana. 2)Kurt commited suicide, which is already highly unique among the aforementioned musicians, but what's more is that he WASN'T on drugs when he did it... The media told the public that because they couldn't think of another good explanation, but Cobain was in fact clean from all illegal substances when he fired that gun. It wasn't drugs (like Joplin or Hendrix), it was his twisted, warped, and raped mind. He couldn't handle the pressure of fame and fortune that hit him so quickly, and just because of that one song, too... John Lennon was shot... that both pisses me off and confuses me... Lennon was an wordly symbol of peace and love, less than a god, but more than man, y'know?? Yet, some poor fool found the courage to shoot Lennon... Who in the seven circles of the fucking Occult would even think to do such a thing as to shoot John fucking Lennon!?!?! I still don't know, but I'm working on it...  My hands feel out what my eyes can't see Confined to my closet, I can barely breathe

      I just read Meganess' Live Journal... She's worlds deeper than Harrison gives her credit for... Even though I support my friends in most anything and everthing they do, I don't think that it's gonna work out between them (if either of them read this, it's just my opinian and there's really no reason to have a shit-fight over it)I know, I know... I kinda sound like Ryan now... But I just Can't help it... I think it's great that Meganess has all these disturbing thoughts, it makes her unique in a way. Yesterday, me, Ryan, Kevin, Shara, Meganess, Steven, and Harrison all went to the park by the college for reasons that I can no longer remember... I feel in the creek like a jackass, Shara almost did, but I caught her. WE all ran around and got really sweaty and dirty... Kevin ran away from us, and we had to go find him after Meganess and Shara left. Apparently he got his hair cut... into a mullet... he looks like a real redneck now.   Now on to my lovelife, not that it's any of your business. Since my breakup with Nicky, I'm feeling a lot more free and happy than I was with her, kinda strange... not really. Those last days of school last year, I could realy feel, and almost see, the sexual tension between me and Lauren. I know I've gone out with her before, and I know that she broke up with me... but I also know that a second try would be worth it. Loren... ah, what can I say about her except:Near Perfect... she has a thing about her... just lets me open up to her, tell her anyhting... I've only talked to her twice... I miss someone I don't even know that well... Then there's Hailey and Chloe. Both of them were very nice to me, respected my beliefs, and kept their distance when it was nessecary... but they've both got boyfriends, so it's unlikely.  I hate everything. Mostly I hate the depression I feel as I sit alone in the confines of the wood-and-plaster prison called my room. Sometimes I just wanna hang myself from the rafters of a library, maybe get blugened to martyred by a pitching machine, or even a nice, quiet death, like injecting myself with and empty syringe... but that's just me. You shouldn't model your life after anybody else's, no matter how succesful or kewl you think they are, just live your own life the way you want to... Get up and get out into the world, just be yourself. Commit Suicide if you want, if you're looking for someone to help talk you out of things like that, you're seriously reading the wrong thing...   Still Shmokin

       You are an earthly goddess, a lost angel fallen from the clouds, and I as a mortal am not worthy of your affection. Blech. This romance shit makes me wanna puke up my testicles.    &nbsp;  To miss is to want. To love is to need.    &nbsp;  Can any good really come out of violence?? Kurt Cobain thought so, and in a way so did Gahndi. But they both died of unnatural causes, one by his own hand, the other was killed, so who's to ask?? My music and writing refect my beliefs and ultimate vision. Every religion is WRONG!!! God is DEAD!!! If you can't deal with that, FUCK YOU!!!

       Summer school is finally over, but Loren wasn't there for the last day, so I couldn't give her back her hair ties. I had to do a speech about satnd-up comedy, always an ambition of mine but will probably never be a reality. Yesterday, Loren and I discussed our many stages of depression and addiction, she read my pages and said that I have a reason not to smile. She also said that she also writes things like that whenever she is angry or sad, better yet, if she gets tired of looking at what she writes, she burns it, and I have an afixation of fire. Loren could very well be my next girlfriend.    Cheerful on the outside, but a permanent heroin binge on the inside   A MATCH MADE IN PURGATORY...

       I feel that I should introduce myself, my beliefs, and any other dumbassed thing I feel like before I actually use this thing. My name is not important, my beliefs, however, are of the utmost importance. I'm not gonna try to force my beleifs onto you or anything, I feel that freedom of will is the most important thing in a person's life, I just think if you actually pay attention to what I say, it may prove to be great advice. I believe that the government is out to get all of us, or at least the ones that don't&nbsp;behave like good little drones and&nbsp;sit in front of the mind-warping television. I believe that music, most specifically grunge and punk,&nbsp;is the most effective weapon in the world. I'm also an aspireing vocalist/lyricist, but only in the aforementioned genres, none of that rap and pop&nbsp;shit. I believe that veryone should do&nbsp;and say what they feel when they feel it. that's mostly all for now, check ya laters...&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I know I haven't been posting here in awhile, or in my other blog for that matter... but that's mostly just because I haven't really had anything to say as of late... I can't read my friends blogs and/or LJs anymore, because they've become so repetitive and redundant to the point of nearly putting me to sleep, and I wouldn't blame them if they hate me a litte more than they already do because of that... I don't expect anyone to read this ritualisticly, although there is at least one person that I know of that does (she knows who she is). I don't expect my opinians to be taken seriously, I know I'm not... but I don't want anyone to think of me as just this drugged-out, immature, chronicly depressed jackass... though I am most certainly all of those and more. I need to stop being so depressed, I need some happiness, that's why I've staying been home and keeping to myself lately, although I do miss hanging out with my friends I don't need to feel that tension and depression in the air, it will soon drive me even more insane than I already am. I feel so suicidal right now... I think I'm gonna go bang my head into a brick wall for awhile.  Coming down the mountain One of many children Everybody has their own opinian Everybody has their own opinian Holing it back, it hurts so bad Jumping out of my flesh and I said Cash in!!!    -Mountain Song by Jane's Addiction

      Well... I'm just over here at Steven's house for the night... watching Alien... pretty kewl movie... everyone else went to Hastings for the day, Kevin stole a copy of Driv3r, from the dumpster, of course...  I'm gonna try to get Steven to call Hailey tommorow... gods, I wanna talk to her and Loren so bad, but I don't have Loren's number on hand, so she's unlikely... but more on that in my other blog eventually... I've as of late been listening to more Stone Temple Piolets, Bad Brains, and The Melvins and less of Nivana... well, less of "mainstream" Nirvana, as I still lsten to Bleach continuously... I love STP, especially songs like Sex Type Thing, Creep, and Where The River Flows... Bad Brains is kinda reggae/punk stuff... all black guy band like Living Colour... And I love them for it...  In my eyes, I'm not crazy In my face, it's not over In your womb, I'm not older In your eyes, I'm not worth it           -Kurt Cobain  well, I'm gettin pretty tired, so I'm gonna sign off pretty soon...

      Today, we (me, Ryan, Meganess, Kevin, Harrison, and Steven) all went to Shara's house and hung out for awhile. I was the first one there, naturally as I live the closest to her. Meganess and Harrison were next, and we played "Texopoly" until Ryan came. THen we were all talking, and I guess I said something wrong, because Meganess lunged at me and gripped me around the throat and started yelling at me about me not understanding what exactly went on between her, Harrison, and Ryan, along with alot of other stuff to leangthy to mention. If not for the death-grip on my throat, I would've responded with some problems of my own... But that was for the best, I suppose. Afer Meganess let go of my throat, she ran off to Shara's front orch and cried, I guess... I wasn't there... Harrison went to console her, and the room got extremely uncomfortable. I'm lucky Shara was blocking the other door, or else I would've went outside and lit up and the blunt I had in my pocket and broke my sober vows. I eventually went ouitside (with Shara's urging) and apologized to Meganess. We hugged and made up, I guess... then Kevin and Steven came around, and we decided to walk over to Brookshires and Dollar General to get Shara some stuff...  Well, I'm tired of typing, so I'm gonna go ponder different ways to kill myself while listening to some depressing grunge music.... I hope I'm strong enough to stay sober and alive, wish I sould show my true self in front of other people, but everyone always thinks I'm already so happy... but the truth is, I'm more depressed than most goths...

      Whenever I close my eyes, I no longer see the voluptuous female bodies, cringing and blushing from the embarassing positions that I put them in. I now see vividly grotesque images of decapitated teenagers, cut and bloody torsos, and cancerous lungs. I am geniuinely afraid... afraid to close my eyes, even just to blink. I haven't slept in nearly a week, I can no longer dream...  Where are you Loren?? I need someone to confide in...  3 days sober and counting... Meganess be with me...

      Today we went to Java Jacks and hung out there for awhile, we being me, Ryan, Kevin, Steven, Meganess, and Harrison. It was pretty fun, I guess,Meganess finally got to read in my notebook, and I'm told she wrote something of her own in there, so I'll have to read that... except I left my notebook at Shara's house... so dissapionted... Hmmm, I really having a hard time getting over this Addiction thing, Meganess is really helping out, even if she dosen't know that she is. I don't know, I guess it just helps to know that there is someone who cares, someone who will pick me up if I ever fall... but now I'm just rambling... Steven called Hailey to see if she could come to Java Jacks too... but she wasn't home, so she didn't come along... Too bad, too, cause I was really looking forward to seeing her again... I know, I know what you're thinking "Whatever happened to that Loren girl??" right?? Well, she never really went anywhere... but Hailey is... well, she's just alot more accesible to me right now... stop your nasty thinking, you perverts, I mean to say that I can reach her easier if I ever need too... Hmmm... but I can't just abandon Loren and Lauren, can I...?? No, that wouldn't be right... if I still have feelings for them, it wouldn't be right to abandon all thought for them... Hailey's nice, but she's no slut, she'll need at least some recovery time... I've told Steven about my feelings for her, and he said he liked her too, but he would back off if I wanted her that much... He's a real friend, y'know... hard to come by these days... I can honestly say, if it were me in his position, I would not have given up that easily... But I both thank him and praise him for his sacrifice...   THANK YOU, STEVEN!!!  My Teen Angst Has A Body Count  3 days sober and counting... Meganess be with me...

      I just woke up a couple hours ago... I've kind of been neglecting some of my friends... and I've also been informed that some of my posts may or may not have offended a certain person or persons, and if this is true I'm very sorry... Oh, wait, no I'm not. If I'm not offensive or opinionated, then I'm not me... And if you can't deal with that, then maybe we shouldn't hang out as much... that's all I'm saying on that... I've been reading Kevin's LJ... nice to see an argument from a quasi-nuetral point of view... Man, I hate this whole thing, it's making too many people take sides, pretty soon the group will split into two, and somehow I will end up in between them, not really on one side but not on the other either, y'know?? So I'm done... no use in beating a dead horse till it rots and the rancid smell suffocates you (or however that saying goes), I'm going to stop arguing and just let it die down... Anybody that has argued with me on this, I'm sorry you're losing my support, but I can't do it anymore... if our group splits up, I don't wanna feel responsible for that... I'm just gonna sit back, and let whatever happens happen... I haven't read Meganess' LJ in a while, even though I'm told she loves to read this... I feel so self-absorbed right now, talking only about me me me, even though Meganess tells me I'm not... she says that she can tell I'm a real good person... but sometimes I question that... I mean, what measures a good person anyway?? If I'm a good person it certainly can't be complete soberness from all illegal substances, complete kindness towards all others, or an inner voice that tells me to stop and think about what I'm saying... Hmm... I'm going to go ponder this for awhile...  There's a girl that I know Her whole life is EMO She's got the clothes and the cons Thinks she's kewl like the Fonz  2 days sober and counting... Meganess be with me...

      *~*~*Sarah*~*~*  My name is Sarah   I am but three,   My eyes are swollen   I cannot see,   I must be stupid   I must be bad,   What else could have made   My daddy so mad?   I wish I were better   I wish I weren't ugly,   Then maybe my mommy   Would still want to hug me.   I can't speak at all   I can't do a wrong   Or else I'm locked up   All the day long.   When I awake I'm all alone   The house is dark   My folks aren't home   When my mommy does come   I'll try and be nice,   So maybe I'll get just   One whipping tonight.   Don't make a sound!   I just heard a car   My daddy is back   From Charlie's Bar.   I hear him curse   My name he calls   I press myself   Against the wall   I try and hide   From his evil eyes   I'm so afraid now   I'm starting to cry   He finds me weeping   He shouts ugly words,   He says its my fault   That he suffers at work.   He slaps me and hits me   And yells at me more,   I finally get free   And I run for the door.   He's already locked it   And I start to bawl,   He takes me and throws me   Against the hard wall.   I fall to the floor   With my bones nearly broken,   And my daddy continues   With more bad words spoken.   "I'm sorry!", I scream   But its now much too late   His face has been twisted   Into unimaginable hate   The hurt and the pain   Again and again   Oh please God, have mercy!   Oh please let it end!   And he finally stops   And heads for the door,   While I lay there motionless   Sprawled on the floor   My name is Sarah   And I am but three,   Tonight my daddy   Murdered me.   There are thousands of kids out there just like Sarah. And you can help.   Please pass this poem on because as crazy as it might sound, it might just indirectly change a life. Hey, you NEVER know. Please put this in your diary, if you are *AGAINST CHILD ABUSE*  That is such a sad poem... poor little kid. Pass it on guys

      I have just gotten some news from my good buddy Steven... you can decide if it's good or bad... I have just been informed that the aforementioned Hailey has just become single again... broke up with her boyfriend Justin... kinda sad, I guess... except that I really HATE the FUCK out of Justin, for some odd reason that I can no longer remember... well, that's mostly all... oh yeah, now I have another love life choice, which is kinda kewl, i guess... I mean Hailey was always real nice to me... And I know her alot better than Loren... I'm probably gonna have to make a choice soon, cause Steven and me are talkin about inviting her along the next time we get together... guess I'll sign off, think about my current predicament... even though it's not a real problem, I'm very angry at myself because of it...  Sober 1 day and counting... Meganess be with me...

      I have a problem... a serious problem, not like most people's problems today. I'm addicted to both marijiuana and LSD... pot and acid... I'm trying to quit, or at least stop using them so much... but the path to complete/partial soberness isn't exactly beaten... Meganess says she'll help me through it any way she can, though... that makes me feel a hell of a lot better about doing this, knowing someone like her is behind me to help me back up in case I fall or stray the aforementioned path... After all, I tried this once before... back when I was dating Nicky... but I only made it one day, because I'm WEAK... this is a pretty mind-purging and though-provoking song, "You Know You're Right" by Nirvana... I just love the sarcasm lines "Things have never been so swell/I have never felt this well"... really speaks to me, though not as much as immeadiately after those lines, when Kurt Cobain belts the word "Pain" and holds it out to four syllables... I love this song... probably more than I love myself, which isn't a whole lot anyway... I'm gonna have a hard time getting over my Addictions... I'd like to start as soon as possible, though... not many people will like the sober me... I'll be too violent and depressed for most people to handle... which is just fine by me... well, I'm gettin pretty tired, it's pretty late, so I'm gonna have to sign off...  I drink and I smoke I smoke and I drink But the pain never fades And the greatest crime I can think of Is to keep on going When I can't take it Anymore
