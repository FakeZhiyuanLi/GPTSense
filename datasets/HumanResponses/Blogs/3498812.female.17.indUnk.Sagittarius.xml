      When you thought I wasn't looking you hung my first painting on the refrigerator, and I wanted to paint another. When you thought I wasn't looking you fed a stray cat, and I thought it was good to be kind to animals. When you thought I wasn't looking you baked a birthday cake just for me, and I knew that little things were special things. When you thought I wasn't looking you said a prayer, and I believed there was a God that I could always talk to. When you thought I wasn't looking you kissed me good-night, and I felt loved. When you thought I wasn't looking I saw tears come from your eyes, and I learned that sometimes things hurt -- but that it's alright to cry. When you thought I wasn't looking you smiled, and it made me want to look that pretty, too. When you thought I wasn't looking you cared, and I wanted to be everything I could be. When you thought I wasn't looking -- I looked...and wanted to say thanks for all those things you did when you thought I wasn't looking.  -by Mary Rita Schilke Korzan  Parents can be rough and strict sometimes...but I think all too often we forget the little things they taught us - the special things - the important things in life.  Parents need encouragement sometimes too, and it can be as simple as saying thanks or giving them a hug...  HUGS A hug is the perfect gift One size fits all And no one minds if you exchange it.

      Proverbs 23 17. Let not thine heart envy sinners:  but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long. 18. For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.  Have you ever listened to a preacher talk about the world and its sinful habits and how we should resist them not only because God says so but because if we give into the "flesh" and sin then we will reap horrible consequences?  There is nothing wrong with messages that focus on the bad things that will result from sin, but I think there are other ways of getting motivation than scaring people out of sinning.  Did you ever think about the fact that one day all of the temptation will end?  God promised it.  Have you ever thought of the joy of going to heaven and for those of us who stick it out in the Christian life there will be rewards for us?  I've always wondered what those rewards will be like.  I know that some will be crowns...they must be glorious crowns too, I mean, look at the beauty here on earth - even when it's messed up by a flood and horrible destruction of it takes place everyday with wars and terrible storms - it is still one of the most beautiful and comforting entities to behold.  It's true beauty cannot even be captured in a painting or on picture film it's so magnificent!  If God can create such a wondrous planet such as earth that man even in all of his wickedness cannot fully corrupt and taint its beauty...what amazing treasures will He give His children when they meet him in heaven!  I don't know about you, but that's motivation enough for me.

      Would ya look at the time...2:16am.  lol, I don't think I've ever been so stressed in all my life...and yet I am leaving with a feeling of peace about the situation(s).  Listening to more than one person talk about "life-altering" circumstances and trying to solve them all at the same time can sound like a challenge...and, guess what, it is.  It's what I do though, and while it may have a horrible effect on me...I stick with it because I feel my friends deserve atleast my attention.  Most of them deserve much more than that.  Sometimes I wish I could split myself into more than one of me so I could better let them know that I care...but I have to remind myself that I can only do what I am capable of doing - no more.  I'll let my friends use me as their valuable resource as much as they want, as long as they want, until I run out...because I care about them more than I do myself.

      Konnichiwa! I was looking through some old agendas of mine and I found a poem that I thought I had lost.  I had only kept one copy of it so I was surprised to find it.  Right now I'm stuggling with commitment to every day things like sticking to my moral choices and keeping promises, etc.  It's always nice to find little reminders of importance and "hard work pays off" type things so, here's the poem:                   COMMITMENT Commiment is what transforms a promise into reality. It is the words that speak boldly of your intentions. And the actions which speak louder than the words. It is making the time when there is none. Coming through time after time after time, year after year after year. Commitment is the stuff character is made of the power to change the face of things. It it the daily triumph or integrity over skepticism. -author unknown  Hope this was some sort of encouragement or inspiration to you. Later Days, SMS.

      You know something really neat about the summertime - you can go out side for your devotions.  This morning, I went outside around 9:30 am (cause I slept in 'till about 9 o'clock ^_^')  and it was really peaceful.  The sun was out and the sky was a beautiful bright blue, sort of like the calm after the storm (considering we had tornadoes in Indy the night before).  It just gave me a great atmosphere.  Any way, I read Romans chapter 5.  The verse(s) I wanted to share with you are:            Romans 5:3-5                 3) And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also:              knowing that tribulation worketh patience;                 4) And patience, experience, and experience, hope:                 5) And hope maketh not ashamed;  because the love of God               is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is              given unto us.  (BTW, I use the King James version of the Bible.  I'm not opposed to any other version; it's just my preference.)  I enjoyed these verses because it seems like so many times as individuals we complain in our hearts about the trials we have in life and the struggles we constantly face so much so that we forget why we have them.  The hard times we go through are there to make us better and stronger morally and in our relationships with God and our friends.  So, the next time you find yourself complaining, just remember that the trial, situation, or whatever can make you a better person if you learn from it.                                                                 -have a great day! ^_^

      Have you ever had a bad day?  Life just doesn't seem to give you a break.  I've learned something though, going to a close friend is one of the best things you can do...if not the best.  I'd like to thank my best friend Josh for being there when I needed him.  I may not always treat him the best...but he means alot to me.  I hope this little note will mean something to him.  Thank you Josh.

      Yeah, okay, so I'm gonna be majorly bored this summer.  Thought I'd try something different so here I am writing to everyone who doesn't care.  But that's ok.  You don't have to read all this anyway.  To make it short I'll be tellin' you what I like and don't like about certain things in the world and if get the chance to update this every once in a while I'll give ya my devotional for the day or week or whatever.  Hope you get something out of this little blog...even if it is - "my word this girl is on somethin'!"

      Summer finally arrived for me.  My family had our first cook-out.  Grilled hotdogs and hamburgers, some watermelon, homemade lemonade - it was great.  We got our pool running again, and I went swimming for the first time this summer.  I was a little too happy as they say and stayed out a little too long...not a good idea.  The sun has now left it's long yet temporary mark on me...yes, I look like a tomato.  But hey, it was the classic way of jumping into summer.  Any way, it has been a few days since my last blog; it's not my fault though, it's the computer's.  I had a little virus problem, but all is well now.  And here is a random fact for the day:  Did you know that most frosting on cake is made from pure lard, and that the most common brand is Crisco.  Now you know.  And here is my verse(s) for the day: Job 37 13) He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 14) Hearken unto this, O Job:  stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.  Life can get pretty gloomy and depressing sometimes...but the only reason it does is because we let life get that way.  Job had every reason in the world to have a "bad day" but did he?  His first thought was "I must have sinned against God" so he asked God's forgiveness.  When his torment didn't go away, he didn't curse God and kill himself;  Job trusted God's plan for him, and knew that it would somehow be for God's glory in the end.  Be more like Job today and think of how a trial can be more of a blessing.

      I have often dreamed of such things as magic and mystery, enchantment and beauty.  I very well may have spent a lifetime searching for what I believed they were if it hadn't been for an unexpected influence.  "It is magic for the sun to rise, warm your face, and set, and for the seasons to change the face of the earth.  It is mysterious to gaze into an endless night sky that glistens with millions of stars.  Forests with trees and brooks, fields with flowers and fauna, mountains with sky-lines and waterfalls, and oceans with magnificent creatures and crystal-like reflections - all hold within them an enchantment.  While, to their all-powerful Creator, are nothing compared to the beauty of a human smile."  From the smallest flower to the largest mountain, creation was a gift of magic for our enjoyment...for our smile. How often do your surroundings make you smile? Do you let them?
