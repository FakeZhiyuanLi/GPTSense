      If you believe, That we've got a picture perfect plan, We've got you fooled, 'Cause we only do the best we can. And sometimes we make it. Sometimes we back it. But we get one step closer each and everyday, And we'll figure it out on the way. -Lizzie Maguire, "The Lizze Maguire Theme"   the first day back from break was amazing. it made me realize how much fun school had become. we worked more on our research reports and fam. tree projects, and english was fully devoted to romeo and juliet.  on monday we got a pysco bomb threat and they came in to shonicks class (A3) and they were like "kitty" or thats what chris remembers hearing. and then on tuesday (the day of the first fight of the week) we found out there was a bomb threat. bleh. it was some shitty teens who were trying to rob a bank and like i dunno.. it was in the paper.. i guess i shoulda read it..  wednesday (i think) was lisa's birthday and her, kate, emily and tessas dropped into the library during my break. we sat around and talked and lisa had this HOTT shirt that tess made! jorden stopped by too. oo yeah, since they ditched they all had fake names.  lisa- marie porter jorden- nathalie green tess- elizabeth kate- can't remember..  it was awesome. the history homework had been lightened because Mr. Shonick wanted us to devote time to our research reports. the next day, in english, we performed the opening to romeo and juliet. chris was tybalt and i played benvolio and that BITCH STABBED ME!! i think my dagger was defective... but i got him back, in the begininng ot the party i was capulet and he was tybalt again and i hit him in the back of the head for wanting to kill romeo. freak. kidding~ chris hastings is the coolest. alyssa was romeo tho! shes sooooo skinny.. and lisa was juliet...  on friday i went to math as always, at 7:40, then i had my open so i went into the library and had to sit thru the dancers dancing. bleh. eric watson was in there... and a bunch of girls.. LIKE THE MISSING ONE!! oh yeah, this chick went missin on wednesday and there were 2 more fights that week... so i wrote nathalie a 10 page note which took the whole entire period...  well anyway, after my break i skipped PE cause i really didnt feel good so i went with christina (who has an open B3) and so we walked around soquel village in the rain. she shared a bunch of personal stories with me and i shared some with her.. it was a bonding experience. we went to this like "Lion Park" and there was rain and stuff.. and we went to this yoga place and i almost died laughing!! it was great! then we went to the baglery and ate and we started walking back to school so i could get my camera (not that i had anyone to ake pictures of at harbor!! bleh!!) and we saw christina's mom and so we went to try and get crystal and nathalie outta class but they wouldnt come... so christina and i got my shirt and my camera from my locker.. and then stopped my longoria's room to wave at katy, matt, carson and chris... oo i think alec was in there too...  well we got in christina's car and drove to harbor. the bell hadn't rung yet so we decided to go walk down to the bus stop to check the times but then we got to mud and i was like "nuh uh!" and so we walked back up to the school and we talked with matt and tina and elena and fidel and NAOMI BRADFORD!! she is my harbor lover! i swear, if it wasnt for her i would have tottally had a shitty time. but yeah..  while naomi was off somewhere i was talking with elena jin and nathalie called so we went to go find her and steve saw me and he was like "BEN! BEN!" and i thought he was talking to me but i guess not! cause im not BEN! SORRY STEVE! :-(  with crystal + nathalie there it was a hell of a lot funner! christina and nathalie and crystal and i tottally shined! it was awesome! i would do it all again.. except i would've looked for jaye.. and maybe talked to michael and tell chris albrect (dominic's butt buddy) that i wasn't gonna beat him up.. ha thats funny...  so the bell rang and i went up to tina and hugged her for like a minute and she was like "get off me!" and then we started to walk down to the bus stop. it was shitty and muddy and i called jack vidnovic to try and get a ride but he had already left. stupid A days.. we got down to the bus stop right as the bus pulled away. "oh well, only 15 min." we thought. so we sat. and waited. and there was still no bus. so we sat and tapped our thrid eyes like that chick from Rich Girls. and STILL NO BUS CAME! so we were just about to start walking when this bus came around the corner and we all got on and paid money. i sat with christina and across from us sat nathalie and crystal. this girl new gabi, nathalie's cousin, and she talked to us for a little bit.  we decided on that bus ride that the next time we went to harbor we would PLAN IT OUT waaay ahead of time!  that weekend i got some early christmas presents like NOW 14!!! its a great CD!! luken is the awesomest!! and on saturday i drove up to SF with Andrew Galvez and his two friends, Kathy and Veronica. it was cool! and we went shopping EVERYWHERE!!  banana republic, urban outfitters, abercrombie, american eagle, victoria's secrets, fcuk, macys (OO IT WAS SOOOO FUCKING PRETTY!!), and i acctually think that was it.. hmm.. mebbe there was more... there were a lotta gay guys! and it was super fun cause andrew was there and he bought me in the zone and i bought myself the missy elliot CD. it was one of the BEST days of my life!!  on monday it was a pretty normal C day.. until english. our counselors came in and talked to us about college. i had a lotta questions and so fromnow on when anyone asks "any questions?" chris turns to me and says "brandon?"... yeah.. we also got our schedule options for next semester, but i didnt wanna change anything... well the whole talk was really exciting... it really opened my eyes and that night i searched online for college resources and academic standards.. and i was talking to JACK about it and he said that i didnt EVER come across as the INTELLECTUAL type! psh!! i guess its true then, he REALLY doesnt noe me!!  on tuesday and wednesday i was in full college over achiever mode. i asked questions (like chris knew i would) in all my classes and my french teacher said i was too much of an acheiver and that i would prolly end up killing someone one day. :-D oo i also met micheal over the phone monday and he was pretty awesome. thanks for transferring my calls dominic! even if you did have a shitty weekend and got drunk without me FOR THE SECOND TIME i still love you.. except not. on wednesday i even went to a french club meeting!! it was sooo cool!! we're having a french club party in january and spencers house! spencer the guy, not the girl!! he's soooo hott! tess and tiana and nathalie and naomi and kate are gonna be there too!! its sooo cool!  thursday was rainy. i dont like the rain. but at the same time i love it. we traded rough drafts in shonick and everyone who read mine said that it was good but no one could give me feedback. blah... that day after school while ellen and i were waiting for our ride, i danced with annie under the eaves and then hannah and i talked about starting a club.. lol we came up with funky names.. it was hilarious!! but then my dad came so we left~  friday was boring. nothing fun happened EXCEPT I BEAT hannah and elizabeth and emila and ivy in knock out! hahaha! can't touch this! it was really fun! but yeah when i got home i worked hard on my report and thats basically what i did all weekend.. i slept a lot on sunday and i finished my french family tree project that day... and on saturday (with help from juntado) i started THIS BLOG~!! and on saturday i also watched BUFFY SEASON FIVE~ HELL YEAH IT KICKED ASS! i cried at the end of "The Body" but, of course, dominic was there to kinda cheer me up.  monday i brought my family tree project. we worked more on rough drafts in shonick and thankfully it was so short tat we didnt work THAT long... bleh~ monday was lame.  tuesday was better. we had a sub in math and we did book work the whole period... it was easy and i finished early so i wrote a note to nathalie. piano was awesome and i passed a bunch of songs and got my grade up to a B.. all i have to do is pass 3 more songs and i get an A!! we played this really fun game and i was on a team with the lockewood sisters and ellen and angelica and umm... some other people who are REALLY cool but i dont noe their names. HAHA we brought briana, sara and lisa (not biancalana)'s team DOWN TO CHINA TOWN!! it was great!! the funniest part was annie was sick! the one day we have loads of fun she gets SICK!  well in shonick we did rough drafts for the last time.. the report was due on thursday. oo yeah katherine read mine and SHE DID A SUPER JOB~~ seriously!! she was the only one who could like.. correct it at all!! she is tottally my next pick for proof-reader... ooo in english we watched a scene from romeo and juliet and he had to pants on :-o !! it was.. magical.. as stephen would say.. oh yeah, him and i stopped fighting that day!! it was cool i guess...  wednesday we played knock out again.. its such a fun game! we also tried super knock out which.. i guess.. is where if the person who gets you out gets out by soemone else you're back in. so you win by beating EVERYONE~!! we didnt really finish.. but elizabeth and i talked a lot about.. mm.. stuff... mostly candy.. and during my open i hung out with tiana andkate in the library cause tiana needed to finish her family tree project. she has a really cool family.  thursday i wore abercrombie pajamas! they have mooses on them. we had a sub again in math and we played pictionary AGAIN.. oo we did that on wednesday too.. i forgot to write it tho~ anyone, my pajamas caught everyone's attention and yeah! it was fun stuff. we turned in research reports in history and watch the simpson's odessy and the simpsons hamlet!   "Now when people get wood they'll think of Trojans.." haha flanders...  anway, it was nice having a relaxing day in every class. i wished everyone i had A days with a Merry Christmas before it was over.  friday was the best! i got flooded with gifts.. and i talked with marissa and cloey (shoreline people) in the library. haha i tottally thought of the perfect april fools joke!! thanks marissa~!!  in pe ivy and i made up funny stories while running around the gym.

      If at first you don't succeed, Dust yourself off and try again. You can dust it off and try again. -Aaliyah, "Try Again"   this was a really fun month. it starts on the saturday of kassie's birthday party.   Kassie's friend rachel (this really funny girl from scotts valley, who i hung out with in jully...? sometime around then, we anyway, she) had a friend named luigi who came out and was all gay and stuff. well he gave rachel a book and an invite to the party he was having the next week at his (WOOT WOOT) BEACH HOUSE!! so like yeah.. i was thinking about going but they all said he was ugly so i kinda reconsidered..  anoways the party was really fun! we all were playing ddr and then it was like pizza dinner or something.  rachel+ kassie shared a seat and going left there was: stephanie, cali, kayla, cody, jourdain, ellen, kalie, teena, me and monica. well i kinda sat on the edges of both teena and monicas chairs. BAD idea. i almost fell... twice. and i was wearing my nice sweater...  well yeah after presents (wow, there were alotta animal stuff!) we got ready to leave.. and then we left for THE CORN MAZE~!! the ride up kalie and i sang country songs cause kassie's mom really like the western station.   so we get to the maze and like we go in the entrance and this guy tells us aboutthe maze and its all cold and dark and we can hear music from the haunted ranch place and so we like go in and we wander around finding different things and yeah... we end up all getting seperated, me with cody young. cody and i kinda kissed akwardly and yeah.. we continued on and kassie, teena, rachel and all of them jumped out and scared us. but no one was as scared as monica. i felt bad for her... but anyway, i was with her and then the chain saw guy was like somewhere and we ran and it was so scary.  From the windoooow To the kitchen!  Put some hot sauce on that chicken, Damn yo breath is kickin'!  So eventually we got bored with the whole "wandering-around-the-maze" thing and we decided to go str8 to the haunted ranch. now when we got to the entrance it was kinda creepy but it didnt seem scary at all!! teena was scared so since kalie had gone already, her and teena went out of the maze and waited for us at the exit.   in line, the actors (who were in costume), would try to scare us. first it was this vampire lady with big boobs. she scared me and kassie was like "don't worry, he's gay!!" RIGHT when she said that word a bunch of guys turned around and kinda looked at me. they were really cute, but yeah i figured they were red necks or something...  so we waited in line and i would ask all the actors if i could have a hug cause i ain't 'fraid of no ghost *wink* and then we got ready to go in and we annoyed this bunny man. a lot. so we went in the maze.. kayla, kassie, rachel, cali, stephanie, cody and i. everyone else went after us. it was really creepy in the begininng and cody fell and he was like "leave me! leave me!" and i was like "you are not being left behind!" and i piggy backed him thru the rest of the thing.. oo and i met a really cute vampire who was flirting with me and he was REALLY cute in his vampire make up. so we get outta the place after passing this scary girl who looked like she crawled outta a hybrid of the ring and the shining, we got to the CHAIN SAW GUY! and he like chased us it was soooo cooool!! and then we like left and on the way home teena and kalie were talking about the boys that had turned around when kassie called me gay, and kalie was like "they were touching each other and stuff... tottally fruity!"  so yeah.. i called jorden richardson (the jourdain that was with us was different then the other jorden..) and jorden and i talked and yeah... kassies mom dropped me off and teena promised to give me the book on monday at school.   so i got home at 1 and fell asleep pretty fast... on sunday i slept all day.. i was so tired!  monday started with high hopes of the soon to be 4 day weekend. the library was FINALLY reopened after an awesome renovation. and stephen (this guy i met in october) left school do to independed studies. anyway, on wed. night stephen "came out" and by friday the whole school knew so he was pretty pissed at me. but whatever.. he was kinda lame.  OO annie ross's birthday was on thursday! it was so great i got her a monkey and she got a bunch of other shweet presents... oo yeah, mesha and i wore the monkie on our legs and made it look like it was humping us.. :-D annie got these balloons from tanya and while mesha and i were watching her stuff, one of the balloons blew onto the grass and POPPED! and then annie came back and mesh and i were like "noo!! it was the grass!" and annie didnt believe us and so i took the other balloon (she got 2 small ones and a big.. um.. shiny one) and i was like "noo!! the wind popped it!" and i shoved the balloon against the grass and it popped and i was like "like THAT!" and mesha started crackin' up! it was great! HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNIE BANANNIE~  saturday was suzie's SECOND party. in the morning i went shopping with teena and kendra and got some shweet pajamas. i was gonna meet dominic there and get my shirt back but he got their too late and we left. then the PARTAY~ i met some.. "new" people and it was a lotta fun! im even glad the rowland went dispite the fun we all had. no more vodka for ANY of you! tess is the my best sober friend! lol.. and yeah.. that party was cool but then the cops busted it at like 1 or 2 o'clock. i wasnt there tho but tess was upstairs and like the police told everyone to come down but she didnt so hahaha! i bet it went on their perm. record.   well the next day i hung out with matt and andrew galvez, old friends from cazedero! andrew is REALLY HOT and he's so sweet but he's kinda old.. and now we've decided to be friends until im older.. you noe how it is.. oh yeah, hes 20~ but that night was alotta fun and a lotta laughs! poor matt's prolly trumatized now tho :-) !  the monday of my fourday weekend i stayed home and worked for cash~! it was a lotta fun despite how it sounds, especially cause i watched the first two seasons of angel.~!! and tuseday i hung out with nathalie at the mall-o. i think christina and tina and sarah went too... mm? yeah. i got a sweater and um... i think i bought tina panties :-p  the 3 days that we were in school were kind lame. we didnt really do much in any of our classes except a test in shonick. but that wasnt too hard. i didnt do anything that weekend either. just homework and chores. cha-ching.  so the next week was the last full week of november. wootie woot! we started romeo and juliet in english, our fam. tree projects in french and our final research report in history. we learned how to use athena, this book search thing, in the library, and i got a bunch of nifty books on Joan of Arc.   that weekend i did more chores! i had made/saved 200 and was tottally ready for my shopping spree at valley fair after thanksgiving. on saturday i went to tinas house and she tried to kill me so i hid in her bathroom. but anyway, her and i talked with nathalie from 5 to 12 ish BEATING my record with DOMINIC~!! ha you lost! it was great but then i fell asleep and it kinda ended...   the last two days of school were crazy! i wished everyone a happy thanksgiving and in english we did this REALLY COOL shakepearean dance and like SOMEONE touched my ass!  patrick and i were the last ones outta mrs. miranda's class on the day before break.

      Voulez-vous couche avec moi, ce soir. Voulez-vous couche avec moi. Yeah yeah uh. -Moulin Rouge, "Lady Marmalade"  haha, the month started out great! school was awesome and everyone was so yeah..   but of course my history caught up with me and I began hearing and thinking more about dominic.   i saw him for the first time in 2 months at the mall (of course) and i kinda walked past him. he really pissed me off with his little pissy-ness but whatever. it was a fun day with janis, sally and monique. OMG! we saw ellen in the car on the drive home it was HILARIOUS!   school went on as usually... not really much change. alec was kinda acting weird and chris and patrick were a lil on the alert mode too... i think chris was stoned one day..   annie was lots of fun to hang out with and mesha as well.. and ivy was great.. i met tess in october at aldos. she was really fun and we got to be friends really really fast. michele was cool too and i talked to her and katy quite frequently.   first sat.: can you say kaboom? it was the anual monte carlo fireworks. nelli scored free tickets from kathryns mom.. lol.. even tho i bought a bunch from chris hastings..   i ended up going with kathleen and planned on meeting carolyn, nelli and katy there. i saw chris and carson (really funny guy from the h/a) there with alec. alec kinda gave me the glare and i talked to carson and chris for a little bit but continued looking at the really awesome booths.   Dominic came later... after carolyn and nelli and katy had arrived. lol! carolyn's dad is awesome! well back to dominic~ i let him borrow my shirt for no reason since he had a sweatshirt but whatever. i didnt noe i wouldnt get it back until 2004!! >:-o!   well he ditched us for other harbor people WHILE WEARING MY SHIRT!  so we wandered and i saw elizabeth and naomi and jorden and alyssa and even van dyk! the coolest math teacher from shoreline!!   the fireworks were magical. it was sooo pretty. and i wasnt that far from the rest of the soquelians.... so yeah.. it was great. :-)   lol! this is the best part~ ok so the roads were all closed cause of like some fucked up drunks and we walked to the gas station to wait for kathleen's mom. on the way these cars honked at us and i slapped my ass!! and then at the gas station i swear something was in those bushes!! well at like 11 kathleen's mom and really funny sister darlene got their and we drove to the bank and then BK to satisfy those midnight munchies :-P!   the fireworks weekend was great.   second weekend: snooze! i slept all weekend.. it was great!!   school was getting more and more fun! i was getting closer to everyone.. even patrick and i found common ground~ This is halloween, this is halloween...  the thursday b4 harbor homecoming i called dominic and he was too drunk to talk to me.. so he HUNG UP!!   thrid weekend: Harbor Homecoming go pirates! go pirates! bleh~ this weekend was kinda lame. i met tara at the frosh game and sat with tess and ivy and tara and katy. it was all good. then nathalie and tina and crystal came. after the frosh game i took a quick pic of luken! damn he transferred outta my pe class :-(! well yeah, then ivy, tess and the 3 shorline chicks all went to the deli with me and we ate food. lol.. then i farted.. BUT IT WAS TINA'S FAULT!! tess and ivy left and so i went with kalie and naomi back to the game. that was the first time i saw chris albrecht, dominic's fuck buddy. YUCK! well he was.. um.. "alrite" as nathalie put it.   well i saw dominic a lil bit before the half time of the Varsity game. annie and aby were there too! god i love annie! shes so funny.. and aby changed it this really gross porter potty... half time was kinda weird.. there were dancers.. enough said... i stole tina's lip gloss and almost O.D.ed on it! yay... i stole her soda too..   well then i went and sat with naomi and talked to this really hot guy (who turned out to be taylor!) but i doubt he remembers me.. he was REALLY hot!! oh and i saw jack.. yeah.. no comment :-/  tina had to get a ride home with nathalie and crystal so we wandered around trying to find them but ended up getting really really lost... and yeah... we found them in the end and tina was like "BYE!" and she ran.. and then i talked to dominic and he was kinda iffy but he left with chris to fuck and get ready for the dance and fuck. thats like all they do. well at least hes HAPPY~!!! :-D  yeah well i left with kalie and naomi and it was alotta fun and i was sooo gonna go to the bon fire with jack rodriguez (from french) and a bunch of santa cruz fags but i got sick :-( ...  well school that week was lame cause i had the sniffles.. but i didnt have to swim... so boo ya! elizabeth and me chilled in the gazebo, or how ever you spell it, by the pool!  on thursday i went into the girls locker room for the THIRTEENTH time and like they invited me in and shit and then mrs. locke like fucking grabbed me and hauled me to waddel's office. i got detention, but still it was better than suspension which it woulda been if mrs. locke had her way. >:-o!  the rallies leading up to our homecoming were great! and the homecoming rally was awesome. everyone wanted jeff gill to win (pshyeah~!!) but to rouse support ivy and i made up some poems  Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Damn Jeff is fine!! If I were homecoming crown, I would want him mine!  When you see him on the floor, Ooo la la, you gasp, VOTE JEFF GILL FOR KING.. Or we'll kick your ass~!!  the last weekend: OUR HOMECOMING~!!  it was sooo fucking awesome! so it starts out at the church place with naomi and we watch the parade and jeff and calire throw candy at us and its awesome! and corey was the head cheerleader and it was so cool! so naomi and i met ivy and michele and we walked up the long trail to campus. we see the parade and the band coming up the drive, and then michele and me and ivy go in early for the frosh game. we walk in and see tara and patches sitting up in the stands. so we all hang out during the frosh game and we buy food and patrick gets this little sugar packet and hes like "i think you dropped your name tag.." it was so funny and adorable! after the frosh game we went and chilled at surf city and i got a stoked strawberry.. my soon to be favorite drink!   we got back for the second half of the game and nelli came running over all frantic. "I need help with the freshman float!!" she said, "Will you help?" so patrick is like "yeah!" and we're like "patrick!" and he's like "remember that time.." "NO!!" but we ended up going because nelli is the coolest and patrick is kinda cute underneath it all. so we get to the big orange truck and we're like "no.." but we ended up decorating it and it looked great. tara and patrick ran to berverlys for markers and posters and streamers, and nelli, michele, ivy and i worked on the masking tape and shit."  Rc, the stupid butt hole, and his other senoirs got on their float.. ours was SOOO crappy. it was sad. i shared a sign with michele cause it was really big and when we went in we circled around and we made fun off the irish! ha ha ha ICE THE IRISH!! so yeah and then we went to our side and woot woot! it was fun. but they put ont he brakes and i fell on patrick. it was so much fun! alec and chris showed up and threw candy at us and patrick chucked this thing back at them.. and madalee and heddy showed up~!! they were supposed to be on the floats but oh well...  so after the floats we took down everything and i scored some pretty green shoes.. they were cute. well i went back and sat with naomi engleman this time (before it was all bradford) and amber from my PE class.. (ive mentioned her, right?) well it was great and after the game i went over to carolyn and we talked and then i went with her and madalee and heddy into the band room since naomi bradford was giving me a ride home. well it was fun and we all talked and then i left promising to dance with them at the dance.  i dressed in mardi gras clothing and my new abercrombie hat! i got to the dance and found ivy and michele and we all went in to the dance. ASB stickers really do pay off.... well the dance was fun. lots of freak dancing! the only girl i didnt dance with was ivy cause she didnt wanna with a gay man, and michele kinda danced with me but left. i had fun tho. SLOW DANCE SHOUT OUTS 2: Carolyn! Nique! and... um.. who else did I dance with!? Shit!! I think it was Tara.. but i dunno and I dont wanna be all like mean.. i freaked with everyone including that girl who wants to have fun~ ANNIE ROSS! woot woot monkie style~!! i even kinda freaked with patchy... KINDA.. but eww.. :-)  suzie and kayla were really fun and yeah.. the dance ended and ellen was nice enough to give me a ride home! woot woot! so after the dance i passed out and the next day i got really sick and i slept most of it..  the last week was really cool. it started fun and ended FANTASTIC on halloween when we all went over to suzie's house. halloween was great from beginning to end. i got pictures of everyone including sexy ivy as a bunny outta a hat and amber + naomi the sweedish bar maids! i didnt have to dress in pe cause of the costume. ooo i was LEI BOY! it was great and yeah.. french was crazy and we didnt really do anything. after school i went to suzie's and we went swimming and into a really nice jacuzzi.. wow.. thinking about it makes me wanna pee... so after we went inside and watched movies and listened to music and ate pizza! that was the first of suzie's parties!! yay! i met a lot of people at that party.. it was really cool..  halloween.. the LAST DAY OF OCToBER~!! it feels like somethin's heatin' up!  lates bRaNdOn (Choppin' Broccolli ;-))

      Fate fell short this time, Your smile fades in the summer. Place your hand in mine, I'll leave when I wanna. -Blink 182, "Feeling This"   the first day of school started kinda like i was expecting. ellen picked me up at 7:20 for the carpool. on the way i had a nervous twist in my stomach... kinda like constapation only less severe.  anyway, we got to school and i opened my locker. 2 - 96. i'd put my combo up here but there are some people reading this who i dont really trust... anyway, i went to my first class. Geometrey. we all stood outside, waiting for Mr. McConnell to show up. That's when I met christine. my first friend at soquel. She came from Holy Cross.. or maybe she got kicked outta there for not believing in god. Whatever, anyway, it was a lot of fun. i learned a lot about her and her fam. WOO HOO! she goes to hawaii every year!! cool beans! so our stubbly math teacher shows up and opens the door. he's already divised a seating chart, alphabetical order, and im stuck between alex baker and brett ackler. Now, alex is pretty cool. hes smart and all that. but brett.. brett stinks... literally... it's called deodorant. well we get our geometrey books and the lesson begins. my mind blanks and i look around the room... holy shit! im the only kid from shoreline! but wait, isnt that chris hastings.  ok, chris hastings, here's the deal.. in May i signed up to be in this intensive humanities course. The humanities academy. the orientation was in the soquel library, in May as well. i wore my spiffy cow boy outfit :-D! I met some cool people there... alec and emily. and, of course, tessa, tiana and kate were there. but back to the story.  so i see chris... and then we talk.. and he's a pretty cool guy. def someone i want as a friend. the bell rings and i look at my schedule... next stop, Piano.  well that was a boring class... i thought when i walked out of piano. all we did was fill out forms. stephanie hammond and ellen are in it with me.. ellen.. little did i know she was going to get way lame, way fast.  so next is my open. i head to the library and i sit down at a vacant table. then, a girl sits down. but not any girl.. it was spencer kaufman. one of the most popular girls at shoreline.  "hey.. brandon right?" she said. i nodded. then she looked at my schedule. "walter for pe..? always dress out and never chew gum. she said. we sat there quietly filling out forms that our A2 teachers handed out.  but pretty soon the bell rang for break.  i met christine and a bunch of other people at my locker. we all had relativley close lockers due to a mishap at orientation... ill get into that later.. anyway, for my first break i headed to my next class. History.. with Mr. Shonick.   i choose a desk next to christine, and pretty soon tessa, tiana, and kate come tortting in. we exchange hugs and "how was your summer?" and then they take seats near me. a bunch of other people come in. there's chris! and emily! oo and crystal! crystal and i have short convo and then she takes a seat next to me. well pretty soon this crazy guy with poofy hair walks in. class starts and we pretty much dont do anything except read and stuff.  the bell rings. my next class is PE.  i walk to the gym with christine and sit in the bleachers. our kinda chubby but happy looking PE teacher walks in. he calls roll and when it all done he gives us some forms. the guy behind me accidently kicks me. "sorry.." he said when i turned around. "hey, im jon luken.." this really skinny kid stares at me with a grin of braces. but whatever. he's cute. lol. we talk a bit but then its over and i head to lunch.  my first high school lunch! you noe what that means.. im going off campus :-D! on the way down with kalie and christine, i run into, GUESS WHO!! NATHALIE! nathalie and i became best friends over the summer.. and it wouldnt have been possible without the DC trip, but i'll get to that after the first day of school.. hmm maybe i should've talked about the summer first.  after buying soda and food at Hernandez, we walk back up the lazy trial (No way I'm going up Sucide Hill!)  English is next. we head back to shonick, cause thats what is says on our sheets, but he tells us to go to miranda. on the way i catch a glance from Alec! boy has he gotten hot over the summer. we fill out more forms in English. there's a lot to do, and we get new notebooks. chris makes a joke about my shirt, but its accepted. Ellen got me my shirt.. another summer story I’ll get to later.  anyway, after English I head to biology with tessa and chris. We have assigned seats and I end up sitting next to.. well.. a big hearted fat kid. Biology breezes by and im out of school. Ellen and I head down to the main parking lot to wait for my dad.   that’s when I saw him.  I was sure he was gay… but whatever the case I felt like I had to find out more about this boy. That’s when I first saw eben.  ok.. so that’s just the first day… there’s a lot more to talk about mainly the summer and stuff.. so yeah..  Later days :-D brandon

      Everybody's workin' for the weekend. Everybody wants a new romance. Everybody's going off the deep end. Everybody needs a second chance. -Loverboy, "Working For The Weekend"   oi.. the end of the summer.. so depressing. august got me addicted to soap operas and text messages. all my children is a really good show for a soap opera. they deal with situations like everyone else. but yeah.. i got over it when school started. my new cell phone tho... that was a big deal. i added every body i knew in, and i mean EVERYBODY.  august is also when i met bryan. he’s really funny but kinda sensitive... anyway, we got to noe each other and yeah.. we were friends.  ooo~ august was the month of the family summer trip. yay hawaii! the trip was a lot of fun, but i wish we spent more time on maui! i was just starting to get a good tan! anyway... we stayed at this really fancy hotel and i met a lot of guys.. you noe me.. :-D my aunt wendy lives in hawaii and i spent a lot of time with her too (no, not kalie’s mom wendy. wendy from my dad’s side)  one night my aunts wendy, debbie and norma and my uncle took us out to dinner at the outback. it was CRAZY~ norma and debbie got drunk and hit on waiters and this one guy hit on ME! plus the scary bus boy watched me potty. and i think the bartender was drunk too.   anyway.. i read a lot of books. the required reading for the Humanites academy was awful. bleh~  i got back on thursday the 14th. the day.. jamie’s mom passed away. this meant jamie would be leaving for washington (the state).. in less than a week..  on sunday the 17th i got a phone call from my “Link Crew Leader” telling me about orientation. lol. i knew from his voice that he was gay.  the orientation was 20th. and of course, nathalie left town the day before.   i picked up ellen, kalie and teena and we drove to soquel. orientation was crazy. my coming out had spread like wild fire. all the shoreliners knew. after a short speech from the president and vice president (my GAY link crew leader) we split into link groups.  the only shoreliner in my group was cloey, but that was enough. we talked about our summer and our ex’s. my link leader was RC (like the soda!). and this other girl... we played a game where we had to remember everyone’s name.. it was fun.   there was one girl in my link group. she was talking about biology and geometry and the humanities academy.. but i didnt remember her from the meeting. when we got closer to school i found out her name was nelli. everyone ran up to her and gave her hugs and she seemed mucho popular. i wanted to be her friend. lol. pathetic, i noe.  after link crew we took pictures. mine SUCKED! probably cause that guy keep telling me to turn my body. OMG! get this! his name – Harry Dong. lmao. well after pictures we got schedules and lockers. locker 2 – 96. everyone one with us got lockers around us. it was really cool.  i looked over my schedule. great. i had a 7:40 class. oh well. not that bad. after we were sure that all 6 of us- me, kassie, kalie, ashlee, teena and ellen- could open our lockers we headed to the parking lot and left. all in all the orientation was fun. oo! i met a guy named stuart saepia. none of us knew he would be kassie; first kiss.  after orientation we went back to my house and watched chicago. it was fun. we sand and danced. speaking of dancing, after the movie we played DDR. but yeah. i had to kick everyone out cause it got late.  that night i was talking to dominic about RC. he asked his ex-boyfriend jack and then jack IMed me and we talked. he seemed really cool.  the last weeks of summer all happened way too fast. the last saturday was kalie’s birthday party. kathleen and i got her CD’s. the party was so much fun. besides kathleen, naomi and lianna were also there. plus kalie’s boyfriend. woo hoo. lianna is kalie’s short but funny friend. she’s tons of fun.  around 5 nathalie called from her trip. i sat down and i started talking to her. the conversation lasted 3 hours. lol. at 8 she left to watch the cheetah girls. she wished kalie a happy birthday and.. blah. it was over.  sunday (the next day) was awesome times 50! it was the day of sally’s birthday. janis, matt, teena and sarah rorvick were there so was tina liang!   ive known sally since 7th grade. shes really athletic. lol.  tina is the coolest girl ever! her and nathalie were my best friends over the summer and they still (more or less) are. tina and matt got in this huge food fight during the party. it was great.  after ,we went back to sally’s house and jumped into her pool. it was awesome. tina wouldnt get in tho.. but i almost pushed her in once or twice... but then she pushed me in... yeah.. good times.  the last day of summer i went shopping (duh!) we saw harry and amy and tessa too! it was so much fun, you have no idea!  but nothing lasts forever. and the summer that i loved so much came to an end.  i went to bed early, but i didnt fall asleep for hours. i couldnt stop thinking about school. oi.  -Brandon!! see yaa

      The tide is high and I'm holding on, I'm gonna be your number one. I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that.. Ooooooh noooo. -Atomic Kitten, "The Tide is High"   Woot woot! it's my b-day month!  July was insane, and it all started where June left off. On July second I was outside tanning cause i wanted to look good. the thought of Dominic being gay made me realize there are probably a lot of other gay guys in Santa Cruz too. so i tanned. and then i fell alseep. and 2 hours later i woke up burned. my whole front side was red. ouch.  i took a shower and put some aloe on it... but it didnt really help.  on the fourth I went with Ili to wilder ranch. i pathetically hoped that she'd invite dominic but she didnt. that little runt. jk!!~ wilder was a lotta fun... except i was burned... and the ice cream melted... but i had my stars and stripes boxers on!! mm yeah. then, when i got back home, my grandparents came over and we had pie and stuff. oo! and the fireworks were soooo cool! my dog like wet himself, but he does that every year.  the next day jamie, maya and kristen came over.  have i mentioned maya before? maya's a really smart and really cool person from shoreline. i've known her since the end of sixth grade when we had drama together. shes lots of laughs and shes really smart. her bat mitzvah was soo much fun!  ok~ yeah.. jamie and maya and kristen came over and we watched buffy. :-D! The Hush episode was really scary and my burn was really itching. ooh yeah, and jamie broke her leg and she had to go to the ER room on the second (the same day i got my burn!).  anyway, that was fun and then it was over..  so the next day i went to see Legally Blonde 2 with Kalie, Amanda and Bobbi.   Amanda is adorable! shes funny and cute and no guy can resist that. bobbi's lots of fun too and shes a good advice-giver. anyway, the movie was really good and outside the theater we saw Jake Scruggs, Emily Hasty and CHRIS HASTINGS. coincidence or what! oo i really liked that guy from the movie and i thought he was gay the whooole time.. but then he asked that girl to marry him and it was like "bummer..."  that night all i could talk or even think about was chris. i was talking to gina and she IMed me dominic's screenname. and he wa son. so we talked for 2 hours and somehow chris left my mind. i didnt even think about him again until mid august. dominic was nice and really sweet... it didnt take long for me to fall for him. but i fall for everyone so thats not saying much.  on the 8th we were going out and we talked on the phone for 6 and a half hours! my all time record.. at least until november. :-D. and by the 13th we had our first date. we saw pirates of the carribean and yeah.. it was fun.. :-D! overall dominic's a great guy.. or at least he was at first. but then things started getting shitty and yeah. it ended. THAT COOLEST THING is that ym's horoscope guide said that i would fall for a pisces and it said the 8th and 13th were lucky days, but the 22nd was a bad one. and i broke up with him on the 22nd. freaky.  the week of my birthday was crazy. i went shopping a lot. jocelyn and i got kicked outta abercrombie for modelling and hara fell in love with cheyenne. kathleen and kalie and i had a lotta fun trying clothes on at anchor blue  OH! Kathleen! she's bundles of fun, and she was my best friend last year. for her b-day i got her 20o bucks worth of stuff including DVDs, CDs and 100 balloons!  ellen got me a shirt from American Eagle and i PROMISED to wear it the first day of school. but before that i wore it on my brithday when nathalie and I saw how to deal. that was such a good movie. outside the theater we saw this old guy selling brownies and we said there was prolly pot in them. lol.  july was an awesome month, and the perfect end to the perfect story was my brand new cell phone. woot woot.  yup yup ~Brandon

      I will remember you, Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. -Sarah McLachlan, "I Will Remember"   the rest of June went by pretty fast. my time was mostly devoted to making collages of pictures from the DC trip and watching seasons 1-4 of buffy. as time went on more and more people knew about my sexual orientation. oo i redecorated my room too. anyway, the day.. well more like night was June 20th. Nathalie and I went to Capitola Book Cafe and waited for the release of Harry Potter 5. it was a lotta fun, and the Shoreline band played for a little bit. there were nasty milk and cookies but it was a really fun night. nathalie and i talked and talked about buffy and jamie added some stuff in.  jamie was really cool.. she went to shoreline last year but now shes gone.. well thats another story that ill save for august.  kristen was there too.. she was a grade lower than us, just like jamie. kristen is short, but shes cool.. and her hair is REALLY fluffy.  anyway, nathalie and i bought our books and then i waited around with kalie and naomi until it was time to go.  kalie's my cousin and naomi is one of her best friends... no explanation needed there.  anyway, staying up 'til midnight was a whole lotta fun and i wouldn't have as much fun doing it until kassie's party in november.  the weeks of June lingered on. two days after i got my book we took a trip down south to LA/Oxnard. i met a really nice guy at the hotel we stayed at. his name was Ben. anyway, i spent most of the trip reading and i finished the twice in eight days.  after we got back, my mom and i talked about my birthday which was less than a month away! i wanted a cell phone and she agreed that i should have one.  the phone rang and i picked it up. Ili. she's pretty cool and i've known her for a really long time. her and bonnie were the first people i told about me being gay. anyway, she told me to come see the play bonnie was in cause there was a gay guy there named Dominic.  "Dominic..." the name rolled over my tounge. "Hot name.."  anyway, i declined her offer to go to the play, but she left me one good thing to think about..  "dominic..."  hehe.. ptfo! -Brandon

      It's something unpredictably,  But in the end, it's right.  I hope you had the time of your life." -Green Day, "Good Riddance"   there are some things you have to know about the DC trip.   40 eight graders take a trip to DC and NY at the price of $1600 and some other expenses for souvenoirs.    Day 1     at 4:15 i called janis and told her we were coming to pick her up. the car ride was icy cold. i could feel my stomach twist. my skin hummed with eagerness. we met at the airport around 5:30 at the United terminal, San Jose.   my stomach still feels knarly and i take some pepto bismol. anyway, we check in. my partner is teena davis. i�ve known her since like.. 1st grade..? prolly. she�s really cool and i couldn�t have asked for a better buddy. we check our bags and Mrs. Chavez gives us our boarding passes so we head to the gate. teena got stopped in security cause she had 40 hair pins in from grad. night. good times, good times.   we were all sitting around in the gate.  maya brodkey, ryan juntado, sarah rorvick, lisa vechionne, amanda yabarra, des cook, cerena barros, tessa libby, kate kahoano, kevin grassadonia, delia guerrero, nathalie servin, kevin deming, miguel dolores, teena davis, des cuneo, lizette lopez, jessica llanos, angelica solis, neil osterman, stephen mccon, elena rossman, miki burns, augustine perez, aaron melim, janis dinkins, lexi tenney, aly rumpanos, matt starkey, isais dolores, ashlee dominguez, kassie dogherra, ben fisher, jaime sanchez, ashley sanders, scott glass, dan.. um.. something, maddie flood, valerie getts, roxy rafi-tarie, elena jin and michele chelman.   anyway, we�re all sitting waiting for jocelyn zimniki to arrive at the airport.  now dont get me wrong, jocelyn�s one of the coolest people i noe, but at this point we are all a little angry at her.   she shows up and check�s in and before you noe it we�re on the plane, sweeping off the ground. daredevil played on screen and some of the kids (mikaela) watched it in espanol. ha ha. we ate fruit, took pics and when they turned the fasten seat belt sign off we got up and PARTIED! seriously, the walkways were crowded with kids.   it was crazy! we swapped CDs, played cards, read magazines, desiree cuneo (who i sat next to) even broke her chair.. you noe, the normal stuff. (i was also sitting next to teena.)   when the movie ended a blooper/comedy show came on and then NBC was up after that. lexi sat behind me and we were listening to the grease soundtrack, cause she played Cha-Cha in a play. �it�s raining on prom niight!� i brought that CD just for her.   uh oh! we hit turbulence half way into the flight. the second time we all were rushed to our seats. teena ended up with Maya and Matt behind me, and Maddie was next to me. Des still stayed by the window.   we still swapped CDs, and my graduation mix made elena and mikaela cry. aww. i was having tons of fun and we werent even in DC yet! des shuffled cards while maddie fiddled with the air vents.   the stewardess came around with soda. one ginger ale please. maddie and i took turns throwing pretzels at each other :-D.   the captian turned the sign off and we all moved around. Matt ended up sitting next to me. Des was figuring out her new digital camera, and matt played his gameboy.   we�ve landed at our gate, D16, in the Dulles airport. just imagine, 5 hours ago we left gate C2 at San Jose. I wonder if anyone got there bag sent to Cuba.. ha ha.matt and i had the same time on our watches.. and miki said something about making out with her cheek..? oo yeah, those blanket that had been touched by naked bodies!   we got our bags and yummy candy and then we stepped out into the humidity of the East Coast. it was a relief when our AC�d bus drove up.   We drove passed some famous sites, the Potomac, the Washington Monument, Smithsonian, White House, Federal Reserve and the Department of the Interior (don�t ask...)   There was a parade in front of the White House. lots of military vehicles and what not.  we passed more sites, a car being towed, a bus of old people, American History Musuem, the National Achives and the IRS!!   Starkey made a funny quote �Some people are smart, some people are not...�   our chaperones for the trip were Mrs. Chavez, her son and daughter: Mike and... um... the daughter. and also our librarian, Gayle Rorvick! She�s really cool.   we drove into Union Station and peered at the top of the building. Fire, Electricity, Freedom, Knowlegde, Agriculture and Mechcanics. all things that helped man evolve from the primitive beast he once was.   we j-walked to the train station, where we found a REALLY COOL food court. we bought pizza and talked about how Nathalie got hit on!! by an old guy!! that�s when i first met nathalie. well.. not first met, but first had a real conversation with.  Nathalie and and I got gelato ice cream. mm. and then i bought a pint of lemon ice cream for our room. Ahh! Mrs. Chavez said it would melt before we got back. we had to eat it super duper fast. I ate with Matt, Kassie, Nathalie, Janis, Teena and Aaron, but left to go shopping with Jessica and Amanda. I took the ice cream with me :-D.   We looked at books and finished the ice cream. we even saw a really cool train! we met up with Aaron, Matt, Kassie and Teena on the way out. Jessie said she�d she me on the bus and Matt was like �or in hell!� Then Kassie and I walked back to the bus taking pictures along the way.   on the bus we sang �Baby Got Back� and then our tour with Hopi got under way. We drove to the Jefferson Memorial and i got some cute pics of Miki, Elena, Elena and Lexi. there was a really big ledge too.. Jocelyn almost walked off it.   then we headed to the to the Roosevelt Memorial. Hopi (our tour guide) asked �do we need a bathroom break?�, Jaime yelled �NO! We got cups!� and then Miki was like �Not all of us are like Kevin..�   the FDR memorial was really cool. there were a bunch of waterfalls and we got a bunch of photos. it was really hot tho.. if i stayed outside any longer i would�ve friend like bacon. Matt said the Washington Monument looked possesed.. and then he said sweat was good hair gel. lol.   i�ve known matt since preschool.. more or less. he was friends with my cousin Kalie. his mom knew her grandma or something... yeah.. anyway, he was prolly my first best friend.   anyway, there was a bunch of rain and lightning. rorvick and i were gettin� pretty freaked out.. Matt said a bunch of things �Guys take showers so they don�t smell worse,� and �Maybe we could hit the guy who didnt make a california avenue.�   we went to a supermarket to buy stuff for our room. in line, Matt, Aaron and I stood behind a drunk guy in a dress! he was buyin� Burban! lol. then we got back on the bus and it started to pour like never before.   when we got to the hotel, Karen checked us in and we went to our lucky room. 509!! Mike came by and gave matt his medicine, and then we got ice to chill our drinks.   Kassie and Teena and Ashlee came up to see us when this creepy old man came over and said �I will not tolerate loudness, I have two 8 year olds in a bed and I will not have you waking them out. One loud noise and *snap* I�ll call the front desk and you�re outta here.�   we spent the rest of the night talking to everyone on the phone.   some hot gossip?   Tessa, Kate and Cerena got a security gaurd assigned right outside their door.  Des Cuneo, Nathalie and their room buddie have a fridge! They said we could store stuff in it...  Kassie, Teena and Ashlee got their phones disconnected!   kassie came up to get ice and i saw tape on our door and thought mike had sealed it, but he didnt and anyway, teena sealed it and we got ready for bed. Mike came to tuck us in and that�s when we found out he hadn�t put the tape on! he talked to us about tomorrow and about our �traumatizing� run-in with the old red neck.   everyone went to bed and i stayed up, in the bathtub, writing in my journal.    Day 2    we ended up talking until 2 the night before. the red neck was banging against our wall, but we weren�t being loud.. lol.. in the morning we woke up, showered, and went down to breakfast. I had eggs and cereal.   then we walked to the lobby and found a handicapped bathroom! it was so cool! it opened by itself!! and then we rode the escalators. then on bus, we heard about how elena rossman ran into her closet mirror because she thought it was open.   elena is awesome! i�ve known her since 5th grade... maybe longer.. yeah , i think longer. but anyway, shes really nice and fun and friendly. one time i threw a phone book at her and it hit hurt in the head. i bought her candy though! lol..   we headed to the Veitnam Memorial and we all got carnations to put out for soilders. our first stop was the Korean War memorial. 19 soilders lined up on the tundra. next we visted the Veitname Memorial, with 58,226 names cast in stone, the place felt lonely. empty. names. all names.   i left a carnation under Micheal A. Walter�s grave thinking he might be related to Cooper... that kid is so perverted.   anyway, we walked to the Einstein statue and took pictures. there was a rumor that if you touch his nose, you will get smarter. i touced it... twice... just in case. we got back on the bus. woo, that AC relieved me. oh yeah.. miki is goldylocks.. and janis is a hyena? i dunno, those two are crazy. Hopi had a bunch of sweat stains on her butt... lol..   George Pataki and Chris Cox. New York Senator and California Representative. I met them both! We got out of the bus and headed to the front of the Supreme Court building. thats the judical branch. these hairy guys came up to us.. i think they were making fun of people who wore fur cause they were dressed like cave men.   anyway, we took pictures and i told tessa that her family had come to resuce her from civilization. �Smile and say FAMILY REUNION!� yeah.. you had to be there...   then we went to the Library of Congress. there was a naked statue of Neptune in the front. with a 9 incher! Inside the library we saw a bunch of books and there was a really cool zodiac floor! Nathalie and I love it! There was even the first book ever printed!   we walked to the capitol building and I met Chris Cox from New Port Beach! He shook my hand! It made my day. we went in the building and we saw TONS of priceless artwork. it was amazing. De Soto, Columbus, The Pilgrims, Pocahontas, The Declaration, Saratoga and Yorktown were some of the paintings.   we also saw a bunch of statues and learned a lot about the capitol. then we met george pataki. on the capitol building lawn, there was a protest. �Circumcision is wrong! The foreskin is not a birth defect!� boy, that prolly made the jewish boys behind us very happy. oo! alec is jewish!   yeah, back to story. oh we went to McDonalds next and we have to eat EVERYTHING we bought. I ended up eating everything everyone else didnt want too.. Fries, Milkshakes, McNuggest (Nathalie calls them �Muggets�) and more fries. i left them a souvenior the janitor will never forget. Kassie said �we should take a picture of the fries!� and kate was like �just look in the toilet tomorrow!�   Next we stopped at the White House visitor center. I picked p some stuff for Mr. Sullivan AND! i got a coloring book! yay! we walked back to the bus and stopped at the White House. I got a stick from the lawn! it was really cool. and i saw the West Wing! That is a really good show...! there were a lot of squrriels too.. we walked past Alexander Hamilton and the Treasury Building and we even saw a monument to General Sherman! it reminded me of Gone with the Wind.   we then went to the Holocaust Museum and watched a story about a boy named Daniel. it was really sad. there was even a little walk through thing and Lisa V. was my partner. Lisa is really cool.. and really nice too.   then we went to the old post office and went up a glass elavator. it was ok, the veiw was kinda weird, but hey, i had Kevin grassadonia�s booty scrunched close to me for most of it, so it was great. coming down the elevator, teena scared me to death. we left the old post office and headed to..   THE INTERNATIONAL SPY MUSEUM! way lamer than it sounds... i got a cool shirt tho. and i beat kevin g. a lot though at this weird game. ha ha i won. we got to climb through an air duct too! it got really boring.. but then there was this thing where you could see ur house on a satelitte! it was awesome! i bought a sweet t-shirt that says �Deny Everything� yay!   it started to rain and we got back on the bus. soon we stopped at a pizza place. matt got cheese poured in his hair and i made kassie laugh by saying �Cheese Me� when the waiter came around. Well we headed to the Lincoln memorial after that. we took a bunch of pictures and learned a lot about old Abe. He was really tall...   we went shopping at this little place with a bunch of street vendors and the rain began to pour. we got back on the bus and headed to the Kennedy Center for Fine Arts. there were flags from every nation except Lybia, Iran, Iraq, Cuba and North Korea. we also got to see into an opera and we saw a hall of states. then we went up a balcony and took pic.   Next, we drove to the Iwo Jima memorial, where Janis and I were the tour guides. fun stuff. we took a bunch of pictures of the six soilders raising the flag and then we just wanted to go home and sleep.   when we got to the hotel, Janis and I used the phones to try and call Ellen. it as busy, but we met these 2 girls and janis gave them her room number. When i got to my room, the door was open and Aaron and Matt were gone, probably getting ice. Lexi and Elena called and told us to go downstairs to a party.   we brought candy and soda and MM they had cheez-its. we also got to raid Mrs. Chavez�s room and get free food. then we went back to our rooms and tried to get to sleep. but instead we ended up talking until three. we were really tired in the morning.    Day 3    FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH!!   today was the trip to Arlington national cemetery. after a quick breakfast we were taken into a world of sad sculptures and gravestones. we visited the eternal flame and the tomb of the unknown solider. the hike was a long one, but the changing of the guards was.. for the most part... worth it. it was kinda dramatic.. but it�s to honor the dead so i guess its ok. i liked it.   all in all arlington was good. after the cemetary, we headed for the washington monument. we rode the elevator to the top. well, the 100 floor. the look down was 500 feet! it was really cool, we got to see so much! after the monument we walked to the Smithsonian where we said �Aloha� to our tour guide.   we got to travel around the �Mall� which is the term used for the block on which the Smithsonian museums sit. We breaked and picked buddies. Ashlee and I headed for the Natural history museum and headed all the way down to the food court. we got soo much food!   i�ve known ashlee since kindergarten..? yeah, she�s really cool and funny. and she likes to read a lot, so if i ever read a book then her and i can have discussions about it.. its funner than you think :-D   anyway, after we looked at a bunch of gems and the Hope Diamond. 52.27 karat from India. there were a lot of crystals and stuff and i got a sweatshirt from the american history museum. we went across the street and walked down to the art museum. we bought a few bottles of soda. we took pictures in front of a fountain and then went into the air and space museum. thats where we met up with Janis, Nat, Valerie, Ashley and Lisa.  Nathalie and I ditched Janis and Ashlee and hid behind a fence thing that we thought was tinted (we can see out but they cant see in) Janis and Ashlee were walking aroundon the floor below. suddenly they look up at us and wave. Nathalie screams �I THOUGHT THEY COULDN�T SEE IN!�   we continued walking and we got in a WW2 plane! how fuun!! we checked out some rooms with planets in them and we looked at some space shuttles too.   at five we met matt, ben, aaron, janis, ashlee and everyone else in front of the museum. it was scorching hot but the bus came soon and we drove to the Department of Printing and Engraving. we saw moola being made and we checked out the gift shop.  on the ceiling there were motion censors, and my head almost set them off.   after the money place we drove outta DC. we drove to virgina and stopped at the pentagon mall where we went shopping! ee! ashley sarah and I went to abercrombie and then viki�s. it was so much fun! they had really cute undies in fcuk. then we went back to the bus, running through the rain to get to it.   back at the hotel, we all got dressed in our bathing suits and went down to the pool. i sat outside and wrote in my notebook since the rain had died down. i walked with elena back to the lobby but i realized i had forgotten my key. we went to the front desk to ask for another one, but they wouldnt make one for me.   teena walked me back to the pool and we got aarons key. i went into the elevator and teena said �be right back.� so i held the elevator and this guy came in and was like �going up?� and i was all �yep..� and then a while later he got out and teena came back and got in and he was like �going up?� and she was like �sorry.� by the time i got back to the 4th floor, elena was done showering and we all hung out. it was another hall party! i went in kevin�s room and we talked and yeah, it was fun.   i ran back up to my room and slipped a note under the door for aaron and matt. i also brought candy downstairs. the hall party was gettin� hot and i ran back to my room to get soda right when matt and aaron got back. matt and aaron went down to the party but at 10 we had to get back to our rooms and tuck in.    Day 4    that night we packed and packed and after we had cleaned our rooms we watched drew carey. i fell asleep tho and i slept like a log... or maybe a rock... i would say a baby but i guess babies dont sleep super well. oh yeah! that night i got a call from my mom and thats when i found out she was PREGNANT! the baby�s due February 16th! see ya all at the baby shower :-D!   anyway, the next day we woke up late and i brought a soda down for breakfast. when we were in the lounge i opened the soda and it SPRAYED all over me. i went up to my rooom and changed, and headed back to breakfast, but then kassie ran into me with a plate of eggs.. so i showered and changed again.   then matt came up to the room and we all brought our luggage down to the bus. wihtin a few hours the bus was moving and we had left virgina for good. we watched night at the roxburry and nathalie, matt and i laughed SO HARD! kassie slept in the hallway. crazy. but anyway, i fell asleep during the movie, but nathalie and matt�s talking woke me up.   after the movie we made a pit stop in Delaware. i missed Maryland! we took a bunch of pictures in front of the �Big Guy Restraunt� statue. when we got back on the bus we drove to New Jersey while watching Orange County. I love that movie! We laughed so hard. after the movie we were on the border of New Jersey and after we went through a tunnel we ended up in Manhattan, New York!!   we finally made it! we stopped at our hotel and dropped off our bags. our tour guide arrived at the new york part of the tour started. first stop: Texas and Texas for lunch! after that we bought some stuff from the local street vendors and we spent most of our time walking around and looking at the sights.   we bought some shirts and then we walked to radio city music hall and then to the donald trumpt building. thats when we went in to take a tour of NBC studios. it was a lot of fun and we saw the SNL set and even some previews for Will and Grace! i bought a will and grace shirt from the gift shop.   we headed back to the hotel and the rain started to pour. my bag started to rip and right when we got in the door it fell apart. woot woot. we went upstairs and all got fabbed up. we looked so perfect and we walked to Chili�s in our formal wear. i had this cute brown american eagle umbrella!   anyway, at chili�s we all sat around and talked. ashley sanders and i danced to genie in a bottle, the spanish version. then we walked to the New Amsterdam theater. we got into the Lion King and everything was goregous. the play was beautiful and at the end i cried. it was amazing.   we walkd to times square after the play. i made some jokes about the hookers and then we all got together and took a picture. on the way we saw lisa leslie from the sparks, and before the picture we saw chopper!! he was really cute, and nathalie got a hug! there were a bunch of pigeons.. ee.. i hate birds.. anyway, the picture was good but i look shitty so, no, im not showing you.   we walked back and saw billy joel!! �we didnt start the fire!� that�s like mr. sullivan�s favorite song. anyway, we got back to the hotel and we watch SNL before going to sleep.    Day 5    we went across the street to this greek diner where i got pancakes. yummy. then we walked to the subway! it was so cool! it was all dirty and stuff and we were going really really fast and then it stopped and i fell over.   we got a few feet away from battery park. we saw the globe that was in front of the WTC and it was really emotional. we went and waited in castle clinton for a ferry to the islands. we met a strange but funny guy and played the limbo with him.   then we went to the island ferry and took a ride to Liberty Island. on the way we met a bug named billy and ashlee got kinda pissed off. then at ellis island, i was talking about how chiuahuas were gonna attack miki and i was like �yo quiero taco mikaela.�   miki is awesome! i�ve known her since 3rd grade. we both had calero but switched out to sherwood! tons of fun! shes really cool.. and tottally blonde :-D   anyway, when we got into ellis island i looked for some immigrants from my family. then ashlee and nathalie got me and we went outside and had a picnic. kassie climbed a wall and the security guard told her to climb to the top. she was gonna do it but he said he was kidding so oh well to that.   we got back on the ferry and got back in battery park. we walked down wall street and i got a picture of me on a bull :-D !!! then we walked to this deli and ate. after we went to ground zero. it was a reflective moment and it was an emotional experience.   after that we took a subway ride to centeral park. there were a lot cool plants and picture to be taken. i even say a statue of balto. oh and teena started to get dehydrated..   we went to virgin records and bought CDs and posters and we were gonna go to MTV studies, but we went back to the hotel and got dressed up for our trip to the empire state building.   we took a trip to chinatown and little italy. the restaurant was REALLY fancy and i could barely eat anything it was so fancy. all i ate was the cheese. yummy. i ate nathalie�s cheese too. then we went bargaining in chinatown. i got kassie and teena bags which were originally $30 each down to $28 for both. ashlee also got a cute necklace.   it was really cold out, and the over look from the top of the Empire state building was really pretty. the sunset was so nice. the line town was REALLY long, but kate and i cut and then in the elevator we sang songs, like that one that never ends :-D then i was almost hit by a car.. and the sign said �walk� !   we went back to the hotel and it took a while to fall asleep. it was our last night of the trip and i was kinda sad to be leaving.

      As we go on, we remember  All the times we had together  And as our lives change, from whatever  We will still be friends forever. -Vitamin C, "Graduation"   &nbsp;  the summer was a new beginning. no, no, june was a new beginning. the days leading up to the last day were crazy. we had to get all our work back, and I even got a letter from 5th grade.   it started with bonnie and ili. they were the first people I told. that I liked guys. It was scary at first, but after it felt really good. like masterbating for the first time. ok� that was a little too much. :-) so what started as small got bigger and bigger. graduation practices and.. lol.. joel marshall.. filled my thoughts for the last days. suddenly it was grad. night. everything seemed so perfect� except Mrs. Zahrobsky�s fucked up balloon arch. well yeah it was beautiful.   and the dance was way awesome. the theme was Hollywood, and boy was it a night with the stars. I told a bunch of people that I was.. well� you noe the word. The night was ending.. tears were falling.. and dances were being danced. Shout outs to des cuneo, lexi!, mikki, maddie, amanda and naomi for havin� fun with me on the dance floor.   the night ended, and janis and I ran around givin� everyone hugs and saying our last goodbyes. I still remember elena rossman asking me for a hug even though she knew we would see each other the next day. You noe I never really realized how much I was gonna miss these people until after they were out of my life. But you cant live in the past forever.   I dropped Janis at home, promising to call her before I picked her up the next day. And then I went home and passed out on my bed. it was over. middle school was over. it was finally over.

      This love has taken its toll on me, She said 'Goodbye' too many times before. And my heart is breaking in front of me, But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say 'Goodbye' anymore. -Maroon 5, "This Love"   The first was SO FUN! god, i noe april's fools is like a kiddie holiday, but i love it fo sho. i gave my grandma a heart attack by putting red food dye on my hand and getting a knife, saying i cut myself. ha ha ha. uhh shonick's class was really fun. it was good turning in my ABORTION REPORT! what what. english was kinda boring though...  friday was really fun. at the end of the mile my speed really kicks in. mrs. locke says this is because adrenaline surges out of your brains and makes you work harder. this explains why everyone was in such a good mood the last day before spring break. i spent my open planning my whole spring break, and in pe i worked my ass of during our "track" lesson. french was the funnest. i taped a picture of a fish on mrs keplingers back because she said that april fools day was like a fish holiday or something. dont ask. it was great though. then nathalie and i drew a picture on the board that said "Happy Spring Break!" it was tres cute.  SCHOOL'S OUT~!!  i spent the rest of the night watching movies and staying up late on the phone with tina and nat. just like things were supposed to be.  saturday- i slept. seriously. it felt orgasmic.  sunday- i totally did all my homework and caught up on all the hot gossip. my mom took me shopping and i bought gossip girls and new socks and wife beaters.. who came up with that name? i think it was stephanie hammond.. or jude law.  monday- after hanging out with nora i went to see eternal sunshine with jaye at the movies. it was HOT! and jaye looked hella cute in his abercrombie vintage t. after the movies we were gonna get jamba juice but i felt all hot and sticky from sitting for 2 and something hours. so i went home and tanned.  wednesday - nathalie and i totally busted out at the mall. we had tons of fun and lots of laughs. AND WE BOUGHT THE FISH!! and burger king! and we saw damon and he was retarded. but what's new? oh yeah, chris cancelled on me to see dawn of the dead that day. or did i cancel on him? so not hot for that boy anymore.  thursday - i went to the movies with dominic. he wore a PINK shirt. still, i give him props for looking so cute in it. haha.. we had tons of fun watchin lady killers. except the title is freaky and everyone died. then i went home and changed.. and i went to see hiltago with jack. but we skipped the movies and i ended up giving him a tour of soquel. RC's REAL NAME IS RAUL!! WOAH!! thats crazy. we did alotta craz shit that'll probably give me a boner radomly during class. then a security gaurd came. now i noe what anna felt like in the A list. mm mm mm  friday - i read all the gossip girls! so good! omg i am so in love with chuck! and blair is the coolest chica since annie ross! has anyone heard from gardenia?  saturday - it was a totally 80's day! nathalie, crystal and i went to the mall! it was awesome until crystal had to leave.. we got jamba juice and we chilled on her iPod! there was a HUGE cutie on a bike too.. woaH! anyone, we walked home in the cold and yeah.. i took a nice shower. flip flops on cold days = no. gossip girl spotted me and put me on her site! i also saw tina and sarah in the mall. it was cool! and sarah looks really good. tina.. well she looks the same..  sunday = easter. i slept a lot and my parents went over to my aunts and uncles. i didnt pracicularly want to go, so i slept in and they had fun and nathalie called.. i dont like eater egg hunts.. but nathalie had funw ith hers! i slept a lot and got ready for school.  monday back was great. i swapped stories with everyone and handed out hugs like it was graduation night. i dont remember much from the day except giving amber a HUGE hug.. and that's about it..  tuesday - counselors came in to talk to us during english. again, it motivated me. i found myself signing up for the same classes, minus piano and pe. i also added leadership. it felt good. shonick's class.. uhh.. i dont remember. OH I WAS STOKED FOR HEALTH.  wednesday- christina's cousin came and her and i hung out in 2nd quad reading today.. after pe i ran to the locker to get jack's card. it was his big big BIRTHDAY! woo! i kissed mesha on accident because i was so excited. it was chill though. uhh we got to harbor and nathalie and i jumped out of the car. we walked down the hill while everyone called our names. when we reached jaye we handed him the rose and card. he didnt want to take it cause he was embarassed so i shoved it in his back pack and nathalie and i hurried up the hill. two girls chased us, d'auria and stacie and nathalie and i jumped in le voiture (thats car in french), but not before chatting with elena rossman.  my mom drove us to jamba juice and nathalie got a yummy carribean passion and i god a razz razz razzmatazz. yum. jack called to say he loved his gift, but then again, how could he not :-P? we got back to school waaay after the bell rang. we walked from the circle parking lot around the side of the 1st building and up the trail witht he two trees that leaned agaisnt each other. then jenica called us from the girl's locker room. she came out and we walked to french together. we had a psycho sub and some chick who knew NOTHING about european history (JOAN OF ARC WASN'T HUNG JUST BECAUSE SHE WORE MEN'S CLOTHING.

      No, I don't want no scrub. A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me. Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride, Trying to holla at me. -TLC, "No Scrubs"   god ryan. you've turned me into a total brainy bitch. i love ya.  so if you've been drinking a lot of liquid, or if you're pregnant.. or have a small bladder.. you might not want to read this until after you've pee'd. cause when you start to read it.. you won't be able to stop laughing.   just so you know, i everytime i sent an IM to ronnie it said: Auto response from chillin552: Your IM has been sent to my mobile device. When I receive it, I will be able to reply. Thanks for your IM! Want your IMs forwarded to your phone? Click here  but i deleted all those from the conversation because if you had to read through a hundred of those you would kill yourself. i know i almost did.  so today i went over to tina's with nathalie.. you can read more about it in my june update later this month. anyway, i saw ronnie's HIDEOUS pictures. so then i went home and i was talkin to that freak.    jackorcan: i saw your PICTURES in tina's yearbook. jackorcan: you never told me you were a fat midget. chillin552: Bitch! chillin552: Ewww! All ugly pictures! That was when i was straight lol    Auto response from jackorcan:  can't talk, won't talk. to all you people  chillin552: Guess what? jackorcan: what chillin552: Last nite i got fucked!!! jackorcan: up the ass?   *okay, so here i would like to say that.. ronnie is really ugly. so imagining him getting fucked up the ass is PRETTY hard. but we will continue. oh.. well he did get it with jaye. HAHAHA.*   chillin552: Yeah jackorcan: by who? chillin552: My friend nate. He lives in watsonville and were going out again 2 nite jackorcan: nate ______ jackorcan: i need a last name chillin552: Haha i dont no it.

I was willing. But it was fun i guess jackorcan: oh jackorcan: number one, we call it butt raping even if it was wanted. number two, it is rape cause hes 19 and you're not.   *notice that he is retard enough to not know the law of statutory rape. weird, considering every sexually active person knows that rule. i bet nate knew it. except not. cause he doesnt exist.*   jackorcan: so what was it like? chillin552: Were going 2 the drive in 2nite. chillin552: True jackorcan: what was it like? chillin552: It was different, but it felt kinda nice chillin552: It was different, but it felt kinda nice   *he said it TWICE? what a skitzo. and he said it just felt "nice"? what about PAINFUL? it was a FUCKING ten inch PENIS in his ASS. maybe he has a loose ass. from getting jaye's tongue up it 24/7. yuck.  SO ANYWAY, JUST TO PROVE I WAS RIGHT I ASKED A FRIEND (WHO HAS DONE IT) ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT:  jackorcan: what does it feel like to get it up the butt? HAPPYGL7: It doesnt feel good jackorcan: i know this is personal but i need to know HAPPYGL7: it's quite painful actually  jackorcan: would you describe it as "different, but [it feels] kinda nice?" HAPPYGL7: no  HAPPYGL7: I would describe it as uncomfortable  jackorcan: would you say it is weird at first but then its nice HAPPYGL7: But If I really loved the person I wouldnt really mind it I guess HAPPYGL7: It doesnt really get nice . . . but you can stand it later on I guess  jackorcan: would you say it causes "tingleness in the stomach" ? HAPPYGL7: It's really dangerous too  jackorcan: what if it is your first time though? HAPPYGL7: you have to be REALLY careful  HAPPYGL7: Nope I woulnt say tingles jackorcan: can i quote you on it? HAPPYGL7: If it's you're first time it's gona be strange HAPPYGL7: why would you quote me ? HAPPYGL7: and to whom ? jackorcan: uhh ronnie thinks it feels "nice" HAPPYGL7: okay you can quote me to Ronnie I guess HAPPYGL7: but deffenetly don't try it till you feel ready  jackorcan: oh i wont jackorcan: lol, im saving myself HAPPYGL7: eeeh I'm just saying in GENERAL  jackorcan: thank you adrian, your wisdom and experience is just what i needed to prove that ronnie is a fat little lying midget with GROSS STOCKY LEGS AND BAD HAIR jackorcan: *muah!* HAPPYGL7: rawr. *   chillin552: And plus, then i guess jaye raped me, and evry1 he did stuff with jackorcan: yeah jackorcan: he did jackorcan: what a rapist   *HI JAYE!*   jackorcan: what did it feel like though, more specific? chillin552: It felt weird the first time going in but... jackorcan: be more specific? chillin552: Well like what specific? jackorcan: MORE DETAIL jackorcan: what was it LIKE chillin552: It was like being fucked, theres really nothing i can say it was like. It seemed like he went slow though jackorcan: what is being fucked like? chillin552: It felt weird at first in the stomach, kinda tingled but felt really good jackorcan: tingled? chillin552: Haha wrong word of choice chillin552: *tingeled jackorcan: tinge led? jackorcan: is that even a fucking word?   *tingled? who says it TINGLES? it BURNS. not that i would know though.. but i've talked to chris. and dominic. haha dominic haha. and of course he went slow.. thats how you do it. unless you want him to rip your ass apart. bimbo.*   chillin552: Bad word of description. Ummm... chillin552: I think were gonna fool around again 2 nite and if it happens again then ill tell u more details so i can be more specific chillin552: Haha, i dont think so jackorcan: what kind of condom did you use? chillin552: Not sure, it was at nite   *so? couldn't you see the condom wrapper? or are you BLIND.*   jackorcan: where? chillin552: Delaveaga golf course. Lol. It was at the parking lot at night jackorcan: what kind of car? chillin552: Pt crusier jackorcan: model? chillin552: It was his moms lol jackorcan: what MODEL chillin552: I dunno all i no was it is a pt cursier red in color and tinted windows   *no one fucks in the back of a car. its fucking impossible. trust me, in a porno search on limewire "sex in the backseat" has no results in which the people actually fucked with the doors and windows closed. which is what i think ronnie and nate would have done. haha unless one of them hung their legs out the window.*   jackorcan: lol tinted windows jackorcan: did you just do it in the back seat? chillin552: No it started out exactly how jaye and i did things   *HAHAHAHAHA HIM AND JAYE!! HAHAHAHAHA*   jackorcan: making out and then you lied down on the backseat and he fucked you? chillin552: No, made out, i took off his clothes he took of mine i sucked him he fucked me. Yea in the backseat   *not to sound like a geek, or someone who assumes things.. but i did an online search of pt cruisers and then have an average backseat room of like 10-14 cubic feet. if it was ronnie and a midget it would probably be possible for them to fuck. but not a guy with an eight inch penis. that's like chris albrecht and ronnie fucking in 10-14 cubic feet. weird. also, no one takes off all their clothes when they have sex. or even head. you just unzip your pants. duh. and what was this "nate" thinking? who would want to see IT(ronnie) naked? oh well, nate was probably blind from looking at his face. and WHO FUCKS IN A PT CRUISER!? losers.*   jackorcan: oh his pt cruiser? and where did you put the clothes? chillin552: Thn front jackorcan: you put the clothes in the front? chillin552: The front seat jackorcan: in his pt cruiser? Chillin552: his moms Chillin552 is away at 3:56:16 PM.  jackorcan: in his mom's pt cruiser? Chillin552 returned at 3:58:45 PM.  jackorcan: you had sex in the back seat of his mom's pt cruiser?   *gross. 16,000 dollars wasted on a car you're son violated. with a chode.*   Chillin552: your being stupid Chillin552: bye Chillin552 signed off at 4:03:01 PM.    *weird. i was being stupid? well at least i make up better lies! bitch.*  oh i can stop with those little star things.  YEAh. well i think its funny that ronnie makes up lies like that. maybe he didnt even do it with jaye? nah i doubt that. he probably thinks that since we know about him and jaye we'll believe about him and some freak with an eight in penis. the only reason jaye did you, ronnie, was because he is a pathetic desperate little boy. who is in love with jack. what a perfect couple.  well chris is gone.. so im the BGG in this fuckin town.  sc faggots are so not worth it.  except jack :P  WISH ME LUCK ON THIS FUCKIN' BIO TEST! brandon

TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD! its really really good. blake kinda spoiled the ending for alec and i. and alec was like "damn blake, can't you see brandon was trying to be surprised!" aww he's trying to protect me. speaking of alec being gay, why is patrick all angry all of a sudden? huh? i blame hormones. or jack. i blame alaways blame everything on him.  um so tuesday was just as good as monday. im gonna play habanera for my final song in piano. because it was in the aristocats, and dutchess would so be my mom. if she was human. and not french. cassondra and i gossiped about the weekend. always fun. and ellen had a weird encounter with cody young. just say no ellen, you are so better than that.  in english we had this tkam quiz and alec didnt put his name on his. so he was trying to get carson to do it, but carson wouldn't. so i took alec's quiz and wrote his name on it myself. when i walked back to my seat alec smiled and looked down shyly and said "thanks" and blushed. so cute. and then after class he said he wasnt gonan be there on thursday to mrs miranda and when i asked why he said he was going the international games thing. and i was like "isnt that for 5Th and 6th graders?" and he was all "im not participating in it *shy blush*" wow. participating. thats like 5 syllables. brains and beauty.  in history (after lunch WHICH WAS GREAT!) he kept laughing and smiling at me when anyone made jokes. uhh but anyway it was fun.. i really really am interested in ww1. its really cool.. but sad.. trench warfare and all. AFTERSCHOOL I TANNED! WOOOOO!!  then i slept. uhh on monday in geo he said we didint have to come on thursday becase of the int. games. so stoked. after tiana and kate visited me in my open period (WHICH WAS A BLAST! we talked about spring break and had a bunch of fun. it was hilarious and we read an STD pamphlet.. just for fun haha.. it was great. they should come in there more often. we laughed and laughed and talked about.. things.) well after that.. we had brunch and i ate an apple. yummy. and then we did funky crunches in pe.. it felt good.

OH AND THEN THE TRUCKS CAME! THERE WERE LIKE 4!! HOLY SHIT! nathalie and i called our madres and complained about the fire. there was a lot of smoke. and it didnt smell like smores. we played duck duck france. boring. i wandered off and talked to random people.. that was fun until it was over and we all went in.. there were soo many firetries and the fire was kinda big.. they were sprying water everywhere. theres gotta be a metaphor in there somewhere. back in french nathalie and i studied for a test. aracelli was like "maestra, if the trial is still blocked how are we gonna get down?" mrs keplinger made a motion that meant they would have to go around through the main parking lot. aracelli was like "OH HELL NO!" funny fun. dane acutally is looking darker. if that is possible. ouch that was kinda mean. oh well.  after school i took a nap. it FELT GREAT!! then i woke up and drank water. i like water. anyway, i wore a cucumber mask it ripped off a chunk of my eyebrow. or something. nathalie and i registered for our summer classes! and i got in to all of them! woo hoo! i like it like that. then i took a shower and nathalie and i called this kid named jair. yeah, hes pretty cool and funny.   well i went to bed after talking to nat and tin on the phone. we MIGHT go to the musical.. but i dunno. i slept in and then my dad took me to nathalies grandma's in the morning. and her mom drove us to the trial. and we walked.. IT LOOKED LIKE A CRSIPY SMORE! yum.. thank good no one was killed or anything. not that im religous. so anyway, after that we got ready for school. while walking to enzwiler's class we saw gabia nd she came to talk to us! she's sooo funny! and really pretty. im voting for her for homecoming queen next year! so then after spending the period talking about the fire it was break and we wandered arond. christina's new name is CRAYON HEAD~!! WOOO! cause of her hair. so funny. bump your rump now. english was just disscussion-ie... we talked about stuff and yeah.. it was kinda fun.. to kill a mockingbird its an amazingly good book. its own worthy.. just like alec is mosesworthy. where was he today? oh yeah, the games... :-(  so at lunch we ate at the deli and some old guy came in wearing the P MILLER clothes!! SO WEIRD! then we walked up and i pee'd and it was class time. i liked history today.. i learned a lot and i only left to go to the bathroom once. and jaye called. boring. uhh afterschool crystal and i walekd around and then i left and went home and watched buffy buffy buffy and then nathalie called and we studied for the french test! it was fun.  i went to bed early and when i woke up i SO did not want to get out of bed. j'aime dormir. it took me about 30 minutes to get ready. my hair was not as soft and wirey as usual so it was harder to comb. and my face looked like SHIOT!   sooooo on the way to school i was thinking about the games we play in pe. they are always soooo boring. god. usher or luda? john john or jeff? SO not. so i was thinking we could make a game like the hot or not game.. like.. paul bridges? NOT! shay baldwin? HOT! but it had to be something funnier that people found.. intriguing.. SEX! so i offically made up sex or rape.. by senior year everyone will be playing it! heres how you play, its easy, if you like someone enough to have sex with them you say "sex" and if they are on you're "FAT, UGLY, STUPID, or ALL AROUND NASTY" list, you say "rape!" totally awesome.  geometry was fun.. crystal and i studied for the french test. i changed my french book cover, it's a&f now! hell ya! abercrombie Vintage :-* nathalie met us dans la hallway and we walked around and then i eventually went to the library.. NATHALIE LET ME USE HER iPOD! soooooo fetch. i listened to music and did homework and then nathalie came in and we went to buy food and then i went to pe. PE WAS CRAZY! we did this HUGE long run, through the park.. its a really nice park, down the creek (which smells like dominic's butt) and around the soccer feild. aww so many memories of the fire day.. i love the soccer feild. OH YEAH! we were locked out of the gym at the start of the period so ivy, krista, elizaveth and me played sex or rape. so great. stephaine hammond? RAPE!! hahahaha that game is the new "it" i love the new crunches too.... mmm..  so anyway, we played over the line and ryan austin's eyes met mine and.. YEAH! he is so my white chocolate. ooh, lizette, gardenia and i came up with a new thingy..  okay>>>> which do you like best (IN ORDER!) white chocolate milk chocolate dark chocolate.  okay so white = white, milk = hispanic and dark = black. AND THOSE ARE WHAT KIND OF GUYS YOU LIKE! they should make oriental chocolate.. otherwise it isnt very fair.. but yeah.. it KINDA works.. unless you're allergic to chocolate.  uhh at the end of pe christine and i had a heart felt convo about homophobia. it was really funny. and she ended with an "i love ya brandon!" who doesnt? ryan austin back up into my groin in the locker room. weird? very.  lunch was devoted to french-ness and watching blake eat his sandwhich. and then nathalie and i walked up with carolyn and played the COOLEST GAME- sex or rape. WHOEVER INVENTED THAT GAME (me) IS A GENIUS!!  french was tres fun. we studied for the test and i thought about.. uhh... the test was easy, at least i thought it was. and the speaking/extra cred. was lots of fun. jenica or zenikwah as em calls her, looked really cute in her new skirt. MMM!! j'adore candy et smores. yummy.  afterschool i walked told nathalie to call me.. and then we saw a man with a truck full of chairs.. and i was out. uhh i didnt have to take ellen home which was kind of a relief. my mom took me to hollywood - SCARY MOVIE 3!! i got the last copy. hell ya. then we check out and blah blah. a bag of swedish trouts and 30 minutes later i was online talking to rc. he really isnt that bad.. he's kinda..

I LOVED THAT MUSICAL! im buying the DVD and then im moving to anatevka!  -------------TRADITION--------------  saturday i woke up pretty early for me. usually i dont wake up until after two, but i woke up around one-ish. i spent the day getting ready for a wedding that night. yeah, it was fun.  it turns out that jack didnt come to the musical cause he was too busy giving and recieving head from jaye in the back of a car being driven by lesbians. how cute :D. see, that's what real love is. uhh i was pissed at both of them.. and i told jack how i cheated with him.. a lot.. over the course of our relationship. but then again, it wasn't a real relationship! cause that's what he told everyone. i'm glad we worked through that drama.  i was kinda depressed, although i'd never admit to it, when i went to the wedding. it was fun. they always make me tearing and sleepy. my mom's friend carol married some peirce brosman look alike named Jim or Tim or Tom or something.. yeah.. the reception was fun and i had.. wine.. and stuff.. it was okay.  when i got home.. or when "we" got home, my dad passed out.. hahaha. i chugged a 2 liter of coke and then nathalie and tin tin called and we talked. i dont remember much of it. i made up a song though.  then around 12 amber came online and we talked for *hours*. it was so much fun.. we sent pics and gossiped and played sex or rape.. didnt we? oh well, i got a cute pic of shay hehe. and she got some EMBARASSING ones of christine and naomi =-o ronnie called (what else is new) and he was pretty boring. i think i fell asleep. my dad woke me up at like 5 ish and told me to go to bed. so i did.  in the morning/afternoon, i worked on my homework and then i thought i would go to the mall with jack. we had decided to stay friends, hes too much of a great guy to let go :-) even if he is just going to play me. at least ill always have the memories :-?  uhh he couldnt go because he had "work" to do. yeah, work do do with jaye. blah. i went to longs first and saw jaye.. it hurt to think that jack would do something like that to jaye.. i mean.. he never really showed much intrest in jaye. but then again jaye wanted jack a lot. i mean a lot a lot. like how when you're young you really wanna go on the caroseul, but then when you get on you feel jipped because it sucks.  well i bought gum and then my mom took me to GAP and i got a bunch of new clothes and flirted with this CUTE!! salesman! he was like "do you want to get a room?" and "if you need any help i can come in at any time". as mr. shonick would say - "WOAH NELLI!"  i bought a jacket, pants and two new shirts. well.. my mom did. she said she would take me to valley fair sometime to check out the selection there. i agreed. uhh we left the mall and i went home and slept and did more homework. I barely did the research paper for miranda. so pointless.. i went to bed early.. i think.. i dont really remember what i did. oh yeah but jaye got pissed at me because i showed my emotions and told him how much i liked jack and stuff.. psh, he's the one who blew my former and soon to be boyfriend while driving around the boardwalk. WHAT HAPPENED TO "I DONT WANT FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS" !? but i digrese.  oh yeah, i talked to chris i think.. he seems like a big asshole now, and he drinks a lot. not that i dont drink.. i just dont drink A LOT. yeah!  monday was so good. it is days like those when i realize i love soquel and would never under any circumstances go to another school. geo was all about studying for the test. crystal drew this picture of this guy but then it looked like soem creepy guy from a movie so she threw it at me and then i threw it back at her and then she threw it and it hit katia. haha. katia was like "HEY THIS LOOKS LIKE MY UNCLE!" only not that loud. piano was fun. CEG EGC GCE CEG C C C C C. uhh you noe who i think just SCREAMS fag? connor clark. hes got that whole femininness too him. plus he was looking at me funny when i went in the band room-ness. annie was the fifth person to notice my NEW jacket. crystal, katia, nathalie and carolyn were the others. WOO! annie said i looked like i lost a lot of weight. nope, i just cried, vomited and shit a lot. :) then in my open i listened to THE BRITNEY SPEARS CD! i rescued it from under my bed. aww it was fun and i read TKAM. SOOO GOOD! i guess i looked really attractive cause alicia said eddy was staring at me alot. that kid is too tan. and hes kinda gross.. with his weird ankles. im sorry, but im not a fan of the noodles ;) aww that was mean. HAHA scary movie 3 quote: i have a bad feeling like when you see an asian person behind the wheel of a car. HA HA HA! poor asians. well then it was off to miranda. where we took a fucking quiz. yay. then we talked about TKAM. and we got a new project. on top of the revolutionary essay. uhh. anyway, everyone liked my new jacket. even alec complimented me. aw. pe was fun as always with G and L! elizabeth noticed my new jacket (like everyone else) and was like "woah, JACKet JACK! haha!" and i was like "uhh.. yeah" i cant go anywhere with out hearing about him. jeez. lunch was tasty, shonick was fun (we studied for the test) and so was french. we just did p.p. verbs. HAHA if i werent in that clas sit wouldnt be half as fun as it is now. alicia was moved to the desk in front of the cabinet and keppie started talking so i was like "alicia! there's candy behind you!" and she liked hopped forward and pulled out the candy and she jumped with the desk and threw it to everyone. yum. then while mrs keplinger was trying to "contain" her i ran up and got a bunch of yummy sour worms and started munching on them. what can i say, im a rebel. after we were settled, alicia was eating this lollipop and she was all "eW! this tastes like shit!" and mrs k was like "thats prolly form the rats that pee in there" and i laughed so hard. haha it was great. alicia was like "i've tasted cum better than this shit! shut up brandon, you're gay!" haha it was so funny. christine started dying of a heart attack too and we both fell on the floor. it was sooo funny.   uhh afterschool my mom picked me up and i just went home and did homework. it was weird not having jaye around.. i do miss him. he was a great friend, and im sad that he is gone. but i must focus on other things now, like school and getting abs.  nathalie and i talked and i did homework and we studied and yeah. i slept. NIGHTIE!  math was fun. the test was hard but i knew it. at least i felt like i did. i dunno how i did on the last two.. how many lateral faces does an octogonal right prism have if you cut of the side paralell to the tangeted of the circle inscribed in the base. uh.. and is the diameter of the sphere in proportion to the cone in which it is inscribed if the cone has r 5 and the sphere has r 4? uh.. crystal cheated of me HAHA and they were different tests. nathalie and i walked to the lockers after the test.. then i went to piano and relaized i forgot my book so i went to the lockers to get it and i saw crystal. we walked together and waved at nathalie and kevin g. in enzwiler. yeah! and then piano was alrite.. ronnie texted me and threw my concentration off. and joe v. and i had a staring contest. haha. hes cute in a jock with no muscles sort of way. and hes REALLY smart! AP bio sophmore year!? woah! give me a biTE!haha we had a sub in miranda. and we had to do the IN CLASS ESSAY! it was easier than i thought it would be, D + A why WWI was different than all previous wars. i said tech, total war effort and the global warfare. and i analyzed that it caused more deaths, in britian and france the total war effort left people being treated as equal instead of men better than women and stuff.. uhh and more deaths.. :) it was relly fun! i like those in class essay. well then we took notes on our "News Article" project. we had the burning down of Miss Maudie's house. easy fo sheasy. uhh we had that creepy sub who kinda check alec out and who alec checked out in return. weird.  OH AND GARDENIA WAS LIKE (to me and crystal and tess) "god brandon, is that ALL you think about? the average buy thinks about sex every 11 seconds, but brandon thinks about it every sec!" then i kinda blushed and i walked up to recycle something and when i came back tess left me a note that was like "when gardenia said you think about sex every sec alec turned, looked at you and smiled" and i was like really? and tess nodded. i kinda looked at alec.. and when he turned around again i smiled DEEPLY and kinda looked away and then looked back. he was still smiling. aww. i feel cute.  THEN IT WAS LUNCH! we studied for the test. in shonick, we took the test. all multiple choice, 120 questions. not that bad. i liked it. alec made a few jokes and he threw me a peice of gum when i didnt ask for it. is it just mroe or does he look good in shorts? haha. after the test we talked about the conflicts of Farwell to Manzanar and To Kill a Mockingbird. I THOUGHT OF AN ASTUTE AND PROFOUND CONFLICT! Jeanne's internal struggle between her heritage and her americanism which relates to the title of the book. manazanar was like the end her hertageish. and she had to give it up, she had to give up her past, in order to move on to the future! woo! i feel smart. i said other things too but not importnant. oh and then we talked about the whole "if you were deserted on an island with just the humanaties academy who would be the leader?" i said georgi cause hes smart and civil. and i'd probably be the smart guy who builds his house on the hill so when it floods he doesnt die. it was fun and it really got me thinking abot being stuck with the humanaties academy. wouldnt be so bad, at least i wouldnt have to face the gay drama anymore. chyeah.  afterschool, tegan and i had a small chat on the test. she is super duper cool! i love her blues clues shirt and her tanness. shes really smart too.. she's like.. what i would be like.. if i was a girl! yeah! call me sometime tegan, we'll chill! well after.. i went home relieved. i love the humanaties academy..

My skin should crack and peel  I want the fire back  Now, through the smoke, she calls to me  To make my way across the flame To save the day Or maybe melt away  I guess it's all the same   So I will  Walk through the fire  'Cause where else can I turn?  I will  Walk through the fire  And let it...   The torch I bear is scorching me  Buffy’s laughing, I've no doubt  I hope she fries, I'm free if that bitch dies  I better help her out  'Cause she is  Drawn to the fire  Some people...  She will never learn  Both: And she will Walk through the fire  and let it...  Will this do a thing to change her?  Am I leaving dawn in danger?  Is my slayer too far gone to care?  What if Buffy can't defeat it?  Beady eyes is right, we're needed  Or we could just sit around and glare  All: We'll See it through  It's what we're Always here to do  so we will  Walk through the fire   So one by one, they turn from me  I guess my friends can't face the cold  What can't we face?  But why I froze, Not one among them knows  And never can be told  She came from the grave much graver One by one, they come to me  First, he’ll kill her, then I’ll save her  Everything is turning out so dark Going through the motions  No, I’ll save her, then I’ll kill her  I think this line is mostly filler What's it going to take to strike a spark? It's what they have inside  She will come  These endless days Are finally ending in a blaze  All: And we are Caught in the fire  The point of no return  So we will  Walk through the fire  And let it burn   ~*~  so while nathalie, chrstina and crystal were at the cincenria (i dont noe how to spell) i finished all my homework.  okay. here's the story.  nathalie and christina didnt talk and nathalie hated her for like.. two months?  and then crystal and nahtalie go to a bon fire at the beach, make out with some random guys, christina comes and gets drunk, nathalie offers to take her home and does even though christina protests a little. anyway, nathalie mom shows up and christinas like "DAVID YOU HAVE TO COME HOME!

OOOH!! and katy called me from standord. she met a HOTTIE. what what!? and a gay guy too. and shes like.. at one of the prettiest campuses ever. except berkley. BERKLEY BOY!! who's up for a road trip? I AM. anyway, that night i was TALKING TO LILY on the computer. lily is amy's lil sis!! shes awesome. we were talking about all the times she scared amy haha and then i was like "OKAY! I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK!" and then i like signed off and left for an hour and she LEFT!! lol. poor lily. amy was like "lily said you left her! shes like 'im never waiting that long for brandon again! after half an hour you can drop a piano on my head.'" haha. poor lily. well anyway.. uhh nathalie and i got in a fight because shes upset that i post HER LIFE on my blog. and its like, its MY BLOG i can say whatever i want. and i dont tell her secrets, though i could. i just said she went to the beach and got drunk and shit. its not like it didnt happen. im sorry you didnt want the world to know, but if you dont, then dont do that shit.  duh.  im perfectly fine admitting that i get drunk in hotel rooms and give head in the back of peoples cars and hand jobs in movie theaters. but maybe im just really open and comfortable letting it all hang out.   i can let my hair down..  so anyway, she also was pissed that i told jenica, who went out with jose, that nathalie was going out with jose. jose cheated on jenica with like 3 other girls. so i thought nathalie could use that warning. and she needed to hear it straight from jenica, i didnt want to assume things. but whatever. i still have my tin ton.  and just so you all know, i may have made it seem likee crystal is a bad person up in my may post, but she still does pretty well in school and its cute that she has a boyfriend. the guy actually wasnt a random guy, but since none of them clued me in back then, i didnt have a chance to post that. but yeah, now you know. not that anyone really reads all the way down to the bottom of the blog. most people just leave. ha.  and i also talked to jaye that night. hes really cool and i really did miss him. im sorry for calling him a bitch and shit. i was just angry. i can get that way when shit happens, but im glad we're semi-talking again.   but nathalie on the other hand, she needs to realize that:   1) she is not always right, she DOES make mistakes, we all do. its part of being a stupid human teenager.  2) jose is not just a gentleman because he acts like one. i could act straight, but im still a faggot on the inside. thats what jaye does kinda. huh?  3) jose WILL cheat on her unless she does sexual things with him. and knowing how fickle she is, she probably will do that stuff. and then he'll still cheat on her because he loves the pussy.   4) i told jenica about nathalie and jose because i wanted jenica to tell nathalie the story of jen and jose and warn her. she cried on your fucking shoulder nathalie! jaye, jack and i is a totally different story, #1 we're gay and #2 we're all really hot. so it was natural that we would cheat with each other.   5) my blog is where i post MY THOUGHTS. ryan wrote about me in his blog, but i dont care cause hes cool and that's HIS blog and he can write WHATEVER he WANTS. and i write that stuff about you because its how i can explain what a DUMBASS you've been.   6) dont act like you dont spread shit about me, cause you fucking do. you told christina I made up the crayonhead thing, but YOU did. and i think thats shitty. if you can talk smack behind my back, i can too. freak.  7) MY milkshake brings all the BOYS to the yard. yours brings all the players. and they make YOU charge.   8)everyone knew about you and christina getting drunk because she told people and you told people and gardenia told people and jenica told people so its not just ME. and if you're just reading that may thing now, that just goes to show you that no one really finishes the blog issues. i doubt you'll be able to finish this one. moron.  9) dont try to turn crystal against me. shes still my friend too, and i know what a manipulator you can be "DONT TALK TO CHRISTINA!! SHES THE TRAITOR!! SHES THE ENEMY!!" such bullshit.   and  10) if you ever need help in chemistry, im just across the table. i dont want you to fail because i didnt help you. i want you to stumble and fall on your own.  THANK YOU and goodnight.   monday was a good day. i looked like MAJOR shit from staying up all night and stuff. but it was okay, because i felt good. chem was fun, i got ROCKSTARS and PARTIED and this crazy teacher came in and was like "I WAS THE GIRL IN CHEMISTRY WHO WHEN THE TEACHER SAID TO TAKE A SNIFF I WOULD TAKE A WHIFF AND PASS OUT!! THAT WAS ME!!" it was so funny. she was cool. i really dont like jean because shes a bitch to me. but i guess she MIGHT be nice. maya is actually pretty cool. and sarah makes me laugh. A LOT. katy called during class cause i called her during her class lol. it was cool, shes lovin stanford. on and NATANIA and AMANDA are awesome chicas.  during the lab, nathalie was like "brandon, i dont get this.." and im like "thats what the teachers for.." and shes like "cant you just help me?" and im like "no" and shes all "what?" and im all "because that would require talking." but if you ever do need help i'd be happy to help ya. read 10 ^^^^ anyway, i chilled with nate. hes a cool one.  anyway, after class i called tina and haha woke her up? we taked and stuff. then my mom came (and jean was there.

"BENZENE? HYDROGEN PEROXIDE?" and shes like "ahh!! i need to study! you're hurting my head!" haha i love her!"  anyway, we were waiting for mr. oka to talk to us cause sexy nate was asking a question. then i saw jean and i thought i should give her a chance to explain her side of the story.. since i didnt even talk to her about her hating me.  so i went over and i was like "jean, why dont you like me?" and she laughed (a good laugh) and she was like "who told you that!?" and i was like "dominic. the DrOMa queen." and she was like "i dont not like you brandon, i dont know you.." and im like "well, we should get to know each otha cuz youre cool and im cool." and shes like "sounds like a plan" aww jeanie, you are so on my COOL PEOPLE list now! *HIGH FIVE!* no more fish face..  anyway, when we FINALLY got to ask mr. oka about the elephant/high heel thing he was like "well, you know how you figure that out? you take an elephant and an elephant wearing high heels and you put them on your foot and see which one hurts the most." and amanda and i laughed and then i said "but isnt it true that stilletos can put a hole in a human foot?" and hes like "i dunno, ive never seen an elephant wearing stilletos. but if i do, i hope its a girl." haha so then we were like "bye mr. oka" and we walked out. megan was laughing REALLY hard.  i walked with amanda and told her about how magolli (or whatever) broke my foot outside sullivan. SO MUCH PRESSURE!! ouch. and then we did the ion/compoud thing. "NITRATE?" "NO3-, NITRITE?" "NO2-, BENZENE" and like i was walking up the hill and she was walking on the hall-ish thing so we were 3 yards apart and then up the hill, on the road, natania walks by and shes like "OMG! YOU GUYS ARE STILLA AT IT!?" haha it was SOOOOOO CLASSIC! YOU DONT EVEN KNOW!! IT MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD!! we said bye to amamnda and told her to study and then i quizzed natania and she walked down the road and i waited at the sign for my mom. haha she got a bunch right!! and then she left. STUDY HARD EVERYONE! my mom came and picked me up after that..  anyway, when i got home i went on the computer and finished up my lab report and studied for the bio quiz. i also talked to JAYE!! im so glad we're talking now jaye, we'll be buddies even when we hate each other! i luv ya! anyway, tina called and then we called amy and then we all left and i talked to lily online. shes funnay.   jackorcan: hey budddie Budddie5: hey jack Budddie5: are you sexy? jackorca: duh. Budddie5: TINAS FISH!   after that fun it was off to another night of ben, boredom and biology. i got there a little late with ashton and ciara. WOO! we got a progress report and i totally got an A! did you expect anything less? good.  then we took the quiz and i sat by ben!! ahh so hot. seriously.. DAAMN! after it was over i was outside with ashton and these chicas from my lab class. see, on lab days we split up so that one group (INCLUDING: ashton, ciarra, tyler, ben boy, molly[or something]) goes with mrs. hoffman and the rest of us go with jill. yeah.  after the break we got to evaluate the instructors and i was kinda harsh on mrs. b (jill) but everyone laughed. and then we talked and i didnt really pay attention cause we only went through four slides instead of the normal TWENTY (million. not) and so i just wrote notes and ashton + tyler + me partied and i was writing a note to naomi and i was like "BEN IS HOT!" and he saw and looked at me and smiled. AHH SO CUTE! and evan and i got in a heated debate. and i was like "SHUT UP, YOU LOVE ME!" and he laughed and just sat there and smiled. wow wow wow. boys and biology. anyway, naomi and i left at like seven cause we didnt wanna watch the HOUR movie. i called annie and we talked about tp. and shit. PT CRUISER!! WOO! and then i left and went home.  ahh the night was nice. i studied for the chem test and talked to amy and tina. even though she never called me. biotch. just kidding.  i went to bed early. on my ONE YEAR AND ONE DAY of being OPENLY GAY! so great. this past year has been the awesomest year ever.    it's been an exciting month!! thank god it's over. now we can all just move on.  so let's recap the month:  IT'S SUMMER! i love joe. a lot. naomi and ryan ditched me for asia. kyle's coool, but his boyfriend's not. patrick gave me his number.. amy is cool. SHE'S LIKE "the BEST" amazon. nathalie bitched me out and then wanted me to help her. katy is in STANFORD. WITHOUT ME!! i better finish her letter. annie and i are SO VAIN! ronnie gets more action than drunk dominic. in the future, tina will be rich $$ RIP Jake Herfurth, Amber's dog. *HUG!* if i die before i wake, feed jake. my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard. crystal is a cutie. i totally apologize for making everyone think she was a bad person in my last blog. JACK NEVER MAKES PLANS. i think he just says he wanted to hang out with me. makes sense, cause he does the same thing with dominic. or so i hear. bio and chem arent THAT hard. dreams are the hottest forms of porn. and the number one thing of the month: jaye's talking to me again!!   QUOTE OF THE MONTH:  ClimberB9: everyone is homosexual to some extent. ClimberB9: no one goes through life without experiencing homosexual feelings to some extreme.    NOTE: i'm doing a BEST QUOTES OF THE SUMMER post at the end-ish of august. so stay cool and keep bein' funny and maybe you'll land a spot.  call me. if you're sexy. bRaNdOn

      GOD. what is it with the fat fags of Santa Cruz?  why do they even try to be players? and why are they all such bitches?  god. they all piss me off.  after i have worked so hard to boost their self-esteeem and make them happy, they think their hot shit and try to play it off like they're COOL.  WELL. I HAVE MESSAGES FOR THE THREE GAY LARDS OF THIS COUNTY.   ronnie - you're a fucking liar.. and FUCKING UGLY. did you really think we'd believe that you got fucked in the back of a pt cruiser at delavega golf course? NOPE. try to make up lies we'll actually believe. like you joined the circus.  ----> hey, i'd believe it!  and you know what! i'm happy you and jaye got together. it is a match made it HEAVEN! now we don't have two ugly fat guys roaming around, falling in love with the cuties and making death threats to the hot guys who the cute ones fall in love with. bless you, mini man.    jaye - what is there to even SAY about you? you're such a fuck up, omg. you don't even give people a chance to explain themselves, and you DEFINETLY DON'T try to talk things out. i pity the ugly ass dickshit who gets stuck with you. unless it's ronnie. you know, i tried to be nice, and i tried to be friendly. i complimented you like crazy, kissed ass, and tried to boost your self esteem so you didn't go all whack and shoot yourself, which we all would've benefitted from anyway.  what more you do you want!?  the next time you're lying in bed, crying yourself to sleep because you weigh more than an elephant and look like a tomato and eggs omelette, remember me, because i was the only hot gay guy you'll ever meet who'll treat you with decency and respect. GOD YOU ARE LIKE THAT FATSO IN SE7EN!!! OMG!! THAT'S TOTALLY YOU!! WOAH!!! YOu'RE LIKE THE GOODYEAR BLIMP!! ARE YOU GONNA HOVER OVER THE CABRILLO STADIUM!!??   and last, to my dear lover  jack - what do you want me to say? i wish we didn't have to fight.. because i really did care about you. but you know what, when you TRY to cheat on brandon, you get fucking yelled at. don't use the fact that i cheated on you during our relationship, because you TRIED to cheat on me, and that's almost, if not just as bad as, CHEATING. JSUT BECAUSE You"RE TOO FUCKING HAIRY AND FAT TO GET ATTENTION FROM ANYONE DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BITCH TO ME ABOUT IT! :-D!!  i have been so open-minded and understanding, and i have forgiven you for sooo many things. SO MANY THINGS. when we first started getting to know each other, you sold out my words to RC and made him think i was a fucking pyscho. DID I EVER THANK YOU FOR THAT? oh well, RC's cool and over it, and you're a fattie.. so it doesn't matter.  then you would pass your phone around at break whenever i would call you because you'd want your friends to lie and say you were in the bathroom so you wouldn't have to talk from me.  HEY, YOU EVEN TOLD MY COUSIN THAT IF WE EVER WENT OUT, YOU'D PLAY ME LIKE THE UNDERCLASSMEN I AM!! AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I CALLED MY COUSIN A FUCKING LAIR BECAUSE I BELIEVED YOU WHEN YOU SAID YOU WOUDLNT!!! STUPID ASS ME. I SHOULD'VE SHOT MYSELF!!!  then i yelled at you and avoided you, and you know what, i'll admit that i was ugly, and if i were you, i'd i've avoided me too! so i can't really blame you for that.  but then you "fell in love with me" and who knows, maybe you did, or maybe you were just sweet talking me so i would blow you because oyu found out that i gave great head (since i DID get with a 20 year old). you acted like a jealous little bitch when i would hang out with jaye, and you gave me funny looks when i didn't say goodbye to you at harbor. was that LOVE or just DISAPPIONTMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE AS FAT AS CHINA!?  then we DID go out! and i must say, i had a lot of fun with you! especially when you'd tell your friends and everyone who knew we were oging out that you didn't think our relationship was going anywhere. AND THEN YOU'D TURN AROUND AND TELL ME YOU LOVED ME AND WANTED TO BE WITH ME FOREVER!! WEIRD, HUH?  but then i got sick of you, since we only hung out THREE times in our almost two months of dating. WHAT A LOSER. and RIGHT after i dumped you, you turned to jaye and started playing with his ding dong and trying to kiss him.  when the three of us hung out that crazy saturday in may, and then we walked back to your car and i gave you head and you told me you wanted to lose your virginity to me, i was stupid, i guess. because i believe you. BUT THEN THE NEXT WEEK WHEN NATHALIE AND HOT HOT TINA AND I WENT TO GO SEE THE SOQUEL MUSICAL, you told me you couldn;'t come because you were sick.  BUT WHAT DID YOU DO? YOU WENT AND GAVE HEAD TO JAYE IN THE BACKSEAT OF A CAR BEING DRIVEN BY LESBOS!! OOO!! THAT SOUNDS HOT!! no.  and then the next day, you had the nerve to tell me you loved me. only me. and that you wanted to go out with me. pretty fickle, huh?  then you yelled at me because you were with tori, the chick who doesn't know youre gay. EVEN THOUGH JUST YOUR FUCKING BEST FRIEND. but i guess that little conversation we had where you told me you wanted to marry her and grow old with her meant that telling ehr you were gay would ruin your LIFE PLAN.  speaking on coversations, you would butter me up and tell me you missed me, and then you would go hang out with jaye at the mall. (I'M LIKE FUCKING GOD, DON'T TRY TO DO ANYHTING AND THINK THAT I WON'T FGURE IT OUT SOONER OR LATER. FATSO.)  i'm sorry, i should laugh off the fact that you're humongus and disgusting. and have really hairy feet. i mean, you can't help that! oh wait.. ;-)  you told me when summer happened we'd be together and again and we'd saee each other ALL THE TIME. BUT IT'S AUGUST AND YOU HAVEN'T FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH ANY OF YOUR PLANS!! LOSER!!  and you know what, i gave you the benfit of the doubt when alex told me that you asked him for sexual favors on your BIRTHDAY! YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!!! you said you were going to SF with your parents on your birthday!! AND I BOUGHT YOU A LONG STEMMED ROSE AND BROUGHT IT ALL THE WAY TO HARBOR FOR YOU!! AND YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK!!  no.. i can't even act suprised. it seems like trying to get other boys to fuck you is typical. maybe it's because you have a psycho alcoholic father and a waspy mom who covers up her problems with money. and don't even get me started on your sister.  but please, i digrese. it's not your fault you have a sucky family. and that you have to cover up the fact that you're gay whenever you're with them. YOU KNOW WHAT JACK! you should just say "I'm GAY AND ACCEPT THAT OR FUCK YOU!"  and then you try to get me to hang out with you ONLY AFTER everyone else cancels on you and no one wants to be seen with you.  you even asked daniel vivani to go MAKE OUT WITH YOU. FUCK HEAD!! YOU DON'T DO THAT SHIT!!! at least i was honest when i told you i cared about you.  i've said it before, and i'll say it again. just because i'm actually hot enough to get with another guy doesn't mean you have to yell at me for cheating on you when you would've done the same in a heart beat. AND A LITTLE ADVICE SWEETIE: STAY AWAY FROM SHORTS!! yeah! hairy ass.  i actually believed you when you told me you loved me, but i guess that's my fault, huh? what a loser i am. so jack, what i wanan say to you is: EXERCISE. FUCK YOUR STRAIGHT CHICK.  AND GO SHAVE YOUR FUCKING BACK HAIR!  i guess i should thank you for the lessons you've given me. and trust me,  i know now to cut the  FAT  out of my  DIET .

YUM AND BEN.  when i got home i started talking 2 nathalie again. cool. yeah. then i went into my room and watched fifty first dates and slept.  friday i woke up at 6 pm and worked on homework and watched cold mountain (SO PORNOGRAPHIC). tina and amy called and we talked. it was awesome like always.  saturday was one of the best days of the summer. i went to see farenheit 9/11 with amy, tina and lily at forty-first (after much negotiation) it was cool cause it was rated R and we still got in. the movie was excellent, mostly cause tina, amy and i made fun of it. it was really good though.. it made me laugh. a lot.  and the base keeps runnin runnin and runnin runnin and runnin runnin.  we went across the street to tony and albas and got yummy pizza. haha no one wanted to eat the last peice of pesto so we were shaking parmesian on it and the cap fell off and cheese spilt EVERYWHERE! it was crazy.  ----> we ran out. and walked down the street to the mall.  the cliffnotes of the mall: -saw nathalie and her cousin -cutie checked me out when i was showing lily a purse in ae -express was boring.. no one cute works there. -abercrombie has DOORS!? since WHEN?? -we got candy and partied -this little kid fell in the fountain -a girl had a seizure -these guys in a black passat holla'd at us  we walked to longs and i saw KATIA BURKE! and we checked out other peoples pictuers and tickled each other in the parking lot. it was a lot of fun. then we walked 2 amy's via the DMV parking lot and we saw crack all over the ground and this chrysler was going really really slow.. so we ran.  when we got to the street that runs by jade street park (is it jade STREET???) this guy was like "HEY I KNOW YOU!" to amy and then he's like "no.. wait.. i dont.." and then we walked a little more and tina's like "is that elena rossman?" and we see this blonde running towards us and when she gets closer i can see that she's wearing the same light brown a&f cords as me.. and it hits me. i drop my drink and run and naomi engleman and i through our arms around each other! it was so great. shes like "im back from japan!" and kate (who was there with tiana also) was like "OBVIOUSLY!" it was funny. oh and chase was there too.. amy and lily's neighbor boy and the one tina had a crush on. only not. it was weird cause i hang out with kate+tiana+naomi and i hang out with amy+lily+tina and he does too!!   GreEenjeLLybeAn1: it was like a cross-over   anyway, after lots of hugs and catching up, we walked down to jade street. haha chase was like "you're gay? that's so cool that you're open like that. if i was gay i wouldn't tell anyone." haha. they left and lily got her yearbook and amy and tina made me run through the swings!! it was so scary. and then we looked at lily's yearbook.  i saw someone who's HOTiZZle. and then my dad came and amy chased after my car. haha.  i just hung at home that night and talked to kyle on the phone for two hours or so. he's super cool (my vans are still better than his steve maddens). sunday was fun too. i went downtown with mischa, steve and anna. anna = caroline's sister. she was home from santa barbra. most of the people i hang out with that dont go to my school are really good friends of the family. we've known each other sicne we were two, partied together since we knew how to party, exchanged christmas gifts, shopped, travelled and.. basically.. had a good time. most of us even go to the same church.  the cool people are: Brandon Aiono (me) Caroline Simmons and Anna Simmons Lilly Thomas and Josie Thomas Steve Hinkel and Mischa Hinkel Kelly Tanner and Becky Tanner Sarah Shane Ben Elmore and Aurora Elmore Dylan Los Huertos and Kia Los Huertos Nora Stewart and Eva Stewart Lindsay Taylor Nate Kaufman and Brian Kaufman Greg Safranek, Nicole Safranek, and Colin Safranek  we may not all be rich but we come from families that have been friends forever. we all have elite qualities, star soccer players, brillant school kids, hilarious comedians, extreme bikers and horse-back riders, musically gifted, and athletically talented.  well i had to go home early but misch is the best. HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOY! downtown we just shopped around and mischa fell in love with these lucky brand jeans. steve was actually being cool and anna and i had a reunion. it was fun. hanging out with them made waking up after 5 hours of sleep worht it.  back at home i did homework and slept. i went to bed early and soon it was another week of chem+bio.  MONDAY (7/12): chem- hung out with nathalie and checked out the macy's preseason catalog. ooo purrrple. natania and amanda and i had fun too. it was a good day. nate was lookin cute in his plaid polo tee and monte was hot as always. IT'S SPELLED MONTE!! woo! i learned that today. anyway, the lecture was just gas laws and the lab was finding out the Molecular Weight of a certain gas. so we had to like fill a flask with water and seal it and then put it upside down in water so the water doesnt rush out. and we had to measure the temperature, volume, emperical mass and pressure.  mr. oka told us to SEAL THE FLASK REALLY REALLY WELL. so i pushed down on the stopper really really really hard and the flask BURST senting shards of glass everywhere; knicking three of my fingers and the palm of my right hand. it all happened so fast it didn't really hurt.. lucielle, the AWESOME lab technician took me in the back and cleaned the blood of my hands. while she went to go get bandaids, josh (the teacher from next door who was int eh lab room) started rubbing antiseptic on. this was our convo:  me- ow.. ow.. oww josh- haha, great job. me- *blush* josh- don't worry, i've done that before.. soo many times. me- really? josh- yep. me- great, now i'm gonna have cuts all over. josh- don't worry, the other gay guys'll think you're tough and cute. me- :-)  AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK HIM IF HE WAS GAY BUT THERE WAS THIS LOUD CRASH! and amanda's like "shit!" and him and i run out and see another flask on the ground and natania with a dust pan. haha. amanada dropped our SECOND flask. (our group=amanda, natania, nathalie, me and MONTE! yeah, i got him to work with us. that hot hunk.) anyway, mr. oka was trying to get the stopper out of the flask and he was like "i can't even get this out, it's soo far wedged in" and josh laughed and patted me on the back. anyway, once we recovered a flask we were putting the gas into the water and monte broke the nozzle off and the butan gas started LEAKING EVERYWHERE!! ahh!! it was soooo crazy. we all like.. evacuted from our table because it smelle dlike shit and lucielle came out with a gas mask laughing and shes like "you guys are cursed!" it was hilarious. nathalie broke the mecury thermometer after that. and then we did the lab and monte was like.. touching me.. ahh.. i almost orgasmed. he's so skater/surfer boy HOT HOT HOT. i died.  not really though. after the lab natania and i were outside and she's like "IM THE ONLY ONE WHO WASN'T CURSED!" and then a tennis ball hit her in the back of the head. ouch. haha. she shook her head and left.  home inbetween= talking to the fam about the injury and talking to other people about hot josh.  bio was regular. we had a lab quiz and andonis and i were making fun of chickens. then we sat through a BORING lecture on tCELLS. ahh. ben was looking hot though. so it was all good. i went home and did the homework and then i just relaxed on my bed and drifted off to sleep sleep sleep.  TUESDAY (7/13):  is it just me or is 13 my lucky number?? nathalie's lucky 2.  okay so in class we just lectured and stuff and monte waved to me. and yeah. natania and amanda and i were laughing and having fun like always. and then when we did LAB we had to find the properties of unknwon solutions and stuff.. and nathalie and i got 13. it's weird becase the order in which the chemicals were listed was the order in which our chemicals were..  A= the first one on the list B= the second one on the list C= the third D= can you guess?? NO!! IT WAS THE FOURTH!  blah blah. so it was really easy.. and cool. and it was group number 13 because all the things are different. after we finished that lab we were walking out to the parking lot because nathalie's aunt was gonna pick us up and we were gonna go see a movie- anchorman. it was weird because this wouldn't have happened if nathalie wasn't there. anyway, we were standing where i usually wait for my dad after biology, and guess who was walking out.  no. you won't fuckign believe this.  GUESS FUCKING WHO.  that's right bitches. it was joe viglienzoni.  i was so excited.. i thought it was like a fucking dream. anyway he walked out of the math building where THE NIGHT BEFORE IN BIO i was WITH ASHTON AND ERICA AND CIARA AND NAOMI BUYING CHIPS AFTER THE QUIZ!! it was so crazy. i have already filled cabrillo with memories. and i love it.  anyway this was our conversation:  brandon- "is that JOE VIGLIENZONI?" joe- *looks up* "it's brandon! :-)" brandon- "what are you doin' here, boy?" joe- "i'm taking english, you?" brandon- "bio and chem." joe- "=-o both! you overachiever, you!" brandon- *shrugs* "you know me.." joe- :-) brandon- "so how's your summer going?" joe- "good, *looks back and at his dad who's walking out with a student and then turns back around. his dad is a math teach at cabrillo* yours?" brandon- "it's been good. i've been thinkin' a lot about you." joe- :-) "cool" -i was blushing by this time so i kinda walked towards nathalie's aunt's car cause she drove up- brandon- "well.. it was good seeing you.." joe- "you have no idea."  OMG I LIKE MELTED WHEN I WALKED INTO NATHALIE'S AUNTS CAR. nathalie was like smiling at me and stuff. and then nathalie's aunt is like the most awesomest fucking person on this planet. you have know idea. she has the FUNNIEST stories and she listens to the shizzlest music. i wish she was my aunt. she told us a story about how like they amde the kids at the day care where she works.. they made them stand in line and push soap on their hands and then dip their hands in water and then towel off with a soap-ie towel and then more water and then another dry towel. and then the lady like cut little slices of food in front of each other them and like gave them each a little peice and the kid she was sitting by was like "I WANT MORE FOOD. MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE." (when she said that nathalie and i were already TOTALLY cracking up) and then she said she talked to gabi who went to that day care thing and she's like "did they make you wash your hands?" and gabi said "yeah" and shes like "what'd you do?" and gabiu's like " there was a sink..." it was soooo funny.  we got to nathalie grandma's and unloaded our things and gabi told nathalie about how jose.. lied to her. (AND NATHALIE DIDNT BELIEVE ME.) so instead of seeing the movie nathalie and i walked to crystals and chilled with her and then we walked to the mall. i love crystal's house, it's so cute. haha crystal's sister lost the phone under the bed and we were like searching for it. it was GReAT. and then we walked to the mall (we all looked super hot) and when we got there we found out jose wasn't working. so we just chilled at different stores. we went to express because i wanted to show nathalie the pearls and i noticed there was a cute guy working who i had only seen once before- at structure. jaye intro'd be to him. brandon tracy. he has my NAME. >:-O. oh well, i'll let it slide. anyway, i thought he was actually pretty cute and i wanted to talk to him.. but i was nervous. i eventually did... haha "i'm looking for something for back to school, any suggestions?" and then he was showing me stuff.. and we talked and laughed and stuff.. too bad he's not younger, he'd be fun.  anyway, after that we went to walden's because crystal had this freaky prophetic-ish dream and she told us about it on the walk over to the mall and in express so we were going to consult some horoscopes and dream dictionaires. (my idea.. yeah. someone stole it from me the next day though. tina knows who i'm talkin about cause i told her lol.) anyway, we read some interesting books and shit and then we walked to longs and bought a ouija board (my idea.. AGAIN..) and i ended up paying the most out of all of us, which is important (i'll tell you why later). anyway, crystal's little sisters are way cool. haha nathalie made fun of a hippie.. and there was one sitting RIGHT THERE. it was funny.  we asked the ouija board some questions and i was like "will i see joe again this summer?" and it said "YES!" which is cool because.. the next day.. well,.. you'll see. and then i asked what would happen between be and jack when he came back and it said "fun stuff." wooooo.  nathalie walked me home and i talked to tina for a little. oh yeah i talked to people online at crystal's house about JOE!! woo. he's SO hot.  all this time you were pretending, so much for my happy ending.  bio was basically me telling the stories to EVERYONE and uhh we watched a movie on mad cow disease and it was really sad. i feel bad for people who have to suffer through that. it's crazy. i blame the people who fed sheep parts to cows. oprah was cool to stand up for people and stuff.  anyway, after that we got to do another mating thing haha only it was more controlled. we got gloves with liquid on it and we had to mix liquid with other people and at the end we would find out whether or not we were infected with a disease. so i did: naomi, megan and calandra.  and i got the disease. i fucking got the disease!! haha the infected people were:  brandon, naomi, bach, calandra, megan, travis, jason biencarti, and kassondra.  it turned out naomi was the initial spreader of the disease. haha.  here's the path:  R1 naomi- - - - - brandon  R2 kassondra megan  R3 bach travis jason calandra   haha it was CRAZY. but fun. THEN WE GOT TO SEE A SHEEP'S HEART!! omg it was so great. but yeah.. we took each other's pulse too and like our blood pressure. it was neat. dora is really cool cause she noes like EVERYTHING. haha and when i went to turn down the lights kassondra's like "brandon, are we mating again?" she's so pretty and cool! then naomi and i (the starters of the diease) went home and i talked to people online about stuff. it was cool.  anyway, that was an AWESOME DAY.  WEDNESDAY (7/14):  chem was really good. we spent the whole day reviewing for the test and older megan and i hung out. she's really cool. and amanda and natania and i reviewd ALOT. oh the demonstration was of LIQUID NITROGEN!! it was sooo cool, you have no idea! we got to freeze flowers and then break them and tracy froze a plum and then nailed a wood thing with it. okay so then jennifer froze this balloon and it deflated but when she took it out it reinflated!! soo cool!! and mr. oka froze this ball and kelly got to take it outside and he was like "throw it on the ground.." so nathalie and amanda and i huddled together and then kelly THREW it HARD and it SHATTERED! and amanda and nathalie and i like fell against the wall, we were screaming soooo hard. it was cool. haha i screamed when the plum broke too and lucielle (awesome lab tech) was laughing. it was cool. i love everyone in that class and i'm gonan miss them when it ends :-( but yeah.. LIQUID NITROGEN! nate and i were breaking daisys! haha and nathalie pushed my in a spinny chair while i was talking to katy (who's still in stanford and hasn't gotten ANY of my letters!!! :-( ..) i lvoe that class. it is so awesome. everyone is amazing. josh it hot. haha.  so after class and ex. problems and stuff nathalie and i waited for nathalie's mom at the bus stop in front of the cabrillo place (cause i wanted to see joe) andthen jean came out and we invited her to sit with us BECAUSE SHE'S SUPER COOL. i was helping her with this chem problem when this BEE flew up under her binder and i like JUMPED up and grabbed nathalie (who was just sitting there eating) and i started hopping around and i wa slike "BEE BEE BEE" and then nathalie's like "turn around" and i froze and looked behind me and joe was RIGHT there.. walkign with his dad to their car. i was like "hi joe.." and i waved and he laughed and waved and it was all so cute. it wasnt a making fun of me laugh it was a laughing with me laughing. so i sat back down with jean and her and nathalie were like.. looking at him.. and they said he was smiling at me when they drove away. aww.  anyway.. nathalie's mom came and took me home and i worked on bio and chem stuff and then i went to bio and we took the exam and like EVERYONE LEFT. it was great. the exam was pretty easy, i hung out with sarah before hand and yEAh. hahaahaha ashton scared the SHIT out of me.  sleep= next day.

AND WHEN I ASK TO TAKE IT TO USE WITH AMY AND TINA AND LILY YOU BETTER FUCKING LET ME TAKE IT BECAUSE CHRISTINA PAID NOTHING AND SHE'S USED IT EVEN MORE THAN NATHALIE HAS. THATS PRETTY FUCKED UP."  okay.. i got that out. but yeah, they were being lame so i walked home.. they came too, but yeah. and then i got ready for bio and called tina on the way, IT WAS HIKING DAY!  -------> what ever happened to me+wes??? weird. oh well, i'm over it.  we all got pumped for the hike and megan and kassondra wanted me in there car!! aww, they're so great. naomi, bach and i said we were gonna go with ciarra and ashton though. haha so we had to run to catch up to them. erika nad ashton were already in ciarra's car (built for 5 people) and so naomi+me+ashton+bach squeezed into the back and erika and ciarra were in the front. it was so much fun. we passed ben and stuff and his eyes POPPED out. and we accidently almost turned around into the old people place.  when we got IN to niscene marks the 14 cars that were driving with us were kicking up so much dust that this old lady in the middle of the road like.. collapsed. so sad.  the hike was alrighty. stupid gene put his hand in posion oak which jill (the teacher.. not the soquel chick) is HORRIBLY allergic too. she was like screaming. haha it was fun. and there was this chick nailing a leaf to a tree. evan was playing teeter-toter with sarah on this log haha. the stream was the fun part. itai and i were dancig on rocks.. and i killed a spider.. oops. kassondra's like "good job b." haha. anyway, then evan like got us to walk across this stream and stuff. me erika and naomi. so we crossed and we just get rock hopping and log climbing all the way downstream. gene was acting totally psycho. but we left him behind and soon we met up with megan, itai and AnDOnis. and then itai and gene left and andonis was like all the way down this other bank.. and we just KEpT CLIMBING CLIMBING CLImbing. it was so great. we hiked a long way and then we decided to go back cause it was scary. lol. we made it back and the whole class was waiting for us. then we hiked back to the beginning and we ALL piled into ciarra's car again. it was so great. HER CAR ALMOST FLIPPED ON THE WAY BACK TO THE SCHOOL!! HAHA!!  when we got out bach left and erika left. while naomi and ciarra were checking out the dust damage to fiona (ciarra's green honda), ashton and i went to wash her shoes and she changed into her dress and ciarra changed into a new shirt. we DECIDED that all of us were gonna hang out.  so we drove to the "do it yourself" car wash and we got to was fiona!! it was sooo cool! i soaped her and foamed her and then ciarra rinsed and then we thoguht we were done but this like.. yellow liquid spit out.. and it was like.. wax.. lol. so we had to totally redo the car wash. and i got to be on the inside when they washed it. she sprayed off all the wax and then she tried to turn it off but she accidently sprayed MORE WAX ON. it was the funniest thing in the world. i couldn't stop laughing. then when we were done we all drove back to cabrillo and ashton met her blind date, BOB. he was actually pretty cute but kinda gay.. anyway, they left and we were gonna meet them downtown so naomi, ciarra and i took off and we decided to go to my house. and we were pulling off the kmart exit of the freeway and there was this rosemary bush outside and ciarra wanted a pinch so i jumped out of the car and grabbed it but i acctually like.. pulled off a whole branch. haha. it was hilarious. then naomi and her had some and it made them all itchy and they were like hallucinating haha. i was just sitting there.  we stopped at my hosue and i got money, changed and told my mom where i was going. she said it was cool and then we were off to downtown. we met up with ash and bob and then the five of us walked to taqueria valliarta whatever. and we got food and ate and it was yummy and BIG. bob and we were all just.. hanging out.. having a good time. anyway, we let bob and ashton go do "there thing" and ciarra, naomi and i drove home. it was a great night! i was out until 10! woo!! that's gotta be a record.. i dont think i've stayed outside later than that unless i was at someone's house.. cool.  OH GOD, on the way BACK from downtown we were driving past the little hospital (THAT ISN'T DOMINICAN) and like we saw these people on the side of the road and i was kinda making fun of them cause it was this chick in REALLY SHORT SHORTS. and like, this guy in a cut sleeve shirt.. so weird.. and then the girl like ran up to ciarra's car and was asking where a gas station was and so ciarra and naomi and i were trying to tell them and then CIARRA, being the goody-two-shoes that she is (BUT I CAN'T BLAME HER FOR IT, CAUSE WE ALL LOVE HER!), invites them TO TAKE A RIDE WITH US TO THE NEAREST GAS STATION. UHHH.  so THESE TWO HICKS PILE INTO THE BACK WITH ME!! ME!! I WAS IN TEH BACK WITH THEM!! the girl was smacking ehr gum and talkign about like how they ran away from missouri and stuff and ciarra's like "where are you from?" and the DAD who was DRUNK was like "you mean the home or the motel?" WHAT??? YEAH!! so ciarra dropped them on the corner of 7th and capitola by that one (i wanna say shell...) gas station and they thanked us kindly and left.  ciarra's like "i bet brandon hates me now."  and i was like "just.. keep.. driving. before they ask for a ride back home."  ciarra dropped naomi off and we were gonna drive down the road screaming "BRANDON TRACY!" since he lives by naomi and her sister and brandon were best friends and.. i dunno.. i kinda had a CRUSH on him. SHHH. eww!! i never said that. SHUT UP.  anyway, ciarra drove me home and we almost got attacked my a psycho dog that ran into the crosswalk near burger king (we took the REALLY REALLY long route.) but i got home safely. SUCH A FUN NIGHT.  that night amy and tina called and we tlaked until 4:30 AM!! it was crazy. we were all like falling asleep and i pretending to be talking in my sleep about joe. oo, turn me on, turn me on. i slept for a decent.. 10 hours..

OK>>>at 3:30 my dad dropped me off at crystal's house. IT'S SOOOOO NICE!! haha my hair was acting crazy when i got there so nathalie played hair stylist. first we tried hairspray.. then lotion.. gel.. water.. blow dryer. haha. it was SOO much fun. then we went into crystal's room and sang songs and danced all crazy. AND LISTENED TO THIS REALLY FUNNY MESSAGE THAT I LEFT ON LIKE.. the 22nd? when i called crystal's cellie and made it seem like crystal was there.  Me- Crystal? Hey!

Crystal? CRYSTAL? There's no one on the phone, liar!!  hahaha. after sitting around in crystal's room we went into her AWESOME backyard! it's soooooo big. it's like the size of four classrooms. the have a little "back" area behid the garage, and then there's a "relaxing area" with a table and chairs and a fountain and LOTS OF TANNING BEDS!! well.. not tanning BEDs but im.. the chairs you can lie back on and sit in the sun. and then there's like a little studio and a PALMTREE ROOM!! and farther back is the pool and the TRAMPOLINE and then there's the "farm place" which is like trees and veggies and stuff!! all good!!  we walked out to the trampoline and started JUMPIN' on it!! it was sooo much fun! we went crazy and i almost passed out! and then there was this scary spider that i heroically killed. MORE BOUNCING! it was soooooo fun!  when crystal's mom+sisters got home we got off the tramp-o-line and crystal asked if she could go to the mall. her mom said yes. HAHA and then we kept seeing ari and i'd be like "hi mari!" and she'd be like "ariana~!" haha well we sang some more and then we went to the mall (after spraying some vanilla mist on!!)  and then crystal's dad like walked out towards the hallway and nahtalie walked like RIGHT there and she like looked at him... and then she LOOKED AGAIN AND SHE LIKE JUMPED!! haha!! it was soooo funny!!  we got some soda from crystal's garage and then we hit the MALL. haha there was this cop and he was checking people for speeding and we had a brillant idea to go yell at people by the hill to stop speeding because a CHP was down the street. but we decided not to cause that would be pointless.  we walked to the mall and shopped a little. gloria jeans for a muffin, walden's for magazines, that cell phone place to see maria and anita. HAHA SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE MALL WHEN WE ARE!!! the guy was like fixing her cell phone soooooo slllloooowwww. anyway, we left and nathalie tried to fill out a form at pinache, but she could becaue she wasn't 16.  we walked around more and they tried on different make-up things in macy's and i went to hang out with jeffie :-)  after macy's we walked to the food court and nathalie and crystal got foodage and i SAW NAOMI AND KATE!! and i totally went and hung out with them! we talked about summer and boys and hook ups and alcohol and KATE'S PURSE SMELT SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOD!! OMG!! and holly, alicia and delia stopped by and sat with us too. i waved for nathalie and them all to come and hang with us but they didn't see.. so yeah.  it was cool though and then i got to talk to joce on the phone. she's awesome! but then i left and they told me to call so i promised i would! nathalie and crystal left me (and my stuff just LYING there on the table) so i walked around and went back into macy's to say goodbye to jeff.  then i caught up with nathalie and crystal and nathalie's aunt picked her up and crystal and i walked to crystal's house-ish and i saw teena davis so she gave me directions to the railroad tracks. i walked down there and talked to amy on the phone JUST IN CASE. then my mom LUCKILY was driving down my street while i was walking in it so she picke dme up and took me home. thank jesus.  at home i talked online to people. it was chill. OH, AND I STARTED MY ASHLEE SIMPSON BINDER COVER!! alex called around 11 and i talked to him while working on it. IT'S SOOO MUCH FUN MAKING BINDER COVERS. anyway, you HAVE to check it out because it's like THE CUTEST THING EVER!!  livin' in the shadow of someone else's dream trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me livin' in a nightmare a never-ending sleep but now that i am wide awake my dreams are finally free don't feel sorry for me  AWWW!! SOOOO DEEEEP!! anyway, i went to bed around three, after finishingmy beautiful ashlee simpson binder.  i woke up LATE on thurs. nathalie called and she was at her grandmas, so my dad drove me down and i chilled with her. gabi is soooo funny!  ~i'm getting a black mustang and then everyone'll be like "oh her comes gabi with her loud music! the ashlee simpson CD!" ~*on the phone with her boyfriend* hey, you're best friend called me and asked me to go with him to some cincenera. what'd i say?

OH! and i helped amy out with her clan of the cave bear essay. i think she's off to a really good start. AMY=THE BEST!!  elena jin and i also talked. we connect sooo much! i can't believe her and i weren't BEST friends in middle school 'cause she's sooo nice and cool and easy to talk to.  anyway, i crawled into bed around 3:30 and then woke up at like 4 on fri. WHOA NELLI!  the brazillian maid was home alone with me (and the baby), so she kinda went ona power trip and mae me brush my teeth but i guess it was a good idea 'cause i do have a dental appt. on the 10th. anway, when my mom got home i talked to her about buying my books for summer readin (I'M SOOO BEHIND!!) and so she didn't believe that i had to read that many books and i had to call katy and katy like said it so my mom was like "okay.. i believe KATY." hahaha.  me: maybe i should just lock myself in my room for two weeks and do nothing but read, drink water and brush my teeth. mom: that's a good idea me: HAHA! i HATE you! mom: what? that IS a good idea!  lol we were laughing a lot.  then mommie dearest took me out to pick up movies. not tooo much fun there.  when i got home my mom and i ordered my books of amazon and we got a whole bunch of other stuff tooo!! lol. funny funny.  then i just hung out, talked online to amber and nat and jack and cheyenne.  the day was pretty basic, nathalie called. another 3DB fight? weird.  then around 11, alex called and we got amy on too and the three of us talked until dawn~  well.. four o'clock. WE'RE SUCH DORKS!! alex and i were like, trying to figure out all the words that don't have vowels (a,e,i,o,u) it was soo great! and we had an enlightening conversation with amy about the pressures of being gay. it was a real HEART to HEART!  oh! i also got an oppurtunity to chat online with andrew violante! that kid is awesome, and if you think otherwise, you better watch your mouth.  hmm nothing else really happened~!! amy is the BEST though.  i woke up at like 2, wishing i was still asleep. i took a shower, and then did what i promised myself i would do that day.  something so important, i can't even begin to explain..  I READ GOSSIP GIRL FIVE!! it was awesome! two hours to read it from cover to cover, mostly because i forgot a lot of the stuff and i never really finished.. it was sooo good though!! i like it like that ;-) the end was so beautiful! everyone together in the park, everyone happy again.  but there are some questions i wanna ask.. what happened with aaron and the veggie chick from hawaii? are nate and blair gonna hook up again? is she gonna LOSE it to him? why did erik have to leave! is chuck gay or just PRETENDING? is this the last we'll see of G? who is the gossip girl? why was everyone sitting on red blankets, they are so passe.  oh well! there are still three books let~ and i know I can't wait to get my hands on them!  after reading that EXCELLENT book (you all need to go out and read them) i watched the butterfly effect on my computer and talked to people online.  daniel viviani isn't that bad! still, soquel should be MY school. i need a place to escape all that gay drama.  okay, so then it was around 9 and i was writing in my blog, putting the final touches on. there was thsi FUCKING LOUD BAND play WEIRD MUSIC and pretending they could FUCKING SING~?? i told my mom to call the police and say it sounded like someone was getting murdered by bikes with electric guitars. but she rolled her eyes and went to feed the baby.  my dad came home (i didn't know he was gone..) with a stanford sweatshirt, just for me! my mom said he drove all the way up there 'cause he felt bad about yelling at me and telling me to take the boys of my binder. haha, anyway, i liked that gift. although it wasn't the BRAND NEW CAR that KATY just got.  oh well. the butterfly effect was such a good movie! i ended up watching the wrong version, the director's cut! it was sooo sad!! it would make people want to commit suicide! ahh!! no wonder they didn't play it in theaters. the end made me cry~ ashton kutcher = sooo cute!  my grandparents came over, they noticed the insane music (who didn't). my grandma then bursted out into this hilarious story of how she sped down HW1 at 73 miles an hour ! she is extreme g-ma! it's crazy, but cool~ as she told the story, she'd occasionally take pauses to say "AND DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT!" to me. haha. when the cop pulled her over she was just like "oh? i was speeding? i didn't knowi could do that.." and the cop was like "you were going 73." and she was like "oh! 73! i thought it said 13!" so he let her off with just a warning (my grandma is sooo good at lying!!) and yeah! haha. she's so great. she taught me what a whore was when i was 9. she was drunk and talking about this lady and she's like "THEY CALL HER MADAME! YOU KNOW WHAT A MADAME IS? IT'S SOMEONE WHO HOUSES THE WHORES!" and i was just like "uh.." and she was like "YOU KNOW WHAT A WHORE IS? IT'S SOMEONE WHO SELLS HER BODY FOR MONEY!! LIKE YOUR AUNT!" hahah. i love my granny.  but anyway, they left.  i talked to kathleen on the phone for a little bit and we talked about colleges and the future and stuff.. it was pretty cool. i took a SECOND shower and finally, at 11 the deafening music was stopped, i think someone called the cops! i know i would've!  i talked online to amber, grabbed some ice cream and chilled. haha amber's aunt is SO cool. she should come up and hang out with us!! partay.  alex made his very own blog! check out the link!  it's called "god talk" haha from the phone conversations! that boy is so witty.  anyway, lily ASKED ME OUT! jk! but we had this countdown thing and then at midnight i posted my beautiful blog! oh yeah, and just so you know, i got an A in bio!!
