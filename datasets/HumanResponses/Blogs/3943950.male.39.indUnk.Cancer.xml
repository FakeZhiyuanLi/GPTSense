      No man is above the law.&nbsp; Verteran actor Robert Sorrells thinks he is.  A veteran character actor Robert Sorrells has been hit with a murder charge after witnesses told police he walked into a California bar and shot two patrons, killing one. The 74-year-old actor, who has appeared in such films as Death Of A Gunfighter and Gunfight In Abilene and popular TV western Gunsmoke, was arrested close to the Simi Valley bar - called The Regency Lounge - shortly after Saturday's shooting. He was booked for investigation of murder and attempted murder and held at the Ventura County Jail. Police Sergeant Paul Fitzgerald declined to say whether authorities knew of a motive, but said Sorrells had visited the bar before. A bartender says Sorrells had been at the bar until it closed on Friday night, returned Saturday morning looking for his credit card, then returned again in the afternoon and opened fire. Police say he shot Arthur De Long, 45, in the back and Edward Sanchez, 40, in the face and back - De Long was killed, while Sanchez, 40, was hospitalized in serious condition.   We pray for the speedy recovery of Mr. Sanchez and offer our condolences to the family of De Long.  The cosmic circle has struck again.&nbsp; How many shots did Sorrells fire?  Three.

      Julia Child, whose warbling, encouraging voice and able hands brought the intricacies of French cuisine to American home cooks through her television series and books, died in her sleep three days before what would have been her 92nd birthday.  "America has lost a true national treasure," Nicholas Latimer, director of publicity for Alfred A. Knopf publishing, said in a statement Friday. "She will be missed terribly."

      I must admit, even this reporter did not see this coming.   Funk singer Rick James, best known for the 1981 hit "Super Freak," died Friday, apparently of natural causes, police said. James, 56, died at 9:45 a.m. at a residence near Universal City, said Officer Esther Reyes, a Police Department spokeswoman.  "He died apparently of natural causes. We learned of his death after responding to a radio call," Reyes said.  And the third one is a very classic lady.  She will be remembered.  Actress Fay Wray, best known for her role in 1933 movie King Kong, died on Sunday. She was 96.She went on to be regularly cast as a heroine in silent movies, scoring her breakthrough in 1928's The Wedding March. In the early 1930s she made a number of horror movies, including Doctor X and The Vampire Bat, and became known as Hollywood's first "scream queen".  The cycle has been closed yet again.  Who will the next three be?  We will keep our eyes and ears open cause Death waits for no celebrity.

      The next batch of three has begun.

Who will the next two be?  Place your bets.
