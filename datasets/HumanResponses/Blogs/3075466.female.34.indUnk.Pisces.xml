      I wanted to say thank you to person from Florida that wrote to me and shared their thoughts on my blogger entry from yesterday. I also want to set the record straight and say that not every itch or symptom is a sexually transmitted disease.   Hopefully more doctors will begin to encourage people to seek proper STD testing. People are asking specific questions about sexually transmitted diseases on that online dermatology message board that I was telling you about yesterday. It is one thing to tell somebody that what they are describing doesn’t “sound like” an STD and it’s another thing to encourage people to seek proper testing so they can rule out the possibility of an STD.   What is the bottom line for me? Well, I believe that if you suspect that you might have an STD and you aren’t sure to the point that you would pay twenty dollars to ask the “expert.” Then that tells me that proper STD testing is in order.   Something that many people don’t realize is that STD screening is not what you think it is. For example: Did you know that type specific herpes testing is not always included in the routine STD screening process? That’s one of the reasons why people with genital herpes don’t always know that they have it. How are people ever going to be able to rule out herpes if they aren’t being properly tested?   Over on my web site ( urlLink yoshi2me.com ) there is a list of things that your doctor should be checking you for when you request to be screened for STDs. That list can be found on the home page.   Everybody’s experiences are there own and even the experts can not always see a sexually transmitted disease with their trained eyes. That is why many experts do insist on proper testing so they can rule out sexually transmitted diseases without any question. Each expert is entitled to do what they feel is best for their patient. It’s the patient’s responsibility to determine if they are receiving the best possible care.  Go ahead and do what is necessary to rule out sexually transmitted diseases and then you can safely say that sometimes an itch really is just an itch.

      I'm feeling a little frustrated today!  I stumbled on a site that charges people to ask medical questions. This community that I found is a dermatology message board where people can pay around twenty dollars to have a licensed “expert” share his years of insight and expertise. You know what the worst part is? People are asking questions related to sexually transmitted diseases and the “expert” doctor keeps insisting what each person is describing doesn’t “sound like” an STD. Isn’t that crazy?   I’m perplexed because I thought most doctors would know that you can not always “see” an STD. You can't tell if someone has a sexually transmitted disease (STD) by the way he or she looks or acts. STDs are very common—there are an estimated 15 million new cases each year in the U.S. And the American Social Health Association ( urlLink ASHA ) estimates that as many as one in four Americans will contract an STD at some point in their lives.  You also can't tell just "by looking." Many STDs show no symptoms. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( urlLink CDC ) says that most STDs remain undiagnosed—that means people with STDs often don't even know it! The only way to know for sure is to get tested.  How do these “experts” get away with telling people, “your symptoms don’t sound like STDs” or “Itching without a rash sounds like anxiety, not herpes.”  Isn't that crazy?   I'm done venting. Next time I ad to my blog spot I'll try not to be so frustrated. If you want to learn a little bit more about me you can find my biography over on  urlLink yoshi2me.com .

       urlLink Yoshi2me.com  is dedicated to providing you with information about genital herpes, cold sores (also known as oral herpes), herpes support groups, herpes social groups, herpes dating sites, herpes stories, hpv, and other sexually transmitted diseases. The  urlLink Social Support Networking Alliance  is a listing of herpes and hpv support and social groups across the United States and Around the World!   Did you know that 90% of people with genital herpes in the world today do not even know that they have it? Did you know that one out of every three people has hpv? If you are feeling a bit perplexed about your diagnosis and need some one on one time with somebody that knows what you are going through then we have some  urlLink H-Pals  standing by ready to connect with you through e-mail. If you are comfortable with a message board setting be sure and check out our online support group:  urlLink Picking Up the Pieces .   On our  urlLink Herpes and HPV Links  we have information for people that can not afford to pay for non-oncology medications. Be sure and check out the physician referral page that lists herpes competent health care providers in your area. Lots of stuff posted to help you with your research!   We have been getting tons of positive feedback from people regarding our  urlLink True Stories  and our  urlLink H-Awareness  Pages. We have plans to expand the information to include more stories, letters, articles, and news! It is our hope that you are able to find help in a supportive setting of your choice where you feel comfortable asking questions, learning, and realizing that having an std doesn't define who you are. If you have hsv or hpv please know that you are not alone!   Here is a list of sexually transmitted diseases that are optimally part of the STD screening process. We believe patients have a right to be screened for these infections when they request STD screening: gonorrhea and chlamydia (hopefully by the PCR method) HIV, RPR for syphilis, wet mount for yeast infections, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, herpes type-1 and herpes type-2 antibody testing using type specific serology, hepatitis B and C, and a gram stain from the urethra of men and the cervix of women. A physical exam should be done for warts, scabies, crabs, and molluscum. A pap smear for women who have not had one in the past year, and HPV DNA for women over 30 should be added to the pap test.   What was your reaction when you found out that herpes testing is not part of the STD screening process? What are you going to do about it? It's not enough to be angry and shocked that testing for herpes is not required routinely by all health care providers. It's time to actually DO SOMETHING about this and not just in April for STD Awareness Month or November for International Herpes Week. There are many different ways you can contribute to shattering the myths associated with herpes and setting the record straight with health care providers. You can contribute to this cause by reading the content on this site and offering feedback as well as your support.  Here is a list of sites you might want to check out . . .   1)  urlLink www.yoshi2me.com   2)  urlLink Picking Up the Pieces   3)  urlLink WebMD with Terri Warren   4)  urlLink The Updated Herpes Handbook   5)  urlLink Herpesonline.org   6)  urlLink www.ashastd.org

      My daughter decided to tell me that she was failing social studies tonight at dinner. THAT definitely got my blood boiling. She laughed so hard when she saw how upset I was and gleefully gave a shout out, "April Fool's Day Mom!"   Do you have any good April Fool's Day stories to share with me?  Be sure and send me an e-mail because I would love to hear about it...

      I have to say I'm really very proud of you and Amy for doing that news interview where you live. Seriously, how many people out there think that they are completely and utterly protected against any and all stds if they use a condom religiously? It also takes a lot of guts for you guys to go in front of a camera crew to be interviewed. It's the only way to put a dent in the negative stigma that is associated with herpes and hpv right? Well, some people wouldn't agree with me because they are too afraid to share their personal std information with the rest of the world and that's fine by me. And I really do understand that each person has to do what they think is right or what is comfortable for them. Anyhow - I just wanted to say what a  great job I think you are doing  urlLink Gayla ! Be sure the next time you talk to Amy you tell her that I said "Kudos" to her, too!!!   By the way - do your boys like to play Nintendo? My daughter and I just got done playing a mean game of Dr. Mario. Ironically it's the one where you have to kill off all the viruses. LOL I think the thing that keeps me going is that I like to pretend that I'm shooting at the herpes virus.   Oh by the way - if you have time tonight you might want to see if you can catch the online  urlLink CME Conference  that Terri Warren and Anna Wald are going to be leading. It should be interesting because they are going to be talking about Importance of Asymptomatic Shedding in the Prevention and Treatment of Genital Herpes.   Did you catch my blog entry from yesterday? I'm still pretty ticked off at what I read and haven't quite calmed down long enough to put my thoughts together to send this couple some facts about stds and people in general. I wouldn't be surprised if one of them has an std and they don't even realize it because they have never been properly tested.   Anyhow - I look forward to hearing from you  urlLink Gayla!!!    *hugs*

      I take serious issue with this:   "Little is heard today about the devastating health effects of homosexual promiscuity.  A panoply of diseases—not only the well-publicized AIDS but lesser-known scourges such as hepatitis A, BE, and CO; herpes; cytomegalovirus; gay bowel syndrome; amoebas; anal warts and anal cancer; shingle-loses; chlamydeous; gonorrhea; and syphilis—serve to truncate the average gay's life expectancy to roughly 50 years.  And these pestilences not only shorten lives but sharply erode quality of life."  The actual article itself is called " urlLink Homosexuality and Traditional Marriage ."   I plan on writing to Mr. Patterson and his wife Chris.  They say you can participate in the discussion going on about that particular article at the bottom of the page... hmmm. Maybe I will have to do that, too.   I feel another blog thought coming soon!

      Dear Grace, Lorraine, and Tim,  I know I could have written to you privately and said what I'm about to say... but instead I am choosing to thank you publicly for your stories and your photo.   I don't think you realize how much good you are doing  by putting your stories and your picture out there on the internet for people to read. Many people that have recently been diagnosed with herpes are trying desperately to put a face with a name or to just read how others are coping. This helps folks to see the bigger picture.   Many times people in the herpes community bitch and complain about the negative stigma associated with this std and then don't want to actually dig in to actually "do something" about it. I've read in places where people write to "keep your chin up" and "herpes doesn't define who you are" but then when it comes time to put their money where their mouth is... they are afraid of who might see their photo or what other people might think. It burns me to just think about it... I mean seriously... how are we going to combat the negative stigma if we are not willing to put ourselves on the line like you guys did?  From the bottom of my heart I want to THANK-YOU and if I had the two of you in front of me I'd have to give you a big fat kiss on the cheek and a HUG!!! I also want to thank ALL of the people that have contributed their stories and letters on the  urlLink true stories page  and the  urlLink herpes awareness pages...   For those that haven't had a chance to read their awesome stories here are the links:   urlLink Grace's Herpes Story    urlLink Lorraine's Herpes Story   Sincerely,  Angela S.   urlLink Omaha HELP Facilitator   Patient Advocate www.yoshi2me.com

      I'm on my way out the door for a couple of weeks to have some fun in the sun with my family. I can hardly wait to see the signs along the road that say - DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS!!! Oh and HOOK EM' HORNZ!!!  If you are in need of support there are a couple of places to find it ... got lots of H-Pals that will listen over on the STD Message Board called  urlLink Shut Up and Post ! There is lots and lots of help over on  urlLink Picking Up the Pieces , too. If you are looking for a support and social group in your area or need something to read for your research project you can always check out my  urlLink home page  where you will find hoards of links everywhere . . .   You are more than welcome to send me an email while I'm away. I will get back to it when I get home from my little vacation from the hot heat of the south.   In the meantime - don't sweat the small stuff and I'll be back just as soon as your spit hits the pavement! Happy 4th of July and God Bless America! My home sweet home . . .   {{{Hugs-to-All}}}

      It's a shame that mainstream media is not telling us the real truth about what is going on over there...  urlLink Michael Savage  is a bit extreme but he is providing an unbiased and truthful service of information which all Americans need to be informed of...  I had an opportunity to take a look at the  urlLink horrific photos  of what is being done to our Americans Citizens as well as the citizens of those countries who support the United States.   How can anyone question our involvement when barbaric acts like those shown on  urlLink Michael Savage's web site  continue to take place? These acts of terror are not new. They've been happening since the 70's and even before then...   Take a look at that  urlLink web site  if you dare! I challenge you to find out the real truth of what is going on because I promise you that you will NOT see it in the news detail for detail.   How can we stand back and undermine our government when our people are being attacked abroad as well as at home. If we stand back and do absolutely nothing it's only a matter of time before our nation is infiltrated by the type of people that are willing to carry out these barbaric acts on our own soil. AND we all know that's it's possible and that plans are probably underway as I type this note.   What happened to the closeness that all Americans felt after September 11th?  As time has passed we have drifted further away from that closeness and I feel it's a damn shame.   Everybody that I have talked with does not want to see the  urlLink photos  or the  urlLink video  for whatever reasons… I believe it’s a disservice to our fellow Americans who have lost their lives because after viewing these  urlLink photos  how could anybody say that we are wrong for wanting to protect the basic rights for all civilized people that wish to live in freedom in a civilized world?   Putting all political affiliations aside we should come together as one people with one voice to say that this is wrong!

      I stumbled on your  urlLink June 16th blog  tonight when I was surfing the internet. I must say that it takes a lot of guts and courage to talk about stds in a public way. I'm proud of you for thinking about it and getting it off your chest! Who knows, you might even make a positive difference in someones life because of that blog entry.   I've been wanting to ask you if your ex boyfriend was ever tested specifically for herpes and how exactly you were diagnosed with HPV? Maybe if you my entry you can write me back and let me know what's up!?   Did you know that 90% of people that have genital herpes don't even know that they have it?   Well, it's pretty late here in Omaha so I better sign off and hit the sack. Hope you have a very nice weekend.

      Michael Moore at a left wing fringe Rally in Boston sputtered, "George W. Bush has gone from being the compassionate conservative to the anti-conservative."   That would the the "Lie of the Day" over on  urlLink  Laura Ingraham's Site  .   What's the Truth?   He (Michael Moore) may be an expert cinematic flim-flam operations, but he's no expert in conservatism.   Side Note: Can you tell I'm a HUGE fan of Laura Ingraham? :-) There is absolutely  NO QUESTION  as to WHO I will be voting for this fall!!!   &nbsp;

       Laura's Weekly E-Blast   urlLink  http://www.LauraIngraham.com      July 30, 2004 &nbsp;    The Heat is On    (Boston, MA) From the hallways of the Fleet Center to the bar stools of Loch Ober, the Democrats here are giddy at the prospect that their long national nightmare--their time in the wilderness--is almost over. Boston is their spiritual home. They are doing their best to keep the primal anti-Bush outbursts to a minimum. They even managed to keep Howard Dean on a relatively short leash. (Remember, for Teresa Heinz Kerry, telling someone to "shove it" actually is good behavior!) The Dems have a token Southerner on the ticket - always a sign that they are serious about winning. They got prime-time speeches from their two favorite persons in the world, who gave us yet another chapter in the saga of Bill and Hill. Most of all, after waiting for almost four years, they finally have their chance to smash the hated George W. Bush and his crowd of Bible-thumping, tee totaling, gas-guzzling, gun-shooting, warmongering rednecks.   The Kerry campaign urged everyone who took to the podium to keep things positive, and anyone sufficiently prominent to speak in prime-time will carefully follow that script. But they can't muzzle everyone, and they can't script D-friendly events that occur outside of the convention. I had the misfortune of staying at the hotel where a group called "Take Back America" hosted a whoop-it-up Bush Bash honoring Michael Moore. A standing room-only crowd of Moore fanatics at the Royal Sonesta Hotel were entranced. He is their Elvis only his doesn't toss scarves into the audience, he tosses out verbal tongue lashings against all this familiar targetsthe Bush Administration, Fox News, corporate "war profiteers" (Halliburton, GE), and flag-lapel wearing "mainstream" journalists who are "afraid to ask real questions." Of course he also sung the praises of his favorite subject-himself. For him, Bush is the "obvious villain," while countries that defy the Administration, like Canada, are wonderful. "Canada is just like the America," he said,"but better." This is the "blame America" rhetoric that doesn't usually make the evening news. This is the verbal bile that makes the Kerry-Edwards sunshine team very nervous.   But you don't have to go to a Michael Moore speech to feel that the hatred -- raw, sheer, unmitigated hatred -- is palpable throughout the convention. You sense it in the bumper stickers that say "Re-Defeat Bush." You see it in the volcanic rage provoked by any reference to the current President. Most powerfully, you feel it in the raw, crackling energy that pervades the Fleet Center. Believe me, they're not this excited just because they want to raise taxes. This time it's personal.   In fact, it represents a sort of family feud. The divisions that roil American politics grow out of the fight that split FDR's New Deal Coalition. The last time the Democrats nominated a Massachusetts Senator for President - in 1960 - they were clearly the majority party, their ranks swelled by socially conservative Protestants and Catholics, many of whom had supported the party since the days of William Jennings Bryan. But the liberals chose to break up this coalition, to attack and ridicule the social conservatives on every possible occasion, to accuse them of racism, sexism, homophobia, and any other sins that liberals could imagine.   The social conservatives took the hint, and by 1980, the New Deal Coalition was at an end. The Democrats haven't put together a winning combination ever since. Oh, sure, they had - and have - the Clintons, but two people (no matter how talented) are no substitute for a majority of voters. And so even though President Clinton presided over eight years of prosperity and (a sort of) peace, he also saw his party lose the House, the Senate, and the White House. And despite all the editorials from the New York Times and the Washington Post, despite all the influence of Hollywood, despite near-uniform support from every single university in America, despite the flood of Bush-bashing tomes filling up the tables at your local bookstore, the Republicans still control our government. And so Democratic hatred grows.   Now we don't normally think of the Democrats as haters. After all, they don't hate the terrorists who bombed us on 9/11, and who threaten us around the world. They don't hate the French. They don't hate Fidel Castro. They don't hate pornographers, or doctors who abort unborn children, or murderers sentenced to die. They didn't even hate the Soviet Union - in fact, they were outraged when President Reagan dared to say that the USSR was "evil." Apparently, they've been saving all that hatred for George W. Bush and all those folks in the flyover states who keep pulling the Republican lever.   And that hatred - which gives this convention so much of its energy - means that for the next few months, John Kerry will be living in a pressure-cooker such as few American politicians have ever experienced. Since they ran off the social conservatives, the Democrats have lost too many elections. More and more, they talk as though they were prisoners trapped in a hostile land - a place where elections are stolen, where multinational corporations create wars, where Hollywood stars live in fear of Baptist ministers. The Democrats increasingly welcome nutty filmmakers like Michael Moore. and America-bashing celebrities like Susan Sarandon. They are ashamed of our history, of our prosperity, of our flag-waving patriotism, and of our insistence on remaining free and sovereign despite pressure from the EU and the UN. In short, the Democrats are simply no longer recognizable as the party that gave us FDR, and Harry Truman, and John F. Kennedy. Instead, they increasingly resemble an angry seminar of conspiracy-minded grad students.   That is the party that John Kerry is supposed to take to victory. If the Democrats lose again - if they have to watch those stupid, ill-bred Republicans celebrating on election night - they will turn on Kerry (and each other) with merciless rage. So the Democrats better enjoy this week. Because if Kerry doesn't get the bounce he needs from this convention--and early polls are showing he's not-- it could be the last happy week for the Democrats for a long, long time.

      Laura's Weekly E-Blast  July 17, 2004&nbsp;   Let Them Be Heard   It has been about six weeks since we buried President Reagan, but it seems like Republicans are on the verge of forgetting what he taught us.   GOP has assembled a list of prime-time speakers who might be equally as comfortable speaking in Boston at the Democratic National Convention. These "non-icky" Republicans include "moderate" pro-abortion rights Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, "maverick" Sen. John McCain, Republican-in-Name-Only New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and "socially liberal" Rudy Giuliani.   "Some big names, but where are the conservative voices?" I asked Bush/Cheney Campaign Manager Ken Mehlman. "The President and Vice-President are the two most important speakers at the convention," he replied. He didn't get to the heart of the matter, which is why the most conservative speaker at the convention other than the candidates themselves is a Democrat--Zell Miller.   One gets the distinct feeling that social conservatives are being treated as a quaint off-shoot of the GOP, rather than as its heart and soul.   It's time to remember who made the modern GOP what it is today.   Before Ronald Reagan brought social conservatives into the GOP (many of those were "Reagan Democrats" who parted ways with the Democrats on issues like abortion, pornography, and welfare spending), it was a minority party that had been beaten consistently by the Democrats for almost half a century. Social conservatives have been and remain the most loyal supporters of Pres. Bush and the rest of the GOP, even when the GOP's policies have not always been in their economic interest. (Can you say "illegal immigration"?) They make up the party's all-important base. With only about 6 percent of the votes up for grabs in this election, turnout will be more crucial than ever (for both parties).   Without the conservative vote, Pres. Bush would struggle to carry a single state -- much less win the 270 electoral votes he needs for the White House.   Today social conservatives are deeply concerned about the direction of the country on a host of cultural issues. They want more than to hear from the President a few times a year in a weekly radio address. They need to feel like their views are being respected, not like their votes are taken for granted. They resent the unbridled power of the judiciary. They feel like their bedrock values are under constant assault by a culture that devalues life and rewards depravity.  Under these circumstances, it is foolish beyond words for the GOP only to highlight speakers who openly and actively disagree with its members on key issues. Showing off your "big tent" philosophy is all well and good. But let's not forget that the tent was built by social conservatives who were willing to do the hard work to rescue the GOP from the country club.   A good late-addition to the Republican National Convention slate of speakers would be Sen. Rick Santorum. He's third-highest ranking Senate Republican, in his mid-40s he's the youngest member of the GOP leadership. He's articulate, passionate, gutsy, and smart. He won state-wide office in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania four times (in 1990, at the age of 32, he won a Congressional seat), then won his Senate seat in the great Republican Revolution of 1994.   Most recently he was the GOP's point man on the gay marriage issue. He didn't flinch when Senators Ted Kennedy and Frank Lautenberg called defenders of traditional marriage "bigoted" and "mean-spirited." He spoke eloquently about how this issue is being forced by imperialist judges, Santorum said, "in utter disregard of our traditions and beliefs."   Luring social conservatives away from the Democratic Party--among them southern Baptists, and northern Catholics--is one of the most important political shifts of the past generation. Republicans succeeded in making Democrats the minority party. Republicans should be proud of that accomplishment--proud enough to showcase prominent conservative thinkers on its convention roster.   By keeping the conservatives under wraps, the GOP is handing the media another club to use against the President. I can already hear Judy Woodfruff on CNN: "Up next, we'll hear from John McCain. Senator McCain has been sharply critical of the President on everything from gun rights to health care reform, not to mention the the GOP's deeply divisive and failed effort to amend the Constitution."   In the 1980s, political experts predicted that President Reagan would pay a steep political price for being pro-life, for even mentioning the "sanctity of life." Reagan ignored the high-priced consultants and stuck with what he knew to be true. He was reelected in a landslide. President Bush should ignore the same experts who are telling him to keep the conservatives locked in the basement. Let them be heard.

      Hey  urlLink  Gayla  ,  &nbsp;  Thanks for telling me about my 469th ranking position! That bit of news made my day BIG TIME. How hard did the Buffoonz think it would be to put a  urlLink  button   up on a page and direct traffic? Who knows… maybe that web search tool and ranking site felt that it was more important to  urlLink  HELP   people first? I’ll never understand those formulas. Something tells me I should have taken more computer classes in college. lol  &nbsp;  As for the extra curricular activities… lol&nbsp; THAT doesn’t surprise me a bit! You would think the Buffoon would have learned by now what happens when you participate in too many extra curricular activities.  &nbsp;  *Hugsz*  &nbsp; P.S. How do you like my new  urlLink  face lift  ?

      I was listening to the  urlLink Laura Ingraham Show  on my computer this morning when a news breaking announcement came through about Martha Stewart's Sentencing. She has to do five months in a federal prison, five months home probation and two years of mainstream&nbsp;probation.

      On July 15th, the Senate is expected to vote on passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA), which would define marriage in the United States as a union between a man and a woman. This amendment is being brought before the Senate because of a trend in some states which prohibit same-sex unions (such as Nebraska) will have their legislation struck down. In order for states like Nebraska to have its legislation retained it must be blostered at the constitutional level.   Currently, both of Nebraska's Senators have stated their opposition to FMA. It is critically important for every person to contact Senators Hagel and Nelson at their offices to let them know how you would like them to vote on this issue.   The passage of this amendment could potentially change how we are allowed to worship in church. Please take the time to read  urlLink the article  from the World Herald written by Kathleen Parker of the Orlando Sentinel.  urlLink The article  has information and examples of how this amendment could affect the church.  Information on how to contact our Senators in Nebraska:   Senator Church Hagel Omaha (402) 758-8981 Lincoln (402) 476-1400 Scottsbluff (308) 632-6032 Kearney (308) 236-7602 or 236-7501  Mailing Address:  Senator Church Hagel 254 Russell Senate Office Bldg. #248 Washington, DC 20510  E-mail  urlLink Chuck Hagel   Senator Ben Nelson Omaha (402) 391-3411 Lincoln (402) 441-4600 Chadron (308) 430-0587 Scottsbluff (308) 631-7614  Mailing Address:  Senator Ben Nelson 720 Hart Senate Office Bldg.
