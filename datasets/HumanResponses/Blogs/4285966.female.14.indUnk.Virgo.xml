      OMG me and Nica just made french toast and they were so frickin filling I am going to barf. Ew, we cracked an egg open and found a still-born and it was kinda nasty...Today I have to go to work and stay there until 9 PM w/Ellen...It is going to suck the left sooooo hard!LAst nite we slept out on the trampoline (me nica and loren). We got all this gross dew  shyt stuff on us and we were almost killed by a mad druggie teenager that was dropped off next to her house. We were scared shytless, it was sooo funny! Lmao   I feel really bad because I havent hung out with the summer gal pals in foreverness ( also Danny L.). But I always feel really jealous when I see Tay, Hannah, chloe, cokes, and ppl. chilling because I have to work my ass off to make a dime. I mean, I love the money and all, but the summer is just wasting away and I havent spent any time with people that I want to hang with. And Maggie left and I am reallllly sad. I wam going to send her a converse shoebox filled with cool stuff when I get the chance.   I MISS BEN SOOOO MUCH! I know I didnt hang out with him THAT much, But i seriously fell pretty hard for that kid in the few days that I knew him. And I knew I was just his summer MV fling, but I really liked him and I hope that I get to visit him in england. It will probably NEVER happen tho, seeing as how  Ive never even been off the east coast. Pretty sad, huh? BUt him and james were like, just so awesome, like, they were pretty cool kidlets. And ben was perfect and so easy to talk to (sorta, I wasnt actually being my whole self because I liked him so much that I was afraid of what he would think... Dude, who else admits that but ME!?) Lol so yeah some day our paths will cross and we shall meet again, fair Ben. LOL ( I am SUUUUCCCHHH a cornball)   Best friends.... Its really scary but I am drifting soooo far from Jaime and Bridget. I dont even talk to them ne more. I call them sumtimes but they NEVER call me. I mean, emily will always be there for me because she already has, but its not the same as tricircle. we could talk about ne thing and say ne thing and we NEVER fought and always get along. Ya know how usually, when theres a group of 3 friends, one usually gets left out and has to go and cry to her mommy? yeah well its not like that for us... we just all always got along, it was scary. And I was like OH YEAH HIGH SCHOOL, LIKE THATS GONA BREAK US APRT RITE? well i  think it is. Bridget is totally going along with all of the fashions now. Fashion is my life, but when u just go along withe the trend, u get funked. And so this fall the look has gone from grunge to prep. It even said so in the frickin BOSTON HERALD! Gayness.... I guess its time for me to lean on my surfer chic look for a while... LETS GO EM!lol but yeah and jaime is just being a prude and sorta snobbish. I still love her to death, but shes really immature sumtimes and its hard to hang with her AND be with other peopel that I love. Its kind of embarresing to have sum one say and do stuff that is irrelevent to the moment and kind of makes it awakward. I LOVE JAIME THO!  Ok so its UBER sad that Andrew is leaving for Loomis.  HE used to just be one of the WT kids, but he is so much much more and its so hot that hes so independant. and we have sooo much in common. For a second I thought that I had a crush on him, but then I was like, no no hes just REALLY COOL. Maybe I do have a crush....   :  )  he he he I dunnoo.... lol but yeah and his bday is sep 21..> VIRGO the VIRGIN ! WOO WOO! lol represent. and we like the same kind of music-ish. and I think we may  have some of the same views as me (politically). I dont really like to follow politics, but sure.... so yeah, and mike mok gave him a ride from alleys to the airport and it was pretty funny that he knew andrew. ( I gave mike a hug at the fair when I saw him with nancy and then andrew was like, WAIT I KNOW U) . SO bottom line is... ANDREW L. is one cool cat.  Ha at the fair last nite we saw mike and peter and the little one with blonde hair. also there was some other random kid there that i ( we) didnt know. And peter is from cali.... yeah OMG I met this kid at work and his name is leaf and he is 21 and he goes to school in santa cruz and he surfs... cool BEANS! man... mikes boxers ish  Well I g2g and fold blankets w/ N.... xoxo
