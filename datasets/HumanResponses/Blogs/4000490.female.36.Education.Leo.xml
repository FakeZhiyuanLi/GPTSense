      I had a little time to take a look at other's blogs. I'm not miserable. I'm not perfect. I'm not in search of the perfect mate. I am nowhere near as profound as my fellow bloggers. Am I cut out for blogs?

      This is my recently adopted motto. It used to be "will it hurt or cost money?" But I am a strong believer that EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. I am grateful for all the experiences I've had in my life, but I've never felt better about myself than I do now that I'm back in school. Buying a computer led to my move to Wooster. Getting layed off led to my job and enrollment in college. Yay for fate!

      Among all else going on in the world today, my mom gets to celebrate accomplishing another year of life.   Birthdays are great. They come no matter what. No matter if you want them or not. No Matter if you are ready or not.&nbsp; Each year there they are.   I happen to like birthdays even though they make me older. I do complain some before they come so I'll get extra presents. That never works, but someday hopefully it will.  Happy Birthday to anyone reading this that celebrates their birthday.

      Ok, so Sister Virginia had something. Not that it was right to humiliate a 5th grader in front of her classmates, but taking a strict stand on tardiness is important. Had she only tried a little harder, I might not have been branded with "the late one". I might not have been nominated for "least punctual" in high school, and I probably wouldn't be told by my family that functions start a half hour earlier than they actually do so that I'll be on time. But, most importantly, I wouldn't come in last when it comes to experiencing the funny things out there. Why was I the last to see the cartoon on jibjab? "This land" is the funniest thing I've seen in a LONG time, and everyone knew it before me!! kuddos to the brothers that made me laugh this morning (boy if I had a nickel for everytime I said that, I'd...well, I'd have a nickel).

      The summer goes WAY to fast. I know most people would agree. (Not my daughter though..or my husband, but most people) I am definately one that thinks we should have 6 months of summer, three months of fall then right into 3 months of spring. The ONLY thing I look forward to at the end of summer is football. My nephews fill my fix for the summer months, I'm sooooo sooooo glad they enjoy playing. Then when they are done for the season, my Steelers (yes, MY Steelers) are in full swing. I still don't like the idea that the corn mazes are open already. My tan lines are no where near visible enough!!
