      Hey its me again your favorite blogger. Well it's still thurday 3 june and 21.04 GMT. I am watching T.V with the one person i want to spend the rest of my life. I was watching a webcast on bbc online while my Lady was watching Emmerdale, Corrie and EastEnders. Well this is what she watches everyday after work. She is so beautiful but truly, i don't trust her. Not like i'm feeling unsecure in somewhat, but when in my past i was labelled as a playboy, i believe in what goes around comes around. Sky is getting darker now over Brixton south London. I am planning on leaving this place as soon as possible because i don't feel like my Lady and son are in a safe neighbourghood. Anyway, right now we are watching Beetlegues or whatever you spell it. This is another day in as i lost my credit card and bank card and no cash on me (but rich in the bank). I am still doing my website i will post the link once eady so keep on reading for now Peace. God Bless You All

      Today is thursday the 3rd of june and the time is 14.36 GMT. I was working all morning on a new website for my own business. I stopped because today I'm not feeling that well. I'm setting up an IT Firm in London but it is not as easy as people thinks. Truly London is a big (the biggest in Europe) but to enter the self employed market you have to be ready to take a trip to hell and back. I woke up around 14 hours GMT to try to take medication and then rememebrs all my other problem. About a year ago, my mother has lost it and hit my fiancee, leaving scars and other marks on her chest. Now, my mum is trying to get back to her like before when all that drama wasn't there. she is actually trying a bit hard by buying my fiancee clothes and the latest she ordered an 18ct gold chain. I know she want my girlfriend to accept her back as her mother-in-law but hey it's not that easy. Yesterday, I had an argument with my girlfriend (i Luv her 2 death)because i told her of the surprise my mum was getting her and she just ignored me and spoke about something so i tried to tell about what my mum she bought for us and she did the same thing again. So i dropped her home after work and went out to take some fresh air. On my way back we had a little "row" other the same thing. Then she told me the only way she will forgive my mum is if my mum sits down with to appologies personally. That's fairly simple well, as i know my mum something she can't do is say sorry to someone. Her ego is bigger than the "Bloody" world. So this morning i called up my older sister to helping me bring to subject to my mum so we can leave it behind us all. My sister was absent and called me back when she got my message but it seems she had her own problem with my mum. My sister is a very clever and independent nursing student(she will be graduated in October), very loving and very kind. Her bursary has been stopped and she doesn't have any money coming in until next  month. So she told me how my mum( she has more than 10k cash in bank)won't lend her money and we all know my sister will pay it back. after she told me hers, i told her aboutmy situation and asked her if she can help me bring that to my mum concerns, but she, knowing my mum told me exactly what i told you early on. So i told her to call my mum and ask her for some money and let her know she will pay back and tell my mum her problem. But for now the first problem which is my mum and my fiancee to sit down and told i guess has hit a brick wall for the moment. If anybody outhere has any suggestion please let me know thanx.
