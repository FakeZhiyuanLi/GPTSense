      PAUNANG SALITA HELLO!!! Halina at makisama sa mga adbentyurs ni Hermes at Jackie. Ang aking 2 alaga...punong-puno ng buhay at aksyon...na minsan ay may halong S.T. flick. ETO...   DA ADBENTYURS OF HERMES AND JACKIE  ADBENTYUR #1 Uunahin ko yung mas matanda...si JACKIE Ipinanganak sha noong March 14, 1997. Nung dumating sha sa bahay namin...napaka-amo at mahiyain nya. Palaging nakabuntot sa akin...di ko sha mashado napaglalakad sa bahay nuong una dahil...meron na rin kaming isa pang dalmatian sa bahay...si SLY! Si Sly ay hindi purong dalmatian...80% lang sha...isa sa mga characteristics ng dalamatian ay ang pagiging territorial nito. Kaya nung dumating si Jackie sa bahay...nagkaroon agad ng mortal na kaaway. Habang lumalaki si Jackie...unti-unti naman itong nagkakasungay (hehehe). Siya ang nagle-lead sa iba pa naming aso (may 2 pa nun...si Sly(dalmatian) at Hubbs(terrier))para magkalat at mag-ingay sa bahay. May isang pagkakataon na binagsak ni Jackie yung salamin ng dining table namin.BASAG ANG SALAMIN!!! Hirap na hirap akong tanggalin sha dun...mabuti na lang at konting galos lang ang nakuha nya. Siguro kung kaya nya lang ibagsak ang piano matagal na nyang ginawa. Sa bahay...si Jackie at Sly ang umuubos ng betadine kesa sa aming pamilya. Lagi silang masaya sa garden...binabasag ang mga paso, nagbubungkal ng lupa...atbp. Maraming kuwento ng kakulitan itong si Jackie...tsaka ko na ibabahagi sa inyo! :D  Si Jackie ay isa sa mga pinaka-mabait naming aso...mabait na makulit. At eto ang isa pang natatangi nyang kakayahan...galit sha sa panget...no offense ha...pero minsan kumatok sa aming pintuan ayung isa naming kapitbahay na madaming inaaway...biglang tumahol si Jackie nang pagkalakas-lakas...at mistulang lalapain na iyong ale. Iyong aling iyon na maraming kaaway...at talagang masama ang ugali lang ang kinahulan ni Jackie ng ganung katindi.  Si Jackie rin ang aso naming marunong umarte...heto ang kanyang picture     sinasadya nyang pagandahin ang tenga nya ng mga panahong kinuhaan ko sha...kasi tangan ko sa kaliwa kong kamay ay isang biscuit. Itong aso kong ito...lahat kinakain...kahit papel kakainin nya...ganon kalaki ang tiwala nya sa akin.  itutuloy...    NOTE: THIS WAS ELOISE'S ORIGINAL POST

      I just want to remember this day.Earlier my aunt living in Nevada gave me a call. I barely recognized her voice because of her hard sobbing, and I instantly knew what was wrong.You see yesterday evening when she called me up, she's told me that right at that moment, her baby - Raider, a 7 year old black labrador - will go under the knife and that she and her husband were frantic, worried sick. She's told me that there were bumps over Raider's body. I knew it didn't looked good and my aunt who is a nurse, seemed to refuse to face the possibility that her baby could die...but 'mothers' are like that, aren't they? But when the vet cut Raider open, instantly they knew that the cancer has spread all over his body and there's just no hope. So immediately they told my aunt and uncle and asked them if they would want them to close him up, wake him up so that they can say goodbye. They were also told that Raider was really suffering. They chose to let him rest in peace. He was cremated and today his remain will be delivered to my aunt.  I just want to remember this day when I wasn't able to console my aunt.....The day when I realized, that someday, I will experience the same thing when my babies decide to 'go away', for good.Raider, rest in peace....someday mom and dad will be just fine.

      adbentyur #2   Meet Hermes (her-mee), born:june 7,2001 breed:shih tzu color: tri-color gender: female    Bigay lang sa akin si Hermes ng isa sa mga students ko. Medyo di na sha naa-alagaan dahil sobrang busy na nung bata (kyna)...nagkasakit na si Hermes. She had Heartworm and was confined at The Animal House vet for 3 weeks. Nung umuwi na sha...nakapag-decide na ang parents ni Kyna to give up Hermes. At shempre....sa aken nila ito ibinigay (fave teacher nya akowe!)Habang inia-abot sa akin si hermes ito ang last words ni Kyna at Aissa (magkapatid) Teacher Eloise...she'll be your dakilang alalay". Nung inuwi ko si Hermes sa bahay namin...ang payat-payat nya at kalbo...hindi sha mukhang aso...mukha shang pusa. Still...hit na hit si Hermes sa bahay at di lang dun pati na ren sa aking mga kaibigan. Totoo yung sinabi nilang "dakilang alalay" si Hermes kasi kahet saan ako pumunta...sunod den sha ng sunod. Inakyat ko sha sa taas sa kwarto namen para laruin. Dun muna sha para di mashado magselos si Jackie...bumaba akong sandali para ihanda yung kanyang pagkain...ng biglang...blag...blag...blag..."Si Hermes nahulog sa Hagdan!" sigaw ni Nanay. Ay sus..sa sobrang pagiging "pala-sunod" nagpatihulog sa hagdan si Hermes to be with me.  Awww...ain't she the sweetest?    posted by: ELOISE

I took the liberty in logging onto my local animal shelter's website and goshiez, the pets up for adoption are soooooooooo cute!! If I could only have them all, I'd definitely go for em. The dogs that look like mops, the ones that look like brooms...the ones that look like old men...hehehe. Well, theyre all cute.

       i first met him  a little more than three years ago, when i was volunteering at the local dog shelter. we found him abandoned at his original owner's home. the owner left him, though she really didn't want to -- she had to go to heaven. so there he was: barely three months old, very frightened, and very alone. he didn't know we were there to help him, and so he was a difficult little ball of fur to handle.   i came into the room and our eyes met, neither of us realizing that at that moment, both our lives were going to change forever . as the days passed, he eventually warmed up to me -- he possessed all of the usual shar pei attributes, including being aloof and even suspicious of strangers. i named him noah, because of his burly disposition and the wrinkles on his face, he reminded me of an old man. he won my heart completely and i decided to be the one to give him his new permanent home. he decided to give my life some meaning.  i live alone, noah gives me reason to look forward to coming home every day. he is an intelligent dog, and typical to most shar peis,  he acts with great dignity  and is completely loyal to me. he trusts me implicitly. he makes me feel needed, like i'm a fine person and that i'm safe. definitely, safe, for he is very territorial and though he has never bitten anyone, he lets guests know he doesn't like their presence in his turf. shar peis are definitely not for the first-time dog owners, but i've had lots of experience with dogs in the shelter. i was very lucky that i had the chance to get to know such a magnificent creature. without noah, i'd have been lost long ago.  sadly, noah's plight is not at all uncommon.  there are millions of dogs in shelters , waiting for someone to take them home and give them all the love and affection that they're more than willing to return. in england alone, every citizen must have 14 dogs each to give all the dogs there a home. if you're thinking of having a dog, please visit the shelter in your area. or at the very least, research about the breed you are thinking of buying, so that you will know what to expect. having a dog is an enormous, long term responsibility, one that we should all think of very thouroughly before acting on. the rewards, however, would be beyond your wildest dreams.

      I have always loved animals; especially DOGS. Growing up, I had all sorts of pets; from Birds, Rabbits, Fishes to Dogs. Each were special in their own way. What I appreciated most from these animals is their ability to sense our feelings. They know when you're down, when you're happy...they know YOU.  Five years ago, when my brother went back to the Philippines to continue his education; we got a Dog...just to keep him company. A Dog named Boo. She was a sweet little thing, a sweet and beautiful Mongrel. As time went by, we all got attached to the Dog. Although the rest of my family and I were living overseas, each and everytime we'd go back, she was always there. She was a part of our family. As she grew, her primitive instincts developed and she became one of the most feared dogs in our neighbourhood. She protected our home. She protected us.  Apart from being the protector that she was; she was also a very good mother to her puppies. It was such a sweet sight whenever we'd give her little goodies then she'd call her babies one by one; feeding the youngest first. She had always put her kids first. Just like we humans do. She also offered us lil gifts at times. She once caught a fish and brought it to my dad. She also caught a bird and did the same thing. Everybody loved her.  Two Years Ago, we received a Phone Call from my Cousin. He lived with my brother and he too looked after Boo. He told us that the 15 year old son of our neighbour had shot our Boo in the heart - IN OUR FRONTYARD.  She was 3 months pregnant...and she was shot right in the heart...right in the heart. She laid there, in our resthouse and bled to death. My Cousin phoned by brother shortly after and he rushed home.  My whole family was outraged. Everyone cried. We loved that dog so much. People say that we are foolish to have such a strong attachment to just an ANIMAL. She wasn't just an ANIMAL to us; she was our FAMILY. Til this day, I still find it hard to talk about the incident. Writing this has made tears well up in my eyes. It still hurts. I still miss my Dog. Sometimes its hard to understand the things people do. Animals are still living beings...they breathe, they feel, they love just as we do.  My family has tried to take the case to court. However, since it is the Philippines, nothing much has been accomplished because according to them, it was just an ANIMAL. Since the incident occured, I havent returned to the Philippines. I do not know if I could control myself under the circumstances of seeing that family and remembering what they did to my Dog. It still hurts and I still miss her.

       A new added attraction on our mini zoo... :D she's a 3 monts old monkey and we call her Chi-chi.  At first medyo takot pa sya sa tao. Medyo aloof.. and mabaho. hehehe!! Ano nga ba naman ang maaasahan mo sa pet shop to take care of this little soul.. siguro matagal na siyang walang ligo. Medyo manipis ang hair nya and payat talaga. Kawawa namang nilalang. Nabulunan pa nga nung first time naming pinakain ng saging... and we thought fruits lang ang puede nyang kainin.  As week pass, medyo nakakarelate na din siya sa environment nya. Nililiguan namin siya thrice a week and she slept with my sister. Of course, medyo takot kami kasi baka may sakit, may ebola, may aids, lahat-lahat na but then unresistable talaga ang charm ng little chi-chi na to sa amin.  Oh my.. kumakain din pala ng kanin ang unggoy. Minsan kasabay namin siyang kumain.. OO nga.. nang-aagaw sila ng pagkain minsan. hehehe! may pagkamaldita lang tong bata na to kasi pag nandyan na nanay nya (my sister).. ayaw ng sumama sa kin. Whenever her mom's at school, she's here with me at my shop... and she always fall asleep in my arms na parang baby talaga. As we know, maingay dito sa shop.. pag inaantok na ang bata at may biglang malakas na tunog.. sumisigaw siya... minsan bumubulong.. siguro sa loob-loob nya  "ano ba naman tong lugar na to.. ang dilim dilim pero ang ingay"  or kaya  "ano ba kayo! inaantok ako! wag kayong maingay!"  hahaha!!    Ah.. may isang beses lang pala siyang sumama sa kin na nasa tabi lang nya yung sister ko.. wala pang isang minute.. inihian ako. Bad Chi-chi! Even Bullit have an experience on her peeing habit... Ganon siguro sila, parang sinasabi na.. "this is my property" chuvabelles. :)  Her latest improvement.. Playful. At first, takot siya sa 3 aso namin... even with my little Schat. Minsan kasi tinatahulan or kinakagat siya (kagat na lambing) nung mga babies ko but not now.. palaban na din ang matsing. Not really palaban pero kaya na nyang makipagsabayan. One morning, nasa lapag lang siya at di nilalapitan ng mga aso.. Di siya pinapansin. Nilapitan si Achilles (which is so big na..) at kinurot near his pwet. Syempre, ang initial reaction ng aso.. kinahulan tapos kinakagat-kagat siya.. She also do that.. nakikagat din ang loka.. Nakita ni Schat na nilalaro ni Achilles si Chi-chi.. lumapit ang dalaga ko (si schat).. ang nakiharot na din. Contented ang 2 (Schat and achilles) kasi nakaganti and they left her. Ay naku.. she didn't even cry kahit pinagtulungan nung dalawa. Pero Chi-chi is not contented, nilapitan ang Schat at siya naman ang kinurot. Tawa na lang kami ng tawa sa kalokohan nya. hehehe! Don lang sa isang aso (na adult na talaga) siya di makaporma kasi baka iwasiwas siya non. Hahaha!  Ok na yung itsura nya ngayon... Makapal na yung balahibo nya, may buhok na unlike before na nakakalbo siya.. and syempre.. tumaba na din. :)  Sabi ko sa sister ko, ituring nya yan parang tao.. dapat laging yakapin, alagaan (as what Ate Thess told me) pero parang sobra ata tong kapatid ko kasi kahit pagtulog at pagkain.. magkasama na sila. Hehehe!    I really wanted to post a picture of my sister and chi... pero di maupload dito eh.. can somebody help me.         posted by: JOANNE

                       I thought of posting this photo of Danielle when one day I saw her, just her head, peeking outside when she heard the noises I was making in the kitchen. Curious as she's always been and with half eyes closed, there she was trying to find out what mama's been up to.        taken yesterday ( july 31st )...this was Gizmo sleeping on top of his shirt. It's a known fact that ferrets sleep in the dark but since we've been having warm weather the past days, the light didn't seemed to bother him ( Jacob and Danielle were sleeping under their other shirt )        Also taken yesterday, their dad and I decided to buy them a piano hoping to find out if we have a  Mozart  in the family ( that's not all together true, we got jealous because the other day, we saw a piano-playing-ferret on tv so we thought.. perhaps our kids can do better. )  Jacob  played about  3 notes  out of curiosity. Papa and mama actually clapped their hands when they heard what  Jacob  has accomplished!          Unfortunately the piano didn't interest them at all, all they wanted to do was to destroy it.  KIDS do the darnest thing!!
