       "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." —President George W. Bush, at the signing of the $417 billion defense-spending bill      What a moron!

      I'm just fixing this place all up, and being totally computer illiterate is not helping me!!!  If anyone can help me out, just e-mail me please!  I still have to get all my favorite links up on the side.  Well, I hope people watched the Daily Show on Monday, Aug 9th, because Bill Clinton was on and he was wonderful.  I loved it when he said that Democrats win when people think, it's so true.  He also talked about that horrible Conservative group attacking Kerry's Vietnam Record and was saying how it's important to fight back.   I'm hoping Kerry hears that, sometimes he seems a little too slow to respond to things, although maybe that's just relative to Clinton.  Anyhow, they can't claim that that stupid book, Unfit For Command, isn't politically motivated,  especially   after those comments of the co-author, Jerome Corsi.  Here's a sample of some of Corsi's comments, courtesy  of  urlLink http://mediamatters.org  (a very cool site, by the way!)     • Corsi on Islam: "a worthless, dangerous Satanic religion"   • Corsi on Catholicism: "Boy buggering in both Islam and Catholicism is okay with the Pope as long as it isn't reported by the liberal press"   • Corsi on Muslims: "RAGHEADS are Boy-Bumpers as clearly as they are Women-Haters -- it all goes together"   • Corsi on "John F*ing Commie Kerry": "After he married TerRAHsa, didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judiasm? He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish. What religion is John Kerry?"   • Corsi on Senator "FAT HOG" Clinton: "Anybody ask why HELLary couldn't keep BJ Bill satisfied? Not lesbo or anything, is she?      Judging from that, I'd say the book and ads  are  politically motivated, and Corsi is a sick bigot!  The Drudge Report really needs to stop...well, existing, but specifically to stop creating all this hype about these crackpots.    I got an e-mail from moveon.org, and they have 17 ads w/ republicans who are voting for kerry because he is the right choice, and you can rate them to help them to decide what ones they should air during the RNC!  urlLink http://www.moveonpac.org/morris/index.html?id=3242-3910267-_XoRuHt71DaLe6E4Fu4MsA&amp;previous_ad_id=2   Every week Newsweek has a map showing the US and what is going on in the most recent polls in swing states.  From the 2 last ones, Nevada, Arizona, West Virginia, and North Carolina all went from slightly Republican to swing states!  Also, Pennsylvania went from swing to slightly democrat, and kerry went from trailing bush to leading in Florida! urlLink http://www.moveonpac.org/morris/index.html?id=3242-3910267-_XoRuHt71DaLe6E4Fu4MsA&amp;previous_ad_id=2
