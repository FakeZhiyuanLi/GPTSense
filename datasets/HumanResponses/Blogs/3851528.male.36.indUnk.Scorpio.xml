      This is my first blog entry ever.  I'm often a Johnny-Come-Lately. In fact I've considered having a "blog" of my own for some time, yet I never felt inspired to do so until now... and Inspiration is the name of the game. The word of the day. So before I get into any other reasons for having a blog (there are several, with one predominant), let me say, my inspiration arrived from TNT--the cable-television channel. An episode of  The X-Files  just finished, penned by William Gibson; I remembered the episode from its first run (being that  The X-Files  is now all reruns, unfortunately), but it prompted me to get on the computer and do a search for William Gibson. I'm already familiar with his work but wondered what else he had done. And the first of the search results yielded a 'blog' entry by... you guessed it... William Gibson. That, among other factors of the moment... the heat and humidity of this July summer night, and the darkness, and yes I know those sound like odd compelling factors, but for me they are compelling nonetheless... drove me to adopt a blog, on this service, the same used by William Gibson.  I think I am in good company.  So what are these reasons for finally creating a blog?  To tackle the corollaries first:  I need a place to share my thoughts. My thoughts are me; hence, to share myself. I don't claim that it makes me an interesting person, yet others have expressed interest. I also would like a place to put odd little bits of writing. I am a writer, yet passages come and go for me which do not qualify for placement anywhere else, or in published print elsewhere. A blog seems a good place. And, what is a blog, but a journal? I have been doing journal entries since I was a boy. It seems only fitting to continue that tradition here, where they at least have the worth of potential viewing by others, instead of wasting space in notebooks, never seen by eyes other than my own. I have many thoughts to share.  But that main, 'predominant' reason for having a weblog... That, I will cover in my next entry. Incidentally, the movie  Poltergeist II: The Other Side  is playing at this moment, now, on the TV in the room behind me (having followed that Gibson ep of  The X-Files )... and as will be revealed, it has everything to do with that main predominant reason.

       First go to this link and read:   urlLink  http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/yearoftheslave.html     This is what I've been saying for years. It's high time to do something about this.  Quit letting yourself be enslaved to a bunch of fat old men who don't care about you. Quit electing the same people to screw up your lives. Kerry or Bush; it doesn't matter--both are members of "Skull & Bones", a secretive Yale University cult with Satanic rituals; both are disposed to living high on your hard-earned dollars and driving the proud United States of America into ruin. Don't let them do it anymore!  DO something about it. Make a change. Elect a third party. Or start a revolution.  We have the numbers.  America is not supposed to be a police state.  Wars don't help us.  Go to Washington, and remind them that the power over this country is NOT THEIRS... it belongs to US. We, the people.
