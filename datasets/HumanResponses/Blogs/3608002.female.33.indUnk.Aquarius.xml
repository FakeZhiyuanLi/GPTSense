       2 Kids sleeping, another visiting a friend, I can be contemplative.  Something feels 'off' today with dh...he is distant, maybe just b/c he is studying, I dunno.  It is a hot one today and I am getting next to nothing accomplished. Sometimes I think this computer is here to rob me of my time...very very sneaky computer.  There are dishes and unmade beds and unswept floors and and and and here I am typing away probably giving myself ocular cancer or something. Oh well, whatever will be will be.    I want to start scraping the eaves of the house...guilt dh into getting it painted! bad I know.  I don't think I could do it myself though...I really SHOULD try.  It is scary up there on the ladder though.    Last night I was iming with a friend and Matthew was over my shoulder, wanting certain audibles to be clicked and whatnot.  He picked his favorite - a bug-eyed old man who says "Oh Yeah"...I told Susie (w/ whom we were IMing) that it was his favorite because it looked like his G'pa.  My dear tenderhearted boy (I forgot that he was tender hearted!) teared up and said "No, it doesn't"...he was very close to burst into tears.  I dissed his G'pa I guess, I felt so small and bad!  Okay...off to scrape those eaves and maybe even turned this buddah off.

       On to a fairly uneventful week, after an uneventful weekend.  Yesterday was  a little different...my church through yet another shower for my wee boy...now I have a lot of diapers...this is good.  My father in law and step mother in law came over yesterday. I think they came to give hubby a speech about responsiblity or something, but he wasn't here...so I got bits and pieces of it.  Was kinda strange and uncomfortable. I think they think I am opressed by my husband and lead a difficult life because of him.  Little do they know, we actually have a healthy relationship....something that neither of them seem to be able to grasp in any sort of way.  Think they've been married a total of 7 times between the two of them - guess practice doesn't make perfect.  I wish I were a better communicator, I would have told them just that- and ESPECIALLY that they don't have to worry about me or pity me or anything of that nature. That I actually quite enjoy my life and my husband and my children. Maybe next time as I am sure there will be one.  My father in law is always so very full of advice...some of it might even sound good if his own life wasn't so f'd up!

       After much inspiration from blogging friends and strangers I thought I would give it a try. I spend enough time on this computer...might as well do some journaling as well.  Right now I am SUPPOSED TO BE out walking with a friend but instead she and I am on IMing on yahoo. What is the world coming to? Sometimes I dread spending time with her anyway...we believe quite differently and I am often at a loss for words.  I probably need to pray for the right words.  My toilet is doing something really weird...if I tell Jed he will just blow me off and say it is nothing but it has never done this before.  I think I might really enjoy this, it could be quite therapeutic.    We will be leaving for Saskatchewan in a few weeks.  A long HOT (no air conditioning) drive with 3 kids.  I have no clue how Solomon or Luke will travel...guess we'll find out soon.  Jerad hasn't been to SK with me for many many years. I am sure it will prove to be interesting. Mixing him with my family always is.  I don't think I could have married anyone more opposite...wonder if I did that on purpose.    Once again I have a mental "to do" list today...hope to get at least 1/2 of it done.  This will get more interesting...I promise!
