       the little man is going crazy with the legos today. they're all over the floor, and i keep walking on them. i swear i don't know why i even bought him a whole bucket of them for his birthday. maybe because it makes me happy. or maybe i thought he would only drive mom nuts with them. at least he's playing with them, that's one way of looking at it. so anywho, i'm just biding my time before i have to give the little guy his bath and then i can go to the library and print out my resume. take that satan's answering service! then i get to dress up tomorrow for testing, yay.    i miss my munkie. i haven't seen him in so long. i mean, we see each other every day, but i don't actually get to spend time with him. i was going to place a website on here the other day, because the first draft that i wrote about myself when i started this thing up had a quote from those adorable little spongemonkeys who found fame with quiznos subs. i need to find the addy again, it's good stuff. keep in mind, the guy's a weirdo, but i think he's hysterical. he's also the one that does the vh1 dancing kittens, but i don't think a lot of people know about those unless they watch vh1 on a constant basis.    anywho, i just thought i'd post of the sake of posting. i don't really have much else to talk about at the time. maybe see ya a little later, or possibly just tomorrow, i might have more to say.    as the kiddo would say, "guppa guppa guppa guppa". i don't know what it means either.

       ahhhh, so this is blog.    welcome me.    anywho, nice to meet you, i'm jourie, and i'll be your tour guide into my crazy life! doesn't that sound fun? sure it does, just nod your little head and agree!! thank you!    now continuing on with the tour, i just want to warn you not to get too comfortable and start loving me, because i'm not all about mushy feelings. okay, so yes i am, but that's beside the point. the point is i currently have two other online journals, one of which i hardly ever use. i don't like people always reading my stuff on somethings just cuase it's my rant area, and i like to let loose sometimes, ya know? but then again, there are pretty colors here, and that's something i've been looking for for quite awhile now...hmmmmm...pretty colors...   so basically i started this thing because my friend has one and i wanted to make a comment to one of her posts, but i couldn't do it without becoming a memeber. so here i am. yay! ummm i guess. if you're interested, you can read my profile and stuff. sorry i don't have pics yet, but i'm sure you can deal :D. this is my edit, so hopefully this one will stay better than the first one did, eh? if it doesn't, those pretty colors might not be enough to make me stay...do your magic!

       so i went on a little trip for a week and came back home. it was i guess you could say a nice little getaway, but i didn't really get away. i got away from my house, and i took a vacation from Don, but that's about it. i'm too attached to Ryan to leave him behind, i just couldn't do it. i was going to let mom and Ryan go to trinidad to visit Dad and Grandma and Jason themselves, but i decided i needed a getaway from this house. i went for a week, it wasn't so bad. i wish that i could get away from everything for one week, that would be nice. just time for me, no one else, no worries about anyone else. i love my mom and Don and Ryan, but i need time for me.   so things are going on the interesting side for now. i have the rest of the month off, two jobs can be taken at september, i need to decide which one i want to go with. i won't go into too much detail only because i've spilled my guts about it too many times to count, and it gets really annoying after awhile hearing about it. i just need to think about it some more without involving anyone else.   i thought i would write in here since it's been awhile and i feel like writing. plus i'm online, and i feel like typing.    i wont' make this long, so i think i'm going to cut it off for now, just let you know that i'm still alive and i will continue to write into august, probably afterwards, but just thought i would let you know.
