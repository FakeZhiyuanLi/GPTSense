      I had my last interview with Bruegger's this morning, and I am so happy to say that I got the job, and start Monday. I could have started tomorrow but I have a sprained ankle and its still swollen, so I guess I had better listen to mom --yeah I still do sometimes -- and stay off it for a few more days so it can heal. The manager's name is Steve, and he seems allright. We spoke briefly and then he showed me the store, which was very big and pretty clean, and then we sat down again. He said that I had come very highly recommended by his area manager, Theresa, whom I had met with on Friday of last week. I can't wait to work again, I quit glass doctor last week, and frankly I'm fucking bored all the time. Also, I so have bills, bills, bills. So at least I have a job now, and soon the money will flow again. I guess it kinda worked out that I fucked up my ankle when I did...its not like I have any money to go out, so I suppose its good that I cant.

      Allright, so Bruegger's Bagels can blow me. The place sucks. The manager doesn't know how to train me for shit, and so another shift manager has been trying to, and she's really nice, but c'mon, its not her job! After about two weeks of getting up at 3:30am and working all day just kind of getting shown how to do things with a gun to my head, I can't take it anymore. The hours suck, the job blows, and I'm done. I wrote a letter telling them I quit, and I'll be dropping it off tonight after I pick up Mark. Done. Capeche?

      Allright, I have a job again. I now am the secretary/customer service/first level tech at Lakeshore Computer Consulting, LLC and Midview Internet Services. My little brother is a tech there, so he got me the job. It's going allright, but the owner tends to swear a bit more than I am comfortable with. He kinda flies off the handle about really stupid shit, and has a tendency to make you feel like crap, so hopefully I'll just learn to let it go, and get used to it.
