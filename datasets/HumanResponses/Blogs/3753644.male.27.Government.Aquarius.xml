      Yeah, I like nice firm c-d titties.  I enjoy going to strip clubs once a year to get a variety since with having a woman, I can't exactly cheat on her... Yeah, yeah, what she doesn't know can't hurt her... but I don't operate that way.  I love checking out titties, guys, you can't tell me that even if a weight challenged woman took her top off that you wouldn't check them out.... if you say, know, you're gay.  Why are we so fascinated with Tits, well, probably like my uncle told me when I was 13, men wouldn't talk to women if it they didn't have tits and a vagina... there's just something about rubbing some boobs, and sucking a chick's nipple that is so enjoyable.

      I have lived in Seattle for 8 years and I am now on my way out, why?  One BIG F'ing reason are Seattle drivers.  For instance, any accident, no matter which side of the freeway or how small, they have to stop and look at it why, beats the crap out of me, hasn't everyone seen a police car, an ambulance a firetruck or two in their life?    Another, when it rains, traffic slows to a crawl, like Seattle drivers have never driven in  RAIN  before because it  DOESN'T  rain in Seattle,  yeah right ...  To keep things rolling, hmmm,  most drivers don't know how to merge.  Lets take a look at an intersection near my house to get on I-5 South.  The on ramp has two lanes, so the traffic heading west can turn onto the on-ramp, and the traffic heading East can take a free turn (no yield, no stoplight) just an unfettered turn on to the on-ramp... Now the problem is with the morons heading East, they like to stop while traffic coming from the west is turning on to the two-lane on-ramp without a yield sign, so who's there to nudge them along?  ME, that's right, me and My HORN.  I will be two or three cars back and just lay into it until the cars get going... f'ing idiots.  Hmm, construction, yeah, let's talk about construction in Redmond, yep, the town that is overrun by liberals and microsofties who think thier poop don't stink... so Redmond Way, the major artery to go anywhere in Redmond is currently being worked on, except, it should be worked on at NIGHT, HELLO HELLO McFly,  why the F  do they need to shut down one lane in the middle of the day when TRAFFIC IS THE BUSIEST ?    Well I'm done for now, if you want a good laugh, look at the traffic cameras...Black is BAD...  http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/pugetsoundtraffic/cameras/default.htm  - Yeah you can see pictures by clicking on the little cameras....
