      We're moving soon. Not too far from here anyways. Like... 3 blocks... Or two, I've never noticed. My prom is on the 30. Mom is right now making my dress. Hmm... I don't know why I'm writing now, I just felt like putting somethings here. I got my new Westlife's CD, Turnaround.  I mentioned we are moving. Well, the house we are moving, I like it, but it needs serious painting and decoration. I want to plant sunflower. I've always loved planting those, since I was 5. At 5 I had 3 sunflower which were obviously ay taller than I was. At 10 or so I had my own little sunflower garden, reason I felt from where they were planted and had my leg black for a week... Then yellow. ^-^; And Now I want one again, this time safer and more than always. I just love planting sunflower, they grow fast, they last, and they are beautiful.  Do you know the story of the sunflower? No? If you don't well. Apollo (beauty and sun Greek god) was in love with Clytie a beautiful maiden or water nymph.  Something happened that they were turned apart. And thus she died for love and is reborn as a sunflower forever facing her beloved. Apollo is one of my favorite mythology gods, he has many love stories. Its interesting. His first love was Daphne, who was an accidental love because he was struck by one of Cupid's arrows.   "The heart that has truly loved never forgets, But as truly loves on to the close; As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets The same look that she turned when he rose."

      I pass the three advance tests! YAY! And the math test with 4! YAY! DOUBLE YAY!!!!!  *sings* I'm a happy girl in a happy world !   Well, that means I ain't taking any math at all from now on. Don't get me wrong, I like math, otherwise I wouldn't have pass the test. But, I ain't needing math in what i'm going to study... I guess my friend is right... I should have picked something that has to do with it, because I'm actually good at it. But I don't see the fun in that, so I picked something more analytical and where I can help others.   SG:SG1 S:8!!!! It's starting on July 9. And I'm praying GOD that dad can get the satellite back up by then! I'm going to miss on so much! Now that is getting good! Its not fair since I've been watching that show for years! Since season 1! Not FAIR! Please God, let dad find $150 for it! Pretty please! I know!... I'll see if I have some luck with the lotto, at least "Pega 2"... 3 times.. That will be $150... *cross fingers*

      I was looking for art programs where I'm going to study. But there isn't any. I'm going to an art school anyways. But really? I wanted art, there's no other place right now near here to go to a degree in art so I have to do that for starters. I'm studying psychology by the way. But my true passion, apart from helping others with their problems, it's art. And since I was a little girl I've been dreaming of traveling the world and drawing smile on the faces of others with my art. And transport everyone into my world through it. And it has been the only dream that has truly lasted this long. But things aren't that easy, so I have to take one step at a time. But in the school I'm going I have lots of chances. They even give exhibitions to Spain. So I got a great chance to fulfill my dream. Even though I never had Spain on my future plans. I must say, everything points to Spain and that I will start there. First Spain, then England, then the World! I know I will do it. I don't know how, or when, but I do know it WILL happen. That's the power of manifestation. And I have lots of time to work with that manifestation. :D

      I was reading " healing with the faeries ". I actually just pick it up and read whatever come. Well, I was reading on manifestation, nothing new to me, only I have hard times teaching mom that. It has worked for me so far. Its all about positive thinking.  Imagine it already happened what you want to happen, imagine it with every detail. And then imagine it every time you can. Dream about it, feel it as if was real, and with perseverance, anything is possible. It's great. We all have that cosmic power within us. We just have to know how to reach it. And the first step is throughout healing, healing of your heart and soul, your whole body and spirit. Not with pills or any like it. But spirituality. Meditation, imagining pure white light entering you and dark one going out and disappearing.   Imagine angels healing you.... Its a great sensation. There are lots of books on it. And also websites with free information. I hope that one day I could teach everything I'm learning. With the help of God. Maybe not in multitudes like many, I don't like multitudes. But with each individual, little by little.

       urlLink People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA): The animal rights organization   I'm working to go vegetarian.. In a ironic way, I hate vegetables. But then again I don't eat much meat, it's disgusting... Except for the turkey and 2 of dad's recipes with red meat. I'm planning on leaving those too. But one step at a time. I don't even like chicken, I eat it because sometimes there's nothing else for me to eat. Did you know vegetarians often live 6 to 10 years longer than meat eaters? Also, meat is one of the most common causes of cancer, heart attacks and weight problems. Proteins? Almost every single thing I eat have proteins, our problem is actually having too much proteins instead of just the necessary. Plus, poor animals, have you seen how they treat them? It's cruel! Now, I'm just trying to digest that, I might end up actually having nauseas out of meats. I love animals... Well, I don't get along with cows very much, but its still cruel! So yea.  I'm still working on it though. I'm eating meat like 3 times a week on the main dish. But I'm eliminating it little by little. I'm having a hard time with my favorite recipies from dad. He's the best meat cooker I know. But still I must do this, for my body and for those poor animals.

      Every time I go to a website to see if I can find any prompts to write about, I always stumble across the old cliche question, "What is love?". I've found it so many times I just couldn't think about anything to write on that. But on the afternoon I was singing Hillary Duff's song "love just is". So I just saw the same prompt and well, decided to answer it. What is love? Everyone looks for an answer to that. Scientifics say is an expression of feelings, or whatsoever. Lovers say is what you feel when you find Mr. or Mrs. Right. Religious people say is the truest manifestation of God or a higher source of any kind. Depressive people say is painful and not worth it. The truth is... There's no explanation, no definition. Love, like the song say, just is. How can we give a true definition for something so wonderful yet so painful. Yes, it is the most powerful feeling of the world. But it still don't have a true definition. Love just is, whatever it may be... Nothing less and nothing more... So stop asking the one you truly love and truly love you why do they love you. There is no answer for that kind of question. Some question don't have answers. What is love? Love just is.

      Yes, and no, I didn't misspell it, I just write it like that to make it kind of unique. And Faery is the original (one of them) word for fairy. I'm not a pagan or anything like it. I must admit though I'm interested in those subjects but to do not practice them. I live in my faerytale, inside my mind and soul. Anyone might think, "how childish" or "how immature". But you know, it's good, because sometimes is hard to deal with some stuff of the outside world. And I'm one of those who deal with them without killing myself over them. But there are times I must escape this reality so harsh. I see it so beautiful every day even though is actually bad times. Those are the benefice of a child's heart. As I always say:  "I want to live with the heart of a child and act with the wisdom of an old soul".  I don't live in luxuries or anything like it, so I'm not a real princess... Actually I am, everyone of us is. Why? Because we are all God's children, and He's the King of kings and so that make us Princesses and Princes. I've had like... 10 blogs more or less since I can remember but this one is not for me, it's for Nephelle, my inner child. Hehe, yea, I gave myself a name. I thought, well, if I'm going to live so much in this world of mine, I might as well give myself a name for that world. I'm not different in any way on both world, I'm actually the same crazy little girl at heart, (I'm not that naive) who never wants to grow up. I have my own diary but here I'll write just to escape reality a bit. In my diary I write real day to day events and feelings and all. Here... Lets say it will be a bit of the same but with a little of faery dust. So there you have it, an introduction to my own faeryland.

      Well, we finally got the phone line back. Lots of things have been happening. &nbsp;I'm going to be the Princess from  "Las Fiestas Patronales".  Its a custom every year here.&nbsp; So we are on low budget but still managing.&nbsp; I'm starting university soon, on the 9th.&nbsp; I'm So anxious about that.&nbsp;  I've been having lots and lots of dreams about my twin soul.&nbsp; I know I'll meet him soon. I just don't know when or where.&nbsp; But he's great.&nbsp; Now I know why I'm always atratcted to the same lone wolf, petty eyes, black hair stereo type. We are conected, and I just feel this will be the one lifetime that everything will be great, or at least I hope so.&nbsp; I do know he has a hard to handdle chatacter. Almost the contrary to me. But as my dream guide said, "They are different, so they complement each other." &nbsp;I have many guides and angels.&nbsp; I've meet... the old man with white hair twice in my dreams, a red haired lady, very pretty, two angels and a tiger. They always say things to me in my dreams, beautiful dreams. And once hile meditating I was able to see them all, I recognized a few, but others not. It was just for a second though. My dad made a loud noise and woke me. I also have some faeries and pixies, REALLY, I do. But only in my dreams I can see them all or in meditation.

      We have moved now. I haven't been able to write since the phobe line hasn't been tranfer yet. I'm at my sister since she's on vacation and I can use the computer while she isn't home without her complaining.  My new house it's nice. I love the backyard. I've sleep great so far. Everything is perfect except for the fact that the tempetures are so high that at night you feel like burning. I have to go to sleep early so I can use my sister's big fan while I fall asleep. Phoebe is giving me a headache but she's ok here. We have to put a small fence so she won't run to the street. I actually have nothing else to write for now.

      Well, what can I see about this week so far, so far so good. I have no complain on my Professors and life has been great. I'll soon be getting my laptop, hopefully. That way I can do my work easily. Today I finally took English class, I must say is my second favorite so far. Its on writing, which I love, and the professor is really cool. We also have computers with internet which I can use if I finish my writing sooner or while the professor gets to the classroom. So I can check my email or even post here from there. Which is cool. Well, my life right now, you can say is practically perfect. ^^ Oh, and my oral report in humanity is on Egypt, HURRAY! YAY! YUPI! YAHOOO! LoL, yea, I LOVE Egypt. God is definitely by my side. Is really good and useful to call the angels and the guardians each and every day.  I'll find something more useful to write about.

      Want to do something nice for someone today? Hug someone! Is that simple. Yes, it is. People usually get themselves in a mess which is only inside their own mind. I've seen it many times. Is the chronic mental sickness of making life a drama soap opera. One of my best friends was like that. You see, the best way to live a simple life is to see the beauty in simple things when the big things are not working. Things are simple if you want them to be. Love doesn't hurt if you don't want it to hurt, on the contrary, love heals. The skies are blue if you want them to be. My skies are always pink because I want them to be. I call it imagination and will power. How about you? I have to admit, I have a wonderful happy and peaceful life. Sometimes I love being alone, other's I don't. But I'm always happy with who I am. And I'm happy with who I am because I know who I am. You can't be happy with yourself if you don't know yourself. I call that a rule. In my short years I've learned more than most of the adult people I know will ever learn. And I'm not talking about harsh life's lessons. I'm talking about those lessons that many people let pass by. Lessons like, how a flower smell, how to make a child laugh, how to make someone happy, how to contemplate the sky at noon, how to sing with all your heart, and even how to taste every single bite of your favorite meal. You see, is not the what of the lesson, is the how, so you can the other's how and enjoy every minute of it. Like I'm doing right now. There will always be pain and lies, yes, but there will also always be hope and love. And no one can change that. Focus on the simple beauties of life. Beauty is so simple, that many let it pass by without notice, and they drown themselves in sorrow and darkness because they haven't been able to see they beauty in a simple lady bug. So, take some time to contemplate the small picture instead of the big picture. Take time to make a list of ten simple things you like about life and 10 simple things you like about yourself. Is it your index fingers nail? So be it. Is it the way your ear is folded? Great! Is it the way the sky turns to thousand of colors before the sun say good night? Wonderful then! Don't try to hard on crossing the big desert, but instead, spend ages looking at the tiny flower that has been brave enough to grow in the middle of it. And learn from it the how, the how to make a difference by just being there.

      I spent 3 days of introduction to university life. Which was really cool. I meet a few people, made a few friends. And was extremely nervous at first. Now I can hardly wait for Monday to start! Not to mention all the eye candy ^.~  I won't be taking english this year it seems or the semester, depending on how many people are taking the  course. My sister said that if there were lots in waiting list, the might open a section. I hope so. That way I would only take this year of engllish since I already have 2 classes done of it because of the advance tests. A/W, I only have one class on Tuesday and Thursday. YAY! I'm SO EXITED TO START ALREADY!!!!!!!
