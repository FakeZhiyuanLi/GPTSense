         so restless in my body, i don't know what to do - so restless in my thinking, i haven't caught a clue...the energy is flowing - through every bloody cell, now, how do i direct it?&nbsp; o fucking hell!&nbsp; this all is very strange, it's like so unfamiliar, that my visual range is, like, so tenuous...depending on the way my fingers move - the little pen they cradle, makes images that like to linger in a place they never were...the words that flow from that well transform heaven from what was hell...did this fringe put your brain in traction??? check out the senseless ramblings of a lunatic in action...

       just read anne's transcribed statement...what a lying scum sucking bottom feeding scurvy mugger she is!!!&nbsp; it seems to me that a person should rather be honest than to lie and think that the truth will never be found, because the hollow victory that comes from besmirching another person's life and pain will be found to be real, and the liar will be found to be a scheming manipulator with no substance other than to inflict pain upon the innocent.

       my granddaughter, lillian renee, arrived on july 21, at 2:58 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; i am completely smitten, it's like meeting her mother all over again for the first time...  she looks just like her mommy did when she was born...i'm NOT predjudiced - o no not me...but the truth is every single one of my babies was the most beautiful and perfect example of creation i had EVER seen - while my poor friends and neighbors children all resembled alien implants!!!&nbsp; but then again, my sperm donor did have nice straight white teeth, strong bones, high cheekbones, dark blue eyes&nbsp;and thick blond hair...my girls got the best of both of us, and each is a work of art!!! i love my children and grandchildren and i don't car who knows it :)

      i don't have to think about the things she has done, today, and so i probably will - it just doesn't seem write somehow...in this day of paranoid politically correct behaviour, how on earth could someone be so brash and bold as to openly harass a (former) friend by manipulating the malleable simpletons who labor under her supervision...??? i never knew the depth of her disdain for me, not, at least until, i got hurt at work...i wonder, now,&nbsp;why she invited me to return to that place of employment; in a business -&nbsp;sense it made perfect sense, of course.&nbsp; i knew the job, was anally rententive regarding timeliness and reliability, (never late, always there never absent, always perfectly presented) and of course the customers love me to peices...i doubt she invited me back in order to drive me insane..but, then, this the 00's ...anything goes...&nbsp; i should steal abbiapple's bottle&nbsp; ex(pletive)-lax and give my brain an enema so i can let the shit fly!!!&nbsp;oh well and shit and darn it!!!

         through the dark diaphanous mist, a semaphore, light flashes...safety here,&nbsp;love here, comfort, not complacence...and stammering heart perks up, it starts a steady rhythm...translating staccato to stumbling feet, that then surely follow that strident beat...mental morse code - it's a secret message...codetalker in the night, in my mind...but it's not right to stay asleep...encrypted truth will be revealed...in time

        I'm very busy these days.&nbsp; For instance, Yesterday I spent about 12 hours writing and then editing my formal eeoc complaint about the goings on at the retaurant where I am (gulp) employed.&nbsp; Typos and all, it will be posted as soon as I send my pertinent infor to my daughter, who, being an honest liar, obviously know all about technotripe like that.&nbsp; AS for me, I am in a poetic mood at this point.&nbsp; Are ya ready?

         okay, so this is what happened:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was injured at work on may 2, 2004. So, being a good little foodserver-team member, trusting, in  good faith,  in the powers that be, I duly reported my injury to the night shift manager.&nbsp; I requested that an accident report be filed.&nbsp; Did she file an accident report?&nbsp; Oh, let's be serious, now!!! She denied I was injured and proceeded to tell me about all of her calamities, including how she worked with her wrist in a cast, was electrocuted by the microwave, had her breast leak all over the place while she was doing inventory because she had just undergone a lumpectomy procedure during the late morning-early afternoon hours.&nbsp; She told me "It's just sprained, it'll get better in a few days"  &nbsp;&nbsp;  But, of course, &nbsp;as she so often liked to tell me, she is "psychic, but she gets it wrong"   Not only did my wrist NOT get better, it hung off the end of my arm like a dead fish for 9 days!!!&nbsp; I went to a doctor of my choosing - inaccordance with the Texas Workers Compensation LAW, and was given a working diagnosis of 'sprain/strain to left wrist, with complications of the upper extremity .&nbsp; Since then, I have suffered harrassment, intimidation, and insults galore...all because I was hurt at work and tried to get these people in a position of authority to DO THERE JOBS!!!!&nbsp; My youngest daughter is also feeling the strain (pun intended)&nbsp;the manager has taken to yelling at her and lashing out at her with swear words, and bad station assignments...I of course have&nbsp;had to retain a workers comp attorney-have no doubt, I will prevail.&nbsp; I have some witnesses, facts, and a videotape!!! I expect my attorney to contact the television station that awarded my employer the coveted "BLUE PLATE" award at some point in the near future, and let them become aware of just what type of business they are publicising with free advertising and OMG!!! PRIZES!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; more to come ....

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One would think working as a foodserver is all about family, since most of are food is served to actual members of the human race, and some  suspected  of such membership.&nbsp; I doubt we serve extraterristrials, but, boy you better know if one came in through the front door&nbsp;and had his (or her, or even  it's ) galactic  visa  card, that ummm...person, for lack of a better word would be given the same service as anyone else with the ability to pay.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, as I see it, is with the management of the restaurant, and with the manager's supervisor, the Division Manager.&nbsp; These people are in charge of a rather large staff, and seem to believe they are in some way actually  superior  to those who serve in the capacity of waitstaff.&nbsp; I doubt they would have their high-paying jobs without us toiling away&nbsp; on the floor  and behind the scenes&nbsp;accomplishing all the tasks necessary to the smooth running machine a resaurant  must  be in order&nbsp;to profit in  any  economy.
