       urlLink by Method from Ubersite    I woke up late for work again today, but that didn't stop me from going to Dunkin Donuts and getting my magical iced coffee, without which I would probably hurt someone daily. As I walked in, I noticed a pretty young thing standing at the counter, waiting for her order. She had this tiny little ruffled skirt on that barely covered her ass, so naturally, I stood behind her and checked her out. She knew I was looking; she could see my reflection in the glass in front of her and was giving me dirty looks. Naturally, I took advantage of the situation and decided to mess with her, seeing that she was an arrogant, stuck up cunt that thought she was hot shit.   I got into Leisure Suit Larry mode, stood next to her and looked at her.    Me: Hi.   Cuntrag: Hi (dirty look)   Me (Captain Obvious): Goin out? You're all dressed up.   This was the perfect time to wink at her, for absolutely no reason at all. I had said nothing to warrant the wink (Note: No comment warrants winking EVER, don't do it), so it was all the better to creep her out. I smiled and winked at her, as if we had shared some secret.   Cuntrag rolled her eyes, pointed outside, and said "My boyfriend's waiting in the car."   Me: Oh, thats nice. So why are you still standing here? You got your coffee, beat it.    Her mouth opened in shock, trying to figure out what the hell just happened. She stormed towards the door, and I watched her little skirt flip around as she left. What a cunt. I turned back to the counter, and said hello to my buddy that made me my coffee.   Next thing I know, someone taps me on the shoulder. I turn my head slightly to see who just touched me, and I'm face to face with 140 pounds of sheer unadulterated guido. He had a tight black shirt on, a gold chain, and the customary spiky Euro-trash haircut.   Me: Can I help you?   Euro-Trash: Yo, did you just disrespect my girl?   Me: Why yes, I believe I did.   I turned back to the counter to await my coffee.   Euro-Trash: YO MOTHAFUCKA, IM TALKIN TO YOU.   I sighed, turned around and looked at him.   Me: Relax bro, It's not that serious. Your girl's not even that hot.   It seems he didn't appreciate that comment. He started shaking his arms and huffing like he was the fucking Ultimate warrior. He had to act all badass. His cuntstain girlfriend was watching from the car.   I half expected him to run around the store, looking for ropes to shake. He didn't. He pushed me.   HE PUSHED ME. I haven't been pushed since the third grade. I stared at him, wondering what to do to this guy. He was still huffing and puffing, sticking out his chest like a flamboyant rooster.   I could either:   A) Fuck this guy up, be even later for work, and possibly get arrested   B) Well, fuck this guy up. He pushed me. I didn't have any other options.    Before I could react, my Pakistani friend behind the counter went into a berserker rage. I've mentioned somewhere before that from what I've seen, when Pakistani people get pissed, their eyes turn a feral yellow, and they all have that big throbbing vein going overtime in their foreheads. This was no exception.   "YOU FAKKIN GUY, YOU BAD TROUBLE, GET THE FAKK OUT, FAKKIN GUY!"   The Ultimate Warrior looked at him and made the biggest mistake of his life.   "This doesnt concern you, you dirty ass Bindu."   Well. Well now. I took 2 steps back and braced myself for the shitstorm.   "YOU GUY, IM FAKKIN PAKISTANI, YOU FAKKIN GUY!!!!!!!"   With a war cry, he came running out from behind the counter, broom in hand, and wailed the kid right in the face with the broom. He proceeded to beat the kid over the head with it, all the while screaming "PAKISTANI MATHAFAKKA! PAKISTANI!!!!!" He chased the kid out of the store and into his car.    Good job, asshole. You just got the embarassment and the ass kicking of your life, all because you had to defend your whore of a girlfriend's honor. Way to go.   He came back behind the counter, muttering "Fakkin guy" under his breath, and continued making my ice coffee.   "Thanks for that" I said to him. "I didn't want to be even later for work because of that asshole"   "No problem, my friend, you good man, you always tip."   I smiled, paid for my ice coffee, and left a 5 in the tip jar.

      Back to you It always comes around Back to you I tried to forget you I tried to stay away But it's too late   Over you I'm never over Over you Something about you It's just the way you move The way you move me   I'm so good at forgetting And I quit every game I play But forgive me, love I can't turn and walk away  This way  Back to you It always comes around Back to you I walk with your shadow I'm sleeping in my bed With your silhouette   should have smiled in that picture If it's the last that I'll see of you It's the least that you Could not do   Leave the light on, I'll never give up on you, Leave the light on, For me too, for me too  Back to me I know that it comes Back to me Doesn't it scare you Your will is not as strong As it used to be

      down to the earth i fell with dripping wings heavy things won't fly  and the sky might catch on fire  and burn the axis of the world that's why  i prefer a sunless sky  to the glittering and stinging in my eyes   i feel so light  this is all i want to feel tonight  i feel so light  tonight and the rest of my  gleaming in the dark sea i'm as light as air floating there breathlessly  when the dream dissolves i open up my eyes  i realize that everything is shoreless sea  a weightlessness is passing over me   i feel so light  this is all i want to feel tonight  i feel so light  tonight and the rest of my life  everything is waves and stars the universe is resting in my arms

      I am a question to the world Not an answer to be heard Or a moment that's held in your arms And what do you think you'd ever say I won't listen anyway You don't know me And I'll never be what you want me to be  And what do you think you'd understand I'm a boy – No, I'm a man  > You can't take me and throw me away And how can you learn what's never shown Yeah you stand here on your own They don't know me 'Cause I'm not here  And I want a moment to be real Wanna touch things I don't feel Wanna hold on and feel I belong And how can the world want me to change They're the ones that stay the same They don't know me 'Cause I'm not here  And you see the things they never see All you wanted I could be Now you know me and I'm not afraid And I want to tell you who I am Can you help me be a man They can't break me As long as I know who I am  They can't tell me who to be 'Cause I'm not what they see Yeah the world is still sleepin’ While I keep on dreamin’ for me And their words are just whispers and lies That I'll never believe  And I want a moment to be real Wanna touch things I don't feel Wanna hold on and feel I belong And how can they say I’ll never change They're the ones that stay the same I'm the one now 'Cause I'm still here I'm the one 'Cause I'm still here

Whether I'm off on my bicycle (or pony) exploring, lost in a good book, or giggling with my best friend, I live in a world apart, one full of adventure and wonder and other stuff adults don't understand.

      this... You may not realize it, but it's 100% true.    1. At least 2 people in this world love you so much they would die for you.  2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.  3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.  4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.  5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.  6. You mean the world to someone.  7. If not for you, someone may not be living.  8. You are special and unique.  9. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you.  10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.  11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a  look: you most likely turned your back on the world.  12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you believe in yourself, probably, sooner or later, you will get it.  13. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget  about the rude remarks.  14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know.  15. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great.

      Notice me, take my hand  Why are we strangers when  Our love is strong  Why carry on without me   Everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, it's haunting me  I guess I need you, baby   I make believe that you are here  It's the only way I see clear  What have I done  You seem to move on easy   And everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you, baby   I may have made it rain  Please forgive me  My weakness caused you pain  And this song's my sorry   At night I pray  That soon your face will fade away   And everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you, baby

      smile though you heart is aching smile even though its breaking when there are clouds in the sky  you'll get by if you smile through your fear and sorrow smile and maybe tomorrow  you'll see the sun come shining through for you  light up your face with gladness hide every trace of sadness although a tear may be ever so near that's the time you must keep on trying smile what's the use in crying you'll find that life is still worth while if you just smile
