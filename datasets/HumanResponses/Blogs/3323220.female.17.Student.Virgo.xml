      Yesh..only love can say: Try again or walk away. When ur feelings arent reciprocated, u tend to feel alot of things. Disapopintment, frustration, low self-esteem, no confidence, sad, and maybe anger..at urself. However, there's one very true cliche dat goes: What is meant to be urs will be urs. What is not meant to be urs will never be wif u for long. Love cannot be forced. Haha...my cousin once send me tis sms. It's so sad but true! I like it so much dat I saved it for half a year liao. It's in chinese..so i can only convert for u to see.   "In the past, I used to run after him. He never turn back to look at me even once. So, I ran even faster to try to catch up wif him. But I'm tired now...I can only change the habit of wanting to understand him..maybe it will be easier...."  How true! I wasnt sad or angry la. Juz can sigh in regret. All tis while, I only want him to be happy. Even if it means seeing him geeting attached wif another gal dat he likes. I gave up the run of liking him. Must admit dat my feelings for him faded..but still, I'm happy dat I get to noe him..and feel for him..and haf beatiful memories in my mind. I never regret all this..if I was given a wish, I wld still wanna go back to last year and haf these beautiful memories. As tis is abt the ending, it will be the last post in tis blog. I dun haf any wish to let Willy see tis blog or let him noe abt my feelings abt him. Haha! So frds, pls help me keep tis secret k? Take it dat u're reading a novel. (Unsuccessful attempt at romance..HAHA...) Many thanks!

      Jennifer (one of my poly click) introduced me & Xueting a job at River Hongbao. We were allowed to pull in our frds to work. I knew he would be happy to know about tis job..so I intro him. I remember I sort-of 'pang-seh' my 2 other frds juz to work wif him alone. Heyhey, it's b'coz he knew no one there mah. He's partnerless, so I cant leave him alone. He's very serious working. Haha..our job is to ask people to fill in their particulars for lucky draws organised by LGM (a local company). He said to each go a direction and ask..den it's more efficient. When I hear him say tis, I'm like "Wow! So 'jing ye' (professional)"  That day was a very memorable and lovely memory for me. It's so beautiful and I still can remember clearly dat day...Coz we went to take a break, den he go buy the 'bing tang hu lu' (candies dat look like cherries n red in colour. It's the sweets from olden days). So I followed him. He bought 2 sticks. One for him and one for me. So sweet!!! Haha..I didnt even say I wan lor. I was quite embarrassed oso la. Coz I dun reali like the candies...cant remember y I dun like oso. Haha! When he ordered 2, I told him I dun wan. But he insisted on buying one for me. It's reali sweet of him. I'll explain later y. After he ate his share of candies, he ask me for tissue. (Coz the candies were abit sticky) Den he ask me wipe his mouth for him. Gosh! My 1st reaction was, 'Er...tis kind of mushy thing u ask a friend to do??' It's not like BOTH his hands were unavailable or wat. I was quite shocked when he ask me to help him wipe his mouth. Haha..like I said b4, u can always expect the unexpected from him. LOL! Of coz I didnt do dat la. So malu! In public..somemore we only friends nia~ I juz passed the tissue to him and said coolly, "Wipe urself la. U dun haf hands meh?" LOL!!!  We went to a near by shopping centre to eat. Cant remember the name le..coz both of our finances werent dat gd at dat time, we opt for food court's food. I mentioned earlier about him being very sweet rite? It's b'coz if he didnt buy the candy for me, he would haf enough money to eat. Den I lent him money to buy dinner. Hee..coz he didnt haf money left, and I brought my water bottle along, he asked me if he could drink my water. I was quite reluctant initially. Coz I dun haf the habit of sharing water wif ppl. Haha! But both of us no money to buy water for him, den I let him drink lor. After the 1st mouthful, he commented dat my water haf MY TASTE. I'm like, 'hey pal I let u drink my water u still "sian"??' Hahahahaha..reali mah. I tried to snatch my bottle away but he dun allow. Damn funny guy!  Later both of us went to Mac Donald to eat the 50cts ice-cream. (Or izzit 25cts?? Cant rem le..) Den we started toking abt alot of things. He suddenly feel like singing..den he sang lor. Hey his singing not bad! He was quite tired and slept there. Den I wrote a note to him coz I wanna go toilet. In the note I wrote sth like tis, "I go toilet for awhile. No need to come find me. U continue sleeping..I'll be back!" haha..abit siao ar me! Yea lor.  His dad's b'day coming up. So he was thinking of buying shirt for his Dad. We pass by Giordano (if I rem correctly) and saw the shirts got discount. We dun haf enough money mah. So I suggested borrowing from Xueting (who was working dat day too. But she was wif her own frds). Xueting quite close to me..she oso very nice. Of coz she lent me..or rather HIM. Hee! Den he went to try it on. (He & his Dad almost same size) Now dat I mention abt his Dad, I must say dat he reali dotes his Dad. Admire!!

      I met him at Outram Institute in 2003. (My 1st 3 mths) Thinking back, it was indeed a place where many beautiful memories held. For me. There, I met many special friends. They were so different from my friends in primary & secondary. Now I'm not comparing..jus dat each were unique in their own ways. And I love them in their own unique ways. A girl named Selina, helped me build up my confidence. Day by day. She may not realised how much I am thankful and grateful for wat she hafve done. (R u wondering wat is it? Haha..nah..she didnt do much actually.) It's thru her actions & behaviors dat I learned alot. Haha..(Selina, if u r reading tis..I'm giving u a hug now =P) Hugz~ She's a very very nice friend who takes care of the little baby here (ME!!). Haha..den another friend who I had pleasure knowing is HIM. Hee!  He was my classmate. My heart gave dat little jump when I first saw him. Guess I was attracted to his looks. Keke~ Who wouldnt??? He got dat tanned look. Plus he looks abit blur & innocent. He's both boyish and man-ish. Hard to find leh! GEM~ lol..He got dat kind of eyes dat shows his blurness (which makes him look cute), and always never fail to make my heart jump faster ;) Got a great smile. Very sunshine & 'tian zhen wu xie' kind! Haha..mesmerised by dat dazzling smile until now! Hee..to top it all, he got those 2 cute dimples. (jus like my idol, Zaizai..except zaizai got 1 only) Which shows his boyish innocence! (Makes him look cuter!!) He always grumble abt the dimples though. Said dat they were ugly..got 2 holes in his face lidat..Haha! Though he's not considered tall (same height as me), he got a MAN body. Haha..his muscles trained from all the tough dance trainings. Of coz I dun ONLY like him b'coz of his looks. I dun look for dat department much when I like someone. Dat someone gotta haf charm or charisma or character to attract me. Yea..He got most of wat I wanted- my dream guy. Lol! He dun go for looks. (Can be proven- he dun look & judge at girls whenever he went out wif us. He dun ask Selina or me to intro him gals.) He's quite a gentleman. (Gentlemen r popular among gals. Hee..cant think y. Aniwae, my kind of 'gentleman' dun haf to be extreme case. He jus gotta respect the ladies. Yea?) He's got such a strong passion for dance dat I admire & respect alot. He's so innocent coz he doesnt think there are EVIL in tis world. As in, he had a very bad habit of hiding his things somewhere. And dat somewhere is PUBLIC. Gosh! Can u imagine??? Got one time he wanted to collect the CNY pay wif me. But we 2 couldnt find the right time to meet. So he suggested HIDING his IC (IC!!! REAL Identification Card for god's sake!) somewhere at Orchard MRT, den I go take his IC & help him collect his pay. Haha..so innocent dat I wanna laugh. I mean, there r BAD GUYS ard who wld find his IC & take it sell or wat mah. But dat's wat I like abt him in the first place. Lol! He's a generous n unselfish guy. (Opposite frm me..sobz sobz!) He got dat little streak of rebellion in him too! Makes him an adventurous & fun-loving guy. (A little like me?! Hee..) He's quite filial & doesnt seem to go against his family kind; rebellious (Opposite frm me AGAIN! *Wail*) One thing I wish he could change is: To place his education as top top priority. Haha..his dance seems to cum first. Den he haf a liking for skipping classes. (Heard he's better now..compared to during OI days..he really skip sch like siao!) He's also a super ultra caring guy. Nowadays hard to find such friend/guy liao. I learn to be more caring towards ppl, esp my friends & family. (frm him! Thanks to him!) He's always concerned abt his frds too. I hate it! Jus made me like him even more.  I tried many times to forget him. Failed badly! Haha..tis feeling is weird. Never occured b4..I mean, dat kind of feeling dat spells TROUBLE. Hee..had many dreams & fantasies abt him =P Yst I dreamt abt him again. Sighs! Selina wished me sweet dreams last nite. I said "No dreams pls!" (Coz those dreams only urge me to think more than I can afford to) Den Selina wished me a dreamless nite. BUT LOOK WAT HAPPENED? haha..not her fault..reali was a sweet dream. The reason y I dun wan sweet dreams is b'coz, it happen only IN MY DREAMS. Haha..I dreamt dat I suffered a shock. Den I opened the door to run away from the 'shock'. Suddenly someone from outside the door pulled my arm and into his embrace. I jus hugged him and sobbed. (Coz I was recovering from the shock) It felt so good! Arhhh!! (Still haf the dreamy feeling now..hmmm...) When I woke up & realised it was a dream, I practically wanna screamed "I wanted a dreamless nite...den y give me such a nice dream somemore??? Argh!!" Cannot-take-it kind, u noe? Haha..but somewhere b4 Selina's b'day, I gave up the run of liking him. Partly b'coz my love (Love??? *thinking hard* Can consider love mah? Haha) was one-sided all tis while. Sighs! Sad but true~ Tis time I am successful in forgetting him. He'll always be my dearest brother in my heart.  There was once or twice I asked myself whether I should confess to him not. Maybe he oso got feelings for me??? Haha...DREAM ON, GAL! yea..as usual la, me dreaming away..I debated wif myself for awhile b4 deciding...NO! I cant ruin these beautiful memories I had of him, and his nice impression of me. (I hope I do haf nice impressions on him..haha =P) I had our friendship to consider. I value him as my frd too much to spoil it by confessing. Besides, it was clear dat he likes me as a friend only. (same for Selina and maybe some other gal friends) 2004 Chinese New Year, we went out. Elton, Selina, him & I. Elton got sth on and left first. Simon came to meet us at PS. As most shops close early, we had nth to do so we went home lor. Selina taking MRT home, while I take bus. The guys can take both. So they were thinking who go accomapny who go home lor. Den being the nice gal (me), I told him to go wif Selina (coz they r neighbours). Den it was decided to use the traditional method to decide. Haha..yea.."O'ya peh ya som" & "scissors-paper-stone". In the end...Selina & Simon, me & him. Well actually it's kinda fated. Lol! (Selina wanted tis ending too..coz she's a very gd frd. Knew I like him..den wanted tis opportunity for us) Dunno Selina & Simon got conspire against me not..haha..anyway, even if is I oso wun blame them. *Winkz* So he accompany me take bus go home. Den he suggested go surprise Selina at her hse wan anot. So being the mischievious & adventurous me, I agreed la. Haha..it's damn irony & funny. We were both in for a surprise! Selina wasn at home. Coz she went to Chinatown wif her mom. Den no choice..I go to Willy's hse. Jus happen he gonna take his reunion dinner. (Actually not reali considered reunion la..coz only he & I eating) Haha..imagine my expressions all the way. I was sooo embarrassed coz his grandma & Aunties were at home. I scared they misunderstood I was his's gf (Who wouldnt misunderstood when a guy brgs a gal over to his hse on Chinese New Year's Eve to eat dinner???) I only ate a few mouthfuls of rice coz I was quite full. (Quite a surprise to me..coz usually I got big appetites!) Den he so cute..eat the rice wif curry & CRACKERS! Haha..dat's him! Can always expect the unexpected from him ;) I was further embarrassed when his grandpa gave me hongbao!!! Pai seh coz I didnt brg any oranges over. (the house-visiting was last minute decide one..) His hongbao oso quite generous!  Forgot to mention dat he's oso a thoughtful guy. Hmm..he reali sounds like any gal's dream guy rite? Haha..he reali is every gal's dream guy. His gf must be very lucky! *Winkz* He knew I like F4..den recently Channel 8 is showing  ..he specially called me to tell me dat the show is on. Twice! Haha..my other frds knew I like F4 oso didnt call me to tell me..haha..(actually I already knew it's on..coz I'm a TV addict! :) My frds no need call to tell me..they oso noe dat I noe..haha)  I am scared dat I will forget all these lovely memories, therefore I type tis blogspot. It's like my diary except dat it is a chapter dat has an ending le. A chapter dat I've closed long ago in my heart. Seeing him happy will make me very happy. Therefore I wish him all the best and hope he finds his dream gal soon! (Not refering to myself..haha..I noe I'm not anyone's dream gal. Maybe not now?!) A beautiful memory must end wif a beautiful ending. How I wish I am your dream gal, Willy.

      I must say frankly, dat I got an illusion of love. Perhaps I read too many romance books, so in one way or another, I wish my real-life relationship is sth like dat. Victor..he..I noe him less than a month only. Yet, he hinted (so obviously) dat he *uh hem* ..er..interested in ...ar..me. I doubt him. I doubt his words. Maybe dat bar of self-defence gate went up. There I was, wif warnings bells ringing in my head. The 1st tot dat came thru my mind is, he is not wat I look for..in a guy. I hope I did not..(and I'm seriously thinking dat Idid not!) ..look down on him.  I dun mind abt ppl's past. Coz like I always like to say and think, wats impt is the present & future. Though he same year as me, he studied til N level..and he cant make it for poly. He didnt wan 2 waste his time repeat his N level..so he opt for NS. When I asked him if he got think abt his future, he said frankly "No!" Hmm..I dun like some of his behaviour. Havent mature yet..maybe guys la..mature slower. He..aiyah..last time I see him quarrel wif our colleagues and all, I got the urge to scold him back. Den when he was transferred to Tan Tock Seng hospital outlet (they need staff there..coz Benjamin, one of Victor's frd, suddenly quit. Juz lidat..abit irresponsible la.) I've seen his frd b4..I try not to judge him too much lor..coz I tink since he cant even answer to our supevisor, how can he be much of a responsible bf? But surprisingly, he quite gd to his gf. Anyway, haha..I go out of track le. So he went to TTS hosp to work awhile..but he will drop by b4 or after work to visit us. Got once ar...how to say..hmm..quite unforgettable la. Dat day both of us had a bad day. I made a serious mistake in my work. I took an order frm customer & I didnt get the cake wif pictures as promised. Den my supervisor helped me made calls to kitchen to settle it. Den Victor came la..on his way to work. Actually I didnt expect him to cum. He didnt say anything. Den b4 my supervisor helped me settle the thing ar..Victor & my supervisor..er..my supervisor scold him lor. For his behaviour at work. Den Victor oso angry..so he answered her back. After dat, he left. But I saw him sitting at the railing by the bus-stop, which is outside our shop. He sat there for quite some time le..so I was wondering..is he waiting for me? I noe he's upset abt the quarrel & probably wanna speak to me. But I havent settle my prob..so I didnt go out of the shop. Instead, I msg him to go work 1st. Anytink we can tok later at nite. These few days..hmm...tonite is the 3rd time I tink, dat we chat on the phone..Den he will always mention abt the gal he likes. I'm a sensitive gal mah..so I suspected long ago dat he likes me. But lately, the hints r getting obvious. It's hard to convince myself dat he's toking abt other gal. Sometimes I was wondering, maybe it's all a dream. I will wake up & find myself daydreaming. Haha..den I will laugh at myself.  There's one thing dat he told me..and I'm quite..er..as in, my impression of him deepened. He said dat if the gal he likes, find another guy who treats her better than him..he will either break up wif the gal..or if the gal breakup wif him, he oso wun br angry. But if the guy dat she left for, is not as gd as him, he will "bu gan xin." Haha..woah! Tonite he said a few things. 1) Ask me go his army swearing-in ceremony 2) He will tell me who the gal he likes, when we go star-gaze one day     He say I will confirm be shocked and will jump ard at the spot     there. 3) After I finished telling him abt the sweet dream I had of willy     (look at my other blog..abt willy de), there was a short awkward     silence. It was den I wondered, "Am I cruel? I knew he *uh hem*     interested in..ar..me..yet I told him such thing..but den..I havent     developed feelings for him mah.." 4) Said I cute..for the 1st time..I nearly wanna vomit. Haha..usually     only I say myself cute...ppl at most say I act cute. But now..he     make me sound like I'm the greatest woman on earth. But aiyah...I     tink he only admire la..not reali like lor..where got so fast de?     Less than 1 month of knowing leh..haha..  Etc..will update in future!

      Victor: If there is one guy who truly likes u, will u accept him? Victor: U look so pretty & behave cutely, got any guys go after u b4? Victor: U reali like sleeping beauty man. Victor: Tmr I go to the shop find u. Victor: Do u mind go star-gazing wif me?  etc... Victor is a guy I knew at work. Though he same year as me, his thinking & behavior still dat kind of playful & havent-grown-up type. Lol..I dunno wat his msg means la. But I noe I treat him as frd only..if I agree to go out eat dinner wif him..it is only a friendly gesture. Hope he didnt think too much..He ar..always "buai gam" wif our supervisor & colleagues. He likes to talk back..as his frd..I dunno how to help him. I got say him..but he say I'm naggy like his mum. Lolx! Maybe I'm sensitive la..hee.. Hmm..thinking of Alex once in awhile. Izzit I reali like him le? I cant explain the feeling..I cant even say y I like him. haha..maybe he gave me the brotherly feeling. I used to wish for an elder bro. Some of my frds say they cant stand their bro and all. Maybe it's my female hormones doing sth to me. Haha! Maybe I juz crave for the protected feeling. Willy is doing an ok job..at being my FAKE BRO..lol..not bad la. Got him such a bro. Since he oso wan a sibling..and I wan an elder bro..JUZ NICE LOR. No more feelings for him..I knew..deep down in my heart. Now there's tis peacefulness in me now. I treasure it..and I dun wish to ruin in near future. K la..I gotta prepare liao. Gg Toa Payoh to eat dinner wif tis boy boy (Victor). HAHAHAHAH..if he noez wat I wrote in here...he'll kill me man! Lol..ciaoz!

      Today I work 7-3pm. Yea..finally morning shift! HAHA..sth happened at work today.  A customer ordered a 3kg cake wif drawings on top. I was quite distracted when the cake arrived. I even glanced at it 2 or 3 times. I didnt notice the mistake. It was ard 2plus when I went to check on the design of the cake dat I found out..MY MISTAKE!!! The cake doesnt haf the drawings on top. OH MY GOD! The customer emphasized dat the drawings must be there. And he is coming to pick it up in another 30 mins. Quickly, I told my supervisor. We managed (luckily!!!) at the last minute to get a new one done for the customer. At first when it seem impossible, as the time wasnt enough to make a new one, we called the customer to explain. We even offer to compensate them wif the cake dat they wanted on another day...and take tis cake 1st. The customer was very angry. (Actually is a couple la..the cake was for their daughter's 4th birthday) I apologised to the customer many times..but he insisted on having the cake been done. No matter wat. His wife said dat their daughter has been asking abt the cake since morning. Y was there such error? To say frankly, it's both the fault of mine & the kitchen chef. I didnt write where they could see "Artwork..". Artwork means the drawings on the cake. The chef oso didnt look PROPERLY. Sighs! I was so scared..need to ask me buy the 3kg cake. $100plus leh..somemore it's Blackforest..I can eat until I sick ar. Luckily wif the help of my supervisor, colleague & the kitchen staff, I managed to settle it. Still feeling guilty, I went to POPULARI went home to bath (after work). Bought a card and decorate it..planning to give the customer. As a way of apologising..to show it in a sincere way. I even made card for my supervisor, colleague & the kitchen staff. Haha! Ok..wif the bad comes the good thing. Actually not reali gd la..but it's gd compared to the cake incident. A person frm Ngee Ann Poly called me when I reached home (to bath). She ask me whether I benefited from the financial assistance provided by Ngee Ann Poly. (She talking abt the rental of notebooks) I jzu say "Ya" Den she says CHANNEL NEWSASIA is doing an interview on this. She says only selected students can be interviewed by them. She ask me if I'm interested. Of coz I was tempted..but den..I camera-shy la. HAHA! Not reali la...juz dat..the tot of my frds & relatives and all saw me on TV..I'm like..."Oh no!" Hee..I'm not photogenic enough too. Lol...lack confidence in front of mirror.
