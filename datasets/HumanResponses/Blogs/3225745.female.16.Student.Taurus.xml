       Ahh...well this is my first blog and I admit it is not that bad. Anyway a lot has happened this week which a lot of you know but I will tell to make sure. Last Sunday I did not go to church so my mom is kicking me out of the house. I am to be emancipated on May 13 the day after my sixteenth birthday.  My uncle will help me out financially and stuff but I just cant live with him. My whole family is trying not to piss her off so no one will take me. That's why I have to get my own apartment.  Today I came home to find empty boxes in my room so I am going to go ahead and pack right now ill see yall later.

       Ahh...i just got home from dereks party.  I had fun for most of it.  just let me say that im really upset with derek.  infact im going to use the words pissed off.  He disclosed something about me that i wish he hadnt. now i know almost everyone there knew..but the guys that didnt know didnt have to.  I thought derek was a nice guy.  but he used that against me and that was just wrong.  i hadnt even done anything to him.  and just so those who know about the "church incident", it wasnt that i needed DEREK to be there persay.  I needed someone there because the girls at FBC dont like me because i dont have sex all the time or drink.  and im sorry if i seem bitchy right now maybe i should listen to matt and just get laid.  well im not going to do that but anyway.  i needed to get that off my chest. im sorry.

       This has been such a horrid day.  I am just counting the minutes for it to be over.  when i got in my mothers car today after school, which was my first mistake, i told her i needed to go to the bank.  she asked me how i was able to get money out.  well since im 16 i had to have a cosigner and i had my grandmother with me so she was it.  well i told her that grandmother had to be there and she flipped out. apparently, i am conspiring with my grandmother to do i dont even know what. anyway it turns out ive gone to the bank cashed my check and im walking out...my mom isnt there...she abandoned me at the bank...so i walk home.  she is so mad that she cant touch my money and i dont know why.  so it turns out that my mom recieved something in the mail and she needs that to take this test and if she doesnt take the test she will lose her job.  im so flipping out right now...i may not get to move out after all...i dunno cross our fingers though...im dying to get out.

We have a lot in common and it is really cool.  May i suggest others do the same.  I dont regret it.  Its nice to meet someone new every now and then.  also i read this blog of an iraqi. now that was interesting.  to see what they write about blew my mind.  dear_raed.blogspot.com...you should read. anyway i got to go do my homework. see you all later.

       I just finished watching Jimmy Fallon's last SNL.  I was very sad to hear this.  For those you may not know, i thought jimmy was a hilarious man. He was one of the few left on the show.  I can see why he wanted to leave but i am just going to miss his funny funny jokes.  I am not that sad im just a little disappointed.  After all, this is just tv.  And recently my life has become too interesting to be too worried about tv.  anyway i was just up and decided to write.  good night i am off to bed.

       Ahh...well its been a nice slow day for me today.  I did go to graduation. it got me kind of scared.  That is going to be in a couple of years and i dont think i will be ready for it.  i dont have any idea of what college i am going to go to anymore and an even smaller idea of what i want to do. i think i want to become a history teacher. But i dont think i could handle talking everyday in front of 20 people. My other idea is just as bad because i wanted to be a lawyer which still has me talking in front of a lot of people.  I am just scared about the unknown.       Also, graduation had me thinking about next year.  i have had such a wonderful year and such wonderful teachers, i am scared next year may pale in comparison.  Its like everything has gotten where i needed it to be so i just have to wait for the other shoe to drop. sorry to use a cliche but it is my favorite since mjf used it.  I have grown a lot this year. Like last year, I was so crazed by tv, the real world was passing me by.  I lived in the real world this year, it is amazing what can happen. better than any tv show.  i have absolutely loved this year and its almost gone.(i mean school year by the way)  it has gone by so fast and i have enjoyed every minute of it.  i had promised myself i wouldnt let this year pass me by and that i would enjoy every minute of it and i didnt always do that.  now i am regretting it.  Just, people, dont let life pass you by.  Enjoy every moment. They are precious.  I sound like someone who is about to die.  I probably will once school ends.  It was something to look forward to everyday. Soon i will have nothing.  Work and home, with my mother,  sounds like fun.  okay i guess i have gone on long enough. i will go now. good night everyone

       Ahh...well i am so tired. I have had a long day.  But the best day i have ever had.  We had my birthday party today and it was the best.  Filled with firsts and perfect gifts.  We started out at the boba cafe and let me say, leah, you were right.  It is awesome.  i opened my gifts.  First were gavins gift cards are perfect. Saves me from 4 nights of Ramen.  Thank you so much.  then there were alex's.  She gave me this gorgeous necklace with a pink heart and earings. She also gave me a pink picture frame.  She is too kind and i love her. thank you so much.  then leah also gave me some pink earrings that i just love!  But i have to say my favorite gift was lachlans, yes lachlans, it was belgian chocolate.  It is the best tasting chocolate in the world.  Thank you.  Also, Morgan.  He gave me the party.  We had gone to his house to watch the movie and his parents, gave me cheese cake. My favorite.  They also gave me my first birthday candle to blow out.  This was the best birthday party i have ever had.  I will truely remember this for a long long time. Thanks to all who came (Justin, Jarrett, Leah, Gavin, Courtney, Morgan, Alex, James, Derek, and Lachlan)  I am going to go to bed now so i can go to graduation tomorrow so good night and ill see you later.

       Ahh...well i went out today with my grandmother and we ended up stopping at this bakery across from Arlington High.  It was an eye opening experience.  i know it doesnt seem that way but let me continue.  We sat down to eat our cookies and drink our dr peppers.  well it was after school so all the gothic kids from AHS came in and we just sat there watching them.  i went to school with these people so it wasnt any surprise when they had blue hair or the baggy jeans.  Well i just sat there sipping my d.p.  while my grandmother talked about how life was when she was a kid.  Then i remembered all the times my mom has mentioned how life was different for her.  So here is a message to all parents/grandparents...okay we get it your life was different guess what? the world changes and how you raise your kids has to change with it. what was acceptable then isnt now and visa versa.  you have to just realize we dont live in that world you all did.  Just because we wear different clothes, listen to different music, doesnt mean we are doing drugs or having sex.  you all are way too paranoid.  relax breath count to ten.  things change it sucks sometimes and sometimes its good.  we have to learn to deal with it. I am sorry.  I hope this helps you.

       Ahh...well it is nine o'clock and i am over at morgans babysitting thinking about where i was a year ago. See most the people i talk to now did not know me way back then.  I remember all during freshman year.  i could not enjoy a minute of school because i was just waiting and waiting for oakridge to free me from my public school prison.  I was thinking about how i would make all new friends and find a great oakridge guy to date and how i would make good grades in school. I also thought i would get way more involved in my  school and know everyone and have lots of friends.  Where am i now?  well i was involved in my school and i am making better grades but what was i thinking? i thought just because i went to a different school my whole life would change. i would act and be different. i am really no different than i was a year ago. i am still that nervous scared little girl and i now realize i always will be.  it just makes me laugh...the way i thought things would turn out for me and the way they did..hehe

       Ahh...it is saturday morning and i am barely awake.  I went to sleep late because I got trapped at the ballpark cuz of the weather. they would not let us leave until like 11.  The only good part about being trapped in a warehouse and counting Hall of Fame ballots is that a guy named Matt was talking to me and i really like him. he is really awesome and smart.  anyway im going to try and have a civil conversation with my mother and try not to be emancipated...wish me luck.

       Okay I just got cable friday, right? well tonight is my first night to watch the glory of The Daily Show with John Stewart.  Now, if you do not watch this show,i feel sorry for you.  Not just because he is a hilarious smartass, but because he informs so many dim-witted people.  If it were not for Stewart, so many average Joe's would not know we were in a war right now.  He tells the truth, then makes fun of it.  What more could you ask for.  John Stewart reminds me of another man.  Dennis Miller. Not that well known but is a fucking genius.  Plus he is also a smartass and can make fun of the world.  So for those who want to be informed about the world but find regular news stations a bore, then check these out:                    1.The Daily Show with John Stewart on Comedy Central (cable 53)                   2.The Dennis Miller Show- CNBC (cable 50)  These shows really give you a great perspective on today's world events.

       okay i went to sonic tonight for dinner and some animal right activist came up to me and told me i was eating a helpless animal. i hate those people. they choose which animals deserve to live. what the fuck, who gave them that right.  like tuna fish.  they hate it because dolphins get caught in the net. forget the tuna fish who gets eaten but the precious dolphin. because its cute and has had tv shows based on it, they deserve to live. screw the tuna fish.  thats why i hate them.  they condradict themselves.  lets save this animal but forget about that one. like one animal has rights and the other doesnt. k i feel better now that i have ranted on about this.

       Ahh...i just got home from spending the majority of my day with Warren, Jarrett, Sam, Lolley, and Leah.  We attempted to watch all three Harry Potter movies in one day.  Its not impossible but for a group of A.D.D people, it is quite difficult.  By the middle of the first we had all gotten up doing other stuff.  We did manage to watch the entirety of the second but barely.  Jarrett wanted to pillow fight at one point.  Then off to the movie theater to see the third movie. Im not saying it was bad but i just had a hard time not wanting to nodd off.  Nothing against the movie itself, guess you have to read the books to follow it. Anyway I had a blast hanging with everyone, now i am off to my grandma's then staying at aarons house. see yall around later.   Jenny

         father like daughter       It is so weird.&nbsp; Dorr, the campaign coordinator, acts so fatherly.&nbsp; I really like it.&nbsp; It makes me realize how much I have missed having a father around.&nbsp; The funny thing is new comers really do think he is my dad.&nbsp; They say we look a lot a like and that we act like each other.&nbsp; So now we pretend to be father and daughter.&nbsp;     The other day, not sure when, I went to fort worth to unload 5,000 signs from a truck.&nbsp; Half way through we decided to take a break.&nbsp; I offered to go to Seven-Eleven to get drinks. Before Dorr, my "dad" had to clean my face.&nbsp; He licked his fingers and wiped off the dirt that was on my face that had gotten there from the signs.&nbsp; I just laughed.&nbsp; Ever since someone asked if i was his daughter, I have felt like I have had a dad.&nbsp; He does such fatherly things.&nbsp; It really makes me miss my dad, or having a dad.&nbsp; I didnt think i minded that much only having my mom.&nbsp; Now i know i wanted both parents.&nbsp; Part of me hopes my mom and dorr will marry.&nbsp; Dorr is really cool.&nbsp; He was in the military, and is teaching me how to drive a tank.&nbsp; He has lived such a life, i dont think he will ever run out of stories.&nbsp; I could listen forever.&nbsp;     I feel like a 5 year old kid that wishes their parents would get back together.&nbsp; It will never happen but wouldnt it be cool? id finally have a dad.&nbsp;     Anyway I guess I have rambled enough.&nbsp; I m gonna try and get some sleep now.&nbsp; Nighty nite     &nbsp;   Jenny

      Hey all!&nbsp; Long time no post.&nbsp; Well I am here to ask a favor of you all.&nbsp; I am volunteering, as you know, for Morris Meyer.&nbsp; I understand most of you are republican but if you could give this guy a chance, he is a good man.&nbsp; Go visit his website  urlLink www.meyer04.us  or  urlLink www.blog.meyer04.us .&nbsp; Just check it out.&nbsp; If you want to have a good man representing you, then you will stand behind morris.&nbsp;   &nbsp; Anyway, Hope you can make the right choice.&nbsp; I know we cant vote now, but it isnt about now, it is about the future.&nbsp; If we keep thinking just about the moment people like Joe Barton get away with ruining the world for future generations.&nbsp; We cant just think about ourselves, we need to think about other people.  &nbsp; Thank you for listening jenny

      Hey guys.  I have not posted in several days because i have been so busy.  I started volunteering for a Mr. Morris Meyer who is running for US Congress.  He is a democrat of course and is going to help our great city.  He wouldnt have to do much to live up to Joe Barton.  God i truely hate that guy.  I went to the parade, i was like "back stage" and met this guy.  I wanted to just spit on him or something because he acted all damn high and mighty.  That man is ruining our great city.  I am just glad to be doing something about it instead of just whinning.  Anyway so ive been up at the office a lot working long hours. I realized i work harder for that man than i ever would for the texas rangers who pay me.  How does that work? i dunno.  anyway im thinking a recommendation from a congressman will look better on my college application than from some guy who works at six flags.  but then again, i may be wrong.  anywho i met this guy joe who works at this QuikTrip really close to my house.  His name is Joe K.  He is 20 years old going to UTA and even though he is just some smartass college student, he knows a fucking lot about what the hell is going on in this world.  He is republican but unlike gavin, he can stand behind what he believes with hard solid facts and some really good points.  This guy is a total nerd, he hasnt even seen a movie in like a year, but he does know what the hell he is talking about. if only he were younger and not catholic. okay  so maybe i didnt get to go to england but in these past like two weeks.  i have learned so much from whats around me, i really am happy i didnt get to go.  Oh but the best part is that a couple of days a ago i got my 1991 Buick Regal out of the shop. they didnt paint it like they said they would and a lot of it is still messed up. like i have no freon for my air conditioner, break pads are shot, radio/tape player is messed up, oh and so are the locks and the sun roof.  wow my car is really already falling apart. but at least i still have my Morris Meyer for US Congress bumper sticker.  other wise it would just be crappy.  anywho my time at this internet cafe is running out so i gots to be out for now but hopefully i ll be seeing some of my friends from oak very soon. i havent seen anyone in a couple of weeks and im getting a little sad.  bye
