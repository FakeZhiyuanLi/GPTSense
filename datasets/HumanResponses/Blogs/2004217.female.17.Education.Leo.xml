      I have just realised the implication of publishing my personal musical tastes to the whole world. My reputation will be  ruined.   And now my ex is online! Whoopidoo. It's not his fault I find him immensely irritating... in fact, he's not even irritating, it's just that he's a little... slow. He's nice and all, but I don't think he was in the queue when they were handing out conversation skills, and right at the front when they were handing out free copies of "How To Be Completely and Utterly Irrelevant" by I. A. M. Pointless. For example, I'm telling him about my weekend (He asked, before you have me down as a self obsessed little girl) and what does he say?  "Was the film good?" "Ah right, cool" "So not such a good weekend then, eh? lol"  Nooo! Nothing so witty! I got:  "Spurs are wearing an all purple kit."  Why the  FUCK  do I need to know this? And how in hell is it in any way relevant to Calendar Girls? There's another puzzle for you. I say "Erm..ok.." and does he respond/apologise? Nooo! He starts telling me about some girl he met the other day. Well, at least there might be a link there... there are women in Calendar Girls?  Good Grief.  Desperate to get to the show Ceff x   # I go up, I come down, and I'm emptier inside... tell me, what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing? And why can't I let it go?#

      Well, after a long and in-depth discussion of the merits of RX Bandits with Vez (Hey Vez!!), I have come to the conclusion that although The Resignation might be a very good album, it is not for the people who are expecting more of the same ska/reggae vibes that were on Progress. Although Sell You Beautiful is an AMAZING song, it is neither ska nor reggae, and as I bought the album expecting this, I was disappointed, as, I would imagine, all the other people buying this album expecting ska/reggae were. RX Bandits have definitely taken a new direction with this album, I'm just not sure whether I like it or not. Fair play to them for recording it live and all, but a lot of it still sounds very self-indulgent to me. Bring back the Ska!  See you at the show Ceff x

       Musical Recommendation!!   I strongly recommend  Senses Fail . They are soooo cool!  Mp3.com defines them as Emo, but I don't like that word because it has no real definition. I'm sure I can make one up though... but it's really hard cos Emo ranges from Dashboard Confessional to Taking Back Sunday and those bands are really different...why am I whining about this??  Anyway Senses Fail are really good, they have an EP out on Drive Thru, go buy it they rule.  Don't buy: The Resignation by Rx Bandits if you like Ska. Biiiig disappointment. There are some moments of sheer brilliance (Pal-Treaux) which then irritatingly descend into self indulgent guitar scraping. Boo Hiss to them.  See you at the show Ceff x

      Wahey! Look at me, Blogging away.  Welcome! To the (probably less interesting than it sounds) Blog of Ceff. I'll be including jokes, hilarious stories along with my usual dose on cynicism on all things male. Don't get me wrong, men are fab (Mmmm... Men ;o)), but I also happen to believe that they are all mean, mean people who keep their brains in their trousers and never change one bit. I would go into details about how I came to this conclusion, but I don't feel like it today. Maybe another time when i'm feeling much more self-pitying.  So! Onto today's random ramblings... 1. For the first time EVER I didn't want to go to English today. It was such a horrible feeling! I felt so guilty... I went, obviously, being the good, studious type, but the passion wasn't there. Gutted. Mind you, I didn't really want to be in school at all today, I would have much rather just stayed at home and thought about...  2. MEN. Well, first things first...GAZ. It's all very confusing. I doubt he really remembers me that well, but because I know ABSOLUTELY NO MEN, I remember the few that I have the privelege to meet in great detail. So- texted him on Sat, invited him out with us on Thurs, but alas, no reply. Will text again tomorrow, with the approval of Liz, who seems surprisingly encouraging about the whole situation- suggesting I went with him to the VALENTINE'S DANCE! Good. Grief! It's all very confusing.  So, that is the current situation... as soon as more interesting things come up that are fun to read and play around with, I will add and stuff, cos this is all very exciting...  I should do something productive now... I'm sure this counts!  See you at the show Ceff x

      Well hello there! After a fairly uneventful week, last night saw me cutting some rug at Academy 2 for what seemed like my first gig in YEARS, but was only a month after the last one. Here's what I thought:  Despite being Welsh, first support When Reason Sleeps made a fairly good effort at getting the crowd going with their very "emo" scream-sing-scream-sing dual vocals and chirpy onstage banter. Unfortunately the Academy crowd are less than receptive; the attitude towards the support tonight is not an open-minded one. In the crowd's eyes, they are simply wasting time and energy, because they're only here for one band: Lostprophets. Not that this deters WRS- they produce a solid 30 minute set, and finish with on a suitably emo note: "slit my throat and hope this funeral never ends". Ouch.  Eden Maine, we are warned by WRS, will "scare the shit out of some of you". Imagine the collective "huh?" that goes round the room when 5 unnasuming yet fairly hairy men take to the stage. I expect great things of Eden Maine after their ominous introduction; I am sorely disappointed. Eden Main are tuneless, chaotic and sound totally unco-ordinated. After the 10 minute-long opening track, the lead vocalist (I hesitate to use the word singer)Adam Symonds mumbles, totally out of breath, incoherently into the microphone before launching into another 5 minutes of out-of-time screaming, unnecessary shouts and uninspiring instrumentals. After the previous pitiful attempt at speech, the band make no other effort to communicate with the crowd before they wander offstage, out of breath and out of fans.  After this disappointing start, the atmosphere amongst the audience is now so expectant that, should the 'prophets underperform, a riot might break out. Thankfully, the sheer showmanship and musical quality of the band is so stunning that a riot is far from everyone's minds. On a cramped stage, in a tiny venue. under such pressure to live up to their image, Lostprophets performed as if they were in a stadium: songs from the forthcoming album "Start Something" sounded polished and were well received and "classics" (singer Ian Watkins' words, not mine) from debut album "The Fake Sound Of Progress" were played with total confidence and imagination. The crowd surge backwards and forwards and often drown out Watkins with their singing, especially on debut single "Shinobi vs Dragonninja". The 'prophets finish with current single "Burn Burn" and leave us breathless, stunned and gagging for the new album. Roll on January...  AND OH MY FUCKING GOD I TOUCHED IAN FUCKING WATKINS!! *screams girly scream and faints in girly manner*  Ceff x   Wanna do whatever, laugh until September...

      I have just experienced what was possibly the weirdest weekend of my entire life. It was spent entirely in a cosy hotel on Lake Windermere with 9 other people for company, and included Em's 18th birthday party, flirting with a 40 year old and my dad's wedding.  So let's begin at the most obvious place: The Beginning. I was collected at 2.30pm from home by Daddy Dearest to be carted off to Worcester for final packing and panicking. We set off at the RIDICULOUS hour of 8.30am the next morning and arrived at the Langdale Chase hotel for lunchtime. We proceeded to the bar, where I discovered the joy of tabs (This weekend's most used sentence? "Just put it on room 20") and by 5pm everyone had arrived:  1. Me  2. Em  3. Dad  4. Sue  5. Sue's mum Marion  6. Sue's dad Roger  7. Sue's brother David  8. David's wife Claire  9. Sue's mate Debbie  10. Dad's mate Paul   Much complaining about traffic occurred before we were ushered into the restaurant for Em's 18th party, which was fun due to party bags and balloons. After a HUGE meal which included two desserts (both cake- oops), we headed into the piano room for Tequila: Cue much amusement on my (sober) part watching Dad, Sue, Em, Debbie and Paul's faces screw up in disgust after each slammer. Ha. One by one everyone left for bed until finally it was just, Me, Em and Paul. At about 1am we headed up to bed, where Me and She ended up (quite logically after some- ahem- mutual revelations) talking about affairs with older men. Then to sleep...   We awoke accidentally an hour early on Sunday(THE WEDDING DAY) due to the clocks deciding to move in the middle of the night- breakfast was brought to the room by a rather nice young waiter who I then spent the rest of the day telling people was "with us for breakfast", mwahahaha. FIT. At 1pm I retired to my room to do my makeup, which immediately prompted my face to go the colour of milk with red blotches. I went for a walk. Somehow (*innocent look*) I arrived outside Paul's room, but due to his in-the-bath nature, I went to the bar for a cold drink and some deep breathing. Skin soon resumed its normal complexion and I was able to proceed with the dressing process. At 2.20pm we arrived in the bar to much oohing and aahing, before heading up to the bridal suite to collect, well, the bride. We walked down the stairs into the main hall at 3pm to Puccini and by 3.20pm we were exiting the hall for champagne and photos to Bon fucking Jovi. Good Grief. In between time, Daddy Dearest married Wicked Stepmother, I read a sonnet and felt strangely apart from the whole event. It was as though I wasn't part of the new life, simply a reminder of the old one, dad's dark beginnings; a skeleton in some sort of metaphorical closet. We went outside into the cold and did photos, toasts and comparisons of shoes. The party then carried on in the function room for another HUGE meal where I, feeling much more relaxed about Em knowing about it, flirted a bit with Paul. I am fully aware that you now think I'm a sick, twisted individual who is just asking for trouble, but he's just. So. FIT. And kind. And  very  complimentary towards me and Em about our looks. And it wasn't disgusting, I wasn't all over him, just smiling, playing with hair, laughing at jokes, a little bit (more) touchy-feely. I was much more concerned about Em: hanging off his arm, touching his leg, asking him to go OUTSIDE with her ALONE for a "WALK" because she was "HOT". He didn't go in the end; I took the opportunity to point out my sister's frisky behaviour at which point he abstained from opinion. Unfortunately, I was unaware at this point she was stood at the window listening in. Oops. I went outside to look for her (in the DARK- clearly an indication of how caring I am towards her; I am NOT a dark person), and on finding her was given ICY shoulder so I went back inside and sat by the fire. She appeared on the balcony a while later and relative normality was resumed, if you can call normality eating sausage sandwiches at 11.30pm while Dad sleeps, pissed, in a chair in the middle of the hall as his bride attempts to get him to go to bed. Once again, by 12.30 it was just Me, She and Paul. We ended up talking about the marriage, how I felt about it and how Sue felt about Me and Em. Em made a comment: "She's better than some of his other partners, and I never met his first wife." Thanks, sis, that makes me feel a whole lot better. I left for bed and after a "chat" with Paul, Em followed.   We awoke again this morning with breakfast from FIT waiter, then we packed and headed down to meet everyone at breakfast. Millions of goodbyes occurred, and finally Sue's parents and I left the hotel for a boat ride and a long, sleepy journey home.   Right now I am considering texting Paul. Every time someone said something that involved the title of a song, we both said "That could be a song", which provided much amusement and a strange element of consistency throughout the whole tale. We said "Cheers" to each other more times than I think I've ever said cheers to anyone in my entire life, and although he's twice my age I spent most of the weekend feeling as though I'd rather be in his room cracking jokes and talking music than listening to Em drone on about Chris/Ben and whatever other boy might be in her life at the moment. He was the constant in the weekend, he didn't change, he didn't get married, he didn't go off in a strop. Dad got it right in his speech, he's "fucking rock solid". And this is not a random diatribe of some lovesick teenage girl with odd fantasies; I doubt I would ever end up doing anything even remotely naughty with Paul, I just felt close to him, he was my mate for the weekend, which was just what I needed at a time when everything that was ever dependable was thrown entirely out of place, out of time and, most of all, out of context. I needed a friend, and he was it. And anyway, he's banned me from being naughty. I now have to send him proposals 3 weeks in advance of what I plan to do, where and with whom I plan to do it. In triplicate. He's also decided he wants to interview any prospective boyfriends before Daddy Dearest meets them. This (clearly) means I'm going to have to visit his house more often...   Ceff x    Lean on me, when you're not strong...

      Right! Plan for tonight's blog: 1. Halloween Party 2. WS1   The halloween party was really quite amusing. I avoided Draper for the entire night and had lots of fun with Selina and Laura, which mainly involved laughing at Suki and Keith Leddington's dancing skills. Ha! All was going well until 10.30 when someone severed a wire and the speakers went "Pffffft." Macho (well, sort of) chanting then occurred, ranging from "Hemmell (sp?) is an arsehole" to "Engerland, Engerland, Engerland" and "You'll Never Walk Alone". Everyone was removed from the building at 11pm. I went home, and lots of others went to Yates'.   And so to Thursday...   We all headed out from Zeb's at 8.45 to WS1, where we stood in the FREEZING cold for ages, watching year 11 after year 11 get turned away, becoming more and more fearful that they would ID us, until we were safely inside. Phew! But alas, we were not followed by Kat n Coz n Beth n Nat, and we (sadly) assumed that either Beth or Nat didn't get in due to youngness. Turns out it was Kat who was denied entrance- weird, seeing as she's been in before. Boo hiss to bouncers. Inside we danced, ran into Carly (YAY), Nina (drunk), Helen (looking rather sexy) and Bhav (oddly enough). Also, EVERYONE who EVER went to my primary school was out last night- saw at least 10 people who I knew or knew me... strange... We headed upstairs at 11 where I had a nice conversation with Draper at the bar about the whole sordid affair and how everyone was taking the piss out of him at school- we cleared everything up and we don't fancy each other and it's all good :o) He left at about 12.30 and at 1 we were approached by Sean (FITFITFIT) who claimed "sponsored kissathon for charity". Needless to say, I gave generously. In fact, I was feeling so generous, I made three donations. mmmm MMMM!! Granted, he also got off with Zeb and Selina and a few other girls, but dammit I PULLED! Laura/Selina/Becky were much disgusted. Oh well! mmmmm Fit....   Ceff x    Let the music smother me, whole weekend recovery...

      Wahey! Have found a way to immediate bloggage! Wheeee! Who knew that "Blog This!" would be so useful...  Nothing interesting happened today. Me and Liz made some poems about Girth and Romping, and I pondered about men... again. Ho hum.  Ceff x   I can see the headlights and the pavement, my legs won't carry me that far...

      Ha! On the annoying Search bar that appeared on my browser when I downloaded MSG+ there is a link to "Foot sex". How intriguing...  My dad posted me some obituaries today. He got my flat number right, the flat block number right, the town right, the county right, but missed out the postcode and wrote HARBORN road instead of CAMBORNE! It's a little more than disconcerting when your own father doesn't know where you live. Granted, I can never remember whether his home phone number starts 724.. or 274... but come on! Harborn?? Good Grief.  2 irritating DRAPER-related things today: First: I got my ticket for the halloween party, and on the back is written "Jess King (Uter)" Apparently "Uter" is written to distinguish me from Jess May who is also coming tonight. Because obviously my SURNAME doesn't distinguish me from her...!! Second: text "from" Draper this afternoon: "i love u". Ha! Turns out Chris Devy sent it. I am less bothered by this, in fact it's kinda funny, but I still wish people would just leave me alone :o(  The search bar now says "Sex girls"... don't think I'll be clicking anywhere near that any time soon...  Ceff x   Reception less than warm...

      Hummmm. I should be doing homework. English homework. I should be doing it with great enthusiasm, because I like analysis questions. But I find myself here on this blog, in the middle of a conversation with Luke on MSN. He's babbling on about something; I haven't replied in about 15 minutes but he keeps sending me messages. Ahh, he's signed out- "gtg c ya l8r.x" (that's right, not only is he TEXT LANGUAGE OVERLOAD MAN but he also has a chronic disability to use the space bar after a full stop). I feel almost dirty for going out with him- why did I have to choose someone who is so blatantly, BLATANTLY wrong for me? I doubt this is hindsight speaking though, I think subconsciously I wanted someone so much that when he messaged me and told me how wonderful I was, I just fell for it. Stupid girl.  Ceff x   You called me on the phone, but you don't even wanna talk!

      Gah. Here's me, quite happily going about my daily business without fuss, no friend troubles, no family troubles and most of all no MEN troubles. Until! 1. Debbs isn't speaking to Laura because (from what I can gather) Laura doesn't like Debbie's boyf Matt and gave him a "dirty look" at Becky's party. Good Grief. How petty. It is nobody's fault that Laura and Matt don't get on, Laura seems to be just fine about Debbs not liking  her  boyf, so just get the fuck over it!! 2. Saw Loz at the bus stop today who was making disgusting comments about me and Draper. Apparently they've been winding him up about me and him and making up texts "from" me asking if he'd got a boner. I repeat, just get the  fuck  over it! I don't fancy him, he doesn't fancy me, end of story. Am now dreading Wednesday due to his (Draper's) presence. Woo.  Ceff x   Calm before the storm, set it off...

      Shattered. Absolutely shattered. This has been one of the busiest weekends ever in the history of busy weekends...   Friday : Free afternoon, leave school at 12.30, go to post office, stamp E111 form for trip to Germany in 2 weeks (2 WEEKS! Argh!). Go to Birmingham to sell Hundred Reasons ticket- Academy don't do refunds. Luckily man behind me in the queue was wanting to buy a Hundred Reasons ticket- Sorted. Unsuccessful raid of Dorothy Perkins half price sale led to trip to Metal section of HMV and a purchase of "Casually Dressed And Deep In Conversation" by Funeral For A Friend. Buy this album. Arrived home 3.30pm, shower, left house for Birmingham University to meet Oli for curry and night out at the Guild. Spent hour previous to travelling to Guild watching Oli, James (cute) and Paul (FIT FIT FIT) play "Pro Evolution Soccer 3" on PS2. Was surprised I did not need to be woken before leaving icky flat. Spent night standing around quietly while Oli talked to other people who didn't talk to me, until about midnight when I engaged in conversation with Paul (FIT FIT FIT) about Ska and how it's great, and how garage rock is shit. Ha. Danced for a while then returned to icky flat collecting 2 road signs, an armchair and a traffic cone on the way to sleep in Oli's bed, while Oli went to his girlfriend's flat in search of sex.   Saturday : Awoke in icky flat, got up, did Oli's ironing for princely sum of £4.40 (student discount). Mother arrived with Oli's washing and food for next week or so, then headed home for quick bite to eat before heading to Gentleshaw to play with Coz's instruments. Rar. Songs were played at me (piano and guitar): Awesome. Cannot begin to comprehend how he comes up with the music he played- totally amazing. He can do "Plug In Baby" by Muse- totally beyond me. Sheer musical quality of songs made up for spending a considerable length of time in sub-zero temperatures in the garage. Began to learn bassline to one of his songs and also learnt bassline to "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (only 4 notes, but still an achievement). Left house 5 minutes before bus leaves Burntwood; missed bus. Waited 20 minutes in the cold before being able to get home to get ready to leave the house for Pelsall for Becky's 18th party. Was fun; Selina and I were a little over dressed but still enjoyed ourselves- stuffed face with flying saucer sweets and laughed at stoopid barmaid, who foolishly asked Selina to "watch the bar" while she went for more glasses. Rollo proceeded to stick his head under the Stella Artois tap for a drink and Zeb poured herself a generous shot of Vodka. Barmaid returned and remained unawares. Ha. Returned home to bed and awoke today ( Sunday ) with headache and aching muscles, for no apparent reason.  Phew! Thank God I've only got one piece of homework to do!  Ceff x   In hope and desperation I'll find my only light...

      Free afternoon! Wheeee! Went home and tidied my room. Boring I know, but it had to be done. And it was fun to boogie around my bedroom to Fall Out Boy turned up loud without being told to a) Go to school  or b) Go to bed. I am also eternally grateful to the Free Afternoon for allowing me to escape from the common room today. Much gratuitous squealing and repeated playing of George Michael's "Careless Whisper" made me want to stick the stereo up the rest of the year's superficial collective bottom. Ha.  Tonight I am out on the town! Well, I'm going to the Hard Rock Cafe with Daddy Dearest. I'm not sure if he's ever been to a HRC before, because I think if he had he wouldn't be taking me there tonight- £8 for a cheese & bacon burger... Mwahahaha "£ £ £". Tomorrow evening however, (I hope) will prove much more fruitful- I'm staying over at Oliver(cousin)'s Uni halls because we're off to the Union, yay! Fingers crossed he's chosen his friends on the basis of whether they're my type. Me? Self centred? Never! I'M just horny...(ME ME ME ME ME)  Ceff x   He's well hung and I'm hanging on...

      Event of the day: Erotic fiction! The "Better Than Cosmo" area of the Wonderbook (notice proper nounage) somehow  morphed  into page upon page of erotic fiction, plus a rather random "What turns you on?" list that Lucy plans to turn into a story. Hee Hee! Much fun was experienced by all during our frees this morning as Liz and I created some naughty stories for our own sordid amusement/pleasure. Mwahahaha.  Event of the day before: Yesterday saw the final, much welcomed episode of the Ceff-Draper saga, when Coz rang him and asked him if he fancied me. Much **FEAR** occurred and I had to Calm myself by listening to the following songs while I waited for the outcome:  Hell Is For Heroes- I Can Climb Mountains Good Charlotte- Waldorfworldwide Something Corporate- I Woke Up In A Car  After YEARS of ":::calm:::**FEAR**:::calm:::*FEAR*" the message came back...  He doesn't fancy me.  I expected it really, and I seem surprisingly un-bothered. He likes someone he works with. I could be seething; green with envy at this WITCH that is stealing my Drapes from me- but I'm not. I suppose it would be more interesting that way, but I've never been one to be predictable. At least, I hope not!  Ceff x   By the way, your hands were shaking...

      Tuesday, Week 1: Most. Lessons.  Ever.  3-3!- lessons PLUS conversation... how I managed 5 lessons a day when I was a teenie greenie I will never know. I recently worked out that I have not had 5 lessons a day every day for nearly 4 years, due to my (cunning) choice of Private Study instead of an actual GCSE. Mwahahaha.  Today's interesting act of the day included sending an "I want your body"-type text to GAZ and Coz- No reply from Gaz and much confusion from Coz: "what the fuk ? lol" being the abbreviated version. Kat told Liz that I wanted GAZ- which is really quite untrue, I did not want him, I was just... considering options! And now Liz thinks I fancy GAZ, EVERYONE thinks I fancy DRAPER and I don't know what to think. *dies* Everyone wants to know what's happening in my love life and I just want it all to go away- I could hear either Loz or Chris Devy (or both) shouting "Where's Uta?" at me down the street- as IF I'd know! And then he was at the bus stop, and I just didn't know WHAT to do, but Helen provided much-needed support and in the end nothing occurred. Arrrrgggghhhhhh MEN!  Ceff x   By sharing these things I rip my heart out

      Weekend over, homework done and dusted and another successful gig. Went to London with Guides yesterday- had to get up at the ridiculously early hour of 7.30 in the morning so I could be at the coach for 8.45. I didn't even know that 7.30 existed on a Saturday! I thought it just... wasn't there! Got to London and went on the London Eye, which was very nice and immediately forgettable. Then headed to Wembley Arena for the "Big Gig"- 10,000 screaming girls(not one boy- gutted, hehehe), a bunch of fairly well known-ish pop stars and Fearne Cotton from CBBC. It was all fairly boring, the Cheeky Girls being the main highlight, until......   MARK OWEN CAME ON!!  Mark bloody Owen! I had no idea he was on and I was soooo impressed. I started going on about how he was my favourite member of Take That, but none of the people I was with had heard of them... felt so old. Boo Hiss. ButButBut! All was not lost when  LIBERTY X  arrived and were just  Great . They finished their set with Just A Little  (SEXXXYYYY)  and I then immediately went to the toilet to ring Selina and tell her allll about it, while Atomic Kitten were on. Then had to survive a 3hour journey home in between a bunch of hyperactive 12 year-olds and 3 miserable teenagers who kept telling them to shut up. Do they not understand how much I  need  my sleep?? Gah.  Another achievement of Saturday was the acquisition of DRAPER's number from Coz. Texted him, flirted a bit, got a reply: No flirt. Alas. Replied, flirted a bit more... No reply so far. Dammit.  Ceff x   And you're so innocent, please don't take it wrong cos it's a compliment...

      Well, here ends another week of school, and I must say, I'm glad to see it go- had my first lesson with Mrs. Rogers since  *the incident*  and she said all of one word to me in an entire hour, and it wasn't even an English word! It was the Buddhist word for no-self, anatta, and she only said it because she had to tell me what to work on. I'm not sure whether she was actually ignoring me, or whether she just had nothing to say to me- apparently(according to Rukia, who is  GREAT ) she gave me a "look" as I walked out the room. Ha! And today had to do some  actual  work in my free today cos I forgot to do my English homework! Me! Forget English homework! Just  look  at what Mrs. Rogers has done to me. *dies* Last night saw my third venture to WS1, this time accompanied by Laura, Alex, Sel and Zeb+Co.- Loz was there, and apparently-  apparently! - DRAPER likes me! Good. Grief. This is highly stressful, because I have noooo idea what to do. Everyone seems to hate him, and I feel kinda sorry for him, so it might seem a little like pity-dating, but he's a nice guy really...arg blerg ick can't cope with all these  men ! This all began when Laura told me DRAPER wasn't coming into Walsall last night-  Gutted! - And then everyone gave me a *look* and it all got very confusing- Zeb told Draper he'd broken my heart by not coming into town and now Loz and Cheese (???what???) have decided to make it their own personal challenge to get the two of us together. Help! But we'll see. If it's gonna happen, it will. From now on, I don't care what anyone thinks about me and him. I'm just gonna keep it to myself and do what I wanna do. *dies again*  Ceff x   This is because I can spell Konfusion with a *K* and I can like it...

      (Count The Stars- Pick Yourself Up)  Feeling much better now. Mummy is making dinner(chicken...cluck) and lil ol' me is listening to Count The Stars, who are really good... Discussed GAZ with Liz today and DRAPER with Kat earlier...  1. GAZ seems to be taking on the job of rent-a-boyf (minus prostitute connotations)..."Available for Special Occasions, comes complete with own suit and spending money" 2. DRAPER seems to be taking on the role of the guy  E V E R Y O N E  thinks I fancy... No comment!!

      Well, what a day- I'm glad we finished early, I don't think I could have made it through German last period.   I got some work back off Mrs. Rogers today- 14/20, Level 4 standard, well done Ceffy. What I didn't realise, was that Mrs. Rogers had photocopied my essay- she then proceeded to hand it round the class and spend 15 minutes picking it to pieces in front of everyone. Pointed out allllll the bad bits... pointed out 1 good bit... ignored the fact that in her comment (only shown on my copy- everyone else's photocopy was covered with a copy of the mark scheme) she had used the phrase "this is an  excellent  summary"... Asked me what my last sentence meaned... I explained it to her... her response: "Well, I still don't understand it- does anyone else understand it?" to which no one raised their hands (Thanks Guys)... then I got a half hearted apology and an admittance that she "probably should have asked my permission first". No shit sherlock! Thanks for ruining my day... felt like crap, got angry, nearly  killed  Kat by throwing my keys at the wall and finally calmed down after going to English (SUCH a relief, couldn't wait to get there) and eating a bar of Galaxy.   My day was further worsened when my purchase of fingerless black+pink gloves from Etam went horribly wrong because they didn't take Solo cards... Next they'll tell me Less Than Jake have split up...  Ceff x   It gets worse before it's all over, I know I'll get through it somehow...

      Aloha!  Last night was most eventful. Went into Walsall with Kat/Coz/Zeb/Laura. It was really good, way better than last time, we had a right laugh- Coz turned into a rap star (50 Pence- you'll find him in da pub), complete with bitches (me and Kat) and I flirted with Draper just for the fun of it. Got quite far, he seemed pretty into me by the end of the night, and I totally forgot about Gaz, lol, until Kat mentioned him this lunchtime, at which point I replied "Who?" hehehe. But WS1 was soooo cool, Me+Kat were dancing with each other rather (ahem) provocatively, much to Coz and Draper's pleasure/amusement/arousal. Every 5 minutes Zeb would drag me away from Draper (Booo, lol) to dance with me and shout "No!!" at me until I finally managed to convince her I wasn't going to pull him. Draper's lovely, but...I don't think so... but he's good for a laugh, and good for the practice ;o)  So that was yesterday!  Today, dragged myself into school and through my lessons, and then into B'ham, where I didn't have enough time to go to Primark- Gutted! Although I did return a gig ticket and buy 2 new ones- Wahey! Lostprophets and Hundred Reasons baby! Yeeeaaaah, Ian in the flesh- Rarrr... Also bought some lightening bolt/ dice-shaped earrings from Dotty Perks, which I have wanted for a while now, so yay :o) Then had to rush off to Digbeth bus station (beautiful example of architecture that it is) and get the coach to Worcester/ Dad's house, which is where I am now... Jimi Hendrix is blaring out of the stereo and Dad is pretty drunk, so just another normal Friday night, hehehe. I want my friends :o(  See you at the show Ceff x

      Good Evening all.   Today's most fulfilling day included 3 almost bearable lessons, 2 highly enjoyable frees, a trip to the passport photo booth, the acquisition of a bass tuner and a shopping trip to New Look accompanied by Coz+Kat followed by a nasty bout of loneliness. They're all so... coupley. Happy. Content with each other. And then there's me. Royal fucker-up of relationships.   They tried to make me go past Phones4U (where Gaz works), but resisted... I'm not into all that enthusiasm, I'm trying not to get all obsessed with him cos it won't help, and I'm not gonna let a guy run my life without even realising it. So I'm just gonna take it easy... see how it goes. And anyways I'm going to WS1 tomorrow night so you never know who'll be out and about there! Rar... men ;o)  See you at the show Ceff x   # I've got it all, but I feel so deprived... #

      Well, that's the German done with. That was possibly the hardest homework I've ever done... How Mrs. Dalgleish expects me to get an A I do not know...   But on to the HILARIOUS stuff that happened today, namely... Kat. The lunchtime conversation began fairly innocently, as I was eating my yummy scrummy M&S Deli Filler (Prawn and Mayo)...  "You know... you're not supposed to eat those out the tub, you're supposed to put them on some sort of carbohydrate" "I know that" "Jess... can you eat potatoes?" "No" "Can you eat bread?" "No" "What about rolls?"  *look*  "What about toast? Can you eat toast?"  *sigh* "No..."  The lunchtime progressed, with Kat poking me every SECOND saying "Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess... Can you eat bread/rolls/doughnuts/iced buns/toast/cake/loaves?" And ending up being hilarious... somehow. After asking her politely to cease pokeage and askage of  stoopid  questions many times, I had to resort to threatening to eat Kat with my spoon, at which point boyf (Coz) rang, and she was therefore saved from such an edible end. You just wait til next time... no amount of "meep"ing can stop me and my  HUGE  spoon... Muahahahahahaaaaaaaa!!!! Ahem....  C ya @ da sho (innit) Ceff x

      Well! Today has been a  p a r t i c u l a r l y   interesting day. Went for an interview with Marks and Spencer today... passed the first interview section (lots of questions about teamwork and problem solving) and passed the second interview section (practical task)... Which means I got the job! Wahey!   Then I found out I should have brought 2 forms of ID with me, a passport photo and an application form. Do I have any of these with me? Nooo, because my confirmation letter did not arrive until this morning,  after    I had left the house. Great.  Then! They checked their Christmas vacancy timetable and there were no vacancies for me! So I spent an hour in some back corridor of M&S Walsall, only to end up in exactly the same position as I was beforehand. Woo fucking hoo.  Although I did get a reply from Gaz- he says he'll try and come out next week, which means I have to try and persuade mother dearest to let me go into town 2 weeks on the trot. Which should be a whole barrel of laughs. Liz even suggested I took him to see Hundred Reasons with me! This is all very interesting, it's like she's trying to tell me that I  should  go out with him. Which is nice. :o)  So all in all, it's been a bad icky blergh day, so I'm going to drown myself in my playlist and get on with what looks like the hardest German homework   e v e r . I'll post more later.  Wishes she was at a show Ceff x

      So, December is next week, I have a whole £8 in the bank and I have not bought one single Christmas present. Tomorrow, thankfully, pocket money will arrive and I will be able to try desperately to find the time in between schoolwork, jobwork, Guides, going to my dad's and spending more than an hour at home at any one time to attempt to find presents for people. Thankfully, this year's list of big-pressie-people is not that long:  1. Mum £10 2. Dad £10 3. Em £7 4. Bev £7-10 5. Philip £0- Mother took out and insurance policy and got a free watch 6. Selina £25 7. Lucy £9 8. Oli £15 upwards- shirts cost money!  If I have the time or the inspiration, I will try and get some smaller presents for other people. And Liz's birthday present. Oh, and I suppose I'll have to get something for Wicked Stepmother aswell...  On top of alllllll this, I am absolutely shattered, therefore grouchy, and have PMT, therefore totally miserable, self-pitying and very, very horny. Grrr.   Thankfully wonderous events such as JYF, Hell Is For Heroes and Good Charlotte are approaching, all of which include seeing men who I either find strangely attractive or come under the category of FIT. But between now and then I will continue to drown in a sea of work, more work, irritability and... did I mention work?  Ceff x   Things can only get better...

      I am currently experiencing another very odd moment. My darling sister has just informed me that one of the guys (this is debatable) from JYF, the one who likes to cross dress, has officially changed his name to a girl's name and started taking oestrogen supplements. This may not strike you as totally freaky; weird, maybe, but not scary from my perspective. But here comes the best bit. Before "the change" he was called Robin- after, he/she/it is called JESSICA ROSE, which, if you will remember correctly, is MY DAMN NAME!! I was sooo weirded out when Em told me, I mean, how scary is that?? What if he's stalking me? *checks under desk*  Ceff x   My girlfriend is a wannabe...

      Today I feel... floaty. Not good floaty though; the kind of floaty when you can't really decide what to do and where to go- the kind of floaty when you feel you can't land next to anyone because everyone's doing something that seems far more important than talking to you. I felt very out of place wherever I went, like I wasn't quite... accepted isn't the word- It didn't feel like I fitted in anywhere, but like I was just going around after people, and everything I did or said was slightly innapropriate, or odd. Floaty.  Ceff x   If I was someone else, would this all fall apart?

      *sigh*  That feeling has returned. That "Oh-shit-it's-Christmas-again-and-I-just-can't-be-arsed" feeling. The Christmas music, the "Perfect gift for Christmas" adverts, the generally shitty Christmas weather. Work didn't make matters much better either; after smashing a £4.99 bottle of red wine over the shop floor by nerves went to jelly and I spent the rest of the night dropping boxes of everything from biscuits to Christmas bloody puddings. And who buys Christmas puddings in the middle of November anyway?? Honestly.  In addition to my Christmas anti-spirit, the general dark cloud that seems to be hanging over school and my love life have made today one big grey blot on my self-centred teenage horizon.   In true geekish fashion, the highlight of my day was my English lesson; although I seem to be the only person EVER to be interested in creoles/code switching/accent and dialect. Oh well. It means I can answer all the questions and look even more enthusiastic than I already am, hee hee...  Ceff x   Gotta have faith...

      Since Tuesday Richard's been texting me. Naughty texts. Rude texts. Downright "I want you NOW" texts. Normally, this would make me immensely happy, and for a while I was- until Friday night, when I he was on MSN, when he reverted beck to normal Rich, the one that doesn't ask you how you are of answer any of your questions, and generally makes out like he doesn't want to be talking to you. Then he goes offline without saying goodbye. Konfused? So am I. I've got no idea whether the whole thing was a joke or whether he's found someone else who he fancies, or that girl from Wellingborough has asked him out. I already texted him twice in the last 2 days with no reply, so he probably already thinks I'm some weird stalker girl and that he's changed his mind about getting together with me at JYF.   I don't know why I bother, he's just living up to his reputation. He decides he likes a girl and then 5 minutes later another one comes along and he's gone. I think the reason I keep falling for him is because he dumped me the first time, during the first part of the relationship when you can't keep your hands off each other and can't stop thinking about each other either. Maybe if we got back together and it lasted a bit longer or was a bit more stable, if he dumped me again it wouldn't be so bad... oh it's pointless thinking about it because it's just not going to happen...  Ceff x   It's to dying in another's arms... and why I had to try it...

      So! I nearly got beaten up today. I laughed oddly at Ripu and she told me I sounded like a sheep, so, being me, I "baa"d at her. Unfortunately the man walking past at this particular point in time somehow seemed to take offence at this, turned around, spat on the floor and asked me if I wanted a "fucking slap". I told him I wasn't talking to him but Ripu, and he once again assured me that, had I been talking to him, I would have got a "fucking slap". How I love living in Walsall. No wonder I'm scared about getting 6 rejections from UCAS- I can't wait to get out of this shitty town...  Ceff x   I hope you choke on those words that kiss that bottle

      I return to England after a week in Germany in which I barely spoke a word of German and discovered that the German people really are as ugly as everyone makes them out to be. I saw not ONE fit person for the E N T I R E week: Gutted.   But other than that, my 4 days in sunny-but-cold Trier were much better than I expected. Katie Herbert really isn't all that bad; the year 11s were all pretty cool and the teachers were really really safe with us. The week began with an average day of school, bar my teachers asking me why I was in school when I was supposed to be in Germany. Selina arrived at my house at around 10pm that night and we proceeded to watch The Little Mermaid and Moulin Rouge until it was time to go. As usual, we were the last ones to arrive, and then the journey began....  At Toddington the coach driver got off to be replaced by his son Jamie- but more on him later... by 7am we were at Dover and by 5pm (German time) we were in our rooms unpacking. After a meal that consisted of what seemed to be a wedge of SPAM and some mashed potato, we (German A Level group and teachers Charmaine, Mr. Birchall and Mrs. Dalgleish) went to the lobby/cafe type place and played poker with building blocks, under the supervision of Katie Herbert, the only one of us who knew how to play.  Wednesday we met the German class. There is one word to describe them: odd. Amongst my group were Benjamin, who stroked his "beard" every time he was thinking and had fuzzy hair, and Florian (yes you read that right), who was on medication for his hyperactivity disorder. Eek. Other Germans who will live on in our memories include:  Benedict, who was in love with Varsha and (according to her) had clammy hands, Joaquin, who thought he could rap, Red T-shirt guy, who everyone fancied but whose name Selina and I can't remember, and Jan, the weirdest boy I have ever met. He hung around with us for hours after the rest of his class had left, tried to make us go to his Harry Potter party and was in love with Davinder. I made everyone check under their seats when we got on the coach to make sure that he hadn't followed us on.  Wednesday morning was also whe Amy decided to collapse in the middle of the breakfast room. She was taken to hospital and kept overnight, and sent home Thursday morning with nothing wrong with her. By Friday, according to Mrs. Dalgleish, the chinese whispers around school included: "Amy's in a coma" "Amy has epilepsy" "Amy has Toxic Shock Syndrome"  LOL.  The rest of Wednesday and Thursday came and went in a blur of interviewing teachers for coursework, avoiding Jan and most importantly, WHOLE AFTERNOONS OF SHOPPING! Woohoo. Trier is such a pretty town with the coolest shops, including a MASSIVE H&M which we promptly raided. I purchased a "very me" wide necked pink and black stripy top for 13 Euros.  On Friday we went to see a film, in German with no subtitles... *sob* It was about a little boy whose father came home from a prisoner of war camp in the summer of the 1954 world cup, which Germany won, apparantly. It was fairly good but the boy just would. not. stop. wearing Lederhosen and I exited the cinema thoroughly disturbed.  Saturday was our "day off". Not that we'd done anything but have days off all week, mind, but Mrs. D doesn't need to know that... we spent all our remaining euros on Diddle merchandise, drinks and cake and then headed to a hotel for a farewell party with the Germans, which consisted of a selection of traditional German food for us to try and some English food for the Germans to try. After that we headed back to the hostel for our final evening in the bar, which was virtually ruined by apperance of Mrs. Ds ex-husband, who was there to see their daughter. He put a dampener on our whole game of poker by complaining about it all the time and eventually we all headed our separate ways, leaving the three of them alone.   Our evenings were spent in the "Cafeteria" downstairs in the hostel. Mrs. D, MC Mattie B/Sea Scout/Mr. Birchall, Charmaine, Jamie, Katie, Becky, Selina and I whiled our evenings away with poker that we bet on with matches, which proved to be the highlight of each day. The atmosphere was so relaxed, it was really cool and we all enjoyed ourselves- Mr. Birchall would deal, Katie would be telling Becky and Mrs. D whether to fold or to bet, Selina would be yak-yakking away to, well, whoever would listen and Jamie and I would laugh at it all while he tried to steal everyone's matches. Jamie was waaaayyy the coolest person on the holiday- for a start, he was from Barnsley, so obviously he commanded immediate respect from me (who incidentally was the only person who DIDN'T take the piss out of his accent). He was sooo sweet and cool and nice and chatty and just great. No I didn't fancy him. Well, maybe a little. I wish he was here cos I loved talking to him so much and I feel sad that I probably won't ever see him again. :o(  On Sunday we boarded the coach at the RIDICULOUS hour of 8am (bear in mind before this we had been up packing final things, clearing our rooms out, having breakfast AND making our packed lunches) and by 8.30pm we were back at school. We said our farewells, headed home, and (surprise surprise) Selina didn't come into school today. Hmph.   So now everything's back to normal. I was ready to come home yesterday morning, but after a day back in wet Walsall I wish I was still in Germany, where I can play poker, talk to Jamie, call Mr. Birchall names and gossip about teachers.   Ceff x   There's a light on in Chicago, and I know I should be home...

      So it's the 28th December and already Christmas feels over. Normally I'd still be basking in the warm afterglow of eating too much and playing with all my fun new presents. Instead, we're back at home already and the house seems strangely under-decorated, despite a 6-foot sparkly Christmas tree standing less than 5 feet away from this keyboard. This year, the whole affair seemed decidedly un-festive; Yuletide sort of just sprang upon us, and although the presents were wonderful and everyone was happy and the food was great, those couple of days that should be happy and content seemed to lack that (forgive the pun) Magic and Sparkle. I was sat in the canteen at work yesterday (I'll come onto yesterday in a minute) and they were telling all these stories- someone's son had proposed to his girlfriend on Christmas day, another's daughter had a baby girl on Boxing Day, and I just sat there, all quiet. I felt like Stanley Bagshaw- nothing very exciting ever happens to me.  Work was hell yesterday. Not hell how you'd imagine it though. It was much, much worse than anything you could ever imagine. Screaming babies, loud grannies and refund after refund after refund. Add to that the post-Christmas sale-goers, and the fact that I was on my feet  all day , and it really felt like someone had taken what little Christmas spirit I had left, strangled it, dropped it in a pile of dog shit and then kicked it into a busy road. But, I hear you cry, you work on foods! You sit down at your till points, and none of your products were in the sale! Well that's where you're wrong. For the whole of yesterday I was loaned out to fashions, because they needed more staff to deal with the mob. The tills on fashions don't have seats, and they had one mother of a sale. I'm surprised I'm still alive to tell you about it.  But! Back to happy Christmas things. Went to Dad's for Christmas No.1, and got 2 CDs (Rancid and Michael Jackson), my new coat (snuggly warm yay), big woolly jumper, book of Politically incorrect jokes from the net (GREAT) and book called The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, which is a murder mystery story written through the eyes of a 15-year-old boy with Asperger's Syndrome. It's brilliant- couldn't put it down and am currently fighting the urge to read it again until I've finished my other Christmas books.  After 2 days of work (busy busy busy, but KERCHING! Overtime), Christmas Eve occurred and we headed up to Barnsley. Nothing much happened. Christmas Day then arrived and as usual, my sack of presents was sat under the tree (after many, many hopeless attempts from my family, I remain adamant that my mother put it there, after seeing her bring it out to the car before we set off). Got some really wicked stuff, but the top three have to be my new Paul Frank t-shirt (Julius the monkey is wearing earmuffs!), Eats, Shoots and Leaves- A Zero Tolerance Guide to Punctuation by Lynne Truss (brilliantly funny- a whole chapter dedicated to the apostrophe) and of course, my MiniDisc player. Of course, my mother being my mother, she forgot to buy any minidiscs and we had to wait until Boxing Day to go to Currys and get some, but we got there in the end and it's still fantastic. I got the new SoCo album aswell, it's brilliant. Mar Hon sounds... hot, to be quite honest. If he sang any of those songs to me, I would either a) melt or b) orgasm. They're just fantastic.  Tomorrow morning myself, mum, Selina, Aunty Bev, Les (mum's mate), Coral (Les's mate), Ann (Godmother) and Ellie (Ann's daughter) are heading off to Gay Paree for some New Year fun and frolics. It should be fun, as long as Bev doesn't keep going on about my dad. Here's the background to this problem: Wicked Stepmother has changed her last name from Maclean, her old married name, to Morris-King, a combination of her maiden name and Dad's last name. At the wedding, at the end of the ceremony, the registrar said "Can we have a round of applause for Mr. and Mrs. Morris-King" which is wrong, because Dad is just staying as plain old King. Of course, I made the mistake of telling Bev this story, and she's now latched on to calling him Morris King. You might laugh now, but try hearing that every ten minutes for two days straight. Not funny anymore. And of course, this week she will tell Selina this, and then she'll pick up on it, bring it back to school and then Laura will pick up on it, and you get the picture.  Ceff x   I could still be ruthless if you let me...

      Horrid weather, horrid day, horrid person. I came to school cold but chirpy this morning, you know, last day of term, giving presents out, getting presents back, having a dance around the form room and playing silly games with my mates. I really wanted to give Sel her pressie because I knew she'd like it and I couldn't wait to get my new underwear off Debbs. Problem number one: Sel decided she didn't want to come to school today. We rang her at home at about 9.45am and she'd just woken up and "wasn't feeling very well". We eventually managed to persuade her to come in, and when I finally got to give her her present she came across as quite ungrateful. "You did get me extra small, didn't you?" Me: "No I got you small to medium, sorry, do you want the receipt so you can take them back?" "Yeah look I need extra small, they're the right ones and the right colour, but they're too long. Give me the receipt and I'll take them back and change them."  No "Thanks anyway" or "Sorry, I should have told you to get me that size"- I found it really abrupt and it got me down a bit. She's supposed to be my best friend, for God's sake, and I felt really distant from her. She went home at about 11.30am.  After school finished at 1pm (woohoo!) Helen and I passed Owen Ingram tied to a lamppost outside school and went to the Wharf bar for a drink, then we both went to our respective workplaces. I discover that both times I'm in work next week I will be unpaid! Not a happy bunny. I've now worked out that I have only taken 4 hours over my allowed leave time, which I have already made up, plus 2 and a half hours extra. Fair enough, don't pay me for the time I'm not there, but not paying me for the time I am there? Not on at all, especially when I'm having to cut short my Christmas jaunt to Barnsley to come back and work in that hellhole for 10 hours straight. The bastards should be paying me extra, if anything.   Ceff x   Coming down, the world turned over; angels fall without you there...

      So, last night came the evening of the Christmas Party. By this time it had already been confirmed that anyone who I planned to go anywhere with on that night was going to the Boy's School Christmas party at Revolution, until, in true bitchy girl style, "someone" (i.e., according to rumour, Pav) contacted said bar and informed them that we were underage. Shit. So, all manner of confusion occurs, including the following questions:  Are you going to the Boundary instead? No. Is it definitely at Revolution? No. Is there still going to be a party? Yes! Where is it? Don't know. What does Hemal say? Apparently it's at Stein Bar now. So it's definitely at Stein Bar? No. Shall I just meet you in Imperial? Yeah.  The common room became a hive of phone calls and text messages, and nothing became clear until Hemal finally appeared in Imperial at 8.45 (the party started, in fact, at 8pm, but I think we were being "fashionably late" or something) to tell us that we were going to the Stein Bar between 9 and 9.30pm, because that was when the football finished and the rest of the boys' school would leave Bar Sport. Riiiight. Eventually, we arrived at Stein Bar and a generally good time was had by all, from what I could tell. Gaz tried to pull Bex but did not succeed as we were leaving, Rachelle Horton's boyfriend tried to feel me up  twice . and I met J(ay), the sweetest guy ever to exist. He's small but perfectly formed and generally a really nice guy- he complimented me on my dress (incidentally, he was the only person to do so), squeezed my hand and made me smile :o) Awww. Fab.

      Let's conduct an experiment. Take a few of my favourite things, namely gigs, music and Benji Madden, mix them all together and see what happens. What actually happened was near enough 2 hours of sheer bliss. I can't really explain what it was like last night; there aren't any words to describe how totally amazing and mindblowing it felt to have one of my favourite bands standing, performing, less than ten feet away from me. Just... wow. Totally and utterly fantastic in every sense of the word- the songs were all brilliant, the set list was a perfect mix of the two albums and I knew every word to every single damn one of them. Their stage prescence, their musicianship, their relationship with the crowd, it was all perfect... just perfect. Everytime I think about it I smile, I just want to go back there and watch them play over and over again- watch Benji leap around the stage, watch Joel get beer thrown at him, watch Paul swear at the lighting guy and watch Billy act generally skeletal. They opened with A New Beginning, as predicted, and finished with Lifestyles, which kind of goes without saying. I was totally surprised when they played Waldorfworldwide, I only expected them to play the singles from the old album, but like I said, they mix of stuff they did was fab :o) because they're Good Charlotte, and they know how to do everything exactly right every single time. But, I hear you cry, are they as fit in real life? My answer: Alas, no. Benji, obviously, is still hot. Joel, despite his best efforts to look punk with his red mohican, still looks ugly compared to his twin- yes I do know how ridiculous I sound. Paul looks like a big puppy dog, bless him, and Billy is actually quite rank in real life, really really skinny and quite scary, to be honest... but his guitar playing made up for all his lack in flesh :o)   I've had my walkman attached to my ears virtually all day just playing Young And The Hopeless over and over again, only to be interrupted by the carol service, which was, as usual, a ridiculous state of affairs due to its general pompousness- "oooh, look at us, we got the TOWN HALL for our carol service... listen to our SENIOR VOCAL ENSEMBLE sing Away In A Manger, isn't it pretty? Look at all these LOVELY, INTELLIGENT girls who can READ" Big whoopee. Get over it. And don't even get me started on you and your ego, Mr. M-J... whoever asked him to read the part of God made a  huge  mistake. I've re-realised the beauty of Emotionless. It's the only song that's ever made me cry; it's so fragile- the simplicity of the guitar in the background makes you listen to the lyrics, which, and if you know any of what's gone/going on in my life you'll understand, really hit home hard for me. Hey dad...  Ceff x   When you lay your head down, how do you sleep at night? Do you even wonder for a while if we're alright? Well we're alright...    Life, hope, truth, trust, pain, pride, love, lust, on without the things we've lost, the things we've gained we'll take with us...

      Wow. What a gig. As ever, Hell Is For Heroes came out onto that stage to deafening screams and played. Just played. Upfront, ballsy, fuck off rock songs that, in my humble, obsessed opinion, will live on forever. And they weren't even at their best; it's a perfect measure of their talent when a gig that could have been better was still fantastic. They began with I Can Climb Mountains- in my opinion it probably would have been more effective leaving it until last, but who gives a shit about the set list- all the songs were just... wow. Even the new stuff sounds fantastic- I feel like I know it already. There's this one song, Folded Paper Figures, and it's brutal- I wanna listen to it over and over again, it's just 4 minutes of anger and spite combined with sheer musical talent. Mindblowing. The support weren't bad either- first band Copperpot Journals were very good, very talented, but didn't quite grab me. Second band was The Lucky Nine- as soon as I heard the name I knew I recognised it from somewhere but I couldn't put my finger on it... then Colin bloody Doran from Hundred Reasons and Dan Carter from 'A' walked onstage. My jaw dropped. It's this new Britrock "supergroup" that Kerrang! have been going on about for a few weeks- in a word, metal. Not my scene, but still talented.  And so now, the countdown begins... 3 days... until it's time...  Ceff x   I can build bridges from ones you burn...

      I'm wearing a new dress that I bought today; It's knee-length, black satin with a ribbon under the bust and little pink polka dots. I'm also wearing an early Christmas present from daddy: £22-worth of pink hat from Oasis, plus my plain old black heels. In 2 hours I'll be going to see Hell Is For Heroes and I have no intention of taking this outfit off until the last possible opportunity. Why? Because I feel great- I looked at myself in the mirror and thought "Damn... I look gooood!!". So fuck you Birmingham, and fuck you, Rich, because I'm sexy and you both just missed out...  Ceff x   She likes the way I stare...

      So much has happened I don't know where to start... I'll try the beginning...  So last week was full of the build up to JYF; the nerves, the excitement, and most importantly of all, planning outfits. Until Thursday, when Birmingham sent me a letter telling me they didn't want me on their course. As I sit watching my life going down the drain while simultaneously holding an MSN conversation with the JYF committee, the novelty of the whole affair began to wear off. But eventually Friday came round and by 6pm I was bouncing around in the car, desperate to get to Bournville. I arrived at roughly 6.15 to discover that only Edd and Lailah had arrived, and that Rich and Em were at the supermarket. Caught Edd looking at me in my fabby outfit, but didn't mention it to anyone- got that little glow inside that makes me somehow taller and gives me that "Woohoo! I'm great" sensation. Rich eventually arrived and immediately told me I looked wonderful and gave me a hug, kissed me, touched me... it was wonderful. I felt fantastic; this guy that I like, he liked me back... And it carried on: the whole of Friday was spent with him, culminating in Epilogue, when, snuggled up in our sleeping bags, things started to get really naughty. Of course, after a little bit of naughtiness in the dark, as soon as the lights went back on and the candles were blown out, he rolled over, stole my pillow and went to sleep. As you can imagine, I was somewhat put out, and so went over to Matt. Matt's wonderful; I just want to cuddle him all day long. I miss him so much, I just wanna see him all the time...  Friday night wore on, and as Matt and I snuggled and Richard slept soundly, I finally relaxed and got over the fact that, once again, I'd been stupid enough to fall for him when there was absolutely no chance of us ever having what passes for a relationship. I had a fab time talking to Edd, Ed, Matt and Lailah about the most random things, which is one of the reasons I go to JYF. It's the perfect excuse to just talk shit for 2 days; no one judges you, no one calls you stupid or gives you funny looks, they just laugh along with you and give you a hug. So Friday night passed into Saturday and Richard woke up. And, as expected, he acted like nothing had happened and decided that he fancied Em. Of course, she was fucking lapping it up, hanging off him like a sick puppy, boobs in his face and skirt slowly riding up her legs. But Matt was there, and he held my hand and gave me hugs and leant on me in the cinema and kissed me and most importantly of all, he made me smile.  Saturday evening arrived, and Kat left the meeting house for a party. On the way out she got hit by a car and, unknown to us, was rushed to hospital. Of course as soon as I found out I was devastated- and Rich was the nearest person. So he hugged me, and kissed me, and I thought "maybe I've got him back"... of course not. After 5 minutes he complained I was squashing him and went "for a walk". Towards Em, who was also "devastated" because she'd been outside and seen the accident and not realised it was Kat. She's got some illusion that Kat actually likes her, just cos once she had sex with her. In actual fact, Kat finds her immensely annoying, self-centred and slutty: just like I do.  Matt and I slept most of Saturday night. My slumber was only interrupted by ridiculously loud snoring from Ex boyfriend No.1, Edd. I didn't know where Rich was and I didn't care, because Matt was there. And he was snuggling me and it was warm and fun. So I awoke on Sunday morning to the sound of Christmas songs, and he put his arm around me and we discussed the merits of each song that came on, before finally getting up for breakfast, packing away and a long goodbye before he had to leave before meeting to catch his train. As soon as he'd left I missed him- I just wanted him there like he was, all snuggly and smily. As I wrote on his Rosy Glow, he made my weekend, just by making everything seem fun again even though Rich was being a twat as usual. And of course, the comments on my figure from everyone around me helped quite a bit. A classic came from Sam: "You're looking very aerodynamic, Jess". And this is why I love JYF! Sean was also highly cuddly during the weekend, and told me I looked good too, as well as Kris, who, since I last saw him (when I had a huge crush on him) has turned fucking  g o r g e o u s: tall, dark, glasses, spiky hair, intelligent... Mmmm! Yet, here I am, falling for the stocky, scarred blonde with a fixation with my sister. So overall, when you balance it out, although Kat had an accident and Rich screwed me around, the weekend was fabbity- I took every opportunity to take the piss out of Em's sexual habits, as did Matt B, another new friend :o).   As soon as I got in the car when my mum came to pick me up, I missed everyone and everything about JYF. It's like it's the real me that's there, totally relaxed and happy. So Sunday night was spent in a haze of memories and an aching in my belly, part for people and part due to my period, which evilly arrived on Sunday morning. Last night I went to work and barely spoke a word- I didn't feel like talking to anyone because I just wanted to go to JYF and give someone, anyone, a hug and a kiss and talk crap for 4 hours, rather than stacking box after box of belgian chocolates in a cold shop. Today was OK, I'm still thinking about it but not missing everyone so much due to the realisation that e-mails exist. It's like a big drug trip that takes days to come down from, but somehow the comedown is almost as good as the trip itself.  I'd e-mailed Birmingham back on Thursday, asking them if they could give me more details about why they didn't want me, and that I didn't want the alternative course they'd offered me (Eng Lang with German, including a year abroad- FEAR). This is what I got:  English/MCS is extremely competative and we look for an interest in, and an awareness of, isues related to Media, Cultural Studies in the Personal Statement on the UCAS form.  This was not the case with your application.  I am afraid that is is not possible to study English Language as a Single Honours degree.  Thanks a fucking bunch! If you're going to reject me you could at least get the grammar and spelling right. And I know I'm only picking on that in a desperate attempt to regain some dignity from this horrible affair, but for God's sake, it was my first choice and I'm breaking up (or down?) inside. My first rejection. I... I don't know. I just don't know.  Ceff x

      That feeling returns. That feeling I get before my period when I feel really low, really down, like I'm all alone, no one wants to talk to me, they've all got something better to do, someone better to see; something more interesting to say.  One thing that's keeping me going is that Rich seems to be paying me some attention again- and telling a miserable, PMT-ridden girl that she's beautiful and damn good-looking isn't exactly the wrong thing to do... He wants to take Friday night off work to come and see me, which is sweet, but it's made me all dreamy. This tends to happen when I think there's a chance of me getting with someone; this time I see myself striding confidently into the Meeting House (somehow my bag, bedding and the art box have made their own way in) wearing my fabulous new outfit and walking past Richard as he stops, turns, stares etc. and eventually I return (after doing something irrelevant to pass the time) and he hugs me... and then he kisses me... and it becomes the start of some beautiful relationship where he never notices another girl (although most of the girls at JYF are prettier than me) and we can talk and have fantastic sex (even though his Peeny (Nod to Kat) is tiny) and go to gigs and he'd be original and agree with me that flowers are a cliche and he'd remember that I can't eat chocolates and that I think jewellery is boring and buy me a CD or a poster or something brilliantly original that only this perfect boyfriend would ever think of *breathe*. See why I hate love? I let my mind wander and then I find myself disappointed when Luke buys me a rose because it's "not original". I should be pleased that he's at least thinking about me.   But why settle for satisfied when you could be... happy?  After such a ridiculous outburst of stupid girly feelings, I will clarify that after such mental diarrhoea (sp?) I tell myself to stop being so stupid and that that will never, ever happen to me because it's way too far-fetched. What will normally happen is, I'll walk in, lots of people who I haven't seen in ages will come up to me, hug me, tell me how much weight I've lost, and he'll see me, think "WHY??" give me an uncomfortable hug and then follow Lucy Gemmell around for the whole weekend. I'll let you know.  Ceff x   So alone... Sometimes I swear that I can hear the dawning of a thoughtless world

      Mother Dearest and I went to B'ham today to the Turner Exhibition at the Art Gallery, and then went shopping and I bought my very first pair of CHUCK TAYLORS!! Eeeee they're soooo pretty, classic style but white with paint splodges all over them... soooo nice I want to wear them forever and ever. Which reminds me, I'm going to have to put my jeans in the wash soon... *sniffle*  Got a letter from the CSA today saying that Dad should be paying us exactly what he has been paying us for the last year. Well £9 more, but who counts pennies? Dad counts pennies, that's who! I got an e-mail from him when I got home saying that he's going to cut my pocket money by £9  and  make me pay my own phone bill because of this. My phone bill comes to roughly £10 per month, so when you work it out, for the extra £9 he's got to give the CSA, he's taking £19 away from me. Mum says I should just tell him to stick it all up his arse and say goodbye; refuse to see him again. Admittedly, it's tempting, but for some reason I can't. I don't think I'd want to be one of those kids with only one parent, it seems very scary. She apologised for giving me such a shit father as well. It amazes me how my parents are so different, when you think about it. She would never, ever dream of treating me like he has... when you cut to the chase, you can see that he hasn't thought through what he's doing, he's just penny-pinching and that no matter how many times and to how many people he says that I'm the most important thing in his world, I'll always know I'm second best to his own personal interests: What's best for him? How can he get as much money as possibly from his bitter ex wife and child? Fuck you. Fuck you. Even shoes can't help me now...  Ceff x   I often wonder how you feel when you're lying (next) to me...

      I was waiting for Elena outside the locker rooms today at the end of school, and I realised how bored I was. Everything is still the same as it was when I came to school; people have the same arguments, the same problems, they hate the same teachers; and no matter how many new buildings they build, that place will always, always be the same. And it's boring! I can see cycles being repeated over and over again in all the years, and I can see people in my year who've never changed. And don't even get me started on this town! Full of fucking nutters, teenage mothers and townies- nothing original and certainly nothing new. This school, this place will always hold happy memories and I will, of course, treasure the friends I've made, but right now I can't wait to get to university.  Ceff x   We gotta get out of this place...

      Hurrah! I have finally got rid of Kazaa. After one too many virus scares, rubbish search bars and bloody pop ups, I downloaded Win MX, which, although rather dull, comes with no extra software and does what I want it to do: download a song into My Music folder. I then deleted the whole 195 MB (biggest file EVER) of Kazaa and celebrated by downloading the new Lostprophets single successfully (on Win MX) for the first time. It's not a looped file, it's not Burn Burn under a different name, it's not quiet, it's not cut short, it's not live. It's not Kazaa!! Yippee!!

      HMPH. Much to (I assume) everybody's delight today, school was closed due to the snow. That's one good thing about it I suppose. It snowed on and off all day yesterday, except for the 20 minute period when I walked from school to the bus stop, where the temperature rose and the snow turned into huge great dollops of rain water, thoroughly soaking me. Thanks a lot. Other than that, yesterday was a pretty normal day, except that some cheeky year 10 or 11 made fun of my earmuffles. Stupid girl, does she not think I can hear her when I've got them on? They don't have music playing in them, dumbass. Although that would be cool...  HMPH. Valentine's Day is fast approaching and I am fast becoming more and more miserable about the whole red-coloured affair. No boyfriend, no crush, no life.   HMPH. Richard can't come to the JYF committee meeting. How selfish of him to deny me the perfect opportunity to decide to be mean to him but then not go through with it.  On the bright side, I have the whole of today to do lots of interesting things like my English coursework. Woo.  Ceff x   Game over, it's no fun...

      Oli rang me on Thursday, and we had a chat and as I put the phone down, the relief that spread through my body was just unbelievable. He's fine. He was just stressed about finding a new flat for his 2nd year because he felt like his flatmates all had loads more money than him. Phew!  So, on to cheerier things: 2 gigs this weekend! Friday night saw the return of Hidden In Plain View and (swoon) The Early November, this time at the Little Civic in Wolverhampton, the only local gig venue I hadn't been to besides Flapper & Firkin. Hidden In Plain View were much improved from their performance at Academy last week, the practice must have done them some good! Yourcodenameis: Milo (yes that is their name), however, were not such a great prospect. They had decent enough songs, but they were possibly the least charismatic band I have ever seen live. Ever. They just sort of... stood there. The Early November, of course, were fantastic- witty, sociable, in time and armed with a bunch of really cool songs, they get better and better every time I see them.  The Little Civic is the oddest venue I've ever been to; for a start, it has carpet, and the walls are covered, several times over, by tour posters. Someone's written "STUPID TOWNIES" on the So Solid Crew one. Ha. And someone drew glasses and a moustache on Amy Lee's face, which also amused me greatly.  Went shopping on Saturday for much needed jumpers, after I realised that the only ones I have are giant ones that you wear on a Sunday morning when you've got your period and haven't washed your hair. Bought three; Stripy one from Gap for £6.99 (reduced from £36, Kerching!), and two others from H&M, one stripy and one plain blue. Also got some new Dreadys from Editions, proper ones with a fixed waistband and a fly! *silly grin* They're soooo nice and comfy and I will wear them all the time for ever and ever. Obviously I will have to wash them at some point, but we can cross that bridge when we come to it...  Went to the final local gig venue I'd never been to, Flapper & Firkin, last night to see Edd's band Echidna play live. They were surprisingly good, quite punky and tuneful but also, unlike other local bands I've seen, in time with each other. Kat has just informed me that one of Sean's friends fancies me and I cringed inside every time Kayla mentioned Rich, but other than that it was a good evening. Went to Hard Rock Cafe, where I ran into Draper while waiting outside for my mum. Gave him a hug for his 18th birthday and was puzzled by his purchase of a £9 cigar. Oh well.  So, all's well that ends well and everything is back to normal. Dammit.  Ceff x   Don't get me wrong if I'm acting so distracted

      I can't concentrate. On anything. Not school, or TV, or anyone's conversations. I check my phone every 2 minutes (shit! where is it?? Hang on...... got it) to see if I've got a message, a call, anything. From Oli. I got an answering machine message from him one morning saying he needed to talk to me about something because he trusted me, and that neither his mum nor mine could know about it. I'm so scared; what if he's in trouble? What if he's got something wrong with him? At first I thought it was a hoax, but after 2 texts and 2 voice messages I began to wonder. I rang him on Wednesday morning to tell him I was here and he could call me today, but he hasn't... I'm so scared. I keep trying to tell myself it's probably something not so big: maybe he wants to change his course at uni, maybe he accidentally kissed Paul, maybe he and Victoria broke up. Maybe him and Victoria broke up because he accidentally kissed Paul... but naturally I keep coming back to the worst of the worst: he's got cancer, he's got AIDS, he's murdered someone, he's dealing drugs, he's been rap... No. NO NO NO.  Scared x   I'm holding on for you.

      Today's pop-ups seem to imply more failure in my life:  "Failed UCAS? Try one of our online degree courses for people too stupid to figure out how to open the door and go to their local college! So easy to sign up for, and only $93482939958686 per year!"  "Hey you, fatso! Your diet clearly isn't working. Try ours instead! For just $29495930059393 dollars a month, you can't afford not to (you fat fucker)!"  Ah, how I wish I could live the American dream...  Ceff x   Nicotine, valium, vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol... c-c-c-c-c-cocaine...

      Pop-ups keep, well, popping up at me. Ones that say "find your perfect love match at I'm-desperate.com". Are they trying to tell me something?  Ceff x   Just once, I think I'd like to see you get it on with me

      The typical has happened. I'm thinking about Sean. 2 days of over analysing his behaviour at Home Grown and telling myself I don't fancy him has made me start *thinking*. Waiting for texts. Going online to see if he's online; Going offline if he's not. And I don't fancy him! I know I don't, it's just that I don't fancy anyone else at the moment and he was so nice to me on Tuesday... argh I'm so useless! All they have to do is *lean* and *hug* and tell me I look great and I turn into a big mushy pile of soppy goo on the floor. He probably doesn't even fancy me, he didn't before and I haven't changed, personality-wise, so it's not like suddenly he's decided to fancy me. Or have I changed? Is it something to do with me looking considerably better than I did a year ago (albeit still nothing very special)?  Ceff x   And I wonder if I'm alone in your head...

      It's been another odd day. Not because weird things have happened, but I've just felt weird, you know? Everything seems to affect you more or seem generally more imposing than it normally is, even colours. I woke up at about 9am due to the slight problem of not being able to breathe properly because my nose felt like someone had shoved foaming plughole cleaner up there- sort of tingly but with no room for anything to move. Dad and Wicked Stepmother left the house at 11.30am and 10am respectively, leaving me and Em in the house together. I don't know why, but often I dread being left alone with her. I know I can cope, there are plenty of distraction techniques if she gets too much, but I just feel uncomfortable. We walked to the pub to meet Dad and Wicked Stepmother; I wanted to go on my own really, but there was no chance of doing that.   Our afternoon's activity was going to see Lost In Translation at Warner Village; after all the hype and stuff it wasn't as brilliant as I expected it to be. Sure, the acting was good, the setting was really appropriate, the script was sharp and different, but there was something missing, for me anyway. I think I've finally worked out what "type" of films I like, and it's the ones with that child-like element of dream and imagination; Peter Pan was wonderful for that, everything was so innocent and at the same time your imagination ran wild without digressing from the plot. The same goes for Harry Potter and even Velvet Goldmine, although there was nothing child-like about that. But anyway, I'm waffling: Lost In Translation was an excellent film, Bill Murray is fantastic, but I think it was a little too... human for me.  I had an odd ten minutes after that, where I didn't want to talk to anyone. That was when everything became imposing; I made the excuse of going to the toilet just to get away from it all, but the cubicle walls seemed to lean in on me so I got out. Em sped off because she got all moody and Dad was just too huge (physically and psychologically) an entity to comprehend and as I would never, ever go to Wicked Stepmother for any kind of mental comfort, I was a bit stimid. I came round though; I always do.   Dad and WS have gone out tonight with some friends of theirs for a balti in Worcester, and Em and I have had an OK time so far. The people Dad and WS have gone out with are the parents of 3 teenage boys: one at university, one in my year (who happens to be GORGEOUS) and one in year 10, who I've offered to sort-of babysit on his first gig, if he wants me to go with him, because Jack (middle boy) refuses to- I'm not really bothered as long as it involves swapping e-mail addresses...  So that brings us to right now. Another day where nothing much has really happened and yet my own mood has managed to turn it into a day worth writing about. Or maybe I've done that so I can spend some time avoiding people by writing this Blog...  Ceff x   Love's the funeral of hearts...

      I take it all back. Fuck father-daughter interaction. I wanna go home, now.   Once more, it is a Friday night and I am on the internet, talking to my friends at HOME, away from my REAL family, while Em, Dad and Wicked Stepmother have a gay old time in the living room listening to Bon Jovi. Bon fucking Jovi. The acoustic album, no less. Could it get any worse? Well, yes. The subject of money could come up. The fact that, despite all our best efforts to conduct legal proceedings regarding maintenance in a civil, neutral manner, he still decides to ring up the CSA (Child Something Agency) and claim that he can't afford to pay a poultry £143 per month for my keep. Thanks a fucking bunch Dad, You tell me I'm the most important thing in the world to you, that you love me more than anyone else in your life, and then you try and make me feel as worthless as possible, financially and emotionally. On top of that, this stupid cheap internet connection keeps cutting out, leaving me marooned, sniffling and with a sore throat, with nothing but The Early November and Kerrang! for company. Rock and Roll...  But, on a lighter note, and I will try to make it light (promise), Zeb's party last night was very good. There weren't as many people there as I expected, but it was still a highly amusing evening for the following reasons:  1. The buffet consisted entirely of sweets and vodka jelly shots 2. The stripper was ugly, tubby and had a Teeny Peeny 3. The outfits were highly amusing 4. I Had drinks but didn't get drunk 5. I danced enough to feel I had balanced the effects of eating lots of sweeties from the buffet  Unfortunately my chirpyness this morning was destroyed by my choking on a throat lozenge in the car on the way to school, leaving me breathless and with a sharp pain in my chest; thankfully the pain subsided after a while but the tiredness remained for the rest of the day. Rock and Roll...  Ceff x   Do you regret your loneliness?

      I am muchly pleased with my new Blogness, henceforth I have decided to make up some new wordage to celebremate this glorifous eventage. Ok enough of that. So! Last night... Drive Thru... 4 bands...9 quid... one great evening. I waited with great anticipation for this year's "Next Big Thing" Hidden In Plain View, and was thoroughly disappointed. They tried a little too hard to be just like Finch and yet be chirpy at the same time, without having the emotion, tuning or timing of aforementioned band.   Official opinion:  "Developing". But if they carry on the way they are, destined to be every emo band's support until emo goes out of fashion.  And of course, The Early November were a stunning example of newly created genre (made up by me) emo-pop-punk-rock, being everything from brutal to sensitive in the space of a half-hour set. Wonderful.  Official opinion:  "Exceeding targets". Way outperformed HIPV and really set the standard for the headliners. Very deserving of the newly-invented(by Sean) Ceff's Seal of Approval, cannot wait for their own tour.  As the lights went down and a large, circular space formed in the middle of the pit, my heart rate began to increase and I started to shake. Memories of the last Home Grown sprang to mind and I began to wonder whether standing by the bar would be a better option. But after two fantastically executed examples of pop-punk, I thought "What the hell. If you can't beat them, join them" and so I did. And had a fab time bouncing around with Sean, surviving the occasional scary moment and generally enjoying myself.   Official Opinion:  "Great". We met the lead singer and he was very appreciative of me coming to all three of Home Grown's Birmingham gigs. Really nice guy, great songs and despite the scary following, I still think they're gonna be huge.  By this time, due to technical (or, as HG put it, "testicle") problems, it's 10.15 and Allister still haven't arrived onstage. Not good for Sean, who has to leave at 10.30, and not good for me, who has no one to hang out with after Sean leaves. The band finally arrived at 10.20 and played a measly 3 songs before Sean had to leave, to my disappointment. Afterwards, however, they put on a good clean show and really showed off their talents and gave a really tight performance. Great stuff!  Ceff x   Somewhere down on Fullerton, there's a place we used to go to get away from it all...

      I feel strangely calm today. Perhaps it's because I'm at my dad's house. Stop looking confused, I know what you're thinking: that I hate it there; I feel trapped, marooned, distanced from my own little world. But ever since I started work at Marks & Sparks and going to dad's house involved me arriving, eating, sleeping and leaving in the space of 24 hours, I've felt restless; I think it's because, as much as I don't like it, coming to Worcester and seeing my dad has become a part of me, and (I think) it's important for me to get that experience of father-daughter interaction. Or perhaps I'm content because I've found someone to go to Drive Thru with me :o) Love you Sean! Debbs is gonna come see Hundred Reasons with me as well, so all I need to find now is a gig partner for Mest and Less Than Jake... anyone?  Ceff x   'Cos this life is too short to live it just for you, but when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?

       Let's get drunk, you can drive us to the harbour, Wish upon a star, but do you know what stars are? Balls of fire, burning up the black space, Falling from the landscape, Exploding in the face of God  Let's get crazy, talk about our big plans, Places that you're going, places that I haven't been, Build my walls up, concrete castle, Keep this kingdom free of hassle, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  But I hear sound echo in the emptiness all around  What you can't change is loneliness Look at what you've found, I'm falling down  Taste the saline rolling down your cheekbone, Tell me that you’re alone, tell me on the telephone, Feel your heart, it breaks within your chest now, Try to get some rest now, Sleep’s not coming easy for a while, child  Child, yeah But I hear sound echo in the emptiness all around  What you can't change is loneliness Look at what you've found, I'm falling down  Down, down, down, down  But I hear sound echo in the emptiness all around  What you can't change is loneliness Look at what you've found, I'm falling down Look at what you've found, I'm falling down   This song is so beautiful... I want to spread my arms and lean back and just float, carefree, in the air as I listen to it.  New Year was... interesting. The venue for the party was very "Rugby Club" as my mother put it, but we made the best of it and other than that the trips were fab and the weather was bright and sunny, if not cold Highlight of the few days was mine and Sel's foot bath at 3.30am on New Year's day, both of us quite drunk, both of us... talking in German. But for some reason I don't wanna talk about this. I don't want to have to explain all the little in-jokes that we made up, or what it was like being lifted over an iron fence in a ball gown and 4 inch stillettos to climb a muddy hill to watch fireworks, or how fun it was to walk around the bohemian region singing Elephan Love Medley; it was fun, and that is that.  Rich is on my mind. I don't feel anything for him (honest). Which is why I keep thinking about him. I think about how I felt about him a month ago, how he treated me and how he's going out with Kayla now, but I feel nothing. Not anger, not pain, not sadness. I don't understand it; I tell people how I feel used, and I do, but then they get angry and I have to pretend how I'm still seething because he treated me exactly the same as he did the last time I fell into his arms. It's my own fault though! I know what he's like! I knew that eventually, sooner or later, he'd bail on me, and I think somewhere deep inside me, I knew it'd be sooner. But his arms...the way they fitted around me... Now now, let's not go down that road, Jess, look where you ended up last time. Jealous of your short, tubby sister because a stocky, blonde, scarred (emotionally and physically), self-centred boy liked her instead of you. My new year's resolutions this year are:  1. No one, especially not Richard Garvey, will take advantage of me. I will be strong and confident and I will  not  be treated like a doormat or a sex toy. 2. Let my nails grow. 3. Lose more weight. 4. Keep reminding myself that I am strong, confident, independent, pretty, intelligent, funny and all those other things that I convinced myself I wasn't when I was fat. 5. Smile more: genuine smiles that make me and the person I'm smiling at feel good. 6. Write more letters and send more birthday cards. Show people that I care. 7. Go to as many 18th birthday parties as possible!  There. Now I have some healthy objectives, ones that will really improve my own personal well being- talk about detox! I've also blocked Luke from my MSN list, and I am considering deleting his numbers from my phone book. Sorry babe, the friends thing? Not gonna happen. We're just not compatible. Oh and also I'd like to get into Leeds University. Please?  Ceff x   You are my reason for breathing...

      Boom. And suddenly we all fall down. It was all too good to be true. People were getting better, making progress, settling down. And then someone, somewhere presses their self-destruct button and everything falls apart. I know, I know, every family has their problems, their wayward members, but when it's your own it seems 100% worse. It hurts to see Oli suffer; I want to give him a hug and tell him everything will be OK- but will it? Besides, he's in Edgbaston, and my arms aren't that long. Dad hasn't contacted me since I left his house on the 19th; it's the 29th today. Ellie's dad hasn't spoken to her in over a month, so I shouldn't complain really, and Oli's parents haven't spoken to him in over two. It all started with him though. Dad. He makes a big fuss, we fight, I cry, he apologises over an E-MAIL and somehow I find it in myself to forgive him. Again. It's always about money, too. I hate that stuff. You either don't have enough, or you've got too much, and when you don't have enough you feel bad because you can't help, and when you've got too much you feel bad because you're not sure if you should help out or not, because in the past there's been problems. Problems you didn't even know about until last week, problems that have been around for years. Why does nobody ever tell me??? It's worse finding everything out now all at once, than finding things out bit by bit. Nobody told me I had a fucking sister until I was 11, for God's sake. On slightly different yet equally pitiful note, I screwed my Leeds interview up. I got facts wrong, I was nervous and I didn't know the answer to half the questions they asked, but eventually I relaxed a little and got a bit more confident. I doubt I've got in, though. Everyone in my family (except maybe my mum) seems to have a self-destruct button, and someone's pressed theirs. I wonder where mine is...  OK, this paragraph is gonna be about good stuff. Promise. I went to another of Edd's gigs on Saturday! Ed Blann was there! I flirted with him! I wasn't thinking about Rich and now I don't care about him! OK now it's just over the top. So yeah, I flirted with him, I don't fancy him as such but it made me feel good and realise that Rich is a fool with a tiny penis and I can do better. I spent the afternoon with Sam and Kat yesterday, who threw lots of compliments my way and made me laugh and smile and forget about everything. JYF in two weeks- I can't wait. Jack's 18th birthday party was last night; it was thoroughly boring and there was no one to dance with, but lots of Jack's relatives who I hadn't seen in a while said how nice I looked, so that was nice :o)  I don't need any of that, though. I don't need to know how nice I look nowadays, even though it's nice. I don't need to go out and flirt, even though it makes me feel sexy. I need a cuddle. I need friendly arms around me, a tissue (yes, me, needing a tissue) and an understanding ear.  Ceff x   There was just one, at the top of a pile of one million...

      So! This week. Much rushage has occurred because of 2 coursework pieces due in on Friday (tomorrow, the day of my Leeds interview). School photos arrived this week aswell, leading to gangs of girls sitting around making self-pitying comments in the hope someone will pay them a compliment:  "My hair is fluffy" "My eyebrows are wonky" "My nose is shiny" "I've got a double chin" "I shouldn't have worn that top"  Get over it. It's done now, and if you want a different picture for the yearbook, shut up and find one. If you still want a decent, professional-looking photo then you're going to have to cough up the cash elsewhere. I can understand people being disappointed with their pictures, and that's fine. But PLEASE stop going on about it. Hmm, what else has happened... Nope, I think that's about it really. What an exciting life I lead!  I was talking to Kayla earlier. She's staying at Rich's house because she's feeling stressed and needs some support in order to sort herself out. Her MSN name last week was "Namarie Fairy In Love". In Love. In fucking Love. It's going to kill me, seeing them together at JYF, I just know it; I plan to snuggle up to my friends and hide away from them and their "In Love"-ness. And it's such a shame, because I really like Kayla. I am, of course, dubious about her choice of men, but that's nothing to hold against anyone. She's lovely and she deserves better. But why do I want him if she's too good for him? I don't consider myself below her... I keep telling myself, it's fine, it's fine, move on, move on, but I'm kidding myself. It's such a horrible feeling, waiting for a couple to break up.   Just waiting.  Ceff x   I'm just another score

      Haven't blogged in a while...  Went to see Lostprophets on Thursday; totally amazing gig, Ian was way hot as usual- the support bands were shite but we had fun communicating by writing out what we wanted to say in the "Write Message" sections of our phones, lol... Sean was there, don't think he fancies me. Typical me, overanalysing someone just being nice. Valentine's Day came and went without excitement, except for a present from my mum of a little Jellycat with a shiny heart- ahhh. :o)  Sunday, Oli came over for dinner; I'm really worried. I found out why he really rang me in the middle of the night. And the most annoying thing is that I can't tell you (whoever may read this) about it, because it's... it's difficult. I haven't been told not to tell anyone, but I don't want to, because it's uncomfortable; it'd be a horrible feeling, having to tell everyone how what I thought was true, wasn't really at all... So for now, I will carry on like I only know what I knew on Saturday, and not what I found out on Sunday night.  Went to Dad's today. The sound of his voice makes me feel like someone's scraping their nails down a blackboard right behind me *shudder*. He's so loud! And he just spouts such crap all the time. He talks shit and he thinks he's right but in the end, he's just talking so he hears his own voice. Shut. the fuck. up.  Ceff x   A million miles from home...

       Switchfoot: Meant To Live    Fumbling his confidence,  And wond’ring why the world has passed him by;  Hoping that he’s meant for more than arguments,  And failed attempts to fly, fly   We were meant to live for so much more... Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside, Somewhere we live inside, We were meant to live for so much more... Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside   Dreaming about Providence, And whether mice or men have second tries;  Maybe we’ve been livin with our eyes half open,  Maybe we’re bent and broken, broken   We were meant to live for so much more...  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside  Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more...  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside   We want more than this world’s got to offer;  We want more than this world’s got to offer; We want more than the wars of our fathers, And everything inside screams for second life   We were meant to live for so much more...  Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live for so much more...  Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live for so much more...  Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live, We were meant to live.   This song is very cool. It's got this really dirty, sexy bassline and vocalist sounds like he really feels the song, which, of course, is the whole point of music. Feeling.  Talking of feelings, this past couple of days have brought me a mixture of them, from a numb Friday, a blissful Saturday and an empty Sunday, to a pissed-off Monday. The numbness came when I saw my dad. I felt nothing. I saw him and I just felt nothing. Which in a way could be worse than any of the other emotions, because it's like my brain is saying "You're so low you're not even worth a reaction at all, let alone a bad one". I was quiet for most of the evening, I didn't really feel like talking to him. I spoke to Wicked Stepmother; although I fundamentally hate her, I respect the fact that she hasn't tried to get actively involved in the past week. Despite his "poverty-stricken" status, Dad managed to cough up the cash for two new CDs and a top for me on Saturday afternoon, much to my delight (and secret anger- if he was giving me the right money I could have bought the damn top myself). Then I got on the coach back to Brum and met the JYF committee in New Street...  Saturday night was fantastic. It cheered me up no end, sitting in Lailah's big brother's bedroom (he's at Uni) next to Matt, laughing and smiling about everything from Little Britain to cruel psychological experiments involving teaching children that green is yellow and doors are walls. You had to be there. Edd really seemed to shine on Saturday night; I didn't get pissed off with him at all and he even came and slept on (I must clarify ON, and not WITH) me during the night. We listened to Konstantine and I snuggled up to Matt and it was warm, happy and generally wonderful. On Sunday morning we said our goodbyes and I was once again in New Street...  Nothing much else happened on Sunday, but Monday came along too damn quickly and I soon wished it hadn't come along at all when I discovered Katie "The Herb" Herbert had virtually taken over our supposedly joint effort on the International Week quiz. I know, I shouldn't make such a big deal about it because it's only International Week, but she is just. so. ANNOYING! I gave her my disk with my international questions on this morning, only to discover she had "finished her Fair Trade questions last week", put up the answers around school and put the questions in form trays. To be fair, she doesn't know what I've been through inside my head this past week, but it just tipped me out of my tentative good mood into a thoroughly irritated one. Added to this, Frau Hitler-sorry-Mrs. Plummer, threw me out of the Library-sorry-Learning Resource Centre for having a bag, after I'd made it quite clear to her that I was in there for 5 minutes to try and print off an English essay. Bitch.  I've written quite a bit for someone who didn't really feel like blogging, haven't I? Oh, and did I mention that I got an interview at Leeds, and that I've fallen for Maroon 5?  Ceff x   Things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do

      I've always thought it was stupid to be afraid of a family member. Someone you've known for all of your life, who you trusted, loved, even. But as this weekend draws closer my nerves are getting worse and worse. I know that he'll be fine; he'll act like nothing's happened, like I didn't put the phone down on him 3 days ago, sobbing and screaming, like I'm just his little girl again. I want to tell him where to go; give him 5 years worth of repressed hatred and revenge. Doesn't he understand? Doesn't he know that when I look at him, the first thing I think is "He cheated on my mum. Bastard", or when I look at her the first thing I think is "You stole my Dad. Bitch"? Oh, I'm just repeating myself now. And it would seem silly, wouldn't it, me coming out with "I hate you, you left me, how could you etc." 5 years after I discovered what was going on. But I'm so much more confident and articulate now; and surely he's waiting for the backlash... or maybe I've left it so long that he thinks I'm "over" it. Can you ever "get over" it? Can you ever "get over" watching your Dad through the bay window of your living room as he packed his things and drove away to his new girlfriend without so much as a goodbye? It makes me sick to think about it.  Things I need for this weekend:  1. CDs- I would die without them. Seriously, if I didn't have my music I'd just stay in my room for 24 hours. Thinking about it, that sounds like a tempting option...  2. Notebook and pens- to review all the CDs I've brought with me! And to write down Blogs while dad's on the computer, spending money he should be giving me on horses.  3. Money- In case a sudden urge to shop/see a film on my own grabs me  4. Clothes- Girly dressing up sessions are always a great way to cheer yourself up!  5. Books- A wonderful way of being sociable by being in the room, but not having to talk to anyone at the same time- and interesting, too!  6. Walkman- for those long walks I'll be taking around the city centre...  Ceff x   Here's to you for bringing me down

      My mum e-mailed me today, telling me to be strong and that I should always know that he doesn't deserve me and that I should tell him so. She also said that we should think positively and know that we're in the right and to ignore all the bullshit around us. And I know that'll be hard, really hard this time, because I seem to be getting shat on from a variety of directions at the moment, but I'll try for her. The last thing I want to see is her suffering because of me. She's the most important person in my world and there is nothing that can stop me from not trying to make her happy.  I got an e-mail quiz thing off Rich today. One of those huge surveys about favourites and stuff, probably because Kayla does them all the time. There were lots of little references to her in it, including one about hoping he was in love. I keep telling myself he's a knob, and that he's not worth my time and effort, but I keep thinking about him. Like I said yesterday, I have no objections to the fact that they're happy together, but every time I see a reference to their relationship, or I see Kayla giggling at a text he's sent her, I feel this rage rushing up inside me and I just want to scream at her. Can't she see?? Can't she see that he's just a selfish, sex-mad little boy who only wants one thing?? Of course, it's all jealousy. If I was going out with him all that would be pushed to the back of my mind, or forgotten completely. And my trainers got dirty in the rain.  It's so hard; when I'm with my friends it's so much easier to forget about all this shit in my life, to get on with my work, smile, laugh and generally just mess about. But as soon as I step outside of the classroom, as soon as I walk out of the 6th form block to go somewhere, it all comes rushing back. I want to talk out loud. I want to say, not type, "I'm going through a load of crap with my dad at the moment", just so I can release some of this feeling that's all pent up inside of me. I don't have the energy to scream and shout and be angry. I simply have a lot of nerves, a dash of self-pity and an enormous sense of loss.  Ceff x   I often wonder how you drive when the road's too dark to see

      Ah, Valentine's Day. For some, a blissful reminder of their love for one another, a chance to celebrate the fact that they have found true happiness and an excuse for great sex. For others, it's a sharp, painful reminder of the lack of decent, trustworthy men in the world, a chance to wallow in your own self-pity and an excuse to buy a lot of alcohol.   I have no objection to couples; when I hear about new couples I always wish them well and I do genuinely hope that each party is happy, but there's always that voice in the back of my mind saying "How come all these people have partners and I don't? What's wrong with me?". If I ever voice these concerns, the standard reply comes back: "Don't worry Jess, you're gorgeous and it'll happen to you soon blah blah blah dreamy girly speak". I'm sure it will, I think one day I will find some wonderful man who really respects me, and it doesn't even have to be a boyfriend, just a man who wants to be affectionate and friendly, even fatherly. I just wish he'd hurry up and make himself obvious, because it seems like I'm getting left behind...  Ceff x   I'm not your star... Isn't that what you said?

      When you look at certain people, you automatically think certain things, which tends to affect your judgement. There's a girl in year 12, and every time I look at her, I think "Her dad died", which of course makes me want to be more "sensitive" around her. That happened with Helen for a while, but now not so much. I wonder what people think when they look at me. In year 8, did my classmates think "There's Jess... her parents are divorced"? Did my best friends, in fact, do my best friends think "There's Jess, her dad's a knob" every time they look at me? Or do they just see me, Jess, wisecrack, Less Than Jake fan, English geek? It almost makes me want to keep it all inside in case they start being more "sensitive". I wouldn't want that; well, obviously I wouldn't want them rubbing their "happy families" in my face, but I don't expect them to be asking me how I am or if I want to "talk". Hopefully they know by now that I'm not one to go around broadcasting intimate details of my private life to anyone that will listen; if anyone wants to know that I don't want sticking their nose into my life, I'll crack a joke. But that doesn't mean that it gives them the right to take the piss out of my family, or my situation. That applies to anyone, from Wicked fucking Stepmother to Rachel Bradley.  I don't wanna talk about my Dad tonight. I don't wanna talk about how worthless I feel, or how right now I couldn't care less if he keeled over and died in his new wife's arms.  Ceff x   To every broken heart in here, love was once a part but now it's disappeared...

      7 years. 7 bloody years of never, ever being late for school, only taking whole days off for illness if I physically couldn't get out of bed or open my eyes, and today, 4 weeks before I leave the damn place, and all the clocks and alarms in the house go CRAZY and somehow I wake up at 5 past 9 in the morning. "Grrr" just doesn't cover it.  The Leeds festival lineup was announced yesterday, prompting me to virtually explode with joy in my dad's car:  Confirmed: Green Day, 50 Cent, The Offspring, The Darkness, Ash, The Hives, Morrisey, The White Stripes and The Libertines.  Rumoured: Blink 182, Lostprophets and Funeral For A Friend.  *dies*  Joy also occurred yesterday at the re-discovery of not only MSG+ (doo doo doo-doo, doo doo-doo, doo doo-doo!) and a lil ole thing called Sick-Happy... watch this space ;o)  Musical update! Current interest: Hip hop. I downloaded half of the new NERD album and half of 50 Cent's album today and yesterday, which worries me in case I develop the urge to start a collection. But the NERD album is only £8.99 from CD Wow... ahh, the trials and tribulations of being a teenager.  Talking of trials and tribulations, I put my giant size 8s right in it yesterday by announcing to Coz that Kat had a spare boyfriend called Nigel who lived in Smethwick, which (somehow!!) seemed very real to him and made him get mad at Kat (boo). Tsch. I can't be arsed with boys right now (this is in no way influenced by yesterday's event, it just relates to it slightly); they just seem to get in the way. This summer, I want to hang out with my friends, drink, party, go to gigs and generally chill out before I pack my bags and go to uni; a boyfriend just doesn't figure in the equation. Good! :o)  Ceff x   Was a po' nigga, now I'm a rich nigga...

      Ugh. Uggggghh. UGGGHHHHH. I feel like a big blob of goo on the floor, all icky and flattened. I got so pissed off this morning after being promptly told to "get over" the fact that one of my friends thought Kris was "pervy", "creepy" and "weird". God forbid I try and fucking defend a close friend, I'm soooo sorry that my friends don't live up to your standards. Stop thinking you're better than everyone. Combine that with an inability to breathe and total writer's block, and the result is something akin to being kicked. Hard. Twice.  UGGGGHHHHHH x   All time lows

      Yes, yes, I am a truly terrible person who never Blogs and I should think about how I would feel if someone else didn't blog when I wanted them to. Or something. I would go and sit in my room and think about what I've done, but then I wouldn't be blogging. So! Much time has passed since the last Blog, the Day Count is now in minus numbers and I am officially ill.  1. Results Day. I was being all cool, telling myself that even if my results were worse than they were before (which they wouldn't be) it was fine because I can always use the ones from before. Of course, when the time came and I found that I had actually dropped a grade in one of my modules (C to a D), I got pissed off. On the other hand, my second retake module went from a D to a B so that's pretty good, but I'm still stuck with an overall grade C and a shitload of work to do before the exams.  2. JYF. What a relief. It was a bit anticlimatic in some ways; I didn't get into my diary that much and there were very few people there, but we still had a laugh and I got lots of hugs and kisses. I think I almost pulled Kris, but I'm not sure. We got very close one night; I dunno, maybe I'm over-analysing again. In fact, yes, I am over-analysing because that's what I do. Bad squishy.  3. Hundred Reasons. I finally managed to drag myself to the Academy on Monday night, thoroughly unenthused at the prospect of having to stand and watch stuff for 4 hours when I could be catching up on some sleep. As it was, the gig was great and Hundred Reasons put on a wicked show, so it was alright in the end.  4. Maroon 5. Amazing band, amazing songs. Shame about the company. Liz, Gaz and Jon went with me, 2 of whom I count as friends and the other I think is very cool, so I was well up for an excellent night out. Unfortunately, Liz and Jon had a blazing row (including tears, shouting and walking off) and Gaz had brought a date, which sort of turned me into a 5th wheel. Still, it's all about the music, right?  The aftermath of all this galavanting is that I now have a horrible coldy-flu type thing, which has been blocking up my nose, ears and throat for the last 4 days. Ugh. Well, at least the weather's starting to improve.  Ceff x   Things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do

      Hola! Life is still unbelievably good, I just don't understand it... The sun is shining, I'm going to Leeds, I'm getting good marks, JYF is approaching fast and according to Debbs, Chris actually likes me... of course, at this point in the conversation I climbed into my jumper and hid under the table, but still, it's a nice feeling, isn't it? :o) I texted him today, just to say hey and (*gasp*) ask him if he wanted to meet up sometime... I suppose I should write something naughty about the thrill of the chase, but... ahhh. :o)  The unfortunate thing about being happy, of course, is that you have nothing to write about; nothing to over-analyse, nobody to rant about. Just sunny, happy feelings. How annoying!

      Mmmm. Parties. Mmmm. Boys. Mmmm. Boys at parties... I did it! I pulled! His name is Chris and he's a friend of Debbs's boyfriend Matt; he lives in Four Oaks and goes to Arthur Terry, and he's doing History, Psychology, English Lit and... wait for it... RS! He went to V last year, he likes Muse and the Chilis; he's tall, skinny, brown, floppy almost-emo hair with blonde highlights and a sort of goatee (but it's not rank, and it didn't get in the way ;o)), but best of all, he wears Chucks! I was in the kitchen and he came in and somehow we ended up with our arms around each other, then Laura came in and said "kiss him" so I gave him a kiss on the cheek, so Laura got irritated and went to get more drinks for us, leaving me and he alone in the kitchen... needless to say, by the time Laura returned we didn't need the drinks ;o)   The rest I can't be bothered to relate in much detail. We talked a lot and kissed a lot, then as he left he told me it was "delightful" to meet me (great!) and I got his number... :o)  So suddenly my life is good. And it's not just good, it's really good. I'm not "not unhappy", I'm actually really happy. I have purpose and direction when it comes to work and love, and I'm calm and content. Of course, there's always that nagging feeling in the back of my head: "don't get too comfortable or pleased with yourself; it could all go wrong as soon as it all went right", so I'm being careful. I'm not imagining scenarios between me and Chris of us visiting each other at University, or having some sort of wonderful, magical relationship. But I would really like to see him again, because he was really nice- he got my sense of humour, he's intelligent and he wears the  best  shoes... :o)   DAY COUNT  Results Day: 4 JYF: 5 Hundred Reasons: 7 Maroon 5: 8  Ceff x   Just a dream, just an ordinary dream, as I wake in bed, and the boy, just an ordinary boy, was it all in my head?

      Life is good, life is great, I am fab and everything is right again. I got into Leeds! That particular piece of news sent last night into a frenzy of hyperactive dancing, screaming and quoting Finding Nemo. Everything is fabulous! I feel happy, slim and successful. I know where I'm going; I've got a purpose. Good things are happening to me, for once - Yay!   I've got this strange hyperactive energy, I haven't felt tired at all, in fact the entire opposite: I want to run around and shout and sing and dance because I know where my life is going! I know what I have to do to get where I want to go, and I know that I'll definitely be going there if I do it. Talk about motivation, huh?

      Today was a good day. Besides the fact that German orals are approaching at a speed faster than the time it took Elena to go from the English room to Claire Masters and bitch about me, I've had a quite smiley day. I spent the lunchtime with Helen because the gang (sans Scooby, unfortunately) went for pizza, one of those things I can no longer enjoy doing. It made a really nice change; I don't get to talk to Helen all that often and we had a laugh and listened to *K*. I've discovered its beauty (again). Mmmm.  I've made a decision!  It is not important for me to take a date to the leavers ball.  It is not necessary for me to go looking for someone to take with me just so that I won't look like a loner. The leavers' ball is exactly what it says on the tin: a ball for the school leavers. Not a ball for school leavers and their boyfriends, not a ball for school leavers and who they managed to drag with them in case they looked like they couldn't get themselves a man. So if I get a date, I do, and if I don't, then... I'm with Becky!  There are two people on the car park wearing shell suits. Intriguing.  Word of the week:  Whoopah!  Don't ask me why, but I just keep saying it.   DAY COUNT  Results Day: 9 JYF: 10 Hundred Reasons: 13 Maroon 5: 14  Ceff x   Are you safe to leave behind every anchor in your mind?

      I feel better today, stronger. I cheered up a lot after Blogging yesterday, partially due to talking to Sam and knowing that he was there for me, and partially due to listening, strangely, to a lot of hip hop. New additions to my mp3 collection include NERD and 50 Cent, who make me want to dance everything away. Sam was wonderful; I don't remember what he said, but he seemed to make me feel safe. Oh I remember now- we were talking about our afternoon in town on Saturday, and he said "you guys are my happy pills" :o)... He let me know that he was there for me if I needed him, which sometimes is better than trying to give advice, I think.  Went to the dentist's today, and came away with a shiny new filling! Goody. How I love free healthcare- not only do they repair your teeth for you, dentists like to numb half of your face for nearly 5 hours instead of payment! I spent lunchtime acting like a stroke victim: all numb on one side and having to eat everything in tiny little pieces. Now the numbness has worn off (thank god: I didn't mind that so much, but the inability to speak properly was beginning to piss me off) and I am left with a dull ache in the back of my mouth where the needle went in. Ouch.  Currently listening to the new Hundred Reasons album: it's not as good as their debut, but come on, it's not like anyone expected them to produce another classic like that without a little practice. It's not bad though- it's got oomph and emotion and it'll probably transfer really well into a live setting. Yay!

      Hehehe. I am SUCH a cheapskate, but at the same time, SUCH a genius. Have invented a new website,  urlLink These trusty chords , which has photos and my reviews on. The reviews that are on there are basically the ones that aren't on  urlLink SickHappy , although I may transfer those ones aswell seeing as the site is pretty dead. The photos are ones I want to add to blogs, but instead of paying for Blog*spot pro or whatever it's called, I'll put the photos I want to show you on there (for free!), and then put links to them! Genius! So that's the background. Click  urlLink here  to see photos from the Third Enigma show.  This has no relevance to any of the previous stuff, but I have to get it off my chest: the adverb "basically". STOP USING IT!! We had to present some information we'd researched on various parts of grammar today, and bloody hell, the number of times "basically" was used in a descriptive statement was just ridiculous. When it comes to my turn I will make a determined effort not to use it. If I do, I will reprimand myself severely; starving seems appropriate, but only because I have eaten like a big fat carbohydrate covered pig for the last 3 days. Bad squishy.  The "leaver's ball" debate continues... which leaver will get to go? Hehehe. "Babble babble bitch bitch", as Mazza would say.

      Hola, yes, bad squishy no blog. Please, reader(s?), find it in your heart(s?) to forgive me. So anyway, my weekend was great! Which is a refreshing change, as usually nothing of any great significance or fun happens and I return to school on Monday with nothing to think about to get me through the week. Friday night, went to see  urlLink Coz's band  at a random school in Lichfield. After two support bands, of whom I will refrain from judging (KILL! KILL! KILL!), Third Enigma did their bit and I did a review. After much consultation with my in-house English consultant (Mum), it looks like this:  Third Enigma’s influences are very clear: their (annoyingly shortened) set echoes the likes of My Vitriol, Placebo, Muse and Radiohead. But don’t mistake strong direction for plain copying - the songs are played with such energy and fervour that Third Enigma aren’t simply imitation Brit-rock. Recent addition Alex Collins gels with the band perfectly for his first show with TE, and it’s soon apparent that an extra guitarist really completes the sound.  After the feedback-fuelled beginning of RobotsMakingNoise, the troubled drawl of Self Esteem sets the tempo for a performance of high quality, driven songs. Most of them follow in the same, angst-ridden vein; the fluid guitar sound of Leave You Behind seems to swirl around the implausibly sweaty venue, while Extremes of Mild joins the ranks of punk in a spot of Dubya bashing. The set is brought to a crashing end with the same improv extravaganza as it began, rounding off a superb bunch of songs to great effect. Third Enigma has masses of enthusiasm, appeal and, most of all, potential; all they need is a little fine-tuning and a lot more of what we saw tonight. Accept no imitations.  It's pretty good, not my best but it could be worse. It was worse, in fact. But Coz seems pretty chuffed with it, so that's cool. But anyway, back to the story...  The band was wicked and then Coz, Kat, Dave, Oli, Sam, Kyle and I headed back to Coz's place for much  urlLink Muse  and talk of  urlLink Skittles , licking 9V batteries, disgusting pizza cake concoctions, drop kicking cats and Kyle taking a "running thrust" at Coz's TV. I didn't get to sleep until about 4am, at which point I was curled up on the floor with 3 other lads (Kyle was on the sofa). Ooer. I wish, hehehe. I woke up at about 8am and went and hung out with Sam and Oli outside in the sunshine for a bit (Coz's GIANT of a dog Murphy also joined us, who I had totally forgotten about since I last went to his house - in the words of Kyle: "I could LITERALLY ride him!!"), until Coz drove me home and I spent the rest of the weekend in the leisurely confines of Charter Place, outside, on a bench, the stereo at the window playing Rock Against Bush Vol. 1, watching a nice young man called Dom work up a sweat under the hot sun as he painted the front of Paul's house... rrrrr.   Incidentally, Rock Against Bush Vol. 1 is bloody good album. The best tracks (should you wish to download them) are:  Sum 41- Moron Alkaline Trio- Warbrain The Get Up Kids- Lion And The Lamb Descendents- Sad State Of Affairs Strung Out- No Voice Of Mine Pennywise- God Save The USA New Found Glory- No News Is Good News Less Than Jake- The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out  It may seem like a huge selection, but 8 really great tracks out of 26 is pretty fair, right? *grin* and there's a DVD! Of course, to counter balance the good time I'm having right now, I find myself wanting someone to share it with, but I know a relationship is just not practical before I go to Uni, it'd complicate things waaaaaay too much. Honest.  Ceff x   It's such a sad state of affairs, and I don't care...

      The terrible person within me who never, ever blogs because she is a lazy git has returned. Hola. Now is the time for a list:  1. Easter/The Zoo 2. Barnsley 3. Work 4. Dad 5. Comics 6. Miscellaneous  We are now in our second day of school after the poor excuse for a holiday that was Easter. I had lots of  urlLink driving lessons  and can now do left turns and... well, that's about it. We went to  urlLink The Zoo  on  urlLink Easter Sunday , and it was soooo cute and there were sooooo many cutesy lil  cute animals! There was a baby  urlLink elephant  and  urlLink lions  and  urlLink tigers  and best of all...  urlLink MEERKATS!  I want a pet one. Don't laugh! They're so sweet, all fluffy and squiggly and... aww. :o)  Went to Barnsley on Easter Monday. Stayed with my nan. I haven't done that since I was about 7. Oliver came over and we all discussed... stuff. It felt like some sort of horrible secret summit, a nasty little bitching session. Very odd. Dad found out about the whole sorry affair on Monday, and he seemed strangely accommodating about the whole thing. What is wrong with all my family members? Hee hee.  Work, to be specific, revision, is looming ever faster towards me, being all scary and huge. I keep telling myself "It's OK, I have a whooole month before exams" and then I remember my German oral which is on the 6TH OF MAY (sob), and then my heart starts to beat faster and I feel sick. Blergh.  Dad is scaring me. He's going all out on the "you're my favourite daughter" routine. From New York, not only did he bring me the hat I requested, but some choccie lip balm, a note book, a Hard Rock Cafe pin and two tops! Mum reckons some of it was meant for Em... hehe. Apparently she was meant to come to Dad's house this weekend but he said something "wrong" on the phone the other day and she got all stroppy. Oh well, at least now I get the best bed for a bit longer....;o) I'm a bit apprehensive because this weekend I'm going to have to discuss  urlLink Uni  fees; we've been getting on so well since  urlLink Em  fucked off and I'd rather not jeopardise that by bringing up the ever painful subject of money. It always turns things sour.  What's next on the list? Ahhh, comics! Ed Blann has made me a compulsive webcomic reader; not only am I reading all of  urlLink his  comics, but 3 others:   urlLink Questionable Content , which is about some indie kids who may or may not fancy each other   urlLink Count Your Sheep , which is about a little girl called Katie and her imaginary friend Ship, who just so happens to be a sheep   urlLink Chugworth Academy , which I started reading today. It's about a group of naughty teenagers supposedly at high school in the good ole US of A, and their lives in general.  Help me. I think I have a comic problem. Looking back I also think I have a hyperlink problem. Still, I need the practice, right?  In other news, I have decided I am going to actually DO something with my hair. Mum got me some volumising shampoo for me today, and she's gonna trim it for me (finally!) and highlight it. She also suggested putting a broad pink stripe in it somewhere... hopefully it'll turn out alright... meep! I've also started listening to "North" again...it's such a smooth album and some of the tracks make me go all *mmm*. Ooh, and I randomly downloaded this thing from Microsoft which has made me a database of all my mp3s! Genius! If only it could do that with my CD collection... which reminds me, new  urlLink New Found Glory  album, Catalyst, in the shops, 17th May!! Bring it on! The new single, All Downhill From Here, is released the week after and I've already downloaded. Sweet as.    PLUG PLUG PLUG : Buy Rock Against Bush, show your support for a)  urlLink Fat Wreck , b)punk rock and c)MVC- it's only £4.99 if you buy it from there and it's got about 294958939394 tracks on it from some wicked bands.  Ceff x   Catalyst, you exist to pull me down...

      According to my horoscope, this is what I should be doing. And it was the Observer horoscope, so obviously it's true. Talking of the Observer, there was a giant article about blogging in their Review section yesterday. Although it feels good to be ever so slightly ahead of the "trend", I am slightly annoyed because mine and Kat's *thing* has now been broadcast to the entire nation, and suddenly everyone will want one. Just like punctuation and Lynne Truss. Gah. But I digress; as I said, in accordance with said horoscope, I am doing my best to remain as sunny as possible. I had a good driving lesson today, relaxed and went at (wait for it) over 30mph! Zoom zoom zoom. I am also digging out as many summery CDs and songs as I can find, including these albums:  A -  Hi Fi Serious The All-American Rejects - The All-American Rejects Less Than Jake - Hello Rockview  and these songs:  Nelly - Ride Wit Me Fenix TX - Surf Song Letters To Cleo -  I Want You To Want Me Self - Stay Home (Shrek soundtrack)  I also dressed up in my brand spanking new Sandra D outfit (minty green strapless dress, matching baby doll shoes and white cardy) and pranced around the house singing and celebrating the fact that the dress is a size 14. Yippee!  Inevitably, as the sun makes brief appearances, the number of people in the car park rises. I like the car park; it's like a microcosm of the world right outside my window. Everything happens there, and I see it all, hee hee hee... I've noticed a strange increase in the number of punks hanging around. Not skater kids, or random people with baggy jeans and hoodies, but proper punks with tights jeans and anarchy symbols stitched, printed, carved or otherwise attached to skin, bags and clothes. I will watch this development with careful interest... talking of punk, I was reading the Bible-sorry- Kerrang last night and I think they've FINALLY pinned down a definition of today's punk:  "Bending the system to your advantage"  Simple and, well, not very punk, but effective enough. It covers all manner of sins, including Good Charlotte. The only thing is, it was in an article about Mest, who, in case you were unaware (which you probably were because I haven't told anyone), I've gone right off. Eugh- Mest.  Ceff x   I love the way you roll excuses off the tip of your tongue, as I slowly fall apart...

      After the (generally) upbeat tone of the last post, I find myself 3 days into the Easter holidays with nothing to do and an enthusiasm only to sit at the computer, doing nothing, which isn't really bloggable material. The most interesting thing to happen today was a phone call from Dad: Wicked Stepmother has a new job with HMI (Her Majesty's Inspectors- to put some perspective on the magnitude of this job, Ofsted is their bitch), which according to Dad, will incur "changes". Ones that he refuses to talk about on the phone. Intriguing. It's probably not to do with money, although I won't rule it out; mum says HMI get moved around the country at the drop of a hat, so maybe they're moving away... I don't know how I feel about that. I seem to be getting on with Dad at the moment, so him moving away might make me unhappy. Mind you, if you'd asked my in February I couldn't have cared less where he went, as long as he suffered a horrible car crash on the way there and died a horrible death in a horrible way. Ahem.  I bought the NERD album, by the way. It's good; very slick, very sexy, very "Pharell".  Ho hum.  Ceff x   Love is not a victory march...

      Ah, there's nothing like a little Morrissey to remind you how great your life is.  My joy has faded; I have come down from my natural high. Even Morrissey can only barely help ease the immense sense of frustration, irritation and/or anger I feel every time Em speaks. Yes, she arrived, quietly, at lunchtime today and suddenly everything is back to "normal", right down to the return of my underlying reluctance to come to Worcester. It's not an optimistic visit to Dad's house anymore, it's regular punishment; imprisonment for a whole weekend with the remnants of his life, the dregs he scraped out the bottom of the barrel labelled "people I've fucked over". At least now I know it's not Dad that causes me stress though: it's Em, with all her talk of, well,  her , and whether she can find a place in her garden where she can sunbathe in the nude (seriously), or how is was her that created the monster that is Rich (grr), or how she really needs to be at home with Lee right now (melodramatic? Em? What a surprise). The most annoying thing I find about her self-centredness is that after a while, I end up competing with her- she's going to see a band live, I've seen two this week; she likes sunbathing, I've been out in the sun constantly recently; she doesn't like Rich, I hate him with the passion of a thousand suns. And it pisses me off that I end up like her when she's around, because what she is is everything I hate. Ooh, she'd love it if she knew I was writing about her...  Ceff x   It's OK to be angry and never let go

      I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to write this blog, seeing as there are no words to describe last night. In answer to my mother's question "Was it good?" on the journey home last night, all I could say was "Ohhhhh wowwww... best gig EVER". Have you ever experienced a total connection, a total sense of belonging, like this is the place or time that you could stay in forever? That was last night. I knew the words to every single song except for one new one (from their new album coming out in July yaaaaaaay), and I moshed, skanked, ran around like a crazy person and then I moshed some more; the people were all there for the same thing, to see the same band, to sing the same songs; it was like going home. Bliss. I don't know if anything will ever live up to it... until I go and see them again, that is ;o)  Ceff x   This is a fair request, and I promise I will not judge any person only as a teenager. If you will constantly remind yourself that some of my generation judges people by their race, their belief, or the colour of their skin, and that this is no more right than saying all teenagers are drunken dope addicts or glue sniffers...

      Eeeeeee giggage. I went to see  urlLink King Adora  with Coz on Friday. The rest of his band was there and I was chatting to them, and they all seem really nice guys. Eeeeee I know a band. Coz told me he'd sent my review to the other 3 band members, until Charlie told me he hadn't got it, as did Jack, so in fact, in Coz's head, 3 must equal 1. Bless 'im. Much "huzzah"ing occurred, as well as much sweatiness do to my innapropriate dress (2 tops). I had a lot of fun, then got invited back to Chillie's house (not by Chillie- again, this is all Coz's fault :D) and rang mum to ask her if I could stay at Coz's (it's near enough) and received a definite no. Boo. So spent a couple of minutes moping before venting some anger on the moshpit. The band were good, too. I haven't heard their album in about 2 years but I remembered I liked their style; they really bring it off in a live setting as well, and I think I might try and get my hands on the new album. Or just copy it off Lucy. Mwahahaha.  Eeeeeee more giggage. Guess who I'm going to see on Thursday *grin* go on *grin* * urlLink guess  *grin* Can't wait *grin* best gig ever *grin* after the last time I saw them *grin* Eeeeeee. *grin* If you think I'm being restrained, you can't actually see me; whenever I think about it my body seems to spasm strangely and I have the urge to jump around the room like a crazy person, which, incidentally, I will be doing on Thursday night. EEEEEEEEEEE.  urlLink *grin*   Ceff x   Whatever turns you on...

      It feels like last year all over again. Dad and I had a big fight about (guess what) money on Monday, namely how much of it he was going to give me in order for me to go to Uni. He seems to be incapable of giving money to anyone other than me. That might sound good, but when the money is your rent and fees, which could be paid straight to the university, making me a middle man seems a bit pointless. He refuses to give the money to my mum as well; it's like he doesn't trust her to pay it- he's still bitter about the whole CSA thing, which he keeps claiming is a pointless excercise, so why he get so annoyed about it is beyond me. Oh, I can't be arsed with it anymore. If I wasn't reliant on him paying half of everything, I'd tell him where to put his money and get rid, because it stresses me out too much, and I don't need that a month before my exams. We were getting on so well, too. Remember that self-destruct button?  Last year reared it's ugly head again at 10.41pm last night (I was looking at the clock when it happened), when my phone rang:  Ceff: "Hello?" Speaker #2: "Hi, it's me" Ceff: "Er... Hi... Who's this?" Speaker #2: "It's Luke" Ceff (in shock): "Oh, hi..." Luke: "..." Ceff: "What?" Luke: "Just wanted to see how you are" Ceff (thinking quickly): "I'm fine, I'm just going to bed"  Luke: "Oh, OK then" Ceff (irritated): "...er, speak to you soon then?" Luke: "Yeah, OK then" Ceff: "Bye"  What the hell is going on?? For one, why is he ringing at half ten at night to "see how I am"?? And if he's ringing me, surely he should have something to say?? If he rings again I'll make it clear I don't want to speak to him again. There are various things I could try:  - Pretending I don't know who he is - Speaking in German - Not speaking at all - Telling him I've moved to the Outer Hebredes - Not answer the phone - Pick up the phone, and put it down again - Get Debbs to answer the phone and speak in Spanish - Get Sel to answer the phone and speak Gujerati - Get Laura to answer the phone and speak Liverpudlian  I could tell him the truth/to piss off and leave me alone, but that's just not as fun, hehehe.  I have started revision! If revision means sunbathing and eating strawberries whilst half reading a German copy of Cosmo...;o)  Ceff x

      It's all over! I am officially a school leaver, and celebrated thie momentous event with an afternoon of heavy drinking. It was such a laugh; Sel, Bex and Debbs were talking to teachers, Laura was sat with the TT et al (imagine me making a face similar to the MSN emoticon with one eyebrow raised) and I spent the afternoon with Kat, Joolz, Bhav, Beth, Nat, Liz, Hayl and Coz. the turning point (where alcohol was concerned) was most definitely the woo-woo drinking competition (which we won!), but other highlights of the afternoon included saying "huzzah" an unimaginably high number of times, Liz's craving for filthy pirate rum, writing people's code names (Be Careful, Gutted, Holier-than-thou etc.) next to their pictures in the yearbook and me being inadvertantly mean to Mrs. No. 4's boyf when Coz gave me a lift home. Handy tip: make sure that all windows in the car are closed before proclaiming loudly that the person standing outside the car is "evil".  Before all this alcohol washed away a considerable amount of brain cells, the Leavers' Assembly was held in the hall. I won two awards: Most Amazing Transformation and Person Most Likely To Correct Your Grammar. Yay! As Ripu proclaimed to the entire year, yes, it is sad, but you know you love me for it. *grin* Some people, however, were less than gracious about my fabby award, claiming loudly to their form tutor that they "should have won that award". Well, you didn't; what are you gonna do with a star-shaped piece of card on a string anyway?   There were a couple of other unexpected events that afternoon as well- firstly, Danni Mynard asked me to sign her yearbook. Danni Mynard! Queen of the Barbies, winner of Dumbest Blonde and general Jess-disliker (or so I assume) since about October 1997. I signed it, obviously, because I'm not gonna get all mean and stubborn on the last day, but it was still very odd. Why? It's not like I mean anything to her. The other odd event on Friday was Sanita, who also started talking to me, but for entirely different reasons. She came up to the table and said "Hi Jess" and shook my hand. Noting my (very) confused (and drunken) response, she said "I heard you were pissed so I thought I'd come over and say hi". I replied "Er... thanks" and she went off, back to the confines of the AM. Sanita hasn't spoken to me in about 3 years, but somehow she finds it satisfying to come over and, well, not laugh, but very subtly mock me because I've had a few drinks. If that was one of my friends I wouldn't mind, but it pisses me off that she thinks she can come up to me and take the mick because I was enjoying myself. Grr.  At about 5pm Coz drove me home and my mum fed me gammon and eggs and made me drink tea. Two mugs. Large mugs. On the drive home I was laughing at all the kiddies in uniform and how they were still at school; yes, it was naughty, but also strangely satisfying. You should try it some time. I got changed and returned to town, only to be ID'd at Yates's and to sit in Imperial being bored. I went home at 9pm and fell asleep on the sofa watching Late Night With Jonathan Ross, and awoke the next morning (somehow) without a hangover. I am now at Dad's house (Em was supposed to come but hey, whaddya know, she had a "crisis" and had to stay at home), and I've just spent the afternoon at the races, in the sun, in my new strapless, stripy summer dress.   Revision starts tomorrow... honest!  Ceff x   Last summer, I did nothing, just sleeping, thinking and hanging around...

      Eek. Last day of school- ever- tomorrow. Suddenly exams seems so much closer...  This has not been the best week of my life. For a start, it has been full of sentiment: the release of the yearbook (and all the signing it entails) seemed to make it OK for people to burst out crying at any point during the day. Ick. I can't deal with people crying; it freaks me out. If they don't stop very fast, i.e. within 30 seconds, I get irritable. I don't cry myself; it shows weakness on my part and it ruins my face. Also, I've managed to go 7 years without most of the year seeing me cry, so I'm not going to break with tradition. It will be the end of an era though: never again will I get postcards from mum with my lunch, or go to M23 for German only to be told by Mr. Birchall that we're in H02, or have to write a radio script for Word Of Mouth, or go to assembly, or have last minute end-of-term parties in the form room, or fight over the stereo in the common room, or complain about the lack of Galaxy bars in the chocolate machine, or wonder who's free now, or, most scarily of all, have my best friends around me all the time. We've had our ups and downs, our fights, our laughs, our cries, our practical jokes and our piss takes, but Bex, Sel, Laura and I (Debbs joined in year 11) have been a little group since year 7 and when I get to Uni they won't be there anymore. And that makes me sad.  Last day ever. Not gonna cry.  Ceff x

      Last week was filled with many fun/scary/significant events. I finally decided that I was definitely going to go to the Leavers' Ball, put my money where my mouth is and bought a ticket. So far, I have no pangs of regret, but I certainly have no great enthusiasm for the whole affair. Laura has lost her ticket; Pave says she can't give her another one, and has also told Laura that she can't give her name and ticket number at the door, because of "security problems we had last year", so Laura spent today searching between the chemistry lab and the form room for her missing ticket, before going to ask Cindi to see if she could get a more forgiving result. I'm so glad that we get such good service for the high price of the ticket....  Talking of tickets, it says on mine (in fact, them all) that it is "Black Tie", so upon this discovery I dragged out my bridesmaid dress and tried it on. It's too big. Bugger. My mum is too scared to take it in and says it looks fine, but I feel horribly fat in it and I don't think it will flatter me at all. I tried Em's bridesmaid skirt on- a snug, but good fit, and am contemplating whether or not I should just wear that with my purple stilettos and a purple top. My first plan was to wear my strawberry dress, but it seems that this is not formal enough. Hmph. Accessorisation seems to be the way to go on this issue. Is accessorisation a word? Well, it is now.  We didn't go and see Win A Date With Tad Hamilton. Debbs dropped out to see Matt instead, Bex had to finish her Tech coursework and we were late for the mid-afternoon Tad Hamilton showing, so in the end me and Sel went to see 50 First Dates. Don't waste your money: the jokes were funny and Drew Barrymore looks gorgeous, but the plot was so flawed it was impossible to really get into it. Something I did get into, however, was Funeral For A Friend on Wednesday. After Frankie dropped out at the last minute, I had to ring Lucy in a state of panic at 10 O' clock Tuesday night and ask her to come with me. Thankfully, she did and the gig was amazing; there were 3 (3!) support bands, 2 of whom were shite but the middle one was bearable, and Funeral were just amazing. The lead singer has a mouth like a toilet though; every other word was "fuck" or "fuckin'", which started to get on my nerves after a while, but then they'd play a song and I'd fall in love with them all over again. Of course, my mother was, for the first time, highly disapproving of my going to this gig, because it was...  My German oral exam on Thursday morning! After writing, scrapping and re-writing my presentation 2 days beforehand, understandably I had a few worries about my first exam. Thankfully though, it went fine and Mrs. Dalgleish really played to my strengths, and says if she was marking it she'd give me and A or a B, which certainly takes the pressure off for the written exam. Phew! The best thing that happened that day was after the oral, when I arrived at 12.20 to my first General Studies session, which started at 10.30, and said to Mrs. Clothier, "Hi... Sorry I'm late", hehehe.  Of course, all of this happened unbenownst to my Dad, who, when he rang me last night (instead of Thursday, when he said he would) told me that he had no idea that I had a gig and an exam this week, even though they were the last things I said to him as I got out the car on Monday, when I saw him. Out of sight, out of mind, eh? Never mind.  4 days of school left now. Everyone seems to have something to complain about currently; most popular is the Leavers' Ball, while another is the teachers and how they don't care, closely followed by something along the lines of "I'm so fucking sick of school and can't wait to get out of this shithole". Am I the only person that appreciates the really good education we've received while we've been here? Yeah, so we have to come in for registration and give reasons why we're late; yeah, so some teachers make mistakes and some are worse than others, but good grief, if we'd gone to a regular comprehensive, our teaching and treatment would have been ten times worse. All I want to do this week is chill out, not hear any complaints and enjoy the last week of the place that's got me to where I am now and will help me to get where I want to go in the future.  OK, so now my hands are getting tired and Kat is complaining that she has nothing to read (hehehe), so I will tell you all about Mark's 21st Birthday party and spending the afternoon with Sam and Kris another time.  Ceff x   Whether inflation, or globalisation, fear is a weapon of mass destruction

      Holaaaaaaaa  Ahem. Bank Holidays! Whoever persuaded banks to take random Mondays off at seemingly illogical points in the year deserves a medal. I got thoroughly sozzled at Sel's 18th Birthday party last night, knowing full well that I could get 2 good nights of sleep before I dragged my sorry ass back to The Institution For Bright People on Mon-sorry-Tuesday! We (Me, Sel, Bex) are going to see  urlLink Win a Date With Tad Hamilton  tomorrow; the teen movie that's so bad you don't even have to be a teen to watch it (it's certificate PG).   urlLink Sel's party  was amazing. Despite the facts that we were the only people there from school, I only really knew Sel's immediate family, didn't like the food and was just *awful* at cricket, I had a really good time and everyone was really chilled out and friendly. Laura was clearly not having a good time at the start, though, which made it a bit tough because I was starting to relax around all the new company and she was really tense; the problem was that she hates cricket and really didn't want to play, plus the fact that she didn't talk to anyone probably didn't help matters much. Anyways, what matters is that I enjoyed myself and felt really welcomed by the whole thing, which was cool; I met loadsa new people who were all fab and generally had a great time of it.  There are only 9 days of school left. I have already had my last lesson with Mrs. Dalgleish. I have 5 days to decide whether I want to go to the Leavers' Ball or not.   REASONS FOR:  It's a reason to get all dressed up and dance the night away; it's the last time we will be together as a whole year group; it's a great tradition.   REASONS AGAINST:  It's the same night as JYF; it's £30 for a ticket plus extras; some of the year won't go, which counters the "last time together as a group" argument; I don't like a lot of the year; Frankie and Hannah have been discussing choreographing a "She's All That"-style dance routine for the occasion.  I wonder if I could ask Pav if I could go for less money if I told her I was only going for an hour before I went to JYF... My head hurts...  Ceff x   Will you need me now? You'll find a way somehow...

      I am less twitchy today. My irritation has subsided (although not entirely) and I'm sure everything will be alright very soon.  I had my last exam today. My last ever reason to go to school. I handed back all my books and my locker key this afternoon, and I left. I left school. I am now a fully fledged member of society; I can get a job, start a career, do whatever I want. The only nagging thing now is that I have no base -  nowhere where I know I will find people who are my friends, where there's stability and where I'll always get a laugh and a joke. And a packed lunch. Now... now I have to work for friendships and relationships. And lunches. It all gets so much more complicated from here. I didn't want to step outside the gates this afternoon. I trudged towards them, thinking "This is it. After this, I'll never have to come into school again" Of course, I'll be back there for results day, but if I didn't want to, I could just have my results to sent to me. It was strange, leaving; everyone else had left early because all the staff were having a meeting in the library, so there was no one about. It was like the last scene of Friends, when the place was empty and they left it all sentimental and weepy. Obviously, I wasn't weepy, but it was still hard for me. I mean, that place  was  me for 7 years; it taught me everything I know, academically at least, and also gave me great friends. It's the place I was when my parents got divorced, when I found out about Em's existence, and various other big-at-the-time events that I'll always associate with school. I feel a bit lost now, actually.  I was kept in quarantine today. Like a foreign animal. I had an exam clash (AQA assumed I could cope with both English Language and RS simultaneously) in the afternoon, so my English exam was moved to the morning, thus consigning me to 2 hours' sitting in the finance office being bored. The time came and I was led through hoards of people, as if going to be crucified, them all smiling, slightly mockingly, at me, while I was put into the RS room and had tables shifted around me. It was a lovely experience. I felt very valued.  Ceff x   Carve your heart out yourself...

      Arrrgggghhhhhhh!!  Have problems. Cannot write them here. One, because writing on the computer screen is probably unadvisable, but also because people read my blog. Bugger. I will have to sit here and twitch with irritation until it all goes away.   She said I've gotta be honest,  you're wasting your time if you're fishing round here.  And I said you must be mistaken,  I'm not fooling, this feeling is real.  She said you've gotta be crazy! What do you take me for?  Some kind of easy mark?  No, you've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion,  but I swear that you've got me all wrong.  All wrong, all wrong,  but you got me...   I'll be true, I'll be useful,  I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear,  and I'll belong to you, if you just let me through.   This is easy as lovers go,  so don't complicate it by hesitating, And this is wonderful as loving goes,  this is tailor-made,  what's the sense in waiting?   And I said I've gotta be honest,  I've been waiting for you all my life.  For so long I thought I was asylum bound,  but just seeing you makes me think twice.  And being with you here makes me sane,  I fear I'll go crazy if you leave my side.  You've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion, but are you brave enough to leave with me tonight?  Tonight, tonight, you've got me...   I'll be true, I'll be useful,  I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear.  and I'll belong to you,  if you'll just let me through.   This is easy as lovers go,  so don't complicate it by hesitating,  and this is wonderful as loving goes,  this is tailor-made,  what's the sense in waiting?   This is easy as lovers go,  so don't complicate it by hesitating, and this is wonderful as loving goes,  this is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?

       "Man, it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she had, but it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all"   All hail the return of Dashboard Confessional and the gloriously bittersweet "Carve Your Heart Out Yourself". Huzzah, I say, and again, huzzah. From what I've heard of "A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar", Chris Carraba has decided to use instruments that you can actually plug in this time around, which I'm sure is very new and exciting for him.  I have discovered a new comic! It's called  urlLink Ctrl+Alt+Del  and it's laugh-out-loud funny. It's about this computer games geek Ethan, his best friend and roommate Lucas and his other roommate, whose name I can't remember, and the other roommate's pet penguin, Ted. It is based a lot around computer games so some parts of the story I don't get, but the jokes are still universally funny. Huzzah.  On a more ominous note, my horoscope reads: "If some fickle personage has been meddling with your heart strings in the last month or two, the tide turns this week." Gulp. JYF is this weekend. Gulp. The R-word springs to mind...  Gulp x   Oh look now, there you go with hope again...

       urlLink    "Shake my body loose, shake my body, whatever turns you on... Make my body smoulder, make my body so sexational!" A naughty title for a naughty album...&nbsp; urlLink     In the true spirit of girlyness, I have decided to completely change my outfit for the Leavers' Ball, after getting a new skirt this afternoon in Birmingham. I will not divulge details tonight, though... Heeeeee. I spent some time posing in front of the mirror (in my newly proposed outfit) to King Adora when I got in; I love that album, it's so trashy and chaotic, yet it's got this raw, animalistic sexiness to it as well... I wish they'd play some at the Leavers' Ball because I could really, really work it to a tune like Smoulder. ;o)   Never knew I could feel like this; Like I've never seen the sky before... Want to vanish inside your kiss; Every day I love you more and more... Listen to my heart, can you hear it sing? Telling me to give you everything... Seasons may change, winter to spring; But I love you until the end of time...  Come what may; Come what may; I will love you until my dying day...  Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place; Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace; Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste; It all revolves around you... And there's no mountain too high; No river too wide; Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side... Storm clouds may gather; And stars may collide; But I love you (I love you), Until the end of time(until the end of time)...  Come what may; Come what may; I will love you until my dying day...  Oh, come what may, come what may, I will love you, Oh I will love you... Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place;  Come what may; Come what may; I will love you until my dying day...    Damn Moulin Rouge, restoring my belief in an all-consuming, all conquering love. It won't ever happen, it's not possible, but hey, the Leo in me enjoys the passion and the heat of the film. And Ewan McGregor ;o)  Ceff x   You're free to leave me, but just don't deceive me

      So, after a not-so-lengthy discussion with Kat, I have cleared my messy mind up a little. In the relationship department anyway:  I don't want commitment, or anything heavy and intense, but I do want something exclusive. I don't want to get into any kind of heavy duty physical *ahem* activities too fast, but I don't mind a little messing about. I don't want to feel like I have to bring him (whoever it may be) to every event that I go to because he's my "boyfriend" (I refer to an instance when Laura pestered me to bring Luke to her birthday party even though I didn't want him to come), but I don't mind calling him "my boyfriend". I want something easy and fun, something that's chilled out with a lots of flirting but without having to change my life. I want good conversation as well; I don't want everything I say to be met with "awwww" or "oh how sweet" or "bless" or some other disgustingly patronising comment because he hasn't listened, or understood what I said. Is that so much to ask? ;o)  It's just that I can't stand all that *stuff* that's attached to having a boyfriend! The way people expect you to be attached to each other all the time, and have "quality time" together, or spend ridiculous amounts of money on each other because you're "in love". The way they act surprised when you just spend time with your friends, or chilling out on your own; I don't understand these girls that give up their whole lives, their friends, the way they are, just to be with one guy. How can you spend that much time with someone and not get bored anyway? OK, not get bored, but at least need a considerable break from each other afterwards.  Well, that helped. I feel much clearer in my head now, and don't feel the need to write about whatever I'm reading/revising as a distraction technique.  Ceff x   There's nothing to lose; my notebook will explain...

       urlLink    Huzzah! Fat Wreck Chords. Wreck-Chords! Geddit? No one else seems to...&nbsp; urlLink      "What kind of a pick up line is that?" "What did he say?" "Oh my god I can't believe it" "Ew, look at his hair..." "Band guys are so lame" "Why is he staring at us?" "Ew, what is he wearing?"  Some girls are crazy...  hee hee hee. I forgot how much I love this song, and remember now why I bought a t-shirt with "Some girls are crazy" printed on the back. Not gonna tell you what the song is though, if you're interested, ask, or take a guess at who it is.  I feel less bored today. RS went well; the questions, thankfully, were on the areas of Buddhism I actually knew about, rather than random concepts like Buddhology (don't ask, because I still don't know). The last General Studies paper was today too, Society, Politics and the Economy. The pre-release material, which I spent last night reading, was all about the EU. Fascinating stuff, as you can imagine. Thankfully, one of the essay questions at the end was about whether I thought the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan were justified, and whether this action has helped to combat international terrorism, so that let me have a big 4 page rant about good ole George Dubya. He's the 59th most important person in rock music, according to Kerrang, as he's accidentally managed to force the music world into "thinking about more than girls and beer again". Fat Mike is 25th most powerful (Huzzah!)- I heart Fat Mike, he runs a wicked business and manages to be a punk rocker and (god forbid) intelligent at the same time. My dad seems to be unable to mix those two concepts; he thinks that if you listen to heavy metal/punk/emo/hardcore/anything other than bands that formed in 1970-73, you are a complete moron with no idea what's going on in the world outside the moshpit. Gah. But anyway: highlights of my new favourite Top 100 list ("Most important people in rock in 2004") include Avril Lavigne at No. 10 for "prodding 5-and-ups away from the pathway of pop and into the road marked 'rock'", Justin Hawkins at No. 4 ("make way for the anti-Kurt") and Satan at No. 2 for still having "all the best tunes". I'm not going to give away who's at Number 1, because I want people to start buying Kerrang- and anyway, it's only £1 this week AND you get a free punk CD! Bargainous. They still can't help putting Brody Dalle at Number 22 though, can they? Hmph.  Ceff x   What's with you and all your talk of independence? What's with me and my lack of innocence?

       urlLink    The effects of revision...&nbsp; urlLink     I am so bored. Soooo boooored. So bored I think I might just fall off this chair and die, quietly, right here, listening to the new Billy Talent single (River Below), surrounded by notes on Samsara and Nirvana and the 3 marks of existence and fuck knows what else I have to revise before tomorrow. It wouldn't be so bad if:  a) my folder was better organised b) I had made notes from the piles of photocopied sheets that were thrust my way over the last year c) Mrs. Rogers was a better teacher, and hadn't simply thrust piles of photocopied sheets my way but actually taught us stuff we could make good notes from, thus making my folder better organised.  You know, whenever I bitch about her, I always feel like she's watching me... it's probably the RS teacher effect... *looks over shoulder*  Besides the woes of revision, I have made a surprising discovery: Fountains Of Wayne (you know, the ones that did that song about Stacy's Mom... you know, they had that Rachel Hunter woman in the video... oh, never mind) are actually quite good! Dad bought their album after hearing them on some "New Generation of Young'uns" CD that came with his Classic Rock magazine, and it turns out it's a pretty cool, summery album. What is the point of Classic Rock magazine, incidentally? It seems that every time I pick it up all I find is a 1324254303 page feature on the excessive, debauched days of "real Rock'n'Roll" back in the seventies, or a list of the top 100 frontment/guitarists/drug takers (which is always inevitably won by either Freddie Mercury or Robert Plant). Surely they must have realised that they've covered all that stuff at least once by now, right?  Talking of Top 100 lists (Warning: Rant ahead), I read 2 of them this weekend, both of which were the top 100 British albums everinthehistoryoftheworld, or something. The first in Dad's Q magazine (yes, he does buy every music magazine he can find) named Oasis' "Definitely Maybe" as the best British album. PAH! Mediocre. How anyone can speak of a band with a frontman as twattish and talentless as Liam Gallagher with such high regard is beyond me. The same goes for Guns 'n' Roses, by the way. Axl Rose is a big ginger knob. And where is the new GnR album, by the way? Now now, that's another rant for another day... The second Top 100 list was in The Observer's Music Monthly magazine, and listed its No. 1 album as The Stone Roses' self titled CD. I don't know it, so I can't really judge, but there seems to be a trend forming for music publications to say the mid 90s Britpop movement was more influential, more important, even, than all the real, groundbreaking stuff that happened in the 60s and 70s like The Beatles, The Stones, Zeppelin (although I hate them I have to give credit where it's due) or Pink Floyd. Having said that (I told you it was a rant), The Beatles took up positions 2, 3, 6 and 7 in the list, which is just a little over the top, in my opinion. The Streets were in the Observer's list as well, position 70-something. This doesn't really surprise me as the Observer has its collective head up Mike Skinner's townie ass, but it still bothers me. I will not carry on for much longer (promise), but I will say this: MUSIC MADE BY THE STREETS IS NOT MUSIC. IT IS A SILLY MAN TALKING OVER A RANDOM BEAT IN AN ANNOYING ACCENT. PLEASE STOP LISTENING TO IT. Thankyou.  Ceff (going for a lie down) x   They'll think I'm insane, but you'll all know my name...

      There are 3 types of driver: those who are good drivers, those who are accelerator-happy and those who are brake-happy. Unfortunately, I fall into the last category; my driving lesson on Friday was good other than the fact that I stop the car about a mile short of junction lines, meaning that I can't see a thing and put both mine and my driving instructor's lives at risk when I turn a corner. Gah.  After much quick packing (which, incidentally, was totally inappropriate for this weekend as I have nothing to wear with sleeves longer than "short" and the weather is horrid), mother and I headed into the depths of West Bromwich in the direction of the (innapropriately named, in my opinion) Sandwell General Hospital so that a nice man called Mr. Chester could feel my lumps and stick an pointy instrument into me. Hehehehe. No no, nothing happened that could result in some sort of legal dispute: the horrible lump on the back of my ear got some steroids injected into it in the hope that one day it might shrink. Blergh.  Dad came to collect me from the hospital and now here I am, in his house, on his computer, talking to my friends from far far away. Dad says they're going to reorganise the house and move the "spare bedroom" downstairs and the study upstairs. Funny, I was under the impression that the "spare bedroom" was "my bedroom".  I should be revising Buddhism, currently. My exam is on Wednesday and I do not know  anything . Well, I know some stuff, but...meh.  Ceff x   All they know is how to put you down...

      I'm blogging out of habit, really. I have nothing of any note to write about, but as I've been blogging about something most days recently, I sort of feel like doing it. I guess it's my one last attempt at not revising before my exam tomorrow afternoon. I'm starting to get a little tense now: little knots in my stomach and that nagging feeling that I haven't quite done enough work towards it. Oh well; too late to worry now, isn't it?  Blogger won't let me update my profile. I want to add new bands and new interests and stuff... Boo :o(  I feel less disgusting today, incidentally. I have new trousers and they cover my leg-related imperfections sufficiently. I also think my stomach has shrunk a little. I'm probably talking crap (as usual when I talk about my body), but still, I feel better for it.  Ceff x   Make a chick wanna hate, make a boy wanna stare...

      Mmmm. Pimm's. My mum brought a bottle home to try out for the party, and I have fallen in love with it- Pimm's is now my official drink of choice, especially how I had it earlier, with ice cubes, strawberries and apple. Mmmm.  I went into Birmingham with Kat yesterday. We had loads of fun; I laughed and laughed and laughed, and as ever I missed all the JYF peeps as soon as we went our separate ways, but again I was left with that feeling of total inadequacy that the JYF girls seem to give me. I think they're all great and lovely and stuff, but I always feel so fat and unattractive next to them, and that my personality is dull and boring in comparison to theirs. They do fun stuff, go out to cool clubs, dress in really funky clothes and generally seem to have a lot more fun than I do. It doesn't really help that I swear I've put on weight recently- it's all this sitting around the house, doing nothing except writing and eating Jaffa Cakes.  I tried on some bikini shorts in Marks & Spencer yesterday and my legs looked hideous: all lumpy and blotchy and flabby and disgusting. I will be surprised if, when I get to Italy this Summer, if I don't clear the beach of holiday-makers at the sight of my horrible white pins, or at least make them throw up into their beach bags. Blegh blegh BLEGH.  Due to the horror experienced by the sight of my disgusting, horrible, vomit-inducing body shape, mum and I decided to go swimming this morning, with the intention of making it a regular thing. But as it always is with us, our plan was unsuccessful. The University baths were closed from midday, and the Gala baths aren't open yet after some silly person set them on fire (incidentally, how do you set a swimming pool on fire? It's made of water!), so instead we went to Ann's (Godmother's) house and sat in the garden eating pretzels. Gah.  Ceff x   Obviously, she's out of my league...

       urlLink    Eddtrix: This photo made me laugh out loud. There are more, but they're sort of inside jokes from JYF, so the humour wouldn't really transfer. I wanted to put one up though, just as my "funny thing of the day".&nbsp; urlLink     Kerrang! radio launched (was "unleashed", in their words) yesterday. When I first heard about it I was really excited; a brand new radio station that's gonna play songs by all the really cool bands they write about in the magazine, but, as ever, it was a bit of an anti-climax. It's pretty much like other local radio stations, except a bit heavier. Their playlist seems to only include these songs:  D12- My Band (or anything by Eminem) HIM- Solitary Man Jet- Are You Gonna Be My Girl The Rasmus- In The Shadows Evanescence- Nobody's Fool Nickelback- Figured You Out Blink 182- Down and anything by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Up to 5 of those tracks you'd find on a regular pop radio station, so why aren't the broadcasters of Kerrang! being a little more daring? The evening show tonight is a hip hop show, which, if I wanted to, I could listen to on Galaxy, and there's no ska, punk, Britrock, hardcore, emo, nothing. I heard a Jimmy Eat World track at about 1am last night, but even then the presenter called them "Jimmy Eats World". The songs are the most commercial ones by each artist that they can find, and it's really disappointing because I rely on Kerrang! for at least some insight into alternative culture and new music from smaller bands who aren't on major labels with lots of money. They have this thing called "Rated", where they promote certain songs because they're really good. Are the songs by new, up-and-coming bands with a real chance of a successful future, or a band with something new to add to the scene? No: so far, the two "Rated" songs I have heard are the new singles by Nickelback, whose lead singer was once called a c**t by a Kerrang! reporter, and Linkin Park, who need no background information to show you how commercial they are. Overall, though, it's better than the other radio stations, and I'll listen to it because I'd rather listen to Blink 182 over and over again than Natasha Bedingfield followed by Blue followed by Natasha Bedingfield followed by Blue. Ugh, now it's The Rasmus. AGAIN.  Ceff x   We left the radio playing all night long, because the radio's playing all my favourite songs...

       urlLink    Photos from JYF are finally available! Here's me having lots of fun in Coventry with Verity and Kris. *grin*&nbsp; urlLink     Heeee. JYF in 22 days. Of course, before then I have to sit 9 exams and go to (groan) the leavers' ball, but still, it's nice to have something to take my mind off them. I wish it wasn't Laura's birthday that day, things would be so much easier. Sigh. But I am pleased with the photos - I like the JYF piccies because they give me a good way of tracking how much weight I've lost; there are photos from Jan 2003 all the way up to March 2004, so it's a great gauge of how I'm doing. And they make me laugh out loud, which is always good for your health.  I had a terrible driving lesson today. I started off quite well doing a three point turn, but then it all seemed to go downhill from there as I seemed to forget how to operate the car; I forgot to indicate, position the car for turning and use the handbrake. Gah. Next week we start parallel parking, which should be... interesting...  Ceff x   There's something obscene in a dream...

       urlLink    Me at dad's wedding (that's Em in the background). I've just downloaded Hello Bloggerbot or whatever it's called, so I thought I'd add a picture; I like this one because I think I look quite pretty, as opposed to other pictures where I tend to look fat, or I have a stupid grin on my face. Don't ask about the thing on my head. Long story.&nbsp; urlLink     The sun has returned, and I feel distinctly less down. I was up until about 2.30am last night feeling sorry for myself (and also very warm, strangely enough), and I wrote a little, which made me feel better, like I was getting it out of my system. I think my mood has also lifted partly due to talking to a guy called  urlLink John  yesterday, who made positive comments in my direction, which made me feel a bit better. I've still downloaded the latest Linkin Park album though, just in case.  I have spent today sizzling (and revising) away quietly in the back garden, smiling politely and telling the lady from No. 11 for the fourth time (at least) that I'm going to either Leeds or Sheffield in September. In a mo I'll shuffle into the bathroom in my fish-shaped flip flops (Heeeee) to apply copious amounts of Sainsbury's After Sun Tan Maintainer, in the hope that tomorrow morning (supposedly the hottest day of the year so far) I won't wake up equally as white as I did today.  Ceff x   I don't know what's worth fighting for, or why I have to scream, but now I have some clarity, to show you what I mean

       As years go by I race the clock with you But if you died right now, you know that I'd die too I'd die too.  You remind me of the times when I knew who I was still the second hand will catch us Like it always does..  We make the same mistakes I take the fall for you I hope you need this now Cause I know I still do...  Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you...  Should I bite my tongue 'till blood soaks my shirt? We never fall apart. Tell me why this hurts so much?  My hands around your throat and I think I hate you Still they say we never win Just like we always do. Just like we always do...  Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you...  I'd spill my heart I'd spill my heart for you...  My hands around your throat and I think I hate you We made the same mistakes, mistakes like friends do... My hands around your throat and I think I hate you. We made the same mistakes...  Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you...  Until the day I die Until the day I die...   What an interesting thing it must be to see someone sink lower into their own self pity, post by post. My timing is impeccable: the need for a boyfriend, or at least someone to just *be* around, comes during study leave, the period when you have the most time to just sit and think (because you're avoiding doing anything productive), but your friends aren't around to distract you because they're probably sitting at home, doing the same thing. Maybe the need for closeness to someone has come from not having those distractions... I really want to pull myself out of this mood, but it seems warm and comforting; I think part of me likes it, you know? Being able to sit at home, moping around like a greasy grunge maniac, listening to Linkin Park and Story of The Year and Seether, it's a bit like a naughty secret -  nobody else knows that I feel like this (or that I'm listening to such obscenely commercial music), so I just want to keep it this way.  Yeah, I like that excuse.  Ceff x   I don't want to be the one the battles always choose, cos inside I realise that I'm the one confused   PS. A quick note on the song: It seems to fit my own relationship with relationships/love/soppy feelings in general, rather than a specific person, whose name I will not mention. Although it does work on that level too. Except for the "until the day I die" part. I hope.

      I wonder: Am I unattractive, or have I just not met anyone who thinks I'm attractive?   If it's that I haven't met anyone who thinks I'm attractive, then why do the guys I know not find me attractive?  Maybe they don't find me attractive because they don't like my personality. Or maybe they don't find me attractive because I'm not.  But why? What do the guys I know see in other girls that they don't see in me?  Just a thought.  Ceff x   In the heat of summer sunshine, I miss you

      I have not had sex in 11 and a half months. Nearly a year. Nearly a whole  year  has passed since I have been further than a fumble under a sleeping bag, or felt anything more than pure horn. Up until now I haven't wanted a boyfriend, in fact, I still don't want to get into anything more than a casual (but exclusive) relationship, but I'm starting to miss the little things; holding hands, little kisses on the lips, even just having someone to think about when there's nothing else to ponder on. And to coincide with this, I find out that Rich has split up with Kayla (joy to the world!) and is coming to JYF. Great. What if he hits on me? I know myself- despite all my best efforts to hate him with all my heart when he's out of my eyeline, inevitably, as soon as I see him it will start to beat faster, my tummy will go all fluttery and I will think "Well, maybe he's not so bad after all...". I know what I'll do: I will wear my new yellow halter top, stand tall and walk straight past him. And perhaps give him a swift kick in his sleep.  Em is once again in Dad's bad books. After her "triumphant" return on Saturday all was well in Worcester (ha), until Em phoned Lee (current squeeze) and discovered it was going to take her about 4 hours to get back to Coventry. Despite my telling her it would take less time and be cheaper if she went on the coach, she refused to ask Dad for a lift to the coach station and was in a funny mood for the rest of the night. She sat up in my (our?) room for hours watching TV before I came up to bed and she had to turn it off. On Sunday morning she got up, got dressed, packed her stuff and then just *sat* in the bedroom for ages. Nuts. I got up to brush my teeth, then went downstairs to get some brekkie (mmm croissants) and found her half way out the door; "Bye hun [I hate it when she calls me that]" she said, "I'm off now." When I asked her whether she'd told Dad she was leaving, she said "No, it's OK" and then she was off to the train station. "Freak", I said to myself as the door closed. Needless to say, Dad and Wicked Stepmother were not best pleased when I related the tale to them, and Dad said he found her behaviour insulting and told me to take whatever clothes I liked of hers out of her drawer, as he was going to throw the rest out because this "isn't just some doss house that she can stay in when she likes". So now I am the favourite again. Yay.  Ceff x   The fuse is burning somewhere, it's drenched in heat...

      I came back from MAGIC (Midlands Area Guiding International Camp) today! Huzzah. It was my first Guide camp as a leader and I had a surprisingly good time and fitted in with all the proper grown-ups quite nicely. I've missed blogging though, and talking to my mates, despite access to my mobile, a privelege not usually synonymous with camping. Here's my week in short:   Day 1  Busy. Tired but happy. Thinking about Draper.   Day 2  Crap weather! Knackered again but having a laugh. Rubbish opening ceremony involving a stripping fire eater. Am on the lookout for pretty boys. So far: none.   Day 3  Weather improving. I have a cold and Lorraine (other assistant Guider) is contagious. The boy band was v amusing, involving many cover songs and screaming girls. I realised Kati (guide) would probably never go to a gig due to her epilepsy. Scary. Janet (main Guider) said I was useful. Grin.   Day 4  Very relaxed today. Royal visit from Sophie Countess of Wessex. Missing male company. Still no pretty boys on camp, just some who stink of cheap aftershave that the Guides fancy and they know it. Played Twister and won! Twice! Huzzah.   Day 5  Shock horror: good weather. Campfire. Meh. Text from Sam! Yay. Selina says she will buy me a dictionary of euphemisms. Hurrah.   Day 6  Lots of sunshine followed by lots of rain. Thinking about Sean.   Day 7  Last day! Ace closing ceremony, but missing mum. Fear re: striking camp without Janet.  As it turns out, striking camp wasn't so bad and mum and I are sucessfully reunited. This summer's next Guiding task is to set up a Senior Section unit for the older guides before I leave for Leeds. But before then, I need to bathe, sleep and go to Italia! I can't wait for Monday; I know I'm going to miss certain *people* while I'm away (due to my laziness I have not activated my phone for foreign use) but I need a break from dull and dreary Walsall, and sizzling quietly on a beach in my favourite European country sounds just about right. Then I can return, become 18, a student of Leeds University (MEEP) and spend the last few weeks of the longest holiday EVER hanging out with my mates. Ace.  Incidentally, I am covered in insect bites. Definitely not ace. Notice how I have refrained from adding in a bad joke about wanting a nice young man to rub after-bite cream into me... oops! ;o)  Ceff x   We can live like Jack and Sally if you want, where you can always find me...

       urlLink    So...tired...&nbsp; urlLink     I am far too sleepy considering I had a good 6 hours sleep last night. I went to Netherstowe School again to see Third Enigma with Kat, Draper and someone called Andy, then stayed over at Coz's. I didn't even have anything to drink or (ahem) over-exert myself, so God only knows why I'm totally shattered now. The band were ace again, but I didn't expect any less, in fact, they were better this time around. The rest of the evening consisted of defending Hells Is For Heroes to too many people (Blink 182?? EMO??? Tis not normal...), stressing about coats and being disappointed at the non-stunningness of Draper's friend. When we went back to Coz's we watched about 3 films which all seemed to merge into one, leaving us with the feeling that we'd watched a film where a boat with Dean Cain on it sank, before he climbed into the air vents of a house that was on fire, only to see a woman being chased by Jedis/Dan from Big Brother before she stabbed the bad guy in the eye with her nail file. All excellent films, I think you'll agree...  So... Draper. Think. It was a half-and-half situation for me last night: half the time he was annoying and obnoxious, and half the time he was strangely attractive (surprisingly good music taste- always does it for me). Despite what everyone says, he's a nice guy; he's chatty and can be quite gentlemanly when you say the right thing ("I'm cold" = "Do you want my coat?", "I need to get dressed" = "Do you want me to go out?"), and although sometimes he makes comments that are waaay innapropriate and kill the conversation, when you think about it, everyone does that sometimes, it's just he does it a little more than other people. Give him a break! He's not quite ace, but he's alright...  Ceff x   As you sleep, when no one is listening I will lift you off your feet, and keep you from dreaming...

      I spent most of the day with Sean today. Sam and his brother Joe (who is ace, incidentally) were there for a couple of hours but as Sam fucked up his back (mysteriously, no one knows  how  he did&nbsp;it), he had to leave at about half past 2 and so Sean and I just hung out for another couple of hours, wandering, chatting, browsing CDs. It was really, really nice; I felt so comfortable with him, like I was able to just be  me.  We talked about everything from my parents to his parents, from The Streets to Slipknot, and it all clicked: while we don't like the same bands, we agree (mainly) on the bands we don't like, and we seem to be on the same sort of level morally/politically, as well as having&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;sense of humour. And he lets me link arms with him! Most guys just let their arm sort of drop to their sides, leaving me sort of *clinging*, but Sean let me get comfy and fall into step. It made me feel valued, and thus warm and fuzzy. Huzzah.  How odd it is that I'm now comfortable with writing about my feelings for other people in my blog... until recently I've just talked about me for fear of offending or scaring people, or giving them the wrong idea. But hey, this is me, this is what goes on in my head, and I have enough language capacity to explain anything, should questions be raised. Oh my god: have I finally grown up?  Ceff x   I don't care if you don't love me, and I don't care if you don't change, I would live inside the shadows that I cast for you, if it meant that you would stay

      Phew! What a hectic couple of days that was. I went swimming in the morning for the first time in ages, it was really refreshing and am considering making a habit of it. I returned home for a leisurely afternoon of internet, Jaffa Cakes and webcomics, before all manner of chaos occurred outside as Dad arrived to collect me just as my mum returned home with Rod and a new table top for the dining room. Dad was "helpful" and carried the table top up with Rod, meaning that he was in THE FLAT, with MUM and ME, and it was all very, very odd. I finally managed to extract Dad from the flat and we headed off to the speedway, and then to Bournville for Kat's "my parents are in Wales" house party. I consumed excessive amounts of alcohol and attempted to smoke but failed, before heading up to bed at about 3.30am with Kris and Vez to share the double bed in the spare room. I woke up far too early and then at midday we went into Birmingham before I had to dash home, grab Laura's birthday present and dash back out again to Walsall to meet aforementioned Laura, Selina Debbs and Becky for drinks and exchange and discussion of presents. Early night for Ceffy tonight, methinks!  &nbsp;  Sam and Sean were at the party last night, but they had to leave early because they have parents who are sensible. Sam and I seem to be really good friends at the moment, which is&nbsp;cool because we seem to really be just friends; there's no underlying sexual tension between us, we can chat and flirt a little and it's all in good fun, which is ace. Just what I need. Sean's different, he's still making me think, and I don't know if that's good or bad. But still, he's ace too. *grin*  &nbsp;  Ceff x  &nbsp;   I'm having trouble saying what I mean, with dead poets and drum machines

      I watched "Never Been Kissed" last night. Geeky 25-year-old career type goes "undercover" at a high school to see what the kids are up to nowadays. She makes friends with the "geeks" and then becomes "popular" and gets to date the hottest guy in school and becomes prom queen (ahhh). Along the way she falls for her "teacher", who happens to be drop dead gorgeous, intelligent&nbsp;and&nbsp;willing to confide in her when it comes to his own relationship problems, and conveniently breaks up with&nbsp;his girlfriend a week before the prom. After the "popular" kids try to play a dirty trick on the "geeks" at the prom, she blows her cover and tells everyone what she's up to, and how insignificant high school is in the grand scheme of life, the universe and everything. Then she writes a big sentimental piece in the paper, and waits, out on the baseball field for the teacher to come and kiss her. He arrives (in the nick of time!), they kiss, the bad guys get what they deserve, the good wins out and everyone lives happily ever after. Total shit. &nbsp; Ceff x &nbsp;  You were all the things I thought I knew, and I thought we could be

       urlLink     My glorious new welly, that I painstakingly customised using only nail varnish. They need to make bigger brushes for that sort of thing...&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  Wow! My guide leader just texted me! Very impressive. My dad can barely grasp the concept of predicted text, let alone the punctuation key- he texted me recently to tell me he was going to see Harry Routes at the cinema, which, if you translate it correctly, actually means Harry Potter.  &nbsp;  I think I've become addicted to e-bay. I went on last night to see if I could buy some  denim   dungarees  (I lost out in the last minute when some bastard swooped in and bid about 20p more than me, just as my mouse packed in and 203493004 popups appeared), and have now bid on 2 limited edition Less Than Jake stickers (currently winning), a  bright red tutu  (also currently winning) and a limited edition New Found Glory sticker. I sort of cheated on the NFG sticker though, I didn't bother to bid and just clicked the " Buy It   Now! " link. Should be here in about 2 days! Hooray. I'm currently perusing shoes, and have found a pair of gorge   pale blue Ugg boots   for £15. Mmmmm wantwantwant.  &nbsp;  I've also, as you can see, been putting my  creative skills  to work again with my new   wellies  , which I plan to take to camp and Leeds. I bought them for a bargainous £10 from a work clothes place in Worcester ("Jobtogs"- how great is that name??), so they're made of pretty sturdy stuff, especially the toes, which are steel-capped. Great for moshing, as I can inflict pain without receiving it myself! Score. Perhaps owning a pair of boots such as these will qualify me adequately to work on a building site... Oddly enough, images of the second series of  Dirty Sanchez  spring to mind. Eek.  &nbsp;   Ceff  (using new Blogger tools successfully!)  x   &nbsp;   But who cares? No big deal... I want more...

      Hola! I return from the south coast of England, sunburnt and sleepy. We (me and Dad) stayed in a hotel in Poole for a couple of nights, and we visited Southampton, Isle of Wight and, um, Poole. Southampton has the most gorgeous quay, with this big factory outlet shopping vilage Cheshire Oaks-esque thing, complete with Vans outlet. I wandered in a tortured myself for while: found some white trainers with a blue stripe. £30. Hubba hubba.  The Isle of Wight is the strangest place I have ever been to. Well, no, that's not strictly true; it has the strangest looking people on it that I have ever seen. There was an old man at the speedway that barked. Yes, he went up to some people sat in front of us (I assume he knew them) and just, well, barked. There was also an old man that had a huge boil on his nose and a whole variety of other, weird and not-so-wonderful characters. I was glad to get back on the boat, to be honest. The speedway was good, though; I never knew Premier League racing was so competitive, and the track was awesome for speed.  Poole is not so nice; the quay is half smart, new apartment blocks and yachts, and half covered in bird poo and inhabited by grubby pubs and tacky souvenir shops. A seagull pooed on Dad's head though, which amused me. We sailed over to Brownsea Island, which was reeeaally nice but not a place to wear heels (ouch). Lots of greenness, great National Trust tea shop (what NT tea shop isn't great?) and very nice views. There were no barking men (thankfully), but some suspicious peacocks that followed us around and glared at me with their evil eyes. Meep. On the boat back the sky was deceptively cloudy, as by the time I got off it I looked like someone had tattooed my face using beetroot juice as ink. The speedway, again, was ace (even though the view wasn't too great), and Dad and I spent an hour or so in the bar afterwards playing cards. He tried to teach me a game called Crib- I still refuse to believe this is a real game, and am convinced that he made up the rules as we went along so he would win. I whipped his ass at Rummy though, because it's a  real  game.  I'm waiting for mum to come home now. It's been a week since I've seen her and I miss her a lot, especially seeing as spending extended periods of time with Dad reminded me exactly why she's my favourite of the two. In my slightly drunken state on Sunday night, however, I texted her to tell her to order tickets for "Sing Along Moulin Rouge", which I may regret later, probably on Saturday night, when we end up going...  Ceff x   The boys are back in town, no strings to hold them down...

      Sigh. It's sad, isn't it? Blogging not because you want to display your thoughts to the world, but because you don't feel like you have anyone else. And I'm not saying that because it's late, but because I actually feel as if this is the only place that's available, the only place that won't say "Sorry, gtg byeeeeeee" when I need it most. Everyone else has lives; friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, exciting things to do, and they never seem to have time for me anymore. All I need is a hug and for someone to spend some time with me because they're my  friend , not because they're in my base group or aren't allowed to behave "exclusively".  Maybe I'm listening to too much Morrissey...  Ceff x   They said they respect me, which means their judgement is crazy

      Ho hum. Another late awakening, another wasted day. After voicing some concerns to Sean last night, said concerns have been playing on my mind a little. I've mentioned it before on here; the total feeling of inadequacy I get when I'm around the JYF girls. They're all small and pretty and size 10, they swap clothes with each other and get all the attention, and they're so confident and sexy. When I'm around them I just stick out. I'm the "sensible" one; I don't have the quirky fashion sense or the confidence, I can't swap clothes with them and I don't get the attention they do. I'm don't want to be like them, as such, and I'm not craving for attention, but I think I'd just like to fit in with them a little more, and the fact that it's actually physically impossible for me to be half those things makes it even more annoying. The Rosy Glows say it all: on all of theirs, the lads say "it was so great to see you, you're gorgeous/wonderful/sexy/so cool and I can't wait to see you again" and on mine they say "hey! Good to see you again, we really should meet up sometime". Sean told me not to be silly and that I was pretty too, and that Sam could back him up on this, but I don't feel it. They see me in a totally different light from the other girls. They're potential girlfriends, or people they might pull if they get the chance, whereas I'm just their mate, good for a laugh, nice to talk to. And when that's made blatantly obvious from what someone's written on your rosy glow, no amount of their telling you you're pretty is going to change that.  Ceff x   I never will be good enough for her

      Woooo! Wicked Stepmother's parents have bought me 2 tickets to go and see New Found Glory!! Yay!! Sel and I are off to marvel at the glory of Jordan & Co. once more, and I am all the happier for it. *grin*   Dad and I had one of those wicked "Ultimate" conversations last night- you know, they start with "What's your ultimate..." and end with "CD compilation/speedway team/football team/car?". This one was "What's your ultimate festival lineup?". The rules were simple: 3 days, 2 stages, 2 headliners on the first stage, 1 headliner on the second. He chose The Who and Pink Floyd/Ash on the first day, Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones/The Police on the second day and U2 and Bruce Springsteen/Free on the third. You can tell it's a fantasy lineup, as roughly half of Free, Led Zeppelin and The Who are dead. My festival was this: Muse and Lostprophets/Hells Is For Heroes on the first day, Michael Jackson and Less Than Jake/The Smiths on the second day, and Rancid and The Prodigy/Jack Off Jill on the third. Much better, I think you'll agree... ;o) But anyway, back to reality...  I have just had the busiest weekend. Ever. Friday night was the Leavers' Ball; we all arrived in our finery and within 15 minutes, I had white wine down me. Well, at least it wasn't red, seemed to be the generally acceptable thing to say. The night improved from there, thankfully; the music wasn't  too  bad, the food was good (at least, the profiteroles were- that was all I ate) and I got really quite drunk. By the end, I was dancing with Draper. I don't know why, but I always seem to be drawn to him at things like this. And it wasn't as if he became some sort of gorgeous sex god through my haze of vodka, when I saw him, sharp suit, less *curly* hair, new glasses, he just made me... think. Yes, that's a suitably non-committal word. Think.  So, the night went on, and midnight came and Lucy dragged me out even though I didn't want to leave, and I went home and to bed, where I didn't sleep. I don't know why, but I just didn't. Not until about 5am, anyway, which was a bit pointless because I was up again at 7am to get the bus to Nottingham. I was met at the station by James, who promptly whisked me to UGC Nottingham where everyone else was to see Shrek 2. Lots of hugs and kisses and "let me carry your bag"s occurred, and then we went in to see the film, which was absolutely hilarious. Go and see Shrek 2, I'm a total convert to the whole thing, after hating the first one. We went back to the meeting house, and lots of games were played and diaries kept and cuddles had. Sean and I got really close this weekend, brought together by various things I never knew we had in common, he let me share his duvet and lean into him when we sat down... he made me think, too.  So now I'm back at home again, far, far away from everyone I want to be close to, missing them all like crazy, and none of them are online. I want a hug and a kiss and to keep my diary and play Honey If You Love Me or Ratchet Screwdriver, but I can't because no one else gets those games, or the way we are at JYF. 17th September seems so far away...  Ceff x   It's just a little crush, not like I faint every time we touch

      I feel so drained today. I don't know why, as I've done nothing that's really required a lot of energy. Well, I had a driving lesson; they always seem to take it out of me, seeing as they're so damn stressful. We did awareness, anticipation and planning today, all of which I was rubbish at. I'm so envious of people who can drive.  The Leavers' Ball is tomorrow. It'll be the last time I will see a lot of people with whom I've spent the last 7 years co-existing, so it's going to be happy, sad and strange all at the same time. Maybe in 20 years I'll run into someone in the supermarket, someone I wasn't that close to, and we'll squint at each other, and say each others' names unsurely and then have an uncomfortable conversation about our lives now, and whether we still talk to anyone from school, which we probably won't. Alternatively, even worse, I could run into Laura/Becky/Debbs/Selina, with whom I'd lost contact with over the years, and we had nothing to talk about. I think I might just move to Leeds. And then JYF finally occurs on Saturday! Huzzah. My sorry ass will arrive in Nottingham at 11am, hopefully, and then for the next 36 hours much fun will be had by all. Twice.  So here ends my first day as a proper grown up. Thoroughly wasted, I think you'll agree. Only 3 more months of them to go...  Ceff x   If I only had a notion...
