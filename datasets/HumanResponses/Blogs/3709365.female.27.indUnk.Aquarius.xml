The thing is i need more extra job!! Holiday mean u can earn as much as money u want,u don't have to worry about over 20 hours...about ur tax file number..BUT i haven't got any extra work yet!! damm it!! i need it so badly.This is the time to save money!! What should i do if i have plenty of time but got nothing to do!! such a shame!!  I need to collect money to pay my course,and,i need money to make other dream come true agian!! i have secretly dream...which would be great if i can make it real.  I want to go travel....a big trip for my life before get back to settle down in Bangkok!? i don't know whether where i will be end up...but if it suppose to be in Thailand...  I want to go to Bali...Fiji...Newzealand then Singapore i have a good friend who i met 3 yrs ago.Carl,he always persuade me to visit him.I think this is a good oppornity to do if i drop in Singapore on the way back to Thailand,will need to tell him in advance...  Then i would love to go to Laos and Vietnam...around Thailand  Then travel agian in Europe.I have friend in German,good friend who i met here.Sofia.We hope to see one another agian....and i can fly to Hugary to visit Krist as well...Moreover i can travel around Europe and get to see some Thai friend in London..(if they still be there)  Then i need money to live in Thailand or somewhere while i still unemploy.  Obviously,i need money!! Not only money that i need to make these dream come true but i also need a good company to travel with me!! I realised since i live here alone that i don't like to be lonely..i don't mind to be alone but not lonely,if u know what i mean.  So, i need 3 options.1 money 2 good company,partner 3 right time.....  They all seem very difficult...thats y i said it is just secretly dream.But i know that all my heart hope it will be come true one day.Until that time i hope i will have enough money and have someone beside me :)) will see.....  I hope i will have extra hours during this holiday,pleaseeee....

      arrgh!! it was pretty cool!! i can say,this is bloody cool for me...i feel like captain cook dicovered Australia.Wowwww!! still excited about new thing i had discovered :))  Let see,if i will have any feedback from all my lovely friends...  from this blog,besides keep practice my english.I will be encoraged to write more often.I used to write my diary oftenly...but i stopped and less write since i got to live in Sydney....i was supposed to write more,wasn't i?? Well....i've been struggled by living here that's why.I promise,i will write more.I got so many thing to talk about actually...but sometimes i just can't be bother to keep up my diary as in the past...  Everyone who knows me should know that i love to write.I remembered when i worked in Big Blue,i was very busy and had no time to write in my diary so i had wriiten my day in my time schedule and left it under my desk....My collegue Ped,P pong,Olek,Bonus hidely read it and kept teasing me all the time....they said,i'm such a girlie dreamer girl!! i don't think so....its just because sometimes we all have a poetry side doesn't mean i'm a girlie girl.U know what,i believe that we all can be a great poetry like shakespear,especially,when we fall in love..haha!!   what has happened in my life lately?? so many things....some has affected my feeling...some made me happy...some made me down...some made me lonely...some made me fun....BUT most of all,it has made me to be me.I'm stronger :)) isn't it good??  These day,i just think more about what i want to do in life.As u knew that i quit my job and came to live in Sydney...most of the time i worry about what i should do,what i want...what if...and so what!! i want to be happy!! that all i know..  come on guy!! come to my world..be happy...life is so short,do everything to make it real!  i quite sastify my life so far as i got a chance to do what i wanted.Had a job that i dreamt about in a lovely company with wonderful people for 4 years.Had good experience,got to know clever smart cool people.Open my world.Got to go different places in Thailand and other countries.Have heap of good friends.Had fell in love.  I dreamt about living in aboard since i was young.I had a plan to leave my job if i work 2 years but i was enjoy to work there so much....i kept working there until last year...I fulled of job.I need a change for my life.It was time to do something else...to make other dream comes true...I still don't know whether this is the right thing to do? is this a right dicision?? To quit the good job that i don't know i ever have it agian. but i did it anyway.Sometimes u have just to follow ur heart and stop to worry about thing....My sis always tell me that i'm a head lead person and think too much.Now,i'm trying to follow my intuition...and not worry too much ...will see.  The thing is i need to find out what else i need in life?? this is a really my proublem at the moment...i don't know what i want...to be happy....i know...but...what else i want to do...what is my destiny?? who can tell...

      Well.....how should i start this post then....this is a totally new thing in my life.I've never known about blog before until i was told by someone i know.Thanks for this,anyway.  I think he is bored to read my long email and that is why he told me to create my own blog so that i don't have to write to him....well.....  I don't think i will let anyone know.My life isn't that interesting and i'm a shy person.But,this blog is good for me in a way i can practice my english..i still have no idea who will read my blog.  In case no one notice...I'm not a native english speaker....So,feel free for any comment...and any correction of my english.I will be very appreciate. well...i will stop it for now and will have a look what it will turn out..give me one sec...i will be back :))  kiss kiss

      &nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to tell one thing.Last Saturday i went to Thai concert in Sydney ,Townhall.It was "Nuvo" my favorite brand....i remember it was my first time to buy cassett tape,when i was about 11-12 yrs old. I had enjoyed a lots but felt homesick after that...it reminded me about my childhood,my highschool friends, my time in Thailand....  &nbsp;&nbsp; I went to work in Italian res again last 2 days.I love it.I love the ppl over there...i happy with them...that is the main point y i still work there eventhough it is so far away.When u feel like u r being appriciated,u r being need...it's so good.  &nbsp; I also had a chance to chat with Amanda yesterday,i met her on the way to get the ferry to work so i stopped and talked to her.....longer than i though...we talked a lots and i was so glad that finally...truth reveal...she confessed that i was the easiest one to live with and very honest.I'm glad that finally what i am is accepted.......i'm glad that i always be myself.and I Love myself more and more.....  &nbsp; Some exciting situation&nbsp;also happened yesterday had made me smiles obviously....it was a result from what i wanted to do...and i did....and it turned out kind of....nice heheheh.....but i can't tell yet...looking forward to know more though...

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I worked a lot last week since i started to work in Italian restuarant.It means i have to work everynight at the moment.Working in Italian res was nice.PPl there were very nice and kind to me.I can feel that they adore me for somehow.Having some more extra money is not so bad.Except,there is so far away from my home.I missed the bus last week and had to wait for a night ride bus until 12.30am.Can u imagine?? waiting for the bus with this kind of weather...alone at late night!! terrible!! And i got home about 1.20am just exactly the same time as my flatmate,Josie,so i had to wait until she finished using bathroom...i went to bed almost 2am and had to wake up at 7am to go to school!! Well....i will try some more and will see if i can take it....if it is worth for!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been good to keep myself occupied so i ddin't have time to think about my loneliness...Suddenly,i realised that i haven't got any friends left!! No Rodrigo,Christiana...no one wait for me at home...no one hang out with me...don't have any dinner...I felt sad...after they left for one week....Perhaps because of i had something to do for a week and when i had day off yesterday..i felt like empty....Normally i would have someone who talked to or hang around with.....I hope its not last though..i will be survive eventually...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What i have to do is be possitive,i would be very depressed otherwise.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have u ever thought about...y something happens in our life...what for?? Everything happens for reason...BUT sometimes there is no reason to happens at all...i'm wondering...what is the reason...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; We will see.....

      DAMM IT!!!   I was writing the previous post so long and it was just i clicked the wrong button!! It was gone....damm....i have to start to write it again!! O my dog!! too lazy ..but!   Anyway,i had written about i was surprised that i have some reader who bother to read my blog and i wanted to encourage u guys to write some comment in my blog to improve our english and don't be shy!! My english is not so perfect either.Thanks for those one who read it and let me know.I hope the rest of u will let me know and start to write eventually.    I also wrote about my last week that i was a naughty girl.I skipped school 2 days last week.I went out 2 times on Monday night at scubar and went to Brazilian party on Friday.It was farewell week for my flatmate Rodrigo and Christiana.They already left for Brazil yesterday morning.So,i had an excuse to be naughty,i supposed haha..I went out,had drinks and got drunk and(?)...I had 2 pints of beer on Monday night.4 tequilas and 3 beers on Friday night...u know that, how much i could take it hahah...don't criticise me alright..i hope u know how i am.Don't worry nothing was a big deal.I needed a break to clear my head from something and i won't have friends to hang out with anymore...well..at least in a while...i had a reason to spoil myself,though.    On Friday night was nice cos i met my ex teacher in the previous school,David,i haven't met him since i finished english course last year,since i got back to sydney this time.We texted to one another few times though few months ago.So,it was really really nice to catch up with him again.We both were surprised and ended up talking a lots...we talked about life and surviving...We r survivors..by the time i was talking to him,i realised that we knew each other for somehow..i had studied with him for 5 months...it was a long time,wasn't it.I felt like i talked to a friend,it's great that u have friends and i feel like we both are friends not student and teacher anymore..come on!! nothing romance at all!! i swear!!    I get back to my normal life now...wake up in the morning,go to school,go to work...BUT i have something a bit different...just start though..i will let u know later on.    I might get an extra job in Italian restuarant where i went to work 1 time last week.I have to call them on this afternoon to make sure that they still need me.But,the thing is this place is very far away from my house and i will get home about half past midnight.Anyway,i will try and will see how i goes....    Finally,Krist has to move out in 2 weeks.He fought with Amanda again on Saturday and she couldn't stand him any more...I will have a new brazilian girl roomate,she seem to be a nice girl...well...when Amanda told me i felt kind of mixed feeling...he is only one friend i have now...i might lose him but perhaps it is better for us this way...I will keep contact with him(i hope so) so we still friends and only friend.    What else happened in my life....some i could remember some i couldn't.Some i do want to remember some i don't....however,all of those thing have made me stonger for somehow.I less care about what other people thought and care more about what i really want.I listen more about myself.I will focus more about what will make me happy.I will fall inlove again but with myself :) Its time to love myself.    I need to love myself.I will love myself more and more...eventually.I will.....

      arghhhh!! finally,i got to study again.Mainly is mean i have to get up early which is i really lazy to do....BUT i had better pressured myself to be resposibility!!  There has so much thing happened during my holidays...first Joao had to go back to Brazil immediately and our travelling plan had collapsed :((  Krist has been really nice to me but almost had to move out cos he had a fight with Amanda...  I spent a lots of time with Rodrigo.  I haven't got any new jobs...but it wasn't that bad..i still earn some money though.  I already made up my mind to do something BUT get confused again cos i know myself that was not what i want...  I got question in my mind....do u believe in destiny and how and what??  Should i believe in it again....

      .....i've been through bad emotion lately.I was so down last week....really down...and cried a lots though....and i made someone got sick of me...i think i lost him now.  The thing is it's good when u were really down and though so hard about what has happened...Time to let it out ,exploded ur emotions....and start again...  Today i feel much better now..may be The Beatle that i listened in the morning has helped.  It is really nice to love and beloved,but,u gotta be careful when ur love is too full on and it wrapped someone too tight....we all need space.U better take time and go slowly.....just let go...and if it meant to be..it will be...  Love can bring us so down and really high...depends on how we love.If we expected we would have upset easily.....so try not to expect..Although u r really in love..but i do encourage to love base on loving urself.....base on what u want and be urself....and be compromise.Trust on ur couple.Mainly,be confident in urself.We all have got something special thats y someone attract to us and try to approach us...be confident that u good enough to beloved...  If it isn't work out....so just accept....it's life..its supposed to happens sometimes.....we just have to get back to our usual life....learn from it....it will be better next time.Hopefully.  U know what....the more i sad...i feel down...the more i feel stronger afterward...surprisingly,i feel in love with myself more and more....i hope that i will have time to in love with someone soon....and i hope it will be long last finally.
