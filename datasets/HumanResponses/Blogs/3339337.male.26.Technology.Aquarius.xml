       I was told from my friend( urlLink his web site, Japanese only ) really cool new Japanese mobile handset, AH-K3001V, by KYOCERA.  Light and small design, Opera implemented to connect to WEB, more generic mail application implemented following POP3 and SMTP, and reasonable monthly fixed payment! It's attractive enough for me, when I think of it without just one point that it's unusable in Hong Kong :( Anyway I heard he bought it already, so that hope he will enjoy it soon.   urlLink Check AH-K3001V out!  (Sorry for contents in only Japanese)

        Weather  Not so hot, but really humid.   General stuff  I took a taxi to go back to office this morning, because I woke up late. Nothing is worth by waking up in such late time, just wasting time and money. Btw, I decided to start to write this English diary every day. Hopefully it's gonna be keeped on going by myself.   Work  - OTASP APDU correction Correct Configuration Request, Download Request and Commit APDUs. Those errors are related to BlockID=02 and 03, which is for IMSI parameters. - WIM RSA key size updating Increase RSA key size to be created for following 128K bytes product up in several WIM testing projects. - From personnel I got an information that my status of company stock purchasing has been updating from personnel. That's good news, I could earn around 100K JPY by our company IPO.   Fitness training  N/A   Tomorrow?  It will be public holiday tomorrow. The plan is to clean my room up, to buy some daily stuff around Tsuen Wan MTR station, to swimming and to catch the sun at the swimming-pool side.  EOD
