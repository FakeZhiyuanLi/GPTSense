      Yes. This is the end. The end of life trapped in a uniform. The end of life with rules and regulations. The beginning of a lifetime of work dedicated to passion. Drown yourself. Hypnotise yourself. Mesmerise yourself. Is this a dream or is this reality? (Thats a song - Bohemian Rhapsody). what does it feel like to be free?. Its like opening your eyes and all you see is huge blank canvas. Start painting. A huge blank music sheet. Start composing. A Huge blank piece of ... life. Start living.......

         Whenever i hear my band warm down i love it. The best of practice is their tuning note at the beginning and warm down at the end.. hahaha... got to somehow make them play the way them warm up and warm down.. must must must... School's NDP parade.. what a joke.. hehe.. hard to keep a straight face.. hehe bt wat to do... have to be serious.. no performance is tiny and no audience is more inportant than the audience infront of u....thats the difference between prima donnas and real musicians.. treating every piece with the equal respect... unless u can compose a better song than what is on ur stand u shut up and play.. simple. of cos i wun put it that way to my students.. kids nowadays very touchy and very easily influenced.. must bring them up as ladies and gentleman...          horns horns horns... wat to do with u?... why are u like this?.. how are u like this?.. u think holding a orn and just putting ur mouth on the mouth piece considered playing music?.. from april until now... whatever u have learnt rest of the band can learn in half an hour... where is the EFFORT?           theres gonna be a workshop held at Fuhua Sec in december.. Bt Merah, and other bands taught by Ms Tan's students like Shuqun and Tanglin gonna participate... who would have imagined... Er, Patrick and myself.. 3 of Ms Tan's 1st 3 batches in shuqun.. would be teaching and havin bands of theirn own.. amazing...          and owuld would be amazing is if my horns manage to play decenet during that workshop.... amazing if they could manage to play the scale... i only have 2 hands and 2 legs and one mouth and and one body la.. i cant be with horns saxes percussion all at once... not to mention.. where is the time....?. lets just hope a miracle happens in decemeber.. either that or they will be so ashamed they will quit.... makes no difference to me anyway.. bad but true.. no contribution so why should it bother me....          where to find another band?. think think think... just pray... the way this school does things.. i will never survive.. getting paid like 2 months late....           im very happy with the bands sight reading.. gettin better each day.... of cos with the exception of the fabulous horns, the fantastic saxes and the wonderful percs.. who btw dun get their act together without getting a good piece of my mind.. morons.... rest of the band.. fantastic... at times rhythm is pitiful bt they try.. the only thing i can say abt the winds is if they had gd instruments they would walk into a gold band with both eyes closed....          they gonna go off for long break fingers crossed what they will sound like after the break.. worried.... got to focus.. horns sax perc.. horns sax perc.... HORNS SAX PERC!!!!!!!!!!!          Ok lets warm down... 3...4.... dooooo tiiiiii laaaa sooooooooooooooooooo....          p.s: muah babes.
