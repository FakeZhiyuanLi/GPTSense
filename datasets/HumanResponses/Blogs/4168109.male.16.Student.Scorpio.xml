       Today was one of the most swashbuckling days of summer. Our awesome newborn charter school--now in it's second year!--had its orientation/open house-thinger today for the 2004/05 (is that correct?) school year. I got to see faces from the days of yore--including my preciously adorable Mexican,  urlLink Ximena ; a newly-bleached  urlLink Christine ; the  urlLink new & improved --according to  urlLink Zara  [ urlLink blog ]-- urlLink Jack ; the tremendously amusing  urlLink Vickie  [ urlLink myspace ]; the positively radiant  urlLink Mary ; the hideously unnatractive--again, according to Zara-- urlLink Powell ; and the  absolutely stunning   urlLink Theresa . I failed miserably to get a photo of Theresa, since I didn't have film and my digital camera sucks twat--and since Zara hogged her digital camera and  didn't even take any photos!       After a brief assembly at Zara's house, Zara and I wheeled down to the new VAPAC capus site (click here--no,  urlLink here --to visit their curiously never-updated site--watch the "PSA", featuring frosh Emily and Frank in his pajamas! And I'm pretty sure I'm in it somewhere as well). Upon arrival at the gorgeous new site, I immediately orgasmed and then went to find Theresa. After searching and searching to no avail, I settled for her sister, Vickie, and Zara. We did something that I forgot about, then I went to get my schedule, which was all backasswards--and since the senior counselor wasn't available I couldn't fix my classes, which is--contrary to popular belief--completely gay.      Later, after fucking Zara in the janitor's closet, I spotted Mary and instantly got pissed off. I think I talked to her and her mom for like five seconds or something, but I was getting anxious at the fact that I couldn't find Theresa, so I ditched those bitches and discovered Theresa just as she was arriving with her other sister--Brittany--and her parents. I freaked out at the sight of her, for I am an idiot, and ran off to find Zara.      After doing some more forgettable shit with Zara and Jack, we decided to go to  urlLink 7-11  (linked for the convenience of you hosers that may not have 7-11's in your hometown) across the street. After forcing Zara to invite Theresa and Brittany--as well as some random black chick--we set out to for 7-11. On the way we came across Ximena being cute and Mexican, so we kidnapped her and brought her with us. The cool people (Jack, Ximena, Zara, and I) bought Slurpees--or "slooshies", according to retard Zara--and the other chicks bought boring-ass Snapple and soda. I bought a badass tabloid magazine and then we went back to the school.      While Zara and Vickie were whoring themselves out to some creep rapists, I worked on seducing Theresa. I'm pretty sure she is at least  a little  smitten with me--even Zara said she thinks that Theresa likes me, and Zara's the most disapproving about this whole thing. She's a seventh-grader, and even though she may act a little mature for her age, she's still going to show her admiration the way a seventh-grader does. She kept taking my cell, and she stole my sweater and wore it around her neck. Oh, and she was acting a little shy. That's what seventh-graders do when they're in love, no?      Anyway, later on Christine showed up and I gave her a hug, pissing off her stupid-ass boyfriend in the process. Jealous guys can all suck my cock. At the same time. Please?      After losing my tabloid, my parents showed up. My dad--up from San Francisco--bought me and Zara and Vickie lunch, but Zara was being creepy and shy and stubborn and didn't eat anything--my dad thinks she's anorexic now. Fortunately, Vickie made up for Zara's loserness by being her usual lovable self. My dad still loved Zara though--he called her a "firecracker".      Anysuch,  urlLink Laurel  [ urlLink blog ], I hope you're having a fun -chuck-less weekend.  (SARCASM)              -chuck-   ...or eat limes...

       Whoo! Twenty blog entries! Well, twenty-one now--but that's not the point. I honestly didn't think I'd last past nine entries.       But enough about me. Well, actually,  more  about me. I've been thinking--yes, I know, very shocking. I guess the major question in my life right now is: "  urlLink  Mary    or   urlLink  Theresa   ?" Do I continue in this endless quest for Mary?--who seems to have grown quite fond of me now that I speak less and less to her. Or do I move on and try for someone else--namely, Miss Theresa.       On the one hand (the Mary one), I truly am in love with Mary. I mean, I can talk about her like I hate her and say cruel things about her, since it's the summer and I rarely see her--but what happens when school's back in session? I can't possibly contiue pretending she doesn't mean anything to me if I'm confronted with her stupid face every day, can I? She's only the second person I've really loved, and letting go of that seems out of the question. But I've been trying preposterously hard to get her to love me back, and that has proven to be fruitless. It's been five months since we've stopped dating--I should have moved on from her by now. And I believe the only way I can move on from her is to literally  move on  to another person. Which brings me to my next point...      Theresa. Okay, so, maybe I'm not in love with her; maybe she has a boyfriend; maybe she's a seventh grader-- so?  I was watching  The Dreamers  (amazingly beautiful movie, by the way) today, and those French bastards don't care about any of that shit. Hell, they spoon with members of their own  family . Do you think age and relationship status gets in the way of a Frenchman's libidinous desires? Hell no! Just because I grew up in this Puritan-founded bastard of a country doesn't mean I have to bow down to its wholesome, pristine beliefs. And it's not like I just want to have some sexual affair with her--I  really  like this girl. I think she's smart, funny, kind--not to mention, dazzlingly gorgeous. But do I have a chance with her? Well, I'd like to think so. I guess I should probably learn more about her and the relationship she has with her boyfriend before I make my move.       So I guess I just have to just ask myself who I want more.       Who do I want more?       ...       Well, I can't answer that. Maybe if someone else asks me.       ...       I  said , "Maybe if someone else asks me."       ...     urlLink  G-D    [  urlLink  blog    ] : OH, WAIT, YOU MEAN ME?        No, I mean that other extension of my personality who answers all of my queries.        G-D: THERE'S ANOTHER ONE?        Yes  you , you ass.        G-D: UH...WHAT DID YOU WANT?        Just...Just nevermind.        G-D: NO, WAIT--I GOT IT.  AHEM . WHO DO YOU WANT MORE, MY SON?        ...       No, that didn't work either.        G-D: WELL THEN STOP BOTHERING ME, DICKWAD. I HAVE SERIOUS BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.        Like what? You haven't done anything useful in years.        G-D: WELL, I, UH...I HAVE A BLOG NOW,  THANKYOUVERYMUCH .

        Okay, so this  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans  bullshit is, well, bullshit. For some reason, they've called upon  urlLink Kerry  to release his Naval records, which can be found pretty easily right  urlLink here . They also claim that every commanding officer Kerry had in Vietnam "...signed a letter saying he is unfit to be commander-in-chief." Well that would be awful evidence against Kerry, if it were not a  urlLink total fucking lie .          Oh, and yeah, there's also that little piece of information that  none of them actually served with Kerry . Unless by "served with Kerry" you mean...uh..."served in the Vietnam War around the same time Kerry did".          But none of that is even the point, really. That Kerry served in the Vietnam War--that he's a "war hero"--is of no interest to me. In fact, it kind of disgusts me that someone would serve voluntarily in such a shitty war. What I respect about Kerry is that he later went on to protest against it.          Ha! Since nobody gives a shit about the real  urlLink Olympics , why not play  urlLink this  creepy game?               -chuck-     ...or eat limes...

                I swear to G-d that is real.  urlLink David Hasselhoff  is potraying Mr. Billy Flynn in London's production of   urlLink Chicago  --how terrifying is that? I refuse to believe that Hasselhoff is better than the hundreds of other men who auditioned for that role. Well, at least he's probably better than Richard Gere.      In other news, Mom and Mom's Husband fought incessantly through the night and early morning. Unfortunately for me, there was  urlLink no hallway door  to drown out their persistent shouting.      Ugh,  urlLink Zara 's [ urlLink blog ] just   urlLink asking   to be raped. If you've learned anything from me, Zara, it's that you shouldn't trust spics and black people. Now kick that Ruben guy to the curb if you know what's good for you!         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...

       I was at Tower Books today--smuggling books out of the store as usual--when a certain  urlLink magazine cover  caught my eye. The magazine was London's  Time Out  magazine, and on the cover was the illustrious  urlLink Natalie Portman . Unfortunately for me, I already had three books stuffed in my pants, so the magazine wouldn't fit. But the offer was too good to pass up--I bought it. I spent seven dollars on a  magazine  from  London  because it had a three-page article about Miss Natalie.  Seven dollars!  But it was worth it, because she looked [ urlLink ! ] and sounded positively radiant. Here is a portion of the article expertly reproduced by me:       ...Mike Nichols' film  Closer  in which Portman...portrays a character she's never played before--a stripper. 'You definitely see more of me than you have before,' she laughs. To prepare for the role, Portman learnt how to hoist her slight, girlish frame for the libidinous delight of others--by pole dancing...rating herself as 'pretty good for someone who's not a professional.'...She has been known to be...fiercely guarded over the way her body is portrayed on screen. It makes her decision to play such a titillating character that much more noteworthy. 'I never want to do anything that's going to make me uncomfortable in my regular life,' Portman explains. 'I never really want to walk down the street wondering who's seen my tits.'...Now, however, Portman is enjoying the free time she has planned for the rest of the summer. She'll spend it helping encourage American voters to vote for John Kerry.       Pole-dancing Kerry-supporter--if that's not the most attractive combo on God's       urlLink G-D  [ urlLink blog ] : HEY!      G-d's green earth I will eat my hat.      There's also a pretty great quote from one of my heroes,  urlLink David Cross , in the magazine: "I'm genuinely puzzled as to why [Tony Blair] wants so desperately to impress this lunatic Texan Christian fundamentalist."      In other news, the  urlLink mystery  continues...         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...

        The beautiful Miss  urlLink Zara  [ urlLink blog ] and I rendezvoused at the nearby Buddhist church this afternoon for   Super Japanese Day!!!     Super Japanese Day!!!   is an annual festival held by the Buddhist church across the street from my house in which they celebrate, you know, Japanese shit. I'm pretty sure they don't  really  call the celebration   Super Japanese Day!!! -- but if they did, that'd be pretty fucking awesome. Technically, all I have to do to find out the official title of the party is walk outside and look across the street, but I'm too lazy and I'm wearing my skivvies (settle down, Zara).          Anysuch, Zara had to work there since she's like an honorary Jap or something, so I met her while she was working. I bought this kickass samurai sword and went  urlLink Uma  on Zara's honorary- urlLink nipper -ass, then we ditched her little booth and trekked over to Jamba Juice. I killed Zara with my sword [ urlLink ! ] and walked back to the church, where I proceeded to make love to her foxxy mother.          [ WARNING:  The  urlLink Angus Diet  is  not  a real   diet!!!1]          I haven't had a real conversation with  urlLink Mary  for a couple days, and you know what? I don't care all that much.

        Last night was  amazing . I'm sure it was nowhere near as amazing as Miss  urlLink Laurel 's [ urlLink blog ] was, for she went to a showing of   urlLink Garden State   (damn you!)--but it was fabulous nonetheless.  urlLink Zara  [ urlLink blog ] and I journeyed over to the magnanimous  urlLink Vickie 's [ urlLink myspace ] house yesterday afternoon for some swimmin'. I wasn't planning on going in the pool, as I couldn't swim, but I was assaulted and forced into the pool by the girls. So into the pool I went and off my body my shirt went (did I seriously just type that?) to the delight of Miss Zarandaria (don't pretend you didn't love it, Zara). I eventually taught myself how to swim and then proceeded to kick Zara's ass in a race across the pool, even though she hella tried to cheat. Cheating gets you nowhere, Little Missy.           urlLink Andrew  [ urlLink myspace ] and his punk-ass little brother arrived later, along with a couple other random kids, which was my cue to get out of the pool so that I would be out of the way while Zara and Andrew got a little more intimate (which never happened, 'cause they're both hosers).          But enough about those crackers. Once out of the pool, I ate some chips and chatted with Vickie's stunningly beautiful little sister,  urlLink Theresa  (I hope I'm spelling that correctly). I'm afraid I am in love. I'm still unwilling to belive that she's only twelve years old--perhaps everyone is just playing a complex trick on me. But, seventh-grader or not, I'm in love with her, and I  will  conquer her. I'm pretty sure she's at least halfway in love with me anyway.          Ha!  urlLink Mary  called me twice last night trying to get hold of me, but guess who didn't answer 'cause he was having so much fun? (Me, you retards) Now who wants to talk to  who , bitch?          [shameless plug in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...]       For another, more feminine telling of last night's events, go  urlLink here !

It had everything an R-rated teen movie should feature: boobs galore, shitty soundtrack, fat people, that creepy Russian guy that's in every single movie in the world. And they threw in a load of flapping European penises for good measure. Oh, and the bitch from  Harriet the Spy  was in it--all grown up and ravishing.            urlLink G-D : OH, YEAH, LIKE IT MATTERS THAT SHE'S ALL GROWN UP. YOU PEDOFILE.

        urlLink Mary , being the scarlet woman she is, decided to call me today--the day right after I decide to get over her dopy-ass. I caught myself twice about to utter the contemptible words--"I love you"--and stopped myself. The words just cascade out of my mouth when I'm talking to her. I think the only thing that can help me now is shock therapy. Maybe sending a shudder of electricity to my brain whenever I mutter the word  love  will fix my problem. But then what about  glove, all of, luff, belove ...will those words be lost as well? Shit--my acting career will go nowhere without those precious words.      I finally watched  Once Upon a Time in Mexico --the third installment in the El Mariachi series, perhaps Mexico's largest (and only?) movie franchise to make it in our Great Country. Johnny Depp loses his eyes and says "fuck-mook", and Mickey Rourke practically strangles a chihuahua through the entire movie--so if you haven't seen it, it's well worth the five bucks to rent a copy.      In other news, the Discovery Channel is sleazy and distasteful. I was watching a program on squids early this morning, minding my own business [ urlLink 1 ], and this "scientist"-guy (probably just some male whore the Discovery Channel hired to wear a lab coat) was talking about squid mating habits and such [ urlLink 2 ]. According to whore-scientist, within the male squid's ten tentacles, one of them is, well, the squid's  trousersnake  (I mean, uh, tentaclesnake). When the male wishes to reproduce, he basically slaps his thang in the female and releases sperm stuff and the female has her babies or whatever [ urlLink 3 ]. So, this guy is talking about squids and how he found one--dead, male--in its peak of squid puberty. Now for the horrifying part. This creep then proceeds to pick up the squid's dong and (here it is)  squeezes  it, thus forcing squid spoogies all over the motherfucking table. That's only the half of it! After this "scientist" force ejaculates this  dead  squid, he up and puts his hands all in the  squid sperm ! [ urlLink 4 ]      [ urlLink 5 ]         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...

Oh, and she has black hair and green eyes, which is so crazy it makes my feet explode.       DAVINA  [no photo--too black to show up on camera] Proof that I'm not racist. She's another one of my best friends, and the only reason she's not my  best  best friend is because she's black. I usually do something stupid that pisses her off--she gets offended easily and I rarely ever think about what I'm saying, a very calamitous combo.    QUOTE:  CHUCK. I'm really thirsty. I want to pick up this water bottle I found on the ground but I'm resisting myself.   DAVINA. You're resisting arrest!!11   CHUCK. ...?     VICKIE  [ urlLink photo ] [ urlLink myspace ] My Samoan bitch and future wife. She rocks because I got her a  urlLink bacon maker-thing  for her birthday and she actually liked it.    CLOSEST CELEBRITY LOOK-ALIKE:  Reminds me of  urlLink Ibis from Road Rules .         KATIE  [ urlLink photo ] The beautiful girl I'm currently in the long process of seducing--about ten months so far. Very long process. Co-wrote  urlLink my future .    DID YOU KNOW...?  That Katie lost her hand in a bear-wrestling accident?         AMANDA  [ urlLink photo ] Ex-girlfriend who is currently helping me get over Mary. She keeps offering to get me a whore and I keep refusing, but it's getting harder and harder...    OBSESSED WITH:  Drunken cowboys with bulging crotches.       LAURA  [ urlLink photo ] Another girl I'm seducing. The only problem is that she has a boyfriend, and she's like one of those  loyal  girlfriends you hear about.    MOST EROTIC NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE:  She tackled me while playing in the river and we were caught by the rapids. We would have been swept away, had it not been for my incredible survival strategy--grabbing on to the rock bottom of the river for dear life. She's just lucky I never let go of her or she would have been pulled under. I'm like Superman except not as queer-looking.       ANDREW  [no photo available, bitches] [ urlLink myspace ] The guy Mary made out with, and Zara's current ex-boyfriend. There's no hard feelings between us because he's a cool guy and he said he wouldn't have made out with Mary if he knew how I felt about her. I'm hoping that he and I will become better friends in days to come.    TRADEMARK:  Ends every sentence with "and that's the way the cookie crumbles, miss sir!".         BLACK PAT  [ urlLink photo ] My other black friend (count 'em: one, two) who is totally whipped by...         ERIKA  [no fucking photo] [ urlLink myspace ] Friend from the old high school. She buys me Jamba Juice.    CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC:   Retarded  voice.         CHRISTINE  [ urlLink photo ] My  urlLink smacktarded  friend who occasionally turns into a posessed, homicidal car.    DID YOU KNOW...?  That GeoCities sucks my cock?      THERESA  [unfortunately, no photo yet] Vickie's divinely beautiful (twelve-year-old) sister who I'm in love with (and who has a boyfriend).    G-D: SHE'S TWELVE FUCKING YEARS OLD, YOU PERV.         XIMENA  [too endearing to show up on camera] Quite possibly  the cutest  little Mexican in the world. She looks like an extremely attractive cross between an ant and  urlLink Gizmo  (if that's possible).    DID YOU KNOW...?  That New Mexico is  not  the capital of Mexico? 'Cause I didn't.       ALEX POWELL  [the only photo I have is of his ass] I put his full name only because I either refer to him as "Alex" or "Powell"--or sometimes "Alex Powell". He's bipolar on the subject of me--sometimes he likes me; sometimes he loathes me. Overall, he's a pretty cool guy--when he's not being a pussy, that is.    OBSESSED WITH:  Every girl in the  world.        JACK  [photo-less] He's already conquered two girls--Christine and Amanda--on my cast list, and now he's after Zara.    TRADEMARK:  Jeff.         LAUREL  [ urlLink photo ] [ urlLink blog ] Some chick.    IN LOVE WITH:   urlLink This guy          G-D  [no photo available, as you'd probably turn to stone or something if you looked directly at Him] [ urlLink blog ] Sometimes drops into my blog for a quick visit--usually to criticize me.    CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC:  I'm guessing He probably has a really long beard.         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...

         W ell, bitches, I'm on the road to recovery--"Turning the corner," as old George Dubya Junior would say. I'm not on the road to recovery from drugs or alcohol or sex--no, I'm recovering from this bitch:     urlLink     The splenderous Mary    Getting over a girl is probably one of the hardest things a man can do. Especially this whore--just  look  at her. The hardest thing about moving on from a girl is that there's not much you can really say to encourage yourself. At least dope and smack addicts can tell themselves that by recovering their drug addiction they will become healthier and live longer lives, but being in love with someone who doesn't love you back isn't necessarily unhealthy. And who's to say she doesn't love me? I mean, she loved me at one time, why can't she still? But I guess she wouldn't have made out with someone else if she really loved me.      But enough of that dumbness. I'm broadcasting my recovery to anyone who reads this--which will probably only be  urlLink Zara , since she's basically the only person I can trust to not tell Mary about this blog. Of course I'll publish other shit about me as well, but the main purpose of this blog is to record my hurdle over Mary Hill for future generations. Or for Mary and I to look back and chuckle about when we're married. Which won't happen.         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...
