      Ok, not many will see this, since I am just getting started, and this is going to be my playground for awhile.  But soon it will be announced that I am the next product of the nasty life-partnership between  urlLink Harvey  and  urlLink Grau .  Yet another blog bastard as Harvey attempts to take over the blogosphere with his sidekick prison bitch!  I will be working on my profile and all the other little things, but for right now ...  I Have Arrived! Ahahahahahaahaha!!!

      Found a disturbing article as I  hit my home page.   urlLink Nazi's in Oshkosh?   What the hell's going on up there, Harvey?  Could someone check this out, and let me know.  Only glanced at the story, didn't click on links.  Trying to make sure that I get ...... (see below)

      (wiping tears from my eyes)&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp; Who knew that Ted Kennedy could be so damn funny?&nbsp; My sides hurt from laughing!&nbsp; Lush? We knew.&nbsp; Comedian?&nbsp; Aw God, never would have guessed!&nbsp; Comparing John Kerry  urlLink  to early patriots . &nbsp; You gotta read this.&nbsp; It will make you smile if not ROTFLYAO!   UPDATE   I'm sorry.&nbsp; I guess he was serious.&nbsp; For some reason, it won't let me link that story, so here's the&nbsp;joke:&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/27/dems.kennedy.transcript/index.html &nbsp;

      &nbsp; Yep, that's me.&nbsp; I should be sleeping now, but I just get too excited thinking about my vacation.&nbsp; Can't sleep so I'm going to blog a bit, then read Stephen King until the book slaps me in the face. &nbsp;&nbsp; My brother, cousin, and I will be taking off Saturday for Colorado.&nbsp; Not sure of our route, but we're going to get there!&nbsp; On vacation, my brother and I have found it's best to only have an idea of things you want to do.&nbsp; "Want to ride over this way?"&nbsp; "Sure, as long as we can stop by wherever first."&nbsp; Set an itinerary, and you'll end up getting upset.&nbsp; I think our best bet is to take a couple roads to other roads that lead to Newcastle, CO!&nbsp; Once there, we will be staying with a friend, and using his house a base for our daytrips. &nbsp;&nbsp; Part of what is pumping me up, is knowing that I will have someone with me.&nbsp; Two years ago, I rode out to  urlLink Glacier NP , in Montana, down through Wyoming, and to Colorado.&nbsp; Awesome trip, but there were many times that I wished I had someone with me. &nbsp;&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; Going through Wyoming, I  needed  to see the  urlLink Medicine Wheel. &nbsp; A sacred site to the Native Americans, I had read a little about it as a kid, reading  urlLink Louis L'Amour  stories.&nbsp; Once I got there, I initially thought this isn't very impressive.&nbsp; I wasn't at the wheel, yet.&nbsp; As I hiked from the parking lot to the wheel, I began to feel just what it was that drew all the tribes.&nbsp; The feeling you have standing on that mountain (and the mountain itself isn't that outstanding) is indescribable.&nbsp; To try, you would think I was a freak.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; I stood off to the side and waited for a Deleware Indian to finish his prayer.&nbsp; He had gotten there at the same time as I did, but I wanted him to have his privacy.&nbsp; He entered the wheel, removed his boots, and started to pray.&nbsp; I kid you not... as he started praying, a small bird (looked kinda like a sparrow) landed directly across from him.&nbsp; No big deal.&nbsp; But as he went and faced each direction, the bird kept 180 degrees from him, looking at him the whole time.&nbsp; As he finished up, and left, the little bird took off.&nbsp; Yeah, sounds like no big deal, but what got me was the  "feeling"  in the air.&nbsp; The next to go in the wheel was an Apache, and as he entered, an eagle flew up and started circling to the north.&nbsp; It stayed there as long as I was there, but I left before the Apache finished his prayer.&nbsp; The feeling was ineffable, and I found myself wishing that someone would have been there with me.&nbsp; Just a powerful experience. &nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;had a few "did you see that" moments all through that trip, and more than once I found myself starting to&nbsp;turn and say something.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I love to be out by myself, I&nbsp;truly wished for someone to share what I had seen.&nbsp; This is going to be sweet.&nbsp; I can't stand this waiting!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp; From  urlLink Newsday : urlLink Pizza Maker Fired for Refusing Service . &nbsp; Aage Bjerre is a Danish pizza maker who stands for what he believes in, and won't back down.&nbsp; Even at the cost of losing a job.&nbsp; I first read the headline, and thought," man, you could have a lot of fun with this."&nbsp; After reading the article, all I can say is that I'm impressed with the man.&nbsp; He's refused to serve French and German tourists because he says they are anti-American.&nbsp; He was fined for discrimination, but chose to serve 8 days prison time instead.&nbsp; That was last year. &nbsp; This year, at a different restaurant, in a new location, he did it again.&nbsp; And it cost him his job. &nbsp; We can say "Bravo, way to take a stand!"&nbsp; And we should.&nbsp; But think about this;&nbsp; he is not even an American, and he's taking a stand for us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some may think he's doing this for attention, and may make more money in the long run.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; How much money will he make selling pro-US t-shirts online?&nbsp; In Europe?&nbsp; Most of his buyer will probably have to be American.&nbsp; I do have an idea for his shirts.&nbsp; Remember  urlLink the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld? &nbsp; NO PIZZA FOR YOU!!!

      Found an amusing little piece.&nbsp; A teenager claims to have found (in best nerdy voice) a  urlLink marijuana cigarette  in her yogurt parfait from the Golden Arches.&nbsp; No wonder they've adopted the&nbsp;"I'm Lovin' It" slogan.&nbsp; What a way to give people the munchies! I don't know if I believe that some idiot was stupid enough to be smoking inside of the kitchen area, but then again....&nbsp; It's well known among the teens and some adults (bar knowledge), that one of the fast food joints one town over has a drive-thru with "extras" if you go through on the right night.&nbsp; Thought it was a crock. Until I met the bonehead providing the extra service.&nbsp; (If you must know, it was  not  a business transaction!)&nbsp; Nice kid, but not very bright.&nbsp; &nbsp; It'll be interesting to see what they find out.&nbsp; Never know, it may have been extinguished in the yogurt by the consumer!

      Blogging this week is going to be a little off and on.&nbsp; Going to be packing and getting ready to ride out west.&nbsp; YAHOOOOOO!!!!!&nbsp; I've been looking forward to this since last fall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, since I've got alot of prep to do, I may be a little scarce.&nbsp; I'll be reading my blogfamily and commenting, but about the posts, I'm not so sure.

      Music this week was loaned to me by Mr. Maltby.&nbsp; He lent me  urlLink Chevelle's "Wonder What's Next."  I had heard a few songs off of the album on the radio,&nbsp; and kinda liked them.&nbsp; Not overwhelmed, but seemed "ok."&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;impressed now!&nbsp; If you like Tool, you'll like these guys.&nbsp; No, they don't sound exactly like them, but they structure their music in a similar manner.&nbsp;  And , believe it or not, they are a Christian influenced band.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, they are  urlLink listed under Christian music. Now, I'm not saying that I like them for that, or that I hold it against them.&nbsp; I do like good music, and this is some goooood music.&nbsp; Closure, The Red, and An Evening With el Diablo are my favorites.&nbsp; As soon as I get some extra ching, this is going to be added to the collection. Beer, same old Amber Bock.&nbsp; Good, good, old Amber Bock.&nbsp; Me thirsty. Started reading "Songs of Susannah" by  urlLink Stephen King .&nbsp; Not too far into it yet, but it's getting good.&nbsp; It kinda started slow.&nbsp; I think that may be because he's giving a bit of a backstory as he's telling the current story.&nbsp; This is book six in the Dark Tower series.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is anything like the other's it should be excellent!&nbsp; If it's not, please don't tell me.

      Soccer fans abroad seem to be portayed as violent hooligans, always ready to fight at a drop of the hat.&nbsp; Sounds as if those overseeing the game may be taking that reputation away from them. &nbsp; urlLink Never question a referee's call , at least not in South Africa.&nbsp; You may get shot.&nbsp; Almost sounds like  urlLink Tammi's  story about  urlLink tough cops. &nbsp; Sounds as if South African soccer is a little messed up, and I'm talking the whole league.&nbsp; That story is down a little from the shooting ref.

      Just a quick note to all of&nbsp;you, all 7 of you who may read this.&nbsp; I am going to be doing some research into a drinking game called quarters.&nbsp; You may know how to play, and if so, suffer while I offer a short explanation.&nbsp; Players take turns bouncing a quarter off of the bar, or table, whatever is handy, and trying to get the quarter into a glass.&nbsp; If they succeed, a fellow player, called out before the bounce attempt, has to rid the world of a shot of liquor.&nbsp; In one on one mode, one gets a chance to nullify the attempt by sinking said quarter after the successful attempt.&nbsp; This is repeated until the bartender orders you out of the establishment. If any of you happen to know who originated this game, please send a name and address, so that I may get even with the gent/lady.&nbsp; This game may be fun, but putting a sot into the condition in which I happen to be stuck in presently is not.&nbsp; Ok, it may be, but....ah, nevermind.  My apologies in advance to those blogfamily members who I may have e-mailed.&nbsp; I know some went through, I just hope they aren't as meandering as I think they may be.

      "So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodnight ......" I've got music playing in my head, 24/7.&nbsp; Usually, it's an equal mix of cartoon music (and the cartoons that go with them),&nbsp; shuffling blues, punk, TV theme songs, and once in a while church songs.&nbsp; Yeah, I know, that's a  great  mix.&nbsp; But it usually keeps me in a fairly decent mood.&nbsp; Things start going bad,&nbsp; that's when the happy workout tunes start popping in.&nbsp; Slipknot, Slayer, Overkill, etc.&nbsp; You know, listening to the right music while working out can increase the amount of weight lifted, or distance run.&nbsp; Probably just a mind thing, but it's cool how it works.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm drifting. Have you ever had a tune stick in your head that you just can't get rid of?&nbsp; Hours, and hours on the same song,  over, and over, and over  again?&nbsp; Yes, you have ... don't even try to kid yourself. Usually, I'm the guy that works overtime to get those demonic tunes in your head.&nbsp; I walk by whistling Sesame Street, the Chicken Polka, the Bably Elephant&nbsp;Walk,&nbsp;or even that song they used to play at the movies for intermission. (You know, "Let's go out to the lobby, let's go out to the lobby, let's go out to the lobby, and have ourselves a snack..."&nbsp; Think dancing candy, hot dogs and buns.")&nbsp; I go by over and over until you start whistling the same.&nbsp; Hehehehehe&nbsp; Usually.&nbsp; But thanks to Eric of  urlLink Straight White Guy , I had a tune sticking in my head all night at work.&nbsp; Over at  urlLink Madfish Willie's comment party , he played some Stones.&nbsp; I had Honky Tonk Woman going inside my head until I thought I may have went to Hell.&nbsp; Trying to think of anything to stop it.&nbsp; Nothing worked, until Auld Lang Syne popped in there.&nbsp; Ok, weird, but better.&nbsp; But of course, it started bouncing between the two after a while.&nbsp; But wait, from&nbsp;out of nowhere comes that song from "The Sound of Music."&nbsp; Serious.&nbsp; No idea where it arrived from, but it was there. "So long, farewell."&nbsp; Haven't heard that song in  days  years!&nbsp;I finished the night going between all three.&nbsp; One of my coworkers let me know that I am certifiably looney.&nbsp; He may be right. Now.&nbsp; Thanks alot, Eric! Well, I'm going out to the lobby, to have myself a snack.&nbsp;

      Thank you ever so much, Phillipines.&nbsp; Give the insurgents what they want, and they'll go away?&nbsp; Yeah,&nbsp;  urlLink that worked great. &nbsp; I know that a human life was at stake, but you just gave them fuel for their fire.&nbsp; A whole nation should&nbsp;not allow themselves to be swayed by a handful of idiots.&nbsp; Yes, you got your man back.&nbsp; That  is  great.&nbsp; But now they've gone and done it again.&nbsp; How many of these countries are going to cave in, and in doing so, strengthen the insurgents resolve?

      Being a single guy, and with no mud magnets of my own, I live life vicariously through my brother and sister's families.&nbsp; My sister called me and left a message last night.&nbsp; She was still laughing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of her boys are clowns, but the youngest comes up with some funny stuff.  She was tucking the eldest in (the youngest was already in bed ... or had been) when she hears behind her this little guy trying his best to have a deep voice:&nbsp; (long and drawn out)"Are you ready to 'rasso?!&nbsp; Ladies and gennamen, please make way for the Master of the Whoooopieeee Cushion!"&nbsp; I told them about that 2 months ago!&nbsp; Obviously I made a great impression!

       At work, when we are goofing off, we use the term, "screwing the pooch."&nbsp; I doubt that our area is the only one that uses that term, but that's beside the point.&nbsp;   Over at  urlLink Drudge Report  I found this article about  urlLink an idiot who took the term literally. &nbsp; Uhhhhh ....

       Today wasn't a good day for me blog-wise.&nbsp; I was once again stuck doing the "hit and run" blogging/commenting.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the ideas for posts that I had, had already been covered.  &nbsp;  urlLink Grau  and  urlLink Tammi  got right on Arnold calling the dems of California "girly men" with Grau's urlLink "Listen to me now, and hear me next week ...  and Road Warrior's  urlLink "Oh, for cryin' out loud" .&nbsp; I had cracked&nbsp;up when I read about&nbsp;that, and had a few thoughts, but they both took care of that for me.&nbsp; I don't mind one bit.&nbsp;   My other idea that I came up with wasn't really that great, but I thought a few people might be interested.&nbsp; I was at Kline's Club 88 in Beloit, Wi.&nbsp; Saturday night, and they had a beer on tap that I really liked.&nbsp; I thought, "hey, maybe I'll let people know about some of the different beers I try,&nbsp;and bands/albums I listen to each week."&nbsp; Well,  urlLink Little Joe  had beat me to it, with his entry about  urlLink Slipknot .&nbsp; Seriously, on one hand, I thought it was great that he did that, on the other, I was a little bummed.&nbsp; Oh, well, there's still the beer!   This beer isn't some micro brewery treat, but this is the first time I've found it on tap in this area.&nbsp;  urlLink Warsteiner Dunkel  is a damn good beer.&nbsp; I usually drink dark beers, so it's no suprise that I would like this.&nbsp; However, for being a dark beer, you can drink quite a bit without getting that "I'm going to explode if I have one more" feeling.&nbsp; Believe me, I put a serious dent in the world's overstock that night.&nbsp; But there is still so much more work to do!&nbsp; I shall try my best to rid the world of these beverages, one at a time!

       My birthday was the ninth. Nothing different from the usual eat, work, sleep, repeat routine. So, I decided I would make up a birthday tale. Here goes.    The day started off like most; got up, stretched, and had an injury free workout. (I said like  most! ) I showered, ate and then sat down to figure out what I should do on this special day. (Did I mention it was my b-day?) After a couple of bottles of "brunch," I had my day set.    I still had a couple hours before the theatres opened, so I did some housework. Basically that consists of moving my dishes and bottles to the counter next to the sink. The fridge looked like it could use a good cleaning out, so I took care of that, too. Ah, time to head to the movies!    Now  urlLink Harvey  had told me about  urlLink a sneaky way to see "Farfromright 812"  without actually giving any of my money to "der Zeppelin." Buy a ticket for another lame movie, and then sneak into the theatre showing "The Mickey House Show." I know, why see that load of tripe? I just like to anger myself every now and again. Keeps you sharp!    It's been a long while since I've been to the movies. Nobody told me that carrying stuff in was a bad idea; I got thrown out! The movie had just started:  Usher: "Sir, we're going to have to ask you to leave."  T1G: "What's the problem?" (Drops egg)  Usher: "You're throwing things at the screen! You  cannot  do that!"  T1G: (quickly fires off another tomatoe which hits a man in the first row)"So, my aim is off a bit. Doesn't mean I can't do it! (launches another egg; success!) See?! How about that?"  Usher: (grabbing my garbage bag filled with refrigerator refuse)"I mean, that behavior is   not   tolerated in here."  T1G: "Alright, keep the garbage, I'll be .... aaaack (angry guy from front row gets me in a sleeper hold)  Angry Guy: "Going. Or maybe getting your butt kicked?!"  T1G:  (nodding while holding up one finger) "Grrrraaaaaccccckk"  Once outside, I figured I may as well head for home. No wonder I hadn't been to the movies in awhile.   By now, that garbage bag (which the nice usher made sure I got to keep) was starting to smell a little ripe, so I headed over to the side of the cinema where there were a couple dumpsters. As I neared the bins, I spied a seemingly familiar figure. He had the emergency exit cracked open, and was watching the movie intently. Playing on a hunch, I reached in the bag, got an egg, and fired it at him. No reaction, as I hit the wall next to him. Hiding behind a dumpster, I gingerly rummaged around until I found that rancid jar of pickled herring. Hoping to cover him with the pungent rot, I rifled the jar at the wall over the exit. I caught him square in the back of the head instead!!!   "GAAAAAAHH! INDEED!" Any question as to his identity was gone as he turned around.Socks/sandals-check. Black cloak-check. And lo and behold, one of  urlLink Harvey's stakes  was protruding from his groin. Evil Glenn!!  EG: "Harvey?  urlLink Bartender?  ' you there?" Unable to keep from laughing, I stood up.  EG: "Ooooooo .... hobo twins."  T1G: (looking around) "Wha???"  EG: (his eyes growing) "You gents should come with me. I could offer you a bit of  disposal  repose."  urlLink Grau  had told me that the evil one screamed like a little girl. Seeing his fingers were still holding the door open, I leaned hard against it. Grau was right!  EG: " AAIIIIIIIEEEEEEEE! Why'd you do that?!"  T1G: There's only one of me here, and though I may dress like one of your targets, I'm not. (sniffing the air)Although, I must say, after that herring bath, you  smell  like one. Hoooooboy, you reek!"  EG: I know who you are now .... you are the sons of Harvey and Grau. Tell me, do they really ... (moving his eyebrows up and down)"  T1G:  Don't even say it!" (we both fight back an involuntary shudder)  EG: "Better left unsaid. Indeed! Why are you guys here anyway?" So I told him all about my failed scheme.  EG: "Bah, you would think the product of such a coupling would be able to be just a little devious."  T1G:  Whatever. Change of topic ... why do you still have that stake in your groin? Being a vampire, that should be a nonlethal wound. Or isn't it?" (starting to see movement over by the dumpsters)  EG: "Oh, it's not lethal at all. (He gets a creepy smile, and his eyes glaze) I just like the way it feels when my cloak rubs against it, like this. See?!" (I turn away ... yeah, there's definitely something, or a couple somethings moving by the bins)  T1G:  "Ok, on that note I'll be going. You freak!" (oh look, a couple of large racoons materialize .... must be drawn by the herring)  EG: "That's  lawyer  to you two. And, please go. You're making me miss my son's movie! (racoons move in closer) I'm so proud of ....... mmmmmmmmmm, puppies!"  T1G: "Actually, those .... ah, nevermind. I'm gone." (More 'coons are appearing now, as Evil Glenn reaches for one ....) Yep, Grau was right on about that girly scream.  EG: AAAHHH! I'll get you two and your fathers for this! You hobo lookalikes! Aaahhh! I'll fix it so that .... oooh, hey, that's right you nasty animal. Keep  rubbing    that      stake..........   "  What a freak! It wasn't the best birthday, but it was by far the most enertaining one. Hey, I wonder if EG has done something to Grau in retaliation?! Maybe that's why we haven't heard anything from him! Sorry, Pop!&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       I saw  urlLink this  at  urlLink Sailor's site  on Monday, saved the article, and figured to do some checking and griping.  Well, it seems that  urlLink Cajun   urlLink beat me to it!  I really like what he had to say; pretty much mirrors what I was going to say!  I only had a little more to throw in, and I got that from an article that  urlLink tells a bit more. She says she's done material on every president in the past 20 years.  It's one thing if the man is sitting there, and the jokes are done "roast" style.  That can be tasteless in itself, but it's totally inappropriate when the person isn't there.  You can't even say it was a harmless joke, when your other celebrities and speakers are spewing their bile!  Now she feels that the Republicans are trying to hurt her pocketbook.  Riiigght. We all know that because you lost the Slim Fast gig, you are going to be living on the street.  (No, working on the street doesn't qualify as  living  on it.)  It's just a matter of what is appropriate.  Like she said herself, it's not going to shut her up.  I wish like hell there was a way to do that.

       I learned a very valuable lesson today while attempting to work out.   Always  check cable connections before exercising.  I sat down and attempted to do some pulldowns and got a very rude awakening.  Or rather, blackening.  The cable had come unthreaded and when I gave a mighty pull, all I did was slam the bar down on the top of my head!  I heard a crunch, saw a flash, and then everything started to fade out. I didn't get knocked out, 'cuz I saw the ceiling staring back at me before I hit the bench.  I wish I had a video of it.  My cousin said he saw the bar slam into my head, I grabbed my head, and then slowly tipped over!  Ah, good times, good times.  I laugh now, but at the time all I could say over the throbbing pain were a bunch of caveman grunts!  Guess what I'm checking on Friday before I do anything else?!

         Ok, here's one that offers a bit of a poser. urlLink Teen tries to buy gun co. .  I read this, and instantly I felt rage.  But when I sit back and think things through, I have to admit that I'm not angry at the same things that have made me angry.  Bear with me, please, a libation,or ten,or even more, is at work.   Being a life member of the NRA, I first thought that my anger was about the "it's the gun manufacturer's fault" cry.  Ok, maybe a little.  But not what I first believed.  Yes, it's getting to be a pretty common thing nowadays, but that just wasn't it.  Even if they did  urlLink  win that battle , it only mildly enrages me.  Haha!  See, no worries!:)  We NRA members tend to be a little sensitive when things like this come about!   Then, I thought maybe I was only angry because young Maxfield wanted to buy Bryco Arms only to shut it down.  No.  Actually, I like the concept.  Granted, he should think this out a little better, and I'll hit on that shortly, but it's a pretty good idea.  Kind of a variation of the biblical "if thy right hand offends thee, cut it off ...." ((Matt. 5:30?) I used to be a churchboy.)    After a couple more self checks, I realized what it was that bugged me:   the sheer stupidity of it all!   One thing I hate more than an air of superiority is a fog of stupidity.  I feel bad for Brandon.  I really do.  But, to blame this incident on a manufacturing flaw alone is idiotic.  WTF, no, what the fuck ever happened to good old gun safety?!   When handling a tool that is capable of launching projectiles faster than the speed of sound,  point the fucking thing away from others; preferably at the ground!  Can we say "no brainer!"  I can.  Hell, I can even type it.    Buying a  bankrupt  company.  Hmmmmmmmm.  This could be looked at a couple of different ways, depending on what was filed.  No, I guess a debt that is a fine or penalty imposed for violating the law is not forgiven.  So, I guess that would be money right back in you and your lawyer's pockets.  See,  it's mentally tearing me apart!  This would be the part where I was going to expand upon Maxfield not thinking things out.  Shit.  Oh, well, I've typed this, and I'm posting it. Nyah. Now I'm pissed that I can't be pissed about what originally pissed me off!

         Heard this at the pub, and had to run home to see if it's true.  I'm hoping that  urlLink this crap with the Phillipines  is some kind of doublecross.  They say that the statement appeared to be deliberately ambiguous.   I hope that this statement was made with one hand waving "We Give Up," while the other is holding a keg of whoop ass.  I know it's easy to say this sitting here in my house, but we can't keep doing as these sons of goatpigs wish.  First Spain has to prove that, yes, you can tell us what to do, Mr. Smellyfuck.  Now it's appearing that the Phillipines are caving.  Gah!  Nothing like giving them more hope and ambition.  "Hey, the swine are actually leaving!  Now let us come up with more threats, and see what they will do!!" Please be planning some kind of doublecross, Phillipines.  PLEASE    A good friend of mine had a great tactic when facing potential trouble.  We were at a concert in Lejuene, and it was open to civilians.  One civilian  guy started trouble with my buddy's wife, and would not let up.  Said friend did something that I was laughing about for a whole week.  He is a lefty, and he started waving his right hand at the guy, telling him to chill out, settle down, let it go.  Once the idiot dropped his guard, my buddy dropped him.  Cheap shot? Yes.  Effective? Most definitely!  As my buddy said, "he wasn't going to be happy until fists were flying.  I just made him happy!"  I hope that this situation with the Phillipines is a similar deal.

        I got this from  urlLink Mostly Cajun , who got it from   urlLink Acidman , who got it .... does it really matter?  I had to laugh at my results after taking  urlLink  Better Personality Test.   A little maniacally, but I laughed.   My Results: Wackiness: 62/100 Rationality: 62/100 Constructiveness: 50/100 Leadership: 56/100    You are a WRDL--Wacky Rational Destructive Leader. This makes you an enemy of the state. You are charismatic and winning and a very dangerous enemy. You favor justice over compassion, and would almost rather see your opponent fail than you succeed.  You impact the lives of those around you more than any other personality. People remember your name and respect you. You are a tremendous amount of fun to be around and astonishing to watch. You are generally abstinent in your habits, and you like things tidy and ordered.  When picking teams, it is smartest for others to pick yours. Enemy of the State .... Muahahahahahaha!

       This is one I wish I could have seen!   urlLink A vicious groundhog attack leaves two men terribly shaken!   Keeeeeheeeeheeeeeee.  Yes, I know that groundhogs can be a little mean, but this had to be hysterical to see.  Like I told my blog sis Boudicca,  urlLink about her story ,  urlLink it's fun to watch  the neighborhood sometimes.  Especially if they don't live right next door!

       This is just one of those things that you don't quite know how to take.  I mean, you are enraged, and at the same time, you've got a little smirk going.  The situation, a funeral.     urlLink Lcpl. Juan Lopez   was one of four U.S. Marines killed in an ambush in Ramadi, west of Baghdad, on June 21.  Lopez was born in San Luis De La Paz, Mexico, immigrated to Dalton, GA, as teen before joining the Marines.  During his funeral, Sunday, Mexican soldiers blocked the path of a color guard as they marched to the grave site.  Personally, I am pissed that these asses would dishonor this young Marine's memory over some replica rifles.  The initial 21 gun salute was scrapped because Mexico's Constitution bans foreign soldiers from carrying firearms.  Sounds as if the soldiers thought they might fire it anyway.  Still, how low do you go?  And that's where the smirk starts.  (All apologies and respect to Lcpl. Lopez and his family.)  Did these soldiers have the first line of the  urlLink Marine Hymn  going through their tiny little skulls?  Were they afraid that 10 Marines were going to storm their country?  How frickin' sorry!  You really do want to cry for Lopez's family, while fighting off rage and the urge to laugh at the imbeciles.

       Here's the picture;  I am house/pet sitting for my cousin this week.  So, any blogging done is going to be of the "hit and run" variety.  I stop by my house for about a half hour twice a day.  I come diddyboppin' in this morning, and  Holy Freakin' Shit ,    urlLink my birth is announced!     Now, this shouldn't have caught me off guard ...  urlLink Harvey , urlLink Grau , and I have been talking about doing this for a bit.  But,....   Oh, well, what's that saying?   When life gives you sour milk and eggs, drink it, and it should make you stronger.  If it doesn't kill you.   I may be a little off, but that should be close!    Anyway, welcome to  Drunken Wisdom . I will be a little slow out of the blocks, but I swear, it will get better.

         Well, I'm not really back, but I stopped by my house to check mail and e-mail, and saw something on my main page that just pisses me off.  I don't know how many may see this, and to be frank, I don't give a shit.  I'm still practicing, and I'm irate.  Anyway,  urlLink  this is the story  that made me so happy.      To condense, Mikey Scrotumtree (believe it or not, not his real name) is an eco terrorist, goes to Canada, gets busted trying to shoplift a pair of boltcutters, now wants to live "forever" in Canada, and Canadian Immigration and Refugee boards actually are holding hearings to determine if Mikey is admissible to apply for refugee status.  WTF???  I won't give Mr. Scrotums "new name."  To me that's like me choosing to be called "Bob Who Kills Those Annoying The Great Bob."  Just one part of what pisses me off.  But the kicker is that Canada actually will have hearings on his behalf. I realize that it may be a formality, but you busted the numbnuts stealing!  Great potential citizen.  Not to mention the tree crap.  We all know that there are  no  trees up there, and therefore no logging.  You should have no problems with little Miss Firebomb.  None.  (I have to wipe the excess sarcasm off of my screen.)  BAHH!! Oh, and here's another  urlLink link  to help make sense of my rambling.

         My blog sister,  urlLink Boudicca , posted about her  urlLink theme of the night ... U.S. Marines .  A couple of stories from when she was a little younger, and a quote she made: "God didn't make any ugly Marines."  That's just cool!     I found a few more quotes that you will appreciate if you are a current or former Marine as I am.  (I guess that was starting to get a little obvious!)  These are found at  urlLink Doc Russia's Bloodletting  blog.  I think my favorites come from Chesty Puller.  There was a Marine!

       Now, I'm no serious tennis buff, but I usually try to make it a point to catch some of Wimbledon and the French (aaaugh... uncontrollable retching) Open.  It's a sport to watch once in a great while.   This week, I've been impressed by a couple different things.  There's been some great matches.  Some of these players are incredible to watch; Roddick's blistering serves, Federer's dominance, and Serena's power.  There are plenty of others, but that's getting away from the point of this post.   What I want to know is this; what's going on in Russia?  Is there something in the water?  Are they adding some secret ingredient that increases uncommonly beautiful tennis players?   I don't mean to sound like a perv, because I'm not.  Weeell, maybe .... Anyway, watching the matches with Tatiana Golovin and Maria Sharapova got me to wondering.  First Anna Kournikova, and now these two.   And , these two can play!  Obviously, Anna could at one time or she wouldn't have made it to the semi's.  But these two have alot of potential.  Whoa!  Just wait a couple more years!   And, no, it's not because they are blonde.  This gentleman does  not  prefer blondes!  It's just because they are going to be a couple of hotties!:)   Not that there aren't any hotties here, there's plenty, but it makes you wonder if you were born in the wrong country.  Then you realize, they're all moving over here!  Keep on coming over, and bring some of that water with you!!

      Just a quick note to let you know that I'm going to post my vacation probably Friday or Saturday. I was waiting until I had some pictures developed, but screw it... I'm notorious for canisters of film laying around undeveloped. I've still got pictures from my trip to England that  "Er... 'scuse me, but did you say you were in London?" Me: "Oh, great.  urlLink Instason . Actually, I said that I was in  England , although I did wander around in L...." Instason: "Did you get to see the Queen?" Me: "NO! Why the hell would you thi..." Instason: " urlLink Alex  did. He even  urlLink went to the pub and sang karaoke  with her." Me: "You idiot, he was being sarca..." Instason: "Did you get invited for dinner? Being an American and all, I bet she invited you over for dinner!" Me: "No, she didn't invite me o......" Instason: "Oh, you're one of the  urlLink drunken twins . I bet she took you to the pub?!" Me: (thoroughly fed up with the questions and interruptions) "Just shut up for ONE second will ya?! Make that SIXTY seconds!" Instason: (pouting) "Hmmpphhh!" Me: (in an effort to get all I have to say out before the Inquisition starts anew)"No I never saw the queen we didn't go to the pub I didn't go there for dinner I didn't even stay in London for more than 5 hours I stayed in North Yorkshire in Egton Bridge and why the hell are you here in the first place?!" Instason: (still pouting) " You  sure talk alot!" Me: "Just answer my question." Instason: "Well, we often come around to watch you or your twin blog while drunk! It's funny!" Me: (looking around) "Don't tell me that ....." Evil Glenn: (enters through open window)"Indeed! I am here, you miserable sot!" (looks around) What a pig sty! I like it!!" Me: "What the hell is up with you and your "mini-puppy blender" interrupting people?" EG: "Just calm down, oh, drunken one! Where is your twin?" Me:"Criminy! I told you before, idiot,..." EG: " Lawyer!! " Me: "You interrupted again!!!" EG: "Sorry, carry on." Me:"As I started to ...."EG: "  I was merely correcting your mistake.   " Me: "I heard that mumbling! (hurrying once again) I told you before you idiot yes I know lawyer that there is only one of me not the two that you saw after being smashed in the head with a jar and what the hell are  you  doing here harassing me when I'm not even an official member of the  urlLink Alliance ?!  Yet! " EG:(smiling) "Oh, try as you may, you'll not convince me that your twin does not exist. I saw you two standing together!! As for not being a member of the Alliance, I have my doubts about that. If not a member, why do you spend so much time with them, hmmmmmm?" Me: "I spend alot of time with them because they are funny as hell... sometimes even  urlLink Harvey ! And, I'm not yet a member because I don't feel that I have as much talent as the others. Once I feel that I can hang with them and their assignments, I'll see about joining. Until then, leave me alone!" EG: (sulking) "What a crabby pants!  Haven't you heard that if you try hard enough, the Alliance will come to you?" Me: "Say what?" EG:(sounding very exasperated) "If you go at it hard enough, they will come!" (uncontrollable snickering from myself and Instason) EG: "What's so funny?" Me: (composing myself) "N..no...nothing at all.  Really.  (Instason begins to loudly snort)  Why did you say you were here?" EG: "I said something funny, didn't I? (Instason is now rolling on the floor, screaming in laughgony)  I never say anything funny.  If I made a funny, I should like to know what it is!!!  INDEED!" Me:  "No funny, and still no reason for being here, besides you like to cartoon off of drunks trying to type." EG:  "Well, the reason that I'm here is ....(looking at Instason, who is now hyperventilating)  are you sure I didn't make a funny?" Me: "Get on with it ... and I'll even add a  please ." EG: "Very well, I simply wanted to thank you." Me:  (stunned)"For what?" EG:  "The pickled herring idea." Me: "Whaa?" EG:  "You remember when  urlLink _Jon  mentioned  urlLink peanut butter  in his post after coming home?  (shrieks from Instason)  I'd swear I made a joke!" Me:  "Yes, I remember.  Why?" EG:  "Well, once I got  urlLink home from the theatre , I had a ball.   The penguins  love  it!  A few strategically placed dabs of herring, and...." Me:  "OK! Enough. Picture painted! No need to carry on! Damn, you're a freak. Yes,"(both)" lawyer .""You know, I'm thinking that you've been here long enough.  I just wanted to drop a quick note to my blog family, and now you've made me kill all my time.  Hell, I could have posted about my vacation during all this!" EG: "Aha, could have, but didn't!"  Me: (remembering)  "You know .... my twin should be back real soon.  And he's not nearly as sociable as I am.  I suggest you get out of here while the getting is good." EG: (smiling) "I knew you were lying about your twin.  I know everything.  That's why so many people come to me!" (more maniacal laughing from Instason, who is now growing hoarse) Me: "Better take the youngster and leave, before he croaks on you." EG: "Good idea, inebriated one.  Come, young Bucky!  (shrill laughter once again)  I swear I made some kind of joke!" Me: "Perhaps, but why call him Bucky?  Seems a bit harsh." EG:  (aside) "Haven't you seen those teeth?  Well, we're off, but we'll be keeping track of you two!" Thank God they're gone!  I've got to stop drinking, or at least get extended entry!  Hope this is as funny tomorrow as it was to me tonight!

       Blog Bro  urlLink _Jon, of We Swear,  mentioned  urlLink Johnny Cash  in his  urlLink "Mortality Thought ... (and rambling)"  post. He mentioned the song "Hurt" and it's been stuck in my head since. I've had to pull out the album (sorry, CD) to satisfy my need to hear this song. I've listened to it many times this week.  The album is "American IV: The Man Comes Around," and to me, it kicks ass. There are a couple of songs that I didn't think fit quite right. "Bridge Over Troubled Water," and "First Time Ever I Saw Your Face," are prime examples, but for the most part, I love this album! Johnny Cash was one of those artists that could make you feel like you were right there with him, feeling his feelings as he sang about them. On "The Man Comes Around," it's vintage Cash. His last albums were full of cover songs, which he did rather well, (for the most part) making them his own. But I still have to say, the songs that he wrote are better than most of his covers.  Unfortunately, there only 3 of his own on this disc;  The Man Comes Around ,  Give My Love To Rose , and  Tear Stained Letter . Favorite tunes would be;   The Man Comes Around:   I don't know exactly why this song appeals so much to me,  it just does.  Well written, and the piano in this, while no technical masterpiece, adds so much depth to the song.  Gave me goosebumps the first time that I heard it, and still does.  Hurt:   This is a cover of a  urlLink NIN  (nine inch nails) song.  Powerful.  I haven't seen the video for this song, yet, but I've heard that the video is even more so.  I may have to pass; my vision gets water in the way just  hearing  the song.  From what I understand,  urlLink Trent Reznor , the writer of the song, was  urlLink moved to tears  after viewing the video.  We'll Meet Again:   This song just creeps me out, but in a good way! :/  It seems like he knew that this would be the last album he did.  He's got friends and family singing the chorus;  just cool to me. If I went into why Johnny Cash meant so much to me, I'd have to do a post on that alone.  It would take some time! Other cd of the week:  urlLink  King Of The Road   by  urlLink Fu-Manchu .  Click on album title for a review.  It's damn close to what I started writing!  Makes you want to go out driving ... fast. Finished with  urlLink  Song of Susannah   by  urlLink Stephen King .  Great book, but damn, I hate this waiting crap!  I won't spoil it for you, but it just seems to stop too soon.  Can't wait for Part VII. I was going to start reading a  urlLink Louis L'Amour  story, but, inspired by a rancid refrigerator at work, I'm going to read  urlLink  The Long Dark Tea Time of The Soul   by  urlLink Douglas Adams .  The refrigerator bit comes from a fridge in the story that  "no longer merely stood there in the corner of the kitchen, it actually lurked."   I don't know if you've read Adams much, if at all(though I know  urlLink Johnny-Oh  has: he's got a misquote from Adams as his tagline!), but he is hilarious. One of my favorites!

      Yes, I'm still alive, just gone for the weekend.  Now, I'm going into work early, but I thought I would send you guys something to know that I'm not dead, yet.  THUD! My cousin sent me this e-mail.  No idea of who the author is, else I'd credit them, but they did a great job!  Ordering a pizza in 2008: Operator: "Thank you for calling Pizza Hut. May I have your national ID number?" Customer: "Hi, I'd like to place an order." Operator: "I must have your NIDN first, sir?" Customer: "My National ID Number, yeah, hold on, eh,it's6102049998-45-54610." Operator: "Thank you, Mr. Sheehan. I see you live at 1742 Meadowland Drive, and the phone number's 494-2366. Your office number over at Lincoln Insurance is 745-2302 and your cell number's 266-2566. Email address is sheehan@ home.net Which number are you calling from, sir?" Customer: "Huh? I'm at home. Where d'ya get all this information?" Operator: "We're wired into the HSS, sir." Customer: "The HSS, what is that?" Operator: "It's the Homeland Security System, sir. This will add only 15 seconds to your ordering time." Customer: (Sighs) "Oh, well, I'd like to order a couple of your All-MeatSpecial pizzas." Operator: "I don't think that's a good idea, sir." Customer: "Whaddya mean?" Operator: "Sir, your medical records and commode sensors indicate that you've got very high blood pressure and extremely high cholesterol. Your National Health Care provider won't allow such an unhealthy choice." Customer: "What?!?!  What do you recommend, then?" Operator: "You might try our low-fat Soybean Pizza. I'm sure you'll likeit." Customer: "What makes you think I'd like something like that?" Operator: "Well, you checked out 'Gourmet Soybean Recipes' from your local library last week, sir. That's why I made the suggestion." Customer: "All right, all right. Give me two family-sized ones, then." Operator: "That should be plenty for you, your wife and your four kids,and your 2 dogs can finish the crusts, sir. Your total is $49.99." Customer: "Lemme give you my credit card number." Operator: "I'm sorry sir, but I'm afraid you'll have to pay in cash.Your credit card balance is over its limit." Customer: "I'll run over to the ATM and get some cash before your driver gets here." Operator: "That won't work either, sir. Your checking account's overdrawn also." Customer: "Never mind! Just send the pizzas. I'll have the cash ready.How long will it take?" Operator: "We're running a little behind, sir. It'll be about 45 minutes, sir. If you're in a hurry you might want to pick 'em up while you're out getting the cash, but then, carrying pizzas on a motorcycle can be a little awkward." Customer: "Wait! How do you know I ride a scooter?" Operator: "It says here you're in arrears on your car payments, so your car got repossessed. But your Harley's paid for and you just filled the tank yesterday" Customer: "Well I'll be a '@#%/$@&?#!' " Operator: "I'd advise watching your language, sir. You've already got a July 4, 2006 conviction for cussing out a cop and another one I see here in September for contempt at your hearing for cussing at a judge." "Oh yes I see here that you just got out from a 90 day stay in the State Correctional Facility. Is this your first pizza since your return to society?" Customer: (Speechless) Operator: "Will there be anything else, sir?" Customer: "Yes, I have a coupon for a free 2 liter of Coke". Operator: "I'm sorry sir, but our ad's exclusionary clause prevents us from offering free soda to diabetics; the New Constitution prohibits this. Thank you for calling Pizza Hut.   "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty, nor safety."  Ben Franklin  (I added the quote; one of my favorites!)

      I don't know why this strikes me as funny, but I'm getting a kick out of it.  From  urlLink Newsday.com-AP News  comes  urlLink this story . A tornado.  Not funny.  Suspecting it was a tornado.  Now, for some reason it seems funny.  And then, of course, we have to make sure that there is no doubt about this being the work of a suspected tornado.  Just the idea seems odd.  Suspecting a tornado. By now you've seen what stuck out to me.  While only used twice, rather thrice, it seems like "suspect" is the word of the day.  I suggest we re-write it as follows:    Suspected Twister Causes Damage in VA   (the state, not hospital) Danville, VA-A suspected tornado caused widespread damage in this Virginia city.  Officials report this. While suspected, and expected, no injuries were reported.  (At least none were detected.) A spokeswoman for the state's Dept. of Emergency Services, after listing damages incurred during the storm, said," We suspect it was a tornado."  However, A. Tornado could not be reached for comment.   While no arrests have been made, authorities seek Mr. Tornado, and a wEarl Wind for questioning.  A search of a suspected trailer park has yielded no suspects. "We suspect that they'll come around here," says one authority," and when they do, we'll .... hell, I'm not sure."

      Yes, I'm still going to tell about the trip, but that will have to be later.  Being the great time management expert that I am, I'm running a little short.  I got a little carried away with some of my realizations! Ok, I asked,  urlLink "What would you do to keep your grown child from marrying someone who you deem unfit?"   Thanks to all for the welcome back, and the answers you gave in response.  Most were along the same lines, which would be right along with what my thoughts were.  Except  urlLink Harvey , who gave an answer that was more along the lines of what I was hoping for.  He suggested  cutting the child out of my will.    Contagion did give options: you can either disown the child and write them off or just accept they are going to get married to someone not worthy of carrying the spawn that will spread on your legacy.  I like the way it sounds so mean either way. To get to why I asked that question in the first place.  We stopped on the Nebraska/Iowa line on our first night out.  We were kinda hungry, and definitely in the mood to decimate the beer population of the area, so we head into downtown Sioux City.  We had no idea where we were going, so we just stopped at the first hole in the wall that we saw.  We were eating when in walks a group of women laughing and having a good old time.  One was wearing a veil.   After a bit, in walk another couple of women, these a little older.  One stops and starts visiting with my brother.  This woman was the mother of veil girl.  She starts telling my brother all about her (mom's) dilemma.  Veil girl is going to be married at the end of this month, and MOVG (mom of veil girl) hates, no,    HATES   , veil girl's betrothed.  She let's us know all about her reasons for hating this guy, and he does sound like a real loser, but I'm not going into all that.  The whole time, veil girl is listening, and not arguing, so we start thinking MOVG is talking straight.  MOVG definitely loved her daughter, and she was worried sick about what was going to happen.    After talking with my brother for about an hour, MOVG decides that we are a bunch of "real men."  I'm still not sure how this was established.  She figures that if her daughter got to know that there are better men out there, she would drop LOSER.  MOVG tries to convince Bro to take veil girl out for a ride.  "You guys take her back to your hotel.  Show her what real men can be like."  All three of us were laughing our asses off!  Then, after she started to get a little pissed at us, we realized she was serious.  That was more than a little disturbing!  Bro and Cousin let her know, they can't and won't do that... they've got significant others.  Not to mention morals.  Then MOVG comes over to me, and of course I said.... no.  I can't play that.  So then she says, "well just drop her off at your hotel, so she has to call him.  If he catches her out like that,  she's going to be in big trouble with him, and she'll get scared and leave him."  How messed up.  Possibly put your "beloved little girl" into harm's way just to make you happy?  We almost ran out of there!  Pimping out your daughter:  I'd say that has to take the cake. This was a topic that was brought up quite often while we were out west.  And no, not one bit of this is any kind of an evil lie.  It. is. sad. but. true. Even while we were talking with MOVG, I was thinking that this would make a great post.  And it was one of the things I kept seriously thinking about while riding around. Hope that's not too weird for ya.  I'm off to sleepyland.

      Being off work, relaxing, riding the bike through the mountains... it doesn't get much better than that! Most times riding, I reflect on my life, and things I do, things I could/should change, things I really don't care about. This being a long trip, I had plenty of time to realize a few things about myself.  While on vacation, I realized that:  1. Any time I doubt the existence of a greater power, I need to be cracked a good one.  Riding through the mountains of Colorado, hell, anywhere on this earth, you see so many changes in terrain, it's just incredible. The Rockies go from grass covered hills, to hot, sandy high desert. There and in between, beautiful. It gives me chills just remembering how it all looked. Scenery so awesome cannot just happen without some assistance.  2. There are some damn good people out there, to offset the strange ones.  My cousin and brother were the politicians of the trio. They can talk to anyone, and they about talked to  everyone . We met some really great people, and a couple of really strange ones. One guy started out normal, very friendly, making sure that everything was ok when we were stopped. Starts asking about different motorcycle "clubs", then tells us he was in one before he got sent to prison. Ok, not normal, but not  too  strange. Then he goes on this tirade about how we (white people) should be killing everyone not like "us." There's the strange!! While we were looking worriedly at him, he asks if we have a place to stay, 'cuz "I hate to see boys like me stuck outside sleepin'." Thankfully, the good far outweighed the weird!  3. I'm not just single because I can run fast ... I AM AN IDIOT!  I've never been good at reading women, especially when it comes to them being interested in me. If a woman's hitting on someone I'm with, I know what's going on, and if they can't see it, I'll tell them. But I can be such a moron. We were at  urlLink Dinosaur National Monument , at the quarry gift shop, and I picked up a couple of things for my nephews. The cashier was a pretty nice looking woman (actually,  hot  works better), maybe 30, and she gives me this big smile when I walk up. I tell her who I'm getting the items for, and we visit for a bit. After she tells me the total price, I start to hand her cash, stop, and ask,"Will you take credit cards?" She gives me this huge grin, and says, "I'll take almost anything you're willing to give me!" So I hand her my card. Thirty miles away, I realize what she said!! No wonder she looked suprised when I didn't say anything "clever" back! I'm sure that I will be hearing about that for a loooong time! All my brother could do was shake his head and laugh!  4. I have the potential to be a far greater a**hole than I ever dreamed possible!  Not that I'm proud of it, mind you. Maybe a bit. But anyway, the first couple of days, I was biting my tongue quite a bit. My brother, or most times my cousin, would have an idea of what we should do, and if I thought different and said so, it was usually 2-1, their favor. These weren't bad ideas; for instance, they wanted to stop and eat, I wanted to keep going knowing that a certain Harley dealer was only 50/60 minutes away. I had been there before, and knew exactly where it was at.  My brother had really wanted to stop at this place as it's a John Deere/Harley dealer.  urlLink Ernie Williams  in Algona, Iowa. Anyway, the vote was to eat, and it was damn good. However, we were there for well over an hour before we left for the Harley shop in  Mason City, IA . By the time we hit Algona, the shop had been closed for 40 minutes. I was a good little boy, and didn't say "See I told you," although I really wanted to. But I stayed cool and realized that....   5. I  need  to deal with people more often.  I know that what frustrates me, is that, due to the fact I've been on my own so long, I am used to doing things my way, and my way alone. And that's not always right. Most times yes, but not always. Once I caught myself doing that, I was able to relax and enjoy myself a lot better. (Especially because I  knew  that I was right! :) )  6. I really am a rock when it comes to taking a hint! Again, another story of ignorance. I'll keep this one short because it shames me. Drank many shots with a bartender at the bar we decided to frequent while staying out there. She hangs out visiting with my host and me for quite some time. She seemed a little bummed when I insisted that we better get going; had to leave for home in the morning. Payed my bill. As I go over my receipts the next morning, I realize, she was buying all the shots! I should have known that I was being a rock when my host just kept laughing all the way home! He even made a comment about how she seemed to like "you." I thought it was a collective "you" (the three of us) that he was talking about. Definitely not the smartest peanut in the turd am I.  7. I sit at the computer much too often.  Man, I was jonesing to get online the whole time we were gone! Ok, not the whole time, but every day when I got up, or was about to hit the hay (especially when a tad bit tipsy).  8. I really am starting to think of everyone that is in my blog family, and a few others, as family.  I'm not sure if that's a good thing or what. :) It's one of those things you start looking forward to when you get home. "I wonder what they have to say," or, "I wonder what comments were made to my post." It's kinda like sittin' down and visiting with friends. I will say, I missed being out of the loop for the week. " Aaaaaaawwww, him missed us!"  Yeah, there were a few other realizations, but they were just little things here and there. Hell, if I started in on all that rot, this post would be nine days long!!!

        Ok, I'm back, so the debauchery may come to an end.  Geez, you people.  The place is a wreck, what with all the chocolate, caramel, Redi-whip, and marshmallow fluff all over.  Mmmm mmm   mmmm  ....   Oh, anyway, I see you've found my "collections."(Judging from the way they are posed, I'd venture to guess that either  urlLink Harvey  or  urlLink Grau  is responsible.  Had to be Harvey.  Grau may cram limbs into orifices that previously didn't exist, but these limbs are still attached.)  Thank goodness you guys didn't find the "Care Bear" and "Tele-Tubbies" stash!  Doh!!!  Anyway, thanks for leaving me a beer.  Although, since it was under a chair, it may be safe to assume you didn't know you left me one! Another cool thing was all these bras left here!  I'm going to add them to my collection.  Ok, ok, I'll  start  a collection!  Was one of these  urlLink Sarahk's ?  (GrooOOwwlll)   Well, I'm out of time, so I'll tell you about the trip later.  A final question, and when I tell about the trip, you'll know why I ask:  What would you do to keep your grown child from marrying someone who  you  deem unfit?   BTW, I literally laughed out loud reading the comments!  Thanks!
