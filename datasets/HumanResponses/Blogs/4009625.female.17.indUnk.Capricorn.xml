      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Olympic Games will be hold in Greece in Aug 13th this year.I would be at school that time.However,I will pay more attention to this great game cause I love my nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I suppose that the total of the gold medal may not over 28.As a matter of fact, we are weak in some fields like track and field, swimming which has many items.There will be many gold medals.We are lacking in those good sportsman. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,in my opinion,we'll have much surprise from the new sport stars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck!  羽毛球队： 　　 领队：刘凤岩 　　 教练员：李永波、田秉毅、钟波、汤仙虎、唐学华、陈兴东、陆亨文 　　 翻译：包彤 　　运动员(18人)：张宁(女)、周蜜(女)、龚睿那(女)、高?(女)、黄穗(女)、杨维(女)、张洁雯(女)、魏轶力(女)、赵婷婷(女)、陈宏、林丹、鲍春来、蔡?、付海峰、桑洋、郑波、张军、陈其遒   Where's 龚智超？？？？？

      Well,I'm in the band named c'est la vie,and I'm the lead guitar player.  Three months ago I went to fashion front to buy DVDs.And I decided to buy two whose cover prints the electric guitars.So I bought the School of Rock and Freakey Friday.These two movies talks a lot about the rock band,which I am intersted in.  A 10-year boy call Zack in the School of Rock play this design of guitar--flying V     Shut up! It makes me crazy!To own it is my dream.But I&nbsp;can't&nbsp;found it anywhere in GZ,like Tom Lee and Venson.  Maybe I will buy it in HongKong after my doing well in the NMET.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I went to the neworiental school these days, I suddenly realized that English is really an inportant thing ,especially in China.I think my oral English is quite well, and I always look down upon the person who has a bad pronunciation.In fact, in northern China many people don't speak pure English.Take "CCTV"for example,they say "say say tea way " instead.How terrible they speak Enlish!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way ,I prefer American English to British English.  I went to the neworiental school for improving my grammar and learning some exam's skills.NMET comes to me as the days&nbsp;went by.And I believe I can deal with the English examination very well.I became mature in this summer vaction,I'm not longer a child.I am seventeen , going on eighteen.Practise makes perfect!
