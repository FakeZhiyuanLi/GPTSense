      I agree with everyone who hates this album. It is the worst album I've ever heard. This is hard for me to write because KISS is and always has been my favorite band of all time. I've always liked the Gene songs on KISS albums and loved his 1978 solo album. The album cover sucks- could he have found any uglier chicks? The song order sucks, there is no cohesive flow at all, Gene can't produce an album out of a paper bag. How many songwriters does it take to write a crappy Gene album? Answer: 17 plus Gene. There was a time when Gene didn't need any help writing songs, a long, long time ago. Gene is an ***hole for ruining the KISS legacy time and time again. I hate you Gene Simmons!

      WASP have cancelled another concert date - their third in under two weeks. Club Infinity in Buffalo, New York was the latest after previous dates in Montreal and Ottawa were also canned. The latest cancellation was attributed to Blackie Lawless suffering food poisoning.Ex-WASP drummer Frankie Banali commented on the recent cancellations to Guitar World magazine, who sent me this:Drummer Frankie Banali played drums on the new W.A.S.P. album The Neon God - Part 1 - The Rise, with the exception of the song Wishing Well, which Stet Howland appears on. Howland is the current touring drummer for W.A.S.P. While Banali is not on the road with the band, I contacted him, asking for his thoughts on the recent cancellations of shows in Montreal (Aug 8th because Blackie Lawless' mic was too big for the stage) and Ottawa (Aug 10th because the security barrier was deemed unfit to protect Lawless from rabid fans). When asked by melodicrock.com, Banali offered up the following:"I consider myself fortunate enough to have passed on participating in this tour. I don't know all sides of the story so it's difficult to have an opinion other than the fans deserve a higher measure of respect from any band and I hope they will be given an explanation that will satisfy all concerned. Having said that, it's really none of my business just an opinion based on what is being circulated at large."

      VAN HALEN'S BEST OF BOTH WORLDS COMPILATION. Yesterday I spoke of the sound errors within Van Halen's new Best Of Both Worlds compilation. The 2 most notable errors was the sudden halt of Finish What You Started and the inclusion of the short instrumental track Strung Out as part of the track Not Enough, both from the Balance album.Finish What You Started appears to be the original cut, just without the benefit of a fade out.Today I was able to speak with someone who shed a little light on the matter. As with just about anything Van Halen related, the individual declined to go on record officially, but it was a source at Warner Bros., the label responsible for the release and he was happy to talk about it.Funnily enough, it was the first time he had been made aware of the errors! He said that the band was personally responsible for the mastering of the compilation and had 100% control over the choice of tracks to be included and the sequencing of those tracks.It was originally the label's idea to have 1 disc dedicated to the David Lee Roth years and another to the Sammy Hagar years, with the new tracks included on that disc. It was also the band's decision to include the already released live tracks from Live: Right Here, Right Now.All decisions were made by the band and the product delivered to the label was the band's final say.

      I had this album in the late 80's and played the crap out of side one. Pretty Maids- Future World sounded like Accept with keyboards and hairspray. In 1994, I sent my turntable to the dump and boxed up my 300 plus lp's and put them in storage. I had almost forgotten about the album until I found this reissue at Silver Platters yesterday. The only song title that rang a bell was the title track, but I still couldn't remember what it sounded like. I threw it in the car stereo, turned it up to 11 and didn't miss a beat from start to finish. A decade later, I knew the songs like I had heard them last week. Great album! I was surprised to see it was produced by Eddie Kramer (not his cup of tea) and mixed by Fleming Rasmussen. Do yourself a favor, sell your alterna-crap CD's to the used CD store on the corner and buy Future World; you might learn something about musicianship and songwriting.
