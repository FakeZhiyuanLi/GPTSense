      I am really disappointed today, i thought i will have a happy day today, oh well, guess that's my luck. Today after school, i waited for yuk cos she said she has remedial until 6, but at the end, she couldn't find Mrs Neo, so we left school at 5 30. Jian yong, yuk and me walk tampines mall as i suggest going for window shopping and ask them company me. At some point of time, yuk suddenly have a strong interest in talking to jian yong about some stuff, i tried to join in but failed. Then we walked into tis jigsaw puzzle shop, i wanted to show yuk some of the nice pictures i saw last saturday. I found one particular puzzle with a panda and find it interesting, so i showed it to yuk. She was still so indulged in the conversation that she din even notice it. I keep asking her whether she find it nice, she didn't even reply. I tried to understand, it has been long since she talk to jian yong, so i let them chat. Once in a while, i showed them some nice puzzle and ask for their opinion so that none of us will be left out. The problem came after we left the puzzle shop. They were talking about the century square cinema, and how some of the couples act in the theatre. I wasn't welcome into the conversation for some reason. I felt so bored so i decided to walk to cinema to see what movies were avialable. I swear i walked really slowly, i was strolling. But you know what? It took them days to reach to where i am. I was so bored and irritated. I mean, you asked them along and try to have conversation together, yet you are being left out and treated as if you do not exist. What is even worse is when we walk past san bookstore. Ok, i was walking alone all the way from the cinema. I don't feel their presence at all. They stopped me, and said that they want to go into the bookstore, after i had walked a great distance away. And so i followed. I went in, and feel tired so i walked out to take fresh air. I don't think anyone notice me and i don't expect anyone to. I mean after being treated like non-existence for so long, would you expect anyone to notice you? After standing outside like for years, yuk suddenly remembered me. I was damn pissed off that i can't bring myself to open my mouth. Anyway, all she care is Jian yong is still in the bookstore and she should not neglect him. She went to check out on him and she couldn't see him. So i went in to check. I really regret going in. Seriously. Why? She suddenly feel rooted to where Jian yong was. I walked out of the bookstore, again unnotice. I felt like an extra. Any human being who can feel will feel that way, who don't agree? I strolled into Yamaha to check out guitars. After like 15 mins, then they walked out, still talking.   Frankly, which stead will treat own bf/gf like that? When she is with her friend, i will be left out. Now she is with MY friend, i am also being neglected. I sacrifice my time with my friends to company her, but what about her? In her circle of friends, i am below her friends. If she rejected her friends to go out with me, she will feel that she has done a favour. But i have done this a countless times, without even complaining. I really don't know how to react. Even time she neglect me, i will feel upset. I cannot tell her that, she will feel that i am possessive and over-sensitive. I fabricated countless excuses for her. I can't always blame myself for being too-sensitive, cos that i know is just an excuse for me. If you say i am jealous, yes i admit. Don't talk about stead first. When you are with you group of friends, and they for some reason keep excluding you from the conversation, will you feel upset and jealous? I seldom talk to girls, not because i can't, i can if i want to. Is because, i keep reminding myself that i have to be faithful to yuk. But she always talk to guys in front of me. I am always understanding, i should not be so unreasonable as to stop her from talking. But what i ask for is for her to at least show me some respect, let me feel that i am not transparent.

      Yesterday was a very busy day for me. The long awaited day had finally arrived! It's our Student Council Investiture!!! After working so hard for days, staying up in school till very late, skip lectures and tutorials, this very day final came. Basically everything went on smoothly. I was very excited yesterday. I trying very hard to make myself calm down during the walk in. These things don't usually happen you see, so i felt excited la.   After the investiture, it was time for us to clean up. It's damn exhuastive man! Can you imagine clearing 1300+ chairs and about 40 pots??? Havent include clearing of decors and all that stuffs. After that at about 1 plus, jian yong and i went to my house. I played my xbox all the way till 3 plus and went back to school for student council meeting.   Evening, yuk and i went for the cultural night. Yuk was late for half an hour(we were supposed to an hour earlier but she postponed). I was quite unhappy. Cos i didn't sleep well the previous night, been scratching myself trying to relieve the itch throughtout the night. Some more i have to reach school at 6 30. Actually i expected alot of peole to forget my birthday(ya, in case you don't know, it's my birthday!), and indeed, nobody knows about my birthday in school without being told. Of cos there are some people who are very nice la, like kenneth(he sms me 3 times at around 11pm to 12am, to greet me happy birthday), then Jiayi sms me at 2am, and Ms Tiew at 4 plus am. I thought yuk ching forgot about my birthday, cos she didn't greet me happy birthday that morning when she see me. Okay come back to the evening part. She was late, and i was unhappy la... then she suddenly took out a present. I was surprised. Can you imagine, after one whole day of tireness, sadness, anger, itchness, hunger, one kind soul remembered my birthday and gave me something!!! It's like finding water at last in a vast desert. I was elated! She gave me something which she sew it herself, that's so nice of her! Nothing is as good as her present.    urlLink    Yuk and I after investiture

When i reach Yio Chu Kang, it's already 11 30!!! I missed the last bus! Want to know what's the worst? I dun have money for cab, neither do yuk. So i ended going to her house.

      I got back my last paper, chinese, result today. Guess what? I score 79 out of 170 for paper 2! Hahaha! Isn't it high? But after adding my listening and oral exam, i got 100 out of 200 marks! Laughing out loud! I passed! Horay! I passed my chinese common test! I don't know why Tan cb not happy for me... weird. Anyway, i just found out that for AO subject, 45-49 is C6. That means that i don't have D! Haha... This is my final results:  Subject       Grade Mathematics C: C Physics:     : C Biology:     : C Chemistry    : E Chinese      : C5 General Paper: C6  Yuk has been sick for 3 days now... I think it's because of stress that makes her immune system go haywire. I hope that her fever will be gone soon. Don't you think that her absence makes us feel that something was missing? Maybe not for you but it is for me. Furthermore, this is examination period, i am worried that her fever will affect her performance in the chinese exams.   Yuk, hope you get well soon! I miss you!

      Today is not a day for me... I got back my physics paper at the second period of the school. Guess what? I did real badly for it. It's the worst result i have ever seen for my physics paper. After recess, i have chemistry tutorial. This time, the shock is even greater than i ever imagine, i flunk my chemistry!!! Ok, and u know what? That's the worst result i have ever seen in all my papers!  At 2pm, we assembled at the hall for our chinese oral examination. I was damn tired and nervous. When it was my time at around 3 20, i was really damn sleepy. I ended up screwing my whole oral exam. The passage given was so hard that there are at least 4 words which i can't pronounce! Furthermore i stumble over the passage. Guess what's the worst? I can't even comprehend what i am saying during the conversation part.  Of cos there's a thin silver lining in the cloudy sky. You know what is it? I don't have to see my chinese result until next week!!! I am so damn glad to hear that man!At least i can sleep tonight, unpeacefully though.  If you people are wondering how much i got for physics and chemistry paper, all i can say is i did very badly. Take it as if i have never taken common tests. :)    Anyway, other than all these, i have a great day.

      Today's a boring day for me... I woke up at 11 am and slack my way till 1 before i start doing my project work evaluations. I finish everything by 3 pm and called Yuk! But i don't think she wanna talk to me because she can't go out with me today. But i really don't understand, i mean, i can always finish everything in the morning then can still go out with her. But she refused. She don't want to waste her time in my house. But i can understad, i can't expect everyone to be as stupid as me right? Last night before hanging up the phone, she said she will sms me in the morning to tell me if her mum allows her to go out, and so i waited.   But till 3pm today, there is still no sign of her sms. So i called her house to see what she is doing. We didn't talk much, i can understand why as her mum is around. She asked me to talk in msn instead. But guess what? She put herself as away and do other stuffs. ok, so i guess she doesn't want to talk to me. I can't talk to people when they are doing other stuff, they tend to take a long time to reply, so i ended up staring at screen(like an idiot). I waited for quite some time before i decided to play games(I wanna distract myself, i felt irritated).  After playing for 3 hours, i decided to stop. Guess what i saw in her conversation? She said she purposely come online to talk to me and now i busy playing games! Ya! I purposely play games! That really brighten up my day! Do you know how annoyed i am? I can't sms her as her phone is being sent for repair(for 1 term). I can't even lend her my spare handphone! Furthermore, i don't even dare to call her, everytime i call her, she sound as if she don't wanna talk, unless she wants to call me.  Today was a very pleasant youth day for me. I hope you enjoy yours too. By the way, my sister just bought her first pair of spectacles... Haiz.. she played too much computer games. But anyway, she looks pretty in it.

      Today was quite a packed day for me(as usual). I woke up at 11 30 in the morning(actually wanted to sleep longer) to wash up as my project work members are coming to my house for project work meeting. Guess what we meet about? Some lamers told us that we need to hand in the written report draft by this week! We did not know how to go about doing it as we don't know the layout. So, we called Ms azian(or Mdm Azian if you like it). She told us that all she need is our evaluation pieces as we will be having the written report lecture later on!!! Instead of calling the meeting off, we carry on to make our rough draft. After my project work meeting, i headed for my 4A(2003) class gathering at Orchard road.   urlLink    Yummy yummy.. food!!!  There are only 20 people( Some lamers last minute say cannot come), wonder why is it still call class gathering. Anyway, instead of eating at the Seol garden, we ended at Swensen(10 times better off than seol garden).    urlLink        Oh man... Loser need to drink a sip of 'orange juice'! Ingredients: Water, chilly sauce, tomato sauce, pepper, salt... and maybe a little bit of... saliva?   urlLink       Yuck!!! Gerard got to drink it, no choice... haha!   It was actually quite a boring gathering as there's nothing for us to talk about. But i would not consider it as a wasted trip, at least i can still keep in touch with them.

       urlLink     This is the city first city i have ever created in Simcity4. Instead of studying for common test, i spend quite some time on it. Cool huh? But too bad this city is obliterated from the map due to file corruption. Sad... i am currently working on my New york city. It will sure be a very nice piece of work! I shall post it once it is ready.

      Hi to whoever is looking at my blog now... I do not encourage anybody from reading whatever i have posted here. Reason is very simple: Why do you want to read about me?! Too free is it? I post whatever here for me and only me to read. If you are really such a nuisance and insist on reading, fine. There's nothing i can do. Fingers are yours, eyes are yours, brain is yours... Go ahead and do whatever you like! Hopefully you have mental crush after reading...   In case you are wondering why i am writing here, or why am i even starting this blogger thingy. I don't really know too. I am just curious about writing online journal, and how it would affect me in any way, or should i say even affect me at all. I don't like to write in a diary book, i think it's not safe as someone might steal it( don't ask me why, some people steal things for the kick of it, Mental). The other reason is my hand writing is too illegible that i don't think an idiot can even imagine a word out of it. But i do admit one thing: It's better to write in a diary, it has more value( and also keep kay pos away).   Life is short... lives are long...*dreaming...* Ehem! Eh..huh?! Oh oh.. i am writeing a blogger now.. Pai sei pai sei... As i was saying, life is short(Not lives are long). How long do you think one person can live up to? 70s? 80s? 90s? Scientists claim that humans, yes us, cannot live pass 120 years of age. Why? How i know? I forgot to ask them. Curse? nah... no such thing. Lifestyle? Maybe... Humans like to eat junks... Humans' favorite activity is stressing themseleves up by working hard all day all night(hehe...)... Or humans just prefer to die before 120 years old?( Unbelievable but true). Whatever it is, life is short... (sidetrack again... forgot what i wanted to say...) Oh... life is short, try to think about it, how many meaningful things have you did in your past years from the day you enter this pretty world? Anything worth remembering? Any great achievement?(except screwing teachers up) Most of you will say not really much... and i know that's a lie. The truth is, NO! Some of you might have...   There are many things for you to achieve, but not many people grab the opportunities. Why? Many people think that it's no use tiring yourself up just to achieve something. They see opportunities as swayness. But try to think about it, what is the purpose of life? Or should i put it this way, what is the purpose of YOUR life? Is it to step foot on this world and relax... slacking day and night(night?)... eat sleep play... come to this world with nothing, and leave the world with nothing but laziness. If you could see it the other way, instead of waiting for opportunities, look for it. When you have it, treasure it and make full use of it. Give in your best and you will have one more thing to add in your achivement list. Isn't your life more colourful this way? ( If you say no, close this window. If you continue reading, that means you agree with me)  In this lifetime, it is inevitable that we face alot of troubles and problems... we have to make many important decisions and i admit it's very tiring. Stress, the word which seems harmless, but with meaning so powerful that it kill every soul that could not suppress it. One of the reason why i am writing is to release some stress i am facing... It's better to express out in the form of writing, verbally but not physically, than to keep everything to yourself inside your heart. It might explode(literally, ever heard of heart attack?) one day. So, whenever i have problem(which is alot?), i will try to type it out(hopefully i can). Some times i may also type some rubbish when i feel bored or what so ever.   Please don't stay tune and don't keep up to the latest updates( told you i am not writing for anyone to read except me).

      Hi! I am back! Didn't have chance to update my blog recently. I have been busy with preparation for nation day concert. The price has been paid off! The NDP concert last friday was a great success! Consider this is the first time our 19th council organise a major event, some more totally orignial. Oh ya, we are preparing for teachers' day concert already, it will be a memorable one! Let me show you some of the concert pic:   urlLink    Me before going to school...   urlLink    A progressive Society   urlLink    MCS performance...  After the concert, Yuk! and I, together with ken went to watch The Village. The show was quite a twist in the end... I doubt alot of people will appreaciate the show deducing from the responses which the audience gave after the show end. Anyway, after the movie, yuk went to my house to have a second movie, A Beautiful Mind. It is one of my favourtie movies. I have been looking for chance to let her watch, finally managed to.   Overall, it was a very pleasant day for me. My first concert for tpjc, and it went on better than i have expected. Some more, after a week of hard work, i can finally go out with yuk!
