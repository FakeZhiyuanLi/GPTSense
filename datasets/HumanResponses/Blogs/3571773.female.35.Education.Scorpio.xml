      In 2003 - the Central Australian Remote Health Development Services was involved in the New Practice -  urlLink Online Learning for Healthy Communities  project.  The project looked at flexible learning practices in remote Aboriginal Primary Health Care Services; practices such as web and email, interactive multimedia, music and theatre, were used in order to address issues related to:  • remote areas  • Aboriginal communities  • language and literacy      Establishment and Implementation Guide    urlLink Building sustainable practice: engaging remote Aboriginal communities    urlLink    Dorothy Lucardie, Stephanie Mouthaan and Tanya Wooley at the Netw*rking 2003 Conference - Online Learning for Health Communities presentation   Posted by  urlLink Hello

      As part of my Flexible Learning Leaders - Professional Development Plan, I have nominated to participate in the Learnscope 2004 project  urlLink "Working Both Ways"  online forum.  The aim of the project is to connect practitioners in Aboriginal Education around the country to share ideas and learn from each other’s good practice.   This project is about “extending networks through collaboration” and guest speakers will discuss learning solutions clarifying issues and gathering ideas that work for Indigenous people. The aim is to invite the sharing of good methodology to contribute and assist Australia’s Indigenous Community in the transition to the information economy.  I am looking forward to expanding my network of like minded practictioners to share good practice, flexible and culturally appropriate methods for use in Indigenous communities.  I'll keep you posted with my findings.........

      Apparently blogs have been on the Web for years, but since I operate on "Territory time" it is not unusual that this technological information has not filtered my way to Alice Springs - until now.......  Blogs can take a multitude of forms, but are mostly personal or project-related websites that users update regularly with anecdotes of their activities, things that interest them and often with links to sites and the latest news.  I intend to use this form of public communication to express my Flexible Learning Leaders "journey".    At this stage I don't have any web server space to load any digital images so my site will be mainly text based. Oh no!  But - I will explore my ISP account to see if I can access this facility.  I hope you enjoy and value the information contained within this site and any feedback would be appreciated.  Many Thanks - Tanya

       MY ORGANISATION  The  urlLink Central Australian Remote Health Development Service  has been established to develop the capacity of Aboriginal people and health professionals to improve community health outcomes.  CARHDS is a unique service as it is directly controlled by and accountable to the Primary Health Care industry to meet the in service training needs as determined by the employer.    ABORIGINAL HEALTH IN THE TERRITORY   urlLink AMSANT - Aboriginal Medical Service Alliance (NT)  Provides an overview of statistics about Aboriginal illness and illness patterns.    SUPERHERO MESSAGE   urlLink  CUZ CONGRESS    The "superhero" role of Cuz Congress is intended to bring an entertaining and healthy lifestyle message.  Designed to educate people through entertainment seems to be what's really effective rather than going through the drill of 'now make sure you do this and don't do this'  Includes links to a range of primary health care (PHC)services and has heaps of information about different PHC issues and and links to websites that may have more information.

      Hi All!  I'm Tanya Wooley - the Office Manager for the  urlLink Central Australian Remote Health Development Services  (CARHDS) in Alice Springs.  We are an Aboriginal organisation that provides in-service education to Aboriginal Health Workers and management in remote Central Australian communities.  I have just been offered a late inclusion into the 2004 Flexible Learning Leaders program!   My aim is to  promote and initiate change, share knowledge and develop networks  which provide  flexibility and innovative approaches  to learning with the emphasis on ICT and remote delivery to Indigenous participants.  I am particularly interested to increase my understanding of  appropriate methods of education for remote Indigenous communities  and to explore  the role of the Chief Information Officer  in order to  facilitate effective Knowledge Management  systems.    urlLink    Some of the "flexible" CARHDS team members  Posted by  urlLink Hello    urlLink    Tanya Wooley - FLL 2004  Posted by  urlLink Hello

      As a late inclusion into the FLL program, I travelled to Canberra for an Induction to the program with the project team.  Many thanks to Marie, Jenny, Jyothi, Thea and Cathy for making me feel welcome and for a thorough induction to the program.  I had the opportunity to have dinner with previous FLL - Wanda Jackson and lunches with current leaders - Kerry Trabinger, Emma Deutrom and Ellie Thompson.  This was a perfect environment to "swap notes", network and to get a general understanding of what other leaders had planned for their year.   WORKPLACE VISITS   Utilising my time efectively whilst in Canberra, I took the opportunity to arrange orientations of workplaces applicable to my program focus of  Remote & Indigenous .   The following faculties, organsiations and services were visiting to exchange knowledge and to gain an overview of their current methods of delivery:  ***   Canberra Institute of Technology - Faculty of Business & IT - James Hamilton  James gave me an orientation of the Electronic Business Simulator prototype.   No!  It's NOT a Toolbox! Earlier this year, I was involved in an NT trial of this flexible method of delivery which supports the certificate/s - CertII Business, and CertII Information Technology.    Quite a high level of tecnical experience is required to "tailor" the simulator to your own participants needs.  Still in the "tweaking stage" the simulator is very text based........Not a prefered method of my client base.  ***   Canberra Institute of Technology -  urlLink Australian Network of Practice Firms  - Kath Billing  A practice firm is a  simulated business  that is set up and run by students as part of their study program with support from an educator and staff from a real business. Practice firms conduct business with other practice firms in a simulated market economy on a local, national or international basis.  Participation in a practice firm gives students real business insights and an awareness of business sensitivities. They develop skills in decision making, problem solving and in working with clients towards a positive outcome. Students learn to work effectively in a team and prioritise their work; they learn about accountability and daily work routines.  A practice firm often resembles the business on which it models itself, for example in its form, organisation and functions. As employees of the practice firm, students undertake market research, advertise, buy and sell goods; they work out their pay rates and receive a virtual salary to spend in ANPF.  Although there is no actual transfer of goods or money, all the usual business transactions take place: orders are sent, invoices issued, financial records maintained, and a business plan and marketing strategy developed and monitored.  Students learn about business, but they also learn how business really works and how decisions are made. They test their skills in IT, customer relations, interpersonal relationships, negotiation, and time management.  Apparently students become highly motivated and engaged. This is "their" business! Hence the energy and enthusiasm is totally different to the standard classroom operation.  I was made aware that  urlLink Tauondi College  operates a Practice Firm in Adelaide - "Virtual First Aid" who I plan to visit in when in Adelaide in July. I would be very interested to see this simulated/virtual training methodology in practice within an Indigenous context.  ***   urlLink Winnunga Nummityjah   An Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service that provides a culturally safe holistic health service for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of the ACT and surrounding areas.  I had an opportunity to meet with Sharon Ingram who orientated me to her organisation.  We discused flexible modes of delivery and the underlying health issues that are affecting the Indigenous people of the ACT.

      Hi All!  I have mastered the art of blog creation! To those who are interested - it is quite simple to niche your own part of cyberspace.  I will document HOW I managed to create mine.....   urlLink Blogspot  is just one (of many) site that provide FREE services to have a "voice" on the Web.  Just register to create an account, choose a template and off you go!  You don't have to make all your postings "public" straight away.  You have the option to save as drafts, add, amend and publish when happy with the content.  If you want to be able to post images to your blog you have to download additional software - Hello - which you use through your Windows Explorer.   This program is also FREE! Don't get confused and purchase the Picasa as it is not required.  It took a bit of fiddling around to trick the program into inserting jpegs into the correct location but I finally mastered the technique.   urlLink    www.blogspot.com  Posted by  urlLink Hello    I still have to work out how to extend the margins to look balanced and not all squished in the centre (secret source code business!)  I'll get an IT guru to look at the goobbledook and find out HOW to do this!   (I have since spoken with an IT friend and rectified this problem).....   In essence, this form of weblogging (with the post comments option) could address the issue of maintaining "corporate knowledge" or as a record of the Communities of Prctice models.  What do you think?

      I am investigating the new software online communication tool - Skype.  Skype is free and simple software that will enable you to make free calls anywhere in the world.   Skype uses P2P (peer-to-peer) technology to connect you to other users - not to share files this time, but to talk with your peers.  You can talk to up to 5 contacts at a time.    How do you think Telstra and Optus will respond to this?  Have a look at the download site -  urlLink www.skype.com   Anyone interested in trialling its use with CARHDS?  Please let me now.  I successfully held a 3 way conference easily and effectively using the program within our offices on recently.   Skype gets the thumbs up in Central Australia!!     We would be able to exchange documents via email, surf the Web and chat simultaneously!  Talk about multi-skilled!  In relation to our client group - remote Indigenous participants - this tool could be an appropriate communication method.  It doesn't rely on Literacy levels where people feel "shame" to type into forums where their poor literacy is there for all to see.  AND  - people would be able to speak in their own language!   IT skills are still a basic requirement but I was impressed that as an alternative to the text version - a visual step by step installation guide is provided on the Net. I needed to tweak my microphone settings before the audio was loud and clear.  Motivation. If a sound rapport is established prior to implementation and clients are well orientated to the technology - I am confident they would see the benefits of using this program.  I have suggested to my Flexible learning Leaders Special Interest Group - Remote and Rural - to utilise this communication tool.

      CARHDS ran an in-service Professional Development session to educators.  Those who attended will KNOW what: BTEOTTSTPWBAT - means!  We all need to rethink and reapply the RAMP 2 FAME and "Hit by a Bus" techniques.    * Primacy and Recency  Delivering information in small, manageable chunks  * Suitability and Relevance It is important to let the learner know how the new information fits with their existing knowledge so that they understand why the new skill or concept is being discussed.   * Motivation and Support Ensure the participant 1. Wants to learn 2. Is ready to learn and 3. Has a reason to learn  * Two Way Communication  Interaction between the educator and the participant.   * Feedback and Reinforcement  Provide information about the learning experience  * Active Learning Allowing the participant to perform the task while observing   * Multi-sense Learning Participant take in most information through sight, however a learning is more effective when the learner uses more than one of their five senses. Try feel, smell, audio.

      Little Fish was started in Alice Springs in 1994. The company was formed with the key purpose of commercialising financial management and presentation techniques.   I am liaising with  urlLink Little Fish  (formerly Pangaea) about a financial management CD ROM "Bridging Two Worlds" which they have developed for use in remote Aboriginal communities.    Little Fish is being recognized nationally as leaders in the business community, and also as leaders in cross-cultural communication techniques.  Apparently visually graphic and user-friendly - I look forward to evaluating the appropriateness for our client group.

      For the first time I experienced an asynchronous online conference.  What is an asynchronous discussion?  This is where participants contribute to a conversation over a period of time, ie not at the same time.  For example web forums and message boards as opposed to synchronous where participants contribute to a conversation "live", - like chat programs and email.  I found the whole experience VERY text based.  You were required to read huge amounts of text documents and then respond to questions posed against these papers.  The conference was to provide current thinking, practice and discussion in:  *         Knowledge Management  *         Information Literacy  *         Information and Communication Technology  *         Evidence-based Practice  I would be happy to distribute the summary of my experienceif anyone is interested. just post a comment to this board and I will email to you.

      Kate Lawrence - Waltja Tjutangku Palyapayi Aboriginal Corporation hosted a workplace orientation.   We spent the morning discussing appropriate methods for Indigenous participants.    They are integrating the PDL program (MASH, Lets Dance and Crazy Talk) into their methodology.   It is a great and fun way to pass on information especially in remote communities and break down the barriers such as language and culture. It can teach awareness, promote ideas and stories, keep culture strong and can be easily updated when needed.   It is a tool that can bring two different cultures together for the benefit of each other.  They have commissioned the development of a culturally appropriate "avatar" - Waltja Woman - to reinforce improving outcomes for families.  Other "flexible" strategies are used:    Flip Charts, video/DVD, brainstorming, graphical representations, appropriate & relevant scenarios and the good old - one 2 one (f2f) techniques.

       Learnscope Participation   I have been participating in the Learnscope project -  urlLink Working Both Ways  - online forum.   The aim of the project is to connect practitioners in Aboriginal Education around the country to share ideas and learn from each other's good practice.  Register and have a look at the forum!   New Practices Projects   I met with Grahame Sawyer - New Practices - Overcoming the Digital Divide project.   This project will build a set of flexible delivery techniques suitable for students in a remote indigenous community with a training centre. This will support the identified community needs for training in relation to real employment outcomes in the community and develop the ability to deliver an appropriate blend of training including face-to-face, online technology and other standalone elements.    A financial management program has been developed for the Titjikala community and is being hailed as a success.    I have a copy of the Community Financial Management System CD ROM which I will look at in the next few weeks to evaluate its pro/cons from my own perspective.  Grahame was interested to share information regarding his current project and CARHDS's 2003 "Online Learning for Health Communities" project.

      ALA Student Placement  I have been in some thought provoking conversations with Karen Blake - University of Canberra.    Karen has a student placement sponsored by Adult Learning Australia at CARHDS to map the Adult Community Education (ACE) provision in Central Australia.    ACE is a response to the lifelong learning needs of the community and looks as thought our region seriously lacks any provision of these services.   I particularly liked the idea/s of "Tool Buckets" when comparing the ANTA series of Toolboxes.   The collation information and resources in one "bucket" rather than a "box".  A Bucket can be tipped, poured, inverted (turned over), bits taken out and put back again - it has an open top and is accessible.     A Box is rigid and enclosed and difficult to get into or change its shape.  In relation to ICT being integrated into teaching practices - "is it the participant who is incompetent or is it the tool for learning that is inappropriate?" Idealists will insist that obvious, simple, problems should be just fixed, rather than wasting time looking for the cause.  Why should there be a division between Indigenous and non-Indigenous learning?

      Has anyone had experience with Amps?  Amplify is a free toolbar that gives you the power to find, collect, save and share content (including pictures, text, video, animation, and audio) from multiple online sources in personalized pages called Amps.  At this time, only PC-users are able to create their own Amps BUT anyone and everyone with Internet access can view an Amp using either a PC or a Mac.  As a research tool: Amplify could enhance online research by enabling users to save and share information from multiple online sources. Everything you add to an Amp automatically includes a link back to its original online source so that you or anyone you share your Amp with can easily learn more.   Click  urlLink HERE  for a demonstration of the software.  Also an article from  urlLink The Age 17/7/04   I am interested in using this program to collate and share information with my colleagues.

      POSTCARD Located at:  http://learnscope.flexiblelearning.net.au/LearnScope/postcards.asp?id=6010  The Flexible learning Leaders program is all about TIME!   Time to investigate ideas, swap notes, share information and read...   I have had the opportunity to meet with an array of interesting, innovative people who are delivering quality education which incorporates flexible methodology.  My recent visit to Tauondi College and the Australian Computers in Education Conference in Adelaide stands out as a highlight.  Tauondi College has been successful in its vision to provide a rich learning environment which encompasses “both worlds”.  From both an Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspective a “common ground” is found where both the educator and learner feel comfortable to teach and study.  The Australian Computers in Education Conference theme was “Research,… Reform,.. Realise the Potential!” It focused on: research about education and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) use; the change processes that result from ICT applications and access and the opportunities that are provided to students, teachers and organisations by current and emerging technologies.  In particular, Key Note and Invited Speakers Dale Spender, Simon Hackett and Barb Jenkins provided sessions which both challenged and provided inspiration to enable use of learning technologies within a multi-literacy framework.  Multimedia  I am taking the time to look at various multimedia applications and resources.    Text and hypertext  Images  Audio  Video  Combined media  Animation  Interactivity  PowerPoint/MovieMaker  Media on the web (Web Delivery)  Media on CD ROMs  Online discussion forums These applications could provide unlimited functions for developing culturally appropriate educational materials.  Motivation is the key to engaging our learners. When people are having fun, they won't realise how much they're learning.  When thinking about how people remember and digest information:  10% we read  20% we hear  30% we see  50% we see & hear  80% we say  90% we say and do As educators we need to think about the effectiveness of our delivery and provide real learning outcomes if developing resources via these methods.  Blogging  I have created a BLOG!  What is a Blog?  A weB LOG.  Blogs have been around on the Web for years, but have only become popular in the past two years or so.   They take a multitude of forms, but most are personal or project-related websites that users update regularly, with tales of their doings, or commentary on things that interest them, often with hypertext links to relevant sites and the latest news.    My Blog is my little "niche" in cyberspace and is located at: http://remoteindigenous.blogspot.com/  My intention is to use this forum as a model of a Community of Practice to communicate, produce information and feedback on the issues surrounding delivery to remote Indigenous communities.  Skype  Software that facilitates telephone conversation across the Internet.  6 million users have downloaded this peer to peer audio software.  Once downloaded we can make "free" (after paying for an internet connection) phone calls to each other when they're online, using headsets plugged into their computers.  A huge communication potential to remote areas!  Overview  I intend to pass off my learning experience to my peers and colleagues to make the learning experience of our participant's valuable, stimulating and most importantly to enhance their life long leaning to improve their community outcomes!  30BC Lao-Tzu said: "If you tell me I will listen. If you show me I will see. If you let me experience, I will learn."

      Seriously - once I downloaded the program and had a quick peruse of the "how  to" documents - I was away!   Basic IT skills underpin use of this technology but the simple collation of  online resources I submitted as a test took - at the most - 1/2 hour.    I wanted to incorporate all the features available (text, audio, video) but had  to run to a meeting and ran out of time locating an appropriate video component.  I wish I knew about this software years ago!   My favourite bookmarks are overloaded with links to special interest sites  which I have to wade throught to find the specific information I want to  retreive.  With Amps I can collate information into the 1 x location - name and file  accordingly and simply access at the touch of a button.  If I choose to share the online resources I have collated and saved it is not a  requirement that the recipient has the Amp program installed on their PC.  In my industry - Indigenous health education - and as part of my FLL - looking  at the role of "Chief Information Officer" - I feel this application has the  potential to be utilised effectively to assemble specialised information to  share with colleagues to develop into participant learning materials.    Amp also addresses the important aspect of Copyright as the original hyperlink  is visable giving recognition to the source initial source.  I would love to assemble an Amp on culturally appropriate - relevant online  game sites!    If anyone has any great links - please send them to me at:   office@carhds.nt.edu.au  Regards and Happy Amp-ing - Tanya
