      Walking home today I was in a foul mood.  I think it was fitting that it was pissing rain, it only furthered my mood downward.  Made me think about a string of thoughts I often have, however, normally, they are in my head separated by a lot of time.  This time however, I strung them together.  Basically these thoughts are simply a string of "If's" and "Maybe's" about my life.  These thoughts may seem petty to people who aren't me, but to me they are very prevalent these days.  I often find myself looking at other people, and wanting to be able to be them, even if for just one day.  It seems that all my life I've looked around, and seen people who are better off than me.  When I was little, I thought that this was a kind of "red badge of honour."  Being poor was kind of "cool" in a distorted way.  The novelty has worn off.  Waiting for the bus today (god I hate taking the damned bus), I was looking at all the people driving by in their cars.  These people don't realize how lucky they are.  I've never known the freedom of just grabbing keys and heading out.  When I want to go somewhere I need to plan it out all the way.  I always think about a conversation I had with one of Kyle's buddies about having a car (he had one).  He was telling me how hard it is to have a car, and what a pain it was, etc.  I asked him when he went to do groceries how long it took.  20 mins.  I then explained how when I want to go do groceries, I need to make it a 2 hour trip.  30 mins to the store, 30 mins back, and about 45 mins or so in the store.  Also, if it decides to start pissing rain, or snow, I gotta keep on walking.  It seems petty at times to whine like this, but dammit, I'm sick and tired of looking around seeing this type of stuff.  Coming home on the bus today, I kept thinking about the lyrics to a few Eminem songs that I rather like.  One is called "Rock Bottom" (lyrics can be seen here http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/rockbottom.html).  He really sums up a lot of how I feel lately.  The chorus  goes thusly:   That's Rock Bottom When this life makes you mad enough to kill That's Rock Bottom When you want something bad enough you'll steal That's Rock Bottom When you feel you have had it up to here Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear     The other song that I have been singing in my head is a song called "If I Had..."  The opening line is (full lyrics here http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/ifihad.html)   What is life? Life is like a big obstacle put in front of your optical to slow you down And everytime you think you gotten past it it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground   I don't often think of things in such a negative light, but it's hard not to lately.  I probably shouldn't always be harping about these things, but as I said, it's hard.  I don't have many prospects on the horizon, people asking me "So, what are your plans?  What have you been doing?"  I just have to say, "I don't know.  Just been keeping myself busy."  I want to scream, "Nothing!  I haven't seen a paycheck in 7 months.  I feel like a loser all the time, am having trouble sleeping, and have no clue what I want to do."  Things would have made so much more sense if that bastard principal at Chippewa hadn't screwed me the way he did.  If I had to trace the source of my current unfortunate situation it would begin there (actually, it was the horrible treatment I got by Nip U over my placements).  How am I not supposed to be cynical when I have had shit like that tossed at me?  What type of job am I supposed to go do with a teaching degree and an honours history degree?    If I could take it back, the past 5 years, would I?  In a second.  I wouldn't have doubted my choice to school for computers, and wouldn't have filled my resume with the crap it has on it.  I used to look at those letters, B. A. and B. Ed. with joy and pride.  Now they feel like two large locks hanging from my neck, pinning me to the ground.  I try to lift my head and look up, but these letters pin me down.  Oh well.  Enough negative stuff for now.  Things aren't all bad.  I got my ma, and Julie.  Dyl is starting to get his shit together (and damn am I jealous).  Shit with us is getting better too.  I have my little things (video games, comics, music, and books) and need to start looking ahead.  I'm just hoping that I hear back from the other Japanese schools I applied for soon.  Other than that I don't know what I'm going to do.  Until next time.

      Well, another night passes, however, it passes slowly and quite fitfully.  I know why I'm not sleeping properly, but I dare not mention it aloud.  It's quite frustrating.  I did all that I was supposed to.  I stayed in school, got good marks, did the volunteer thing, went to university, got a degree, went back, got a second degree.  There.  The goals of society have been met, and where do I find myself?  Looking back at unemployment since November.  It's not supposed to be like this.  I guess I can find some sick comfort in the fact that I'm not alone.  Jeff is having the exact same problems as me, however, he has been able to work in the meantime.  I just plod through each day, wondering if I'm going to get to work.  I've applied for a few more Japanese jobs, but the NOVA experience has really taken the wind out of my sails.  It's quite aggrivating, wanting something so bad, but feeling that it is just out of reach.  There's the other thing that is really getting to me as of late.  I was always told not to set goals too high, so I never set goals like, "I"m going to be rich by 30."  All I want is a job.  A job that I will enjoy doing.  Is that an unrealistic goal?  I would certainly hope not.  It's amazing how people can take what they have for granted.  Staying with Kyle and Erika really opened my eyes to this.  Both of them have career jobs, they make about $72,000 / year (compard to Julie and my $9,800 / year) and yet they still seem quite unhappy.  They complain about money issues (makes me laugh), etc.  Kyle grunts and groans about his job, but will not get sympathy from me.  I'd do his job in a second if given the chance.  Well, that's all for today I guess.  I can only hope that tomorrow brings me some happiness, as this blog has gotten me feeling more down than when I started.  Well, I did have an awesome time fishing with Norm the other day.  Would be ideal if I had a little place, a boat, and loads of free time.  More dreaming sadly.  Until next time.

      Well, today was quite nice.  In a change up from my regular ritual, where Kyle comes home from work, we chat idly until Erika shows up, then we watch TV and eat supper, today we did something different.  We all chatted away, for a few hours, incorporating supper into the ritual.  It was quite nice!  I've always enjoyed those moments in life, the ones where you know you are fitting in just perfectly.  You are sitting with somebody, or doing something, and everything in the universe just seems right.  It's hard to explain, but I'm sure that other people experience this.  It was like that today.  The three of us, just chatting about this and that, the conversation flowing from topic to topic, and feeling simply content.  It was quite nice.  I haven't had a chance to experience a feeling of calm and contentment as of late, with all this Japan stuff, and career stuff floating around, so this was a very welcome break!  I've always counted myself lucky in terms of the friends I keep.  I have never had an abundance of friends.  In high school I really only communicated with a handful of people, and university was much the same, but the friends that I do keep are awesome.  Some people enjoy having tons of friends, but I've always preferred having a few close friends, people who I would do anything for.  Kyle and Erika fit that exatly.  It's nice to know that they'd do the same for me if needed.  So, I guess when I'm feeling down or messed up, all I need to do is think about how lucky I am, and what I still have around me.  Things are almost never as bad as they seem.  I've always believed that things work out in the end, as they have to, so I think I need to start revisiting that philosophy.  Until next time!

      It's half-way through Wednesday now, and my week with Kyle and Erika is nearly half over!  Time seems to fly by quick quickly, even though my days are spent alone.  I guess I've always enjoyed "alone" time, as it doesn't bother me at all to be in a silent house, with five cats as my only compnay.  Even when I was a little boy I rather enjoyed having lots of time to myself, which is good I guess.  I've been reading a guy's digital journal.  He was an American who taught English in Japan for a year.  It's quite good stuff, and I really hope that I get the same chance soon.  Reading his thoughts and feelings only stirs my own.  I spent enough time talking about my inner drive yesterday, so I won't bother today.  I've noticed an odd feeling as of late.  Before, when I would look ahead in life, I would always seem to know where it was going.  I've always enjoyed feeling some sense of control in my life, so this was always something that helped get me through.  Even after my father died, I was able to look ahead to university, and it offered me a focus point, something to aim for.  Now however, and for the past few months, when I look ahead, I don't seem to have that point to focus on.  I talked about it a bit yesterday, but it's something that is so foreign to me I have trouble shaking the feeling.  I used to tell my ma when I was little that I felt that I didn't fit properly into this society, and to this day I still feel this way.  This new feeling of chaos is only serving to re-inforce these feelings.  I guess I can only hope that things will start to work themselves out.  It's kind of ironic that I'm always telling my ma to find a new direction, live life for the small things, etc, when in my own life, I currently have almost no direction, and am having trouble enjoying the "small things."  I used to think that I had it together, but the more I look, I really don't.  Actually, I just let my mind wander, thinking of what / who is a center point in my life, and I saw Julie.  I shouldn't say that I don't have a focus or direction, as it's not really true.  I have Julie.  Well, hopefully tomorrow I'll have something more substantial to write about, something other than "I wish I was in Japan" and "Gee, I'm confused right now."  We'll have to wait and see.

      Well, another day passes, and my singular, driving urge is to go to Japan.  Julie asked me again today if I knew where I wanted to be in life, and I had to again admit that "I simply don't know."  I've never really had this problem before.  I've always had a couple of doors open to me, and usually have to pick one to go through.  Now however, I'm obsessed with the Japanese door, and for some odd reason no other door is appealing.  I guess the other thing that is weighing in on my mind is going back to school.  In this I really have only two options.  I could attempt my masters degree, which would be 12 months and expensive, or I could go back to school for computers.  Of these options the former is the less realistic one, as I don't have the money for a MA.  The latter is more realistic, but do I want to have two more years of schooling, two more years of debt, and two more years go by in my life?  Not really.  What I really want is to go to Japan, and work.  The pay is good (basically what I'd be making here as a starting teacher, but with less students).  I've always wanted to travel, I'm excited about seeing Japan and all it has to offer, and I think that it offers me an excellent chance to grow as a person.  The only setback to this is that I'm again putting all of my eggs into one basket.  Foolish?  Probably.  However, I still feel that over riding drive to do this, so I guess I'll keep trying until it either fails totally, or works out.  Until next time.

      Firstly, it's been a while since I last posted, so I'll try to be more diligant in the future.  Being at Kyle's for the next week will give me plenty of free time to do this type of stuff.  Well, I didn't get my job at NOVA.  I'm not going to dwell on it very much here, as I've done quite enough of that on my own.  However, it has left me in a bit of a situation, as I sort of had all my eggs in that basket.  Julie has asked me to think about what I wanted to do with my life, and during my walk today I thought about it quite a lot.  The short answer is "I don't know."  This is not good enough however, and the problem is quite deep.  I'm 24 years old, I have two degrees, and my life is set for a career as a teacher.  However, I do not really want to teach, and have no real drive to do so.  This leaves me with few options however, as I'm not qualified to do very much.  I'm applying for a new job with a company called ECC, and I'm really hoping that it works out.  Julie and my ma say not to get my hopes up for this, but it's hard not too. For some reason, a reason that I cannot explain, going to Japan just feels like the thing I'm supposed to be doing.  I'm not a big fan of "destiny" and "fate" so I am not saying that it is my destiny to go to Japan, I just get a gut feeling that it is the right thing to do.  Well, until next time.

      My ma has always told me that writing things down was healthy for me.  I figured that, on the eve of the largest adventure in my life, I should probably do so, and see how things work out.  I'm writing this a day before my interview with NOVA.  I'm hoping that all goes well tomorrow, although I'm fairly sure that I'll get the job.  I've also laid out most of my plans for my first few months in Japan, but, as they say, even the best laid plans can be laid to waste.  Hopefully this old addage won't ring true in my case.  I don't have much to say today, but I'll keep on writing here, with the intention of looking back on these entries in the years to come.  Ronnie

      Wow...  summer has finally arrived!  It's been in the mid 20's for the past few days, and as such, left me quite uncomfortable.  I've never really responded well to the heat, and I now recall why.  I sweat.  Lots.  Too much I think.  Oh well, need to start sucking it up, as hopefully I'll be in Japan soon, and it's very hot & humid there.  Not too much to say right now, just really wanted to drop to to keep this thing current.  I've been in a decent mood lately, so that's always nice.  I'll be back soon, promise.
