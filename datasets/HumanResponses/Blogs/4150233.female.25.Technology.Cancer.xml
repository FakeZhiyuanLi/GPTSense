       Working at HP now for some time, pocket pc's are something thats been a part of my daily work life.   But trust me, I am not bored..talk about it and I go on and on..ahem!    This small piece of device is an amazing thing.Thanks to my mentor jose (HP - Fargo) who taught me so much about it much to his enormous knowledge.   The more popular ones on the stall are the ipaq 4150,4350 (the latest) or the dell axim series . I personally love the hp 4355 .If you are looking for a small handy piece of art then this is it!   You gotto check these sites for more on them,..   urlLink  www.handango.com    urlLink  www.pocketpc.com    urlLink  www.geekzone.co.nz    urlLink  www.pdabuyersguide.com    are just few of the good ones you can have a look at.   this was just an informative blog..   my next one would have some info on the downloadable games that are more fun...

       We all are in a way maniacs of some kinda or other, the only difference being the reason! Talk about tech ..and not so well versed with the latest get wary! is that intimidating sometimes? yes, it is! This has been just an attempt on my part to do something that i always wanted to..pen down what i feel....or to be more precise..type down what i feel. What is technology ? Ah! What a silly question ,u might ponder? But can technology be really defined only in terms of what we see, what the binary can do..or to what extent the science evolves. Being a part of this tech era,I always have felt that probably theres' nothing better than technology that has ever happened to mankind! Simply because , life is more simple, more evolved or to say more busy! Technology has changed the whole scene from the abascus days to the days of pocket pc's! Doesnt it seem like an entire life can be embedded in a tiny chip? Wat say?

       What should have been an extremely important day anxiously anticipated with a year long hard-work and efforts put in turned into the most unexpected eventful day!! I am talking about none other than CAT! What enrages me most currently is the ease with which people who have been given the power to conduct an exam for an admission to an educational institution behave like mere sadistic wolves…waiting to cause hurt and anguish to innocent people across. I and my sister had been preparing for CAT for almost a year, desperate to get an admission in one of the most prestigious business schools with the hope of a promising future; we had been waiting for this exam. First came the shock of the exam being cancelled and the re-test being announced. Lakhs of students like us budged to it and had no choice but to give their next best shot on Feb 15’Th. Finally the day arrives and we wake up from sweet slumber on a wintry day, taking efforts to get ready for the exam. The anticipation and anxiety surfaces, but there is a hope that somewhere in a few months we would be in a business school. We say to each other we can make it and get set to go! All set, the reporting time is 10.30 on the hall ticket. Not more than a 10 mins drive from our home, we decide to be independent on our bike on a Sunday sharp at 10am. With least similarity in our names, mine was Christ Degree College and hers Mount Carmel as our centers of examination. The fate started playing games beginning with our bike breaking down due to the engine being cold; we decided to park it at a departmental store in the locality and board two different auto-rickshaws. It was 10.15 already. The rickshaw could not go beyond a speed of 30kmph and to my bad luck; the route was blocked completely due to the flyover construction happening at Dairy circle. I had no choice but to take a roundabout behind Nimhans and reach Christ College. I hadn’t reached yet, it was 10.32 am….still on my way. My cell rings, I pick it up to answer my famished sister on the other side , telling me with enormous pain and panic that the Professors in Mount Carmel College are not letting her sit through to the exam, although she was there at sharp 10.32…two mins late to the reporting time. What the heck!!!!!!! I mean TWO MINS IS NO BIG DEAL TO NOT LET SOMEBODY WRITE THE EXAM THAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN WAITING FOR ……So INHUMANE!!!!!! To add to the anguish I reach my center Christ College ten minutes late and the people out there were appreciably courteous and concerned. I couldn’t believe that the professor took me to the hall, gave me water and asked me to stop panicking…That is what you call understanding and humanity. I called my sister again and inform her that I was allowed for the exam. We are twins, have been studying together in school, have been doing things together and are probably more attached to each other than other siblings……Have been dreaming to get into the same college after a gap of studying separately for six years. What brings anger and tears in my eyes is that, she didn’t expect IIM’s but had been eager to get into SP Jain and other colleges. Having no maths-background since 10’th she didn’t hope much, but had hopes of getting into some good business school for her MBA. She worked hard; she was always punctual…and never erred in life in terms of her career and academics. How can somebody deny her the right to write an exam just because she was just a couple of mins late to the reporting time? The exam started at 11am, and with sadness gripping her she withdrew the struggle and came back and didn’t get back home in an effort to vent out what she felt like. No one but her knew what she was going through. My exam was a waste of all the effort put in a whole year with the least concentration I could muster. I had to, but sit and give my exam with no choice. This has left such a bitter aftertaste. Had people in Mount Carmel College been more sensitive and more humane towards such genuine cases, things would have been different and would have made a big difference in a life of another young aspiring girl!

      Talk about technology advancements and the most unheard things are out in news ! Can you imagine people exchanging files merely by touching each other.....And yes, we are talking about actual information files being exchanged through human touch. Now this is the latest patent obtained by Microsoft , the place I work for. Phew ! The idea is about using a person's body to network multiple devices together.I gotto know about this through a third-party website ...This is definitely exciting and more exciting is the fact that we will soon be getting rid of batteries for our dependency on them to power up the devices we use.We will very soon , see solar energy powering devices like Pocket PC's . I recently read somehwere that Konarka Technologies(http://www.konarka.com) is developing nanotechnology-based solar panels that can be woven into the fabric of people's clothes. These panels will be able to make electricity from any kind of light, not just sunlight, allowing users to be charging their handheld or smartphone almost constantly.They are even hoping that the device covers could be made out of such solar panels , so they can be charged as they are being used ! Well, it's not gonna be long when thes etechnologies will be a part of my favourite devices, handheld's and smart phones! The speed is amazing!

      Stepping into 2004, we have a lot happening around in the field of technology! How wonderful it feels to have a palm-sized gadget in your hand which does everything from surfing the net and scheduling to making calls and now to behave as a stress buster!! Now thats something I have read recently about and was as surprised as you are right now.But its not something imaginary or just a concept.Ed hardy of Brighthand.com discusses the unusual uses of a handheld.In his words, a company called DreamFree is demonstrating at Comdex this week the Peeg, a peripheral that hooks up to a Pocket PC and is supposed to stimulate different types of brain waves ( according to News.com ) The device has settings that DreamFree says increase the wearer's concentration or memorization ability. It supposedly can also bring about feelings of relaxation or energy. Now that's something , that surprised me.If this is the rate at which technology is developing, it wont be long when we will see technology batting a thousand in our lives!
