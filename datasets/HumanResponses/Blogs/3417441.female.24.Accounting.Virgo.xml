      It's been a very uneventful week...same ol' same ol'...just going to work and scheduling appointments at various adults schools.  Im trying to still figure out what profession I'd like to retire in..I excel in just about all things I do or at least understand it well enough that I excel, I think thats why it's taken me so long to figure out what I want as a career..I mean there's being an accountant,payroll clerk, office assistant, sheez I even been helping a friend of mine coordinate a Church convention and even with that I did a good job..I don't but I know I gotta figure it out fast!!!

      1). My Thighs...they seem to meet each other a little too much  2). Star 98.7'z Say it and Win...I know I can say  STAR 98.7  at least 20 times but they don't want to answer the phone when I call (you get 100 bucks for every "Star 98.7" said in 10 seconds)  3). Number 2...I really hate it!!  4). The dream I had last night..I dreamt that I was watching a movie of when Missionaries came to the beautiful Island of Samoa, One missionary saw a shirt that said "God Save Samoa" and he questioned why they were in Samoa; when Samoa already has a similar God with Similarities in the christian faith, He then started questioning his superiors when they were doing things out of the ordinary like summaning young girls and boys to their rooms and asking isn't that against protocol and the main superior answered we are not in any place that calls for protocol.  Then he starts hanging out with the islanders that were so accepting and started to see them as ungracious guests, they showed him what some of the missionaries were doing with Samoas youth and the disease and perversions they brought with them.  I woke up because I became disgusted and I couldn't sleep!!  5). Really hating No. 4 alot
