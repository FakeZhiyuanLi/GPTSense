       So...nothing of importance happened today...just got a load of stuff from Tescos for my camping trip tomorrow...So you'll be relieved of the bad posting tomorrow at least. Got a busy week from now on though, camping tomorrow and friday, then I have to go to school on saturday and meet my Aunt for a Barbecue afterwards, then on the Sunday I'm going to my firstever paintballing party...but if it's anything like Farcry I'll pwn at it! I may order some Ranma books later off Amazon, I love those books, they're so funny!

       The day started off horribly, by My dad condemning me to an afternoon/evening (4:00-10:00pm) of hellishly boring looking at a flower or two and celebrating the fact that my parents can drink wine...jeez. The nail in the coffin though was when my Dad said : "I know that you don't want to go, but it'll be fun. There'll be  Morris Dancers . Blimey...anyways, I went to school and did some doss lessons which no-one really cares about and I have the all-important job of being the title writers helper...I don't get to even write "D-day Landings:1806 or w/e" but I do get to help to come up with the ingenuity behind it...lucky me eh? Then I had a three hour break and totally pwned at Heli Attack 2 with 107 helicopters floored. Come on the me...So apart from that quite a boring school day, no homework...which is good. When I arrived home though, some uberblessingness happened upon my poor defenseless soul...Firstly it was raining so I didn't have to go to the garden/morrisdancefest, secondly ,my MP370 arrived...it possesses all the uber1337ness of my set up (black and silver monitor,black and blue lights alienware,black everything else) being uber crystalblue silvery and tranlucent shiny black. And it rulages...all that for doing well in my exams...how rare... I promise I'll have that crappy flash trailer up tomorrow, it's finished but I can't be bothered to upload it right now...so I'll give you it tomorrow!

       Moral dilemma...I have 2 Gmail invites and about 7 people wanting one...all friends, or big people who can beat me up. Hmmm...also I need to phone up 2 American Guys and yell down the phone and send a postcard to one brazilian...it's a tough life being a Gmail swapper :D. Anyways my Uncle stayed over tonight and was very "encouraging" throughout the whole england v. croatia game. I mean he was shouting stuff like: "That goalie looks like Damon Hill!" and "Maybe it;s the squares on the grass confusing them." He's quite funny really...I thought it was a good enough result..4-2 but the match against Portugal will be tricky...I don't know the inns and outs of all the stats of the players or what formations are best, but I do know it should be a good game on Thursday, at least we're through to the ko rounds! New Sbemails out today, thought I'd mention it because it's exceedingly good! Give it a watch sometime... It's getting kinda late now, so I'm heading off to bed, but if you've actually read this it'd be good if you could post a comment, I mean I try and make it intresting. And in other news I'm making a new crappy flash animation, and the trailer of it shall be finished shortly, and as special viewers of my blog I think that you deserve to watch it...an exclusive if you wish. Anyways, I'll update this tomorrow!  Sites Mentioned: http://www.homestarrunner.com                  http://www.gmailswap.com

       Good news and bad news today. Good news is that I finally got a Gmail account...sozzledsquirrel@gmail.com and I have to say, the service kicks booty! But the bad news is that my All in one arrived, but my   of a Dad is being evil and insisting not to pick it up from the depot...no reason given, he just feels like it. So I hate him...anyhow, I have thought of an evil revenge plot, detailing specific mice, geese and the odd milky white cow....bwahahahahahahahaha!

       So...a blog...I haven't made one of these for a while. Mainly because my life's so boring, but nevermind. Um...well today I recieved news that I wasn't going to get my braces off this year, but I have to wait a year...which pissed me off slightly...but thats the way life goes. At least my exams are over with an average mark of 82% which is good. Hopefully tomorrow my all in one (printer, not lycra) Canon MP370 will arrive but then again it probably won't. Ordered half-life at last...took me 3 years to do that, I'm kinda slow...I'm mainly buying it for counter strike though... So yeah I'll try to keep this blog updated once every three days or so, probably more to begin with and thats about it...so anyone who wants to read about my ever so boring life....you're in luck!

       OK...just to say that I just updated my profile so you can now know a little more about me....like you always wanted. I don;t have a picture yet because Blogger doesn't accept a .gif file as a GIF file...well whatever, I'm sure it's in the right! On a completely unrelated note how is "GIF" pronounced? I always pronounce it "Jiff" but I know some people who pronounce it like "Gift" but without the T...maybe thats one of life's greater mysteries...or maybe it's just safer to say the letters G,I and F when refering to this particular filetype...more geekiness coming up later!  Or How about now...just a side note: the web comic  urlLink   Control Alt Delete is full of hilarious geekiness...and it's funny...give it a look why don't you, you've already wasted enough time reading this!   http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com

       At last...I am recuperated..it took a day off school though... I've been non-stop busy from last wednesday evening until Tuesday...took a day off Wednesday, feeling ill and exhausted. In total this week I've done a 19 mile walk, camped overnight in a small tent made for 4, fitting 11...had no sleep, Went paintballing...twice,Made an egg racing cart thing, went to a talk on the internet (nothing I didn't know already, of course :)] and organised a primary school sportsday... Blimey. 'Twas all quite fun though! And I have a startling discovery: SOMEONE ACTUALLY READS THIS! Yeah...I was shocked aswell..but CFB ( a guy I know on a Forum) actually reads this...well he read it once, which is better than I thought.Anyways, tis my birthday in all but 2 days now...Having a "Party" tomorrow...yet none of my friends are gonna be there, busy and the like. Nevermind...that's what comes of organising your party 2 days before the event...I need to get more organised, methinks. Ordered one or two things for my birthday...magnets weird bouncy balls...keyrings (I collect them) and the stuffs. Going to PC World *SHUDDER* later to buy a few games stuffs. Also I may  order some new Ranma 1/2 books later, really addictive they are. Anyway, tomorrow afternoon can't be all that bad...it's gonna be in the Trocadero, which for those of you who don't know, is a big fat arcade with cool shops and a rollercoaster thing. Should be good. Anyway. Bye.
