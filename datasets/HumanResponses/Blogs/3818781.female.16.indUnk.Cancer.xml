      so here I am in Minnesota my mom packing the days full of crap that no one cares about making us all get up at 5am and we don't get to sleep till 12 or later...  my dad went and got himself hypnotized  and I thought he was embarrassing enough normally heres what he did: gave birth to a baby boy named Jimmy tried to breast feed said baby thought he was Garth Brooks and gave "autographs" thought he was Michael Jackson and tried to moon walk thought he was Britney Spears and tried to dance thought he was an Alien from mars (which by the way "is purple and pink") who didn't know it's sex and had been here for 6 years looking for cheese made from a mouse (not FOR a mouse)  danced to a song from beatlejuice tried to take his shirt off  and I thought the hypnotist would be fun...

      I like making funny noises...meow...  hmm Nick is really hot I want his body...  mmm! chocolate!  ok my brain is back it just needed a little snack (fish of course) I hate people who have an attitude, my sister being one of which, they just can't get it through their fat heads that hey you're not cool and everyone hates you ok?  people with authority problems irk me as well, I mean why can't you just do what the damned teacher says?? they think well if I'm defiant I'll be cool! If I'm the class clown I'll be cool! well it's time for one hell of a rude awakening kids, cuz know what?   no one cares  no one cares that you're the class clown sure it's funny for about five minutes then after that it's like hey that's really annoying would you kindly STOP?! no one cares that you're being defiant sure all the girls thing oh my god he's so strong! but in reality those guys are just big fat stubborn asses who can't take directions cuz they're too stupid to follow more than one at a time  a notice to any one out there who acts in this fashion:  stop it  defiance went out of fashion the exact same time that multi-colored head bands and bell bottoms did

      Okay so I guess I have no life whatsoever  I’m a misunderstood teenager with no goals in life except surviving high school  I wish I were skinny and beautiful but I never will be so I live with it  Here’s my favorite song in the entire world: “IRIS- Goo Goo Dolls And I’d give up forever to touch you Cause I know that you feel me somehow You’re the closest to heaven that I’ll ever be And I don’t wanna miss you right now And all I can taste is this moment  And all I can breathe is your life When sooner or later it’s over I just don’t wanna go home right now  And I don’t want the world to see me Cause I don’t think that they’d understand When everything’s made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am  And you can’t fight the tears that ain’t comin’ Of the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah you bleed just to know you’re alive  And I don’t want the world to see me Cause I don’t think that they’d understand When everything’s made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am  And I don’t want the world to see me Cause I don’t think that they’d understand When everything’s made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am  And I don’t want the world to see me Cause I don’t think that they’d understand When everything’s made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am…”  I think about Nick when I sing this song He’s so beautiful And I’ll never have a chance with him…because he hates me

      Well kids I finally broke. I knew it’d happen sooner or later but I didn’t think it’d be for this reason. It’s not jealousy. It’s not selfishness. It’s just me wishing I had someone to hold me to love me sincerely and kiss me goodnight.  I was standing there in the dark parking lot with all the people rushing to their cars and driving away from the stadium. DCI was fun, but… it was what happened in the midst of things that irked me. Katie always gets the guy and I always get screwed. This guy that I’ve known for a really long time was there. I’ve loved him since I met him. And Katie had him in her pocket in 3 seconds flat. I stared at the little spot of light under one of the bussed my mind idly wondering where it had come from and Katie rubbed my arm a bit. Next thing I know I’m in her arms crying like a third grader. I spilled my soul to her. And now I’m going to have to live with it. I’ll tell you what I said.  I'm not jealous of Katie I just can't stand the fact that when we're together and a guy comes along I manage to say something to herrendously stupid that he can't help but go after her instead.  we talked about what ever came to mind: how my dad hates my art how our parents fight how the pear that she had brought to eat had become so digustingly squishy hence conforming to the pocket that held it to the seat infront of us  Katie is leaving for college in 2 weeks. I'm going to miss her so much. she's my best friend in the entire world I tell her everything and now I'm not going to have anyone to talk to at school  she taught me a song by Counting Crows on the piano called Colorblind I play it and think of her.
