      Have you ever felt that being an organist is one of the lonelier occupations? Every wonder how much longer you can keep going at it? Ever think that not one really cares anyway, so what’s the use? If you can answer "no" to these questions, you are among a fortunate minority. We all know from hours of practicing that being a musician has its lengthy periods of isolation, that practicing can feel like hard work for what we sometimes perceive as a small reward.  Staying on track takes a mental effort requiring a commitment to long-rang goals. For me, the answers to the question of "why do this" begin with the absolute belief that as musicians we have been granted a monumental gift. What we do with this gift is the important choice.  The gift of music has been bestowed on us for a purpose that reaches far beyond our own amusement. It is a gift through which was are expected to inspire, uplift, encourage, console; a gift through which we are to bring glory and honor, majesty, and strength to our places of worship, a gift through which we are expected to bring joy and profound expression to our congregations. Few people are so richly blessed; few have such magnificent opportunities to reveal the face of God to the world. But there are nagging questions again: "Is it all worth the effort?" The answers come in a wide variety of ways, from unexpected sources, in a surprising manner, sometimes we least expected.  Mark

      Sunday has been called the day of rest, but that is not usually the case for the organist at your local parish church. Yes that is what I do for a living, and I have to say that it’s a pretty darn good job. You get to meet the most interesting people on a daily basis. Not really, but I just like to tell people that I meet a lot of interesting people. Truth be told I see a lot of dead people, being that I play plenty of funerals. Anyway people where singing really well today at mass, especially when I used the state trumpet and the 32' bombard at the end of the hymn. It always adds a real punch and sounds great. Well that what I think, the bombard sounds like a jackhammer at the lowest 12 notes. I personally like the upper octave, it’s so much smoother than the 16' Pousane.  So the choir term starts again in September, we have some new choir members that are very promising. Which is good for me, still the same amount of work, but I can feel more confident in the sound of the choir. When I first took the position 2 years ago, I was interesting to say the least. The sound was all over the place, basses were tenors and it was just a mess. Now finally after 2 years of working with them I can finally say they sound great. I have the best bass and tenor section, 12 of them all together and it sounds great. Soprano and altos are at the same level now, so all in all I am a happy choirmaster.  The next major event coming up in the fall we be the first organ recital at the church and a choir concert the following year. Still not sure what I am going to play, the organ is better suited to play Bach and but I think that I can pull off a little French you know the Franck and the Langlais. The choir on the other hand, not sure what they are going to sing. (I forgot to mention, the church has a group of chamber players, made up of students and pros, and perform with the choir 6 times a year, usually at the Major Holy Days.) I really love the Durufle Requiem, but I would like to start with something different that is not well known. So what else is there?  Ahh yes, after listening to my I Tunes Library, I found the perfect work, the Polenc Gloria. Its awesome and its totally different, and easy for the choir to learn.  Speaking of music, I am playing at my home church tomorrow in the morning, 8:30 AM for the daily mass. It’s the feast of Saint Rose of Lima, the patron saint of the church. Mass will be held in the Church and there will be food afterwards. So it seems that everyone makes out good, even the organist who works when everyone is resting.   Mark

      Well what an exciting day that I had today. Today I had another customer at the church. For those who don't know, I call the dead person at a funeral the customer. Being the organist I always make sure the "customer" is always right. Its not if they have an actual say in what happens. After that I went to Peter's house to install some new software on his computer. His wife makes the best eggplant dish and the hot sauce that he used in it came all the way from Granada. Let me tell you, it was hot as hell. But it was real good.  Afterwards I went back to work and played Sunday masses at the church. While in my office a big storm came up and just as I was about to save what I was doing the damn power went out, and I lost everything. All the other computers in the office are hookup to UPS backup power stations, except for mine. So I guess tomorrow I have to start all over again. But that’s part of life we just can't control. Or maybe I could of by saving the project a little earlier. Well you all know the saying, "Life's a bitch and then you die."  Getting back to all things computers, I was working on my laptop (Lombard G3), its a Mac, and was having problems installing the new OS they put out. Panther is the code name for it, and I had to wait in line for 15 mins at CompUSA to get it (CompUSA tries to sell you PC video card to put into your MAC, which would really screw up any system) So I get the OS and does not work on my computer or my laptop. That sucks because I just spend $120 for it and I can't use it on any of my computers. So I called Apple, who were very helpful with my desktop, but they were completely baffled by the laptop problem. Come to find out its the DVD/CD drive, its an upgrade from the original and is not bootable. So after finding out what was wrong I had to get a new DVD/CD drive off of E-Bay and now all works fine, and I was able to use the $120 program on my laptop. I used to call it the "fuck of all fucks" but it’s starting to turn into a giant piece of crap. I should not say that, I love my laptop and it loves me. (I’m using it right now and it can tell what I am typing and might get mad and crash.) Well that’s all I have to say and I shall say no more. So let it be written, so let it be done.

      Well I decided to make a blog because Ray said that it would be fun. Well welcome to my blog space. A little about me, I am a musician who plays the piano and the organ. Yes the organ, it's the one you hear at church for weddings, funerals, and Sunday masses. There are so many jokes you can make about this, but lets try to keep it clean.  So there is a lot of work that I need to catch up on this evening, so I shall keep this first posting short. Choral service lists need to be made for the choir term which starts in a couple of weeks. It is actually somewhat of a daunting task to choose good music for the Catholic Church. Crap has proliferated into Church music now, and it has become the norm is so many church. It's too depressing, how cocktail music is allowed into the sacred mass, and how many people enjoy it. After being at my job for two years I am happy to say that the repertoire has grown. Right now we have enough anthems and motets to last the entire church year, however there is so much more music that I need to teach them. This year we will be doing an all-British theme. The works of Britten, Matthias and Willcocks for Christmas, during Holy Week its going to be Baristow and Morley, and of course the tradition Latin for the Good Friday service and the Tenenbrae Service. So really the work never really stops in the summer months while the choir is off.  Does anyone watch the Casino on Fox? Like most of their stuff its ok, except for the Simpson's which is the best show in the world. If you don't think so, write a comment and tell me why, I bet you can't.  Anyway, it's a pretty good show and the music on there is OK. Matt Dusk who sings there is good, but when I was listening to his CD he need some more expression, but it's still very good. Back to the show, it's a reality show, imagine that, of 2 friends who buy the Golden Nugget, and try to make money off of it. I don't know if they are making any money, but I'm sure the amount they get from FOX to film there is pretty good. All the best to everyone and remember that his Blog will be at the same Blog time and on the same Blog channel.    Mark
