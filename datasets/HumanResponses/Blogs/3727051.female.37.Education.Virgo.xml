           Despite their propensity for cleanliness, pigs, Ilya decided, were just plain nasty.  It never failed that her turn for cleaning the pens came during the hottest parts of the summer.  The sodden muck of the pens stuck to her boots, the pigs, greatful for company, rubbed against her legs which were usually clad in a pair of one of her older brother's cast-off breeches (her mother hated seeing her in boy's clothing, but had given up trying to prevent it), and the flies buzzed and bit unmercifully through the damp tangle of hair at her neck and ears.      Summer in __________ was usually a very pleasant time.  The fields ripened and turned green and golden under a bright azure sky.  Children played in the fields, swam in the streams and ponds, and climbed trees in the forest.  Wives tended kitchen gardens, looked after the little ones, and chatted across hedgerows.  Husbands tilled fields, looked after animals, mended equipment, and stopped for a mug of frothy cool ale at The Hen and Jackal.

      You know, the concept which most occupies my mind in the last few weeks has been beheading.  Gruesome thing to be thinking about.  Ever since Nick Berg's death, I have been fascinated with the concept of how individuals can do this to other human beings. The thought boggles my mind.  How do you take a screaming, kicking, pleading person, someone with a family, friends, hopes, and dreams, and saw his head off?  How do you sleep?  How do you eat?  How do you go home to your family?  I watched the Nick Berg video and some of the other videos available on the net that document cases of torture (stoning, even impaling someone on a stake), and my mind can't grasp the brutality and lack of humanity involved in such an act.  Even more distressing are the number of people who turn out to cheer on such events.  Now we have 2 more executed men - Paul Johnson, and Kim Sung-Ill, a Korean.  The families who are left to wait in agony, knowing the outcome of their loved ones' fate, knowing there will be pictures and videos released of the horrendous last moments of life, how do they cope?  How do you exist?  Whom do you blame?  There will be no trials for the families to attend, there will be no executions to watch, there will be no closure.  There will only be a casket which can't be opened.  I believe that the war in Iraq is a good thing, if any war can be said to be good.  I support our President and our troops.  I know that sometimes the greater good can be lost in the shuffle of the everyday.  Relieving Iraq of Saddam  was  a good thing; giving Iraq a democratic sytstem of government  is  a good thing.  There are a great many who disagree.  They will be proven wrong.

       Breaking one's foot sucks, to put it mildly.&nbsp; Friday's surgery was to repair the tendon (that was what I heard break), and to attempt to fix the bone.&nbsp; Apparently, the bone was shattered to such an extent that it wouldn't hold a screw, therefore, my foot is full of some kind of wire mesh designed to hold the bone in place.  &nbsp; I had my first shower since Thursday today,&nbsp; boy did it feel good, but I am stuck in bed with my foot propped up.&nbsp; Hubby and boy child are being terrific about it, and they are really helping me out. &nbsp; I will, unfortunately, miss Monday's&nbsp; interviews for a new principal.&nbsp; And that pisses me off to no end.&nbsp; I don't dare try to go, though. &nbsp;  sigh &nbsp; hard to get comfortable at the computer, hard to get comfortable in bed, hard to get comfortable period. &nbsp; Oh well, life goes on...

      As if this summer hasn't been nightmarish enough, last night I stepped off the sidewalk in front of the deck and broke a couple metatarsals in my left foot!  There's nothing quite like the sound of bone breaking as you fall to the recently mown grass in the dark of night - all because you had to go and get your cat (who has 3 legs by the way).  It only gets better.  Hubby is plopped in front of the TV finishing up dinner (we ate late 9:30 pm), and I'm writhing around on the ground trying to call out to him - he thinks I'm hollering for the cat.  Anyway, I finally manage to lift myself off the ground enough to wave frantically at him.  Out he comes, and off we go, 30 miles, to the emergency room.  Unfortunately, two mini-vans full of adults and kids collided east of town - the small hospital was a bit overwhelmed; some of the kids had to be life-flighted, and some of the adults had to be taken to other area hospitals.  Rightly so, my foot was not a priority, and we were told that it would be 4:30 or 5:00 am before the x-ray machines would be free and a doctor would be free.  So off we go, 30 miles back home (the nurse did wrap my foot and tell me to keep ice on it as they really couldn't do anything while it was still swollen).  Once home, hubby makes me comfortable on the couch (as comfortable as a tummy sleeper can be on her back), I doze off and on fitfully through the night, and once morning comes, off we go again to the ER.  The upshot of all this is, I have to see an orthopedist tomorrow to get my foot set and get a cast (maybe).  Meanwhile, I am trundling around with a little blue shoe-thingy and some crutches.  My first broken bone in my entire life has to be something as ignominious as a metatarsal, SHEESH!!!

      Hmm...the plot thickens around here.  Our esteemed leader, the "Ice Queen," as I call her has sent out letters to those of us on a certain committee stating the times of the interviews for the unfilled position.  What the Ice Queen failed to mention, is that we will not get paid for working that day if we choose to attend the interviews.  This is a low blow.  I only just managed to assuage The Green Man from making a beeline to the Ice Cave to voice his rabid disbelief at such a decision.  Is Mark worth $200.00 some odd dollars of my time?  In a word, YES!!!!

      Once again we have a   3 day weekend!  .  I believe I will sleep in tomorrow and then do some stitching.  The boy child is going to 4-H camp on Saturday and will be gone for 5 days; I believe hubby and I will have some time together!!!    YEAH!!!!!  .  I have been ruminating on the seemingly prevalent notion that children/teenagers feel that they are "entitled."  It doesn't matter what they feel entitled to have, do, think, feel; they just seem to feel that since they are alive and breathing and in our presence, we are obligated to provide them with everything their little hearts desire.  When did this attitude of, "Give me, because I want," begin?  Truly, I believe it to be a product of a peaceful society.  These kids do not know hunger, true need, or true want.  They are a generation of "entitlemes."  They have nice clothes, nice shoes, cell phones, chat rooms, beepers, every imaginable comfort and luxury.  What do they know of privation and/or sacrifice.  I realize that lumping all children/teenagers under this banner is not fair; however,  I can, right at this moment, look at eight teenagers and be hard-pressed to find one who would willingly sacrifice for another.  How much food is wasted - when have they had to go hungry?  Truly hungry?  What happened to the notion that food should be eaten because it was set before one, thereby showing respect for the one who made it?  How many people say grace now-a-days?  My family does.  Ours goes like this:   Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty, through Christ our Lord.  Amen    Even that simple little prayer reminds me that my food, my family, my health, my shelter, my very life all come to me through the Grace of God.  I am thankful to have something to eat, somewhere nice to live.  Is that my age? or my experience?  I have seen something of the world; I am travelled.  I say this not to boast, but to place some credence on my next words.  When I entered throught the gates at Auschwitz and walked past the words,  "Arbeit macht frei,"  I was accutely aware that I was about to step foot in a place full of ghosts.  So many people passed through those gates and into the gas chambers; so many lives were snuffed out; why was my life any different?  If I chose to go through my life without the knowledge, cognizant knowledge, of the atrocities committed there, could I truly say that I deserved my life?  This of course, is a rhetorical question.  I am worthy of my life as a child of God.  My life is made more meaningful, because I am aware of the sacrifices others have made before me.  This has become more apparent as I get older.  I feel things more keenly than I did as a young adult.  The WTC is a good example.  Knowing that the people on the upper floors had no chance of escape is a very sobering thought for me.  Watching people who know they are going to die makes me wonder how I would react?  Is my faith strong enough - I believe it is, I hope it is, but how can any of us know until we reach that point?  The children, and to a lesser extent, the parents of this generation, have not had to make any sacrifices.  We have lost some soldiers in conflict across the globe since the end of the Vietnam War, but even the current casualty figures from the war in Iraq are statistically negligable when compared to a similar period of time in any of the other wars we have been involved in.  So, I guess the big question here is, does a prolonged period of peace create apathy and a sense of entitlement?  Our society has so many things to take our minds off society today, that we seem to be incapable of forming an attachment to a sense of duty.  Will the children of the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan have a different sense instilled in them?  Will we soon see a change in the attitudes of our students?  Time will tell....

       urlLink    This is another finish I really like.  It's a piece from the Sweetheart Tree called Busy Dizzy Bees.  I submitted it to Silkweaver's annual stitcher's showcase.  I love the bees - they are stitched over one and look really cool up close.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is one of my very best cross stitch finishes.  I enjoyed stitching this, and enjoyed even more sending it off to be finished by a wonderful lady named Judy O'Dell.  It sits on our mantle, and I change the flowers for the seasons - it looks really cool with the Christmas decorations!&nbsp; urlLink

      On the way home from work yesterday, we passed my husband heading to town.  I got that sinking feeling of impending doom in my stomach, which I pushed aside in favor of more positive thoughts.  Sure enough, when he called (which in itself is an improvement), he was on his way to a meeting!!    WOO HOO!!!    He also called when he was on his way home.  I made sure to let him know how proud I was of him - making the first step is always hard.  He told me the hardest part was admitting that he screwed up 11 1/2 years of sobriety.  I am cautiously optimistic that we are on an uphill trend.  He still needs to make an appointment for the substance abuse counselor and continue to go to his meetings.  I have to work on helping him raise his self-esteem and his confidence in himself.  We both have a lot to work on, but I think we are going in the right direction.

      The weekend is over.  All in all, it was a good one!  Saturday, the boy child and I went to town to purchase hubby's birthday gifts.  We ended up with a new self-propelled lawn mower, a Char-broil grill, and a really cool reclining lawn chair.  Sunday, we presented the gifts (he loved them!!!) and went to town to the grocery store and spent the whole day together, playing croquet, barbecuing, swimming, and of course, lighting fireworks.  Everone still has all their fingers, and nothing burned down.  Now, it's back to work, luckily we only have a 3 day week.  Friday off means another long weekend !   I asked hubby  this morning if he might go to a meeting today; he got a little distant.  I also asked him if he might call the substance abuse counselor.  I'm really worried that he won't go through with these things, no matter what his intentions.  Then I worry whether or not I should be mentioning meetings and appointments to him, I don't want to be pushy, but I do want it to be done.    I guess what I need to do is keep praying, praying, praying.  I have to get over my insecurities about the whole situation, and keep pointing him in the right direction giving him all the encouragement I can.    Just keep on pluggin' away...

      The Fourth of July weekend is suddenly upon us.  I am looking forward to having three days off from school, and the chance to spend some time relaxing with my family.  My husband's birthday is on Sunday, and the boy child and I are planning on getting him a new barbecue grill and possibly a new lawn mower.  I do not feel that this is an unwise decision.  I suppose if I were to be fatalistic, I would be spending my time thinking about the next drinking incident.  That kind of fatalism does no one any good.  We know we have things to work on, but we have lives also.  We have a son.  So, going on.  Why are freshmen boys such idiots?  I've got an English class doing a webquest on  All Quiet on the Western Front .  They have a bunch of info to look up on the web and some questions to answer.  So what do I find?  Three goobers on MSN chat one of whom is listening/watching some kind of satanic, slasher, punk shit on Yahoo.  Sorry about that.  School is almost over for the day; I can go home and rest.

      You know, I really need to stop starting these things out with "you know."  On a lighter note, it is amazing how much better I feel today than I have in the last several days.  God has lightened my heart by showing us a way through the darkness.  While there's life, there's hope.

      You know, sometimes, life just really sucks.  When you think about how you live, about how you coast along without a care in the world, it's no wonder that God trips you up every once in a while to remind you just who's in charge.  I married an alcoholic, albeit a sober alcoholic.  Sober for 11 years in fact.  Okay, so for the last 2 years, he's sort of taken a flying leap off the wagon.  He's pulled a couple of all-nighters in the bar, come home drunk a couple of times, and generally scared, annoyed, and angered me in increasing increments.  I've left him for a couple of nights hoping that that would knock some sense into him.  I've begged, I've pleaded, I've cried, I've yelled, I've done it all.  No change.  Sunday was the worst.  He left at 9:00 am to finish up a remodeling job, said he would probably have to run to town to get a few things he needed, and would probably be home in time to grill a couple of steaks.  When 7:00 pm rolled around, the boy child and I took the drive out to the remodel job.  No husband - just that sinking helpless feeling in the pit of my stomach.  I knew immediately where he was, and what he was doing.  With that knowledge comes a night of very little sleep...listening, always listening for the sound of the pickup.  Waiting, always waiting for the phone to ring.  Then the images begin to form in my mind - dead in an alley, dead in a ditch, dead in a wreck, in jail.  Who will be the pall-bearers?  What will happen to the boy child?  What will I do to keep the house?  Then the hot tears that have been threatening all night, spill over.  I toss and turn in bed alternting between anger and a gut-wrenching fear.  Monday morning rolls around; still no husband.  I took the day off from work and sat down to wait.  Actually, I moped.  The boy child did the best he could to take care of me, but I was a pretty pitiful spectacle.  I finally had a talk with the boy child about his dad and the drinking, and spoke to him of some of the things that might have to happen in order to get his dad to get help.  He stared solemnly off into the distance, nodding when necessary - I believe he understood.  So, Monday night - no husband, no phone call, no nothing.  I broke down and called the city and county jails and the two hospitals.  Nothing.  Again, another night of tossing, turning, waiting, listening.    Tuesday morning, I tried to go to work, and actually managed it for a bit.  I broke down though, went to my bosses and explained the situation for them.  Sympathy and understanding poured from them and into me, and because of them, I was able to go home - first I had to make a stop.  I hate our sheriff's office.  Everybody and their brother seems to be privy to everything that goes on in there.  There's no secrecy and things don't stay secret.  I, however, was at the end of my rope.  With tears in my eyes, I marched in, asked to see the sheriff in private and filled out my very first missing person's report.  Sure enough, 3 hours or so later, guess who pulls into the driveway?  After saying a brief prayer of thanks to God for bringing him home safely, the first words out of my mouth were, "Get your shit and get out."  For no other reason than pure laziness, I won't recount all the angry words (my side only), tears (my side), firmness (my side), and more tears (still my side).  The upshot of all this was, my husband finally admitted he needed and would seek help.  He made the first calls, took the first steps.  I let him sleep in the RV (I admit I felt sorry for him), then on Wednesday morning, we talked.  And talked, and talked, and talked.  Really talked.  For the first time possibly in our marriage.  I love my husband, but I will not be a victim.  I also will not give up when there is hope, and I saw hope here.  Marriage vows are sacred, and I promised to love him in good times and bad, in sickness and in health.  I will not desert him while he is in that dark place in his soul - not when I know he wants to climb out of it.  Alcoholism is a disease.  We can't cure it, but together perhaps we can conquer it.

      Now begins the descent into madness.  What a fool I've been to assume the drinking would stop.   What kind of man says he's off to the grocery store on a Sunday morning and doesn't return until early Monday morning?  I guess it doesn't really matter.  In the intervening hours, I have come to a decision.  My marriage is over.  It's just not over yet.  I must steel myself to do what women since the beginning of time have done.  Be patient, wait.  The bills must be paid off.  When I leave, I don't want to be in debt.  I want to be free and clear.  That must come first.  I shall endeavor to be a good wife and mother, and all the while, I will be working hard to pay off the bills while beginning a savings account of my own.  One hundred and fifty dollars a month to start, direct deposited.   I found that there was very little emotion this time.  I have become apathetic to the whole thing.  I want my life back, I want myself back.  I don't want to be shut in with the paranoia, the distrust, the rub of feeling that is too painful to bear.  I want to be free of it.  But, I want to be free of it on my own terms.   I am a strong individual.  Perhaps I was never meant to be married in the first place.  Perhaps I was naive enough to believe that he wouldn't stray into the depths of his disease after so long out of them.  Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.  I want my strength back.  So now, I settle down to wait.  I can do that.  I've had lots of practice.
