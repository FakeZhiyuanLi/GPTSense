      I just picked up the new ESPN NFL 2K5 at CompUSA today, and it only cost me $20. My initial impressions? The same magic of last year's with some new production values that keep gameplay fresh. I still have yet to delve into the various new modes of play, however, so it's all up in the air. The graphics have vastly improved, but that's probably because I bought the PS2 version last year, whereas this year I bought the Xbox edition.  I do plan on picking up Madden 2005 when it comes out in two weeks and doing a bit of a comparison of the two. Of course, I'll need funds for this, and there's no way in hell I'm spending my iMac funds. It's unfortunate that I've been hit by the football fever; I'm selling five of my games tomorrow to pick up NCAA. By the end of this ordeal, I'll have three football games to tote around and call my own.  And to think that I'm not really much of a fan anyway. :)

      The iTunes Music Store is offering customers a free audio version of the Democratic Convention speeches earlier this week. Too cool. It's nice to see free audiobook content once in a while, even if it will probably almost always be political stuff.  In other news, I'm about 2/5ths the way on earning my new computer. With three more pay days, I should have enough for a new iMac, hopefully. I suppose we'll have to wait until September to see what Apple has in store for us next!

       I read your comments on Google's Gmail. You sound sincere. I have some invites if you are still looking for one.  Just as long as you don't sell it on Ebay, I can send you one.   I just received the nicest email from someone who apparently was reading my blog one day and decided to send me an invite to Gmail. Unfortunately I rejected his offer. Fortunately the reason was because I had already received an invite! To that person, however, thank you so much for your kindness, and I wish you the best.  Which leads me to another "award-winning" review. I was going to save this for later, but I found it the perfect opportunity. So, without further ado,  Google's Gmail .     urlLink    Click for a larger image     Where we last left off, I was in dire pursuit of a Gmail account to call my own. I had tried offering my services, even entered contests, but to no avail. All my methods had failed, and it was then when I realized that I hadn't tried something; people. Afterall, I wouldn't hurt just to ask for an invite from someone in, say, an IRC chat room. So I popped open Colloquy, headed into #adium, and in moments, darkcore set me up with an account. In the words of John Madden... Boom. Immediately after I tried to delete any and all pleas I had made, and then activated my account.  galenwiley AT gmail DOT com.   So now that its all a reality, was Gmail really all it was hyped up to be? In a word: yes. Yes it was. Call me a drooling fanboy if you will, but my expectations were actually exceeded when I finally got a chance to use Gmail for myself.  The first thing I noticed was that it was fast. And I mean  fast . Faster than any web mail service I've ever used. But it wasn't just the send/receiving speeds that surprised me; it was the entire process than just seemed to click. Perhaps it was the lack of obtrusive images that usually put my browser down to its knees, but Gmail just has something about it that makes it particularly speedy in everything it does. Whether its adding a contact or forwarding an email, even attachments of reasonably large size send amazingly fast. I can only hope that once the thing goes public, such speed will still be obtainable.  Speaking of attachments, another feature of interest is Gmail's capacity. Though 1GB will most likely become a standard in a year or so, Gmail is among the first services to deliver over 1000MB of storage. To most, this is a tad overwhelming. Rest-assured, however, the decision has paid off. I haven't deleted a single message since I got the account, and I don't intend to anytime soon. I may never reach my quota in this lifetime. In a way, Google has offered a majority of its users virtually unlimited storage space.  Another feature worth noting is the way Gmail handles reading and responding to messages. The conversation view allows easy reference to every single message in a conversation. When you need to respond to a message, simply type your reply into a non-obtrusive text box and hit send. It's that simple, and more importantly, everything you need is in the same place.  Lastly is the Address Book, which, while not nearly as feature heavy as the other parts of Gmail, works surprisingly well. The interface is simple yet intuitive, making adding and viewing contacts relatively effortless. Gmail even has autofill when addressing messages, something you'd really only expect in a commercial email client.  Gmail's feature load is high, and you'll find yourself using almost all of them constantly. You can assign messages multiple labels for easy searching, create easy to use filters à la Mail.app, there's even a built-in spam blocker. Google will continue to add new features to Gmail, and with the already large amount of third-party applications available, the experience will remain fresh for a long time.  Overall, Gmail delivers in practically every respect. Ignoring a slight problem with refreshing in Safari, Google has done a simply fabulous job.    Overall Score:  10/10  (And to those still looking for a Gmail account, heed my words: you can try entering contests or giving stuff away, but when it comes down to it, the best way to get Gmail is through a real person. Best of luck to you.)

      Apple announced some new iPods today, and from what I've seen, they seem to be up to Apple's standards. Something a little surprising, though, was the new click wheel feature. Sure, we've seen it in the iPod Mini, but I never could imagine it being in the iPod original. Personally, I prefer the scroll wheel with buttons topside much more appealing for a larger mp3 player, but Apple has by no means tarnished its name by making the change. More power to them, I suppose.  The price drop was another shocker, albeit for the best. I only wish I had waited another six months and got my 20GB for only $300 rather than $400, the price tag which the 40GB now carries. The extended battery life is also a feature I will be missing, although I never really had to use my iPod for more than two hours at one time, really. Lastly are the added features, such as multiple On-The-Go Playlists and Shuffle Songs. These are not crucial, but they add a lot of possibilities to an already versatile product. Buyer's remorse can be a cruel mistress.  At any rate, With these new variations, coupled with lower prices and the elimination of the 15GB model, Apple has wowed the competition, proving once more that they are the top dogs in the digital music industry. Will I upgrade? Certainly not now. But if Apple continues to innovate their products, I won't hesitate to buy a new iPod a few years down. Of course, by then, who knows what Apple has in store?

      Now that Blogger is done acting up, I can finally resume my endless array of rants, raves, and reviews. For no one to view. :)  I'm going to be rehauling everything shortly. I promise I'll make more meaningful entries and cut down on the filler.

      Why do they do it? Why do people spend 15 dollars or more a month to play one video game? Granted that aside from free trials, I haven't played any Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games ("MMORPGs") myself, but I can't help but wonder what compels people to spend their hard-earned cash every month just so that they can play as their Lvl67 Fire Elf without worry.  It doesn't sicken me, though. I imagine if I had the hardware and the interest to, I would be more than willing to try out an MMORPG or two. Unfortunately, nothing besides World of Warcraft is even close to satisfying my needs, and that's in closed beta testing right now.  My main knack is that there are just too many MMORPGs out there for the genre's own good, many of them incredibly mediocre, or so says the reviews. Sure, once in a while there will be an innovater, i.e. City of Heroes, but almost always its another fantasy based hack and slash, all of which are essentially Everquest clones.  As technology evolves, I'm certain the concept of MMORPGs will as well, but for now, I'll keep to my Battlefield 1942s and Unreal Tournaments--great online games without all the subscription fuss.

      In related news, I got my first paycheck! 253 dollars. At this rate, I should be able to afford a G5 by the end of the year.  I know I said I wouldn't fill this thing with personal stuff, but I did anyway. I couldn't resist. ;)

      AppleLinks has posted a great  urlLink review  of Toon Boom Animation's  urlLink Toon Boom Studio v2.5 , an award-winning 2D animation suite recently updated for the Mac. Its a great read, especially for someone interesting in dipping their fingers into the animation biz.  Unfortunately the requirements seem to be a pretty steep, with a G4 required at minimum, but this is nothing really new. Hopefully when and if I get a G5, I'll be able to experiment with it. Until then, hopefully others can as well. Check out the review for more info.

      Forgive me for ranting, but what's going on with Xbox Live these days? I remember the days when a week couldn't go by without the latest XBL game coming out, but during the summer, its a whole different story entirely. It seems Rainbow Six 3 will be the only game I'll be playing, if not some variant of it (see Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow).  Still, there's much to look forward to in the late third/early fourth quarters. EA will be releasing their online sports lineup, and I can't wait to lay down some MechAssault 2, although that probably will be in early 2005, when I'm already zoned in to KOTOR 2 and Jade Empire.  Then, of course, there's Halo 2. But we've all heard quite enough about that, haven't we?  Regardless. Late this year/early next year should be a golden age for online gamers. Until then, though, I really have nothing else to play...  Maybe I should start studying for the SATs.

      I finally got around to seeing the first Spiderman movie last night (thank you very much, Netflix!), and now all I have to do is see the recently released sequel. I've heard mixed messages from those who have seen it. A lot of people say its better than the first, while others say it was the lowliest pile they were ever forced to watch. Regardless, I'll be attending Sunday's showing with an open mind, ready to view whatever Sony/Columbia has in store.  A full review of Spiderman 1 will be available soon. First I gotta check out the extras.

      That last post seemed to fix whatever was bugging Blogger out.  In completely unrelated news, I got an email in my Hotmail mailbox detailing some "changes" to my account. Apparently MS has joined the bandwagon and will soon be offering free 250MB of email storage, in addition to better virus support... not that I have to really worry about the ladder. Its good to see that more and more services are upping the ante to their users.  I still would like a Gmail account though... :)

      Something fishy has been going on with Blogger as of late. For one thing, I can't delete or edit blog preferences, and my post count refuses to go past 2. What gives?  Regardless, hopefully these issues will be sorted out. Apparently they have, but I haven't noticed any immediate improvements.

      Something that's been on every Mac user's mind nowadays is  Dashboard , a desktop widget application to be in included in Apple's latest OS X release,  Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" . You see, there's a bit of a controversy going on between Apple and the developers of  Konfabulator , an application which, for the most part, serves the same purpose as Dashboard. Is Apple re-innovating the tech industry, or is it simply ripping off ideas from its own developers?  To put it simply, Apple is doing nothing wrong or out of the ordinary. If no one built off someone else's ideas, how would we progress as a society? Moreso, Dashboard has been compared to Konfabulator too directly. True, both applications allow users to create and use mini-applications called "widgets"--things ranging from calculators to webcam viewers--in order to better speed up workflow, but the similarities pretty much end there. The two apps use different programming languages and neither are handled the same. Dashboard, for example, is designed as a background application, one that only appears when a button is pressed. Konfabulator's widgets, on the other hand, are made immediately available to the user.  This is not to mention that the concept of desktop accessories has literally been around since Mac OS 1.0.  I realize I don't make much of an argument, but try to take things by a different perspective. Konfabulator might have created the first widget solution for Mac OS X, but it certainly hasn't created the first solution ever. Up until Dashboard, there had been no competition for such an app. Now that Apple had something similar, Konfabulator's developers have an opportunity to show the Mac community what sets their app apart from the rest. That's competition in a nutshell.  For a much more in depth look at the issue, I urge you to read John Gruber's article on the issue at Daring Fireball. A link has been provided at the bottom of this article.    Related Links      urlLink Dashboard vs. Konfabulator     urlLink Dashboard     urlLink Konfabulator

      I've decided to publish an essay I wrote at the end of the school year about downloading music. Please note that I am by no means forcing my opinion on anyone, I am merely stating it. You're welcome to provide criticism if you see it fit. Of course, no one reads this thing anyway.  I received an A/A- on this essay, which is roughly a 93%. My teacher recommended I publish it to my local paper, but I did not believe it to be that good. The thesis still needs some work, bare this in mind. And so...   The Problem (and Solution) with Downloading Music A report by Galen Wiley  	Have you ever stolen something? With the exception of the occasional pen swap at the post office, most people, when presented with this question, would say “no”. In this modern day and age, however, stealing has transformed from a legal taboo to a daily activity. A nationwide survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project revealed that over 18 million people steal copyrighted music files from the internet every day, and many don’t even know its illegal. Despite its growing popularity and overall convenience, downloading music illegally off the internet has become a major controversy in the world right now, both morally and economically. 	 Why do people steal music? To make it simple, the results are instant, the act is private, and most importantly, it’s free. Honest customers can get in their cars, drive to the nearest record store, and spend anywhere from $10-$20 on a CD. While conventional CD purchase remains the morally correct way to obtain music, it has become too inconvenient for today’s standards of living, eating up as much time as it is our wallets. The trip back and forth between the record store can be a time-consuming manner, and more often than not, a CD will usually include only a few choice tracks that a customer is actually interested in listening to. In contrast, downloading music is nearly instant; its done at the home, and users get exactly what they haven’t paid for. This advantage, however, comes at the cost of one’s values. Downloading music one hasn’t purchased is undeniably stealing, but there’s a huge difference between physically stealing something from a Borders and “obtaining” a digital file from a global network. The former has risks, while the latter, provided the user refrains from “sharing” the file with others, does not.  	Nothing, however, has managed to synthesize the legitimacy of regular music purchases with the convenience of illegal services. Nothing, that is, until now. Legal music download services are making their way to the digital lifestyle, and everyone from Apple Computer to Walmart wants a piece of the profits. The concepts of services such as Apple’s iTunes Music Store and Sony’s “Connect” are similar to illegal downloads in that users are given a wide selection of music to choose from (with the same instant gratification), but different in that one must pay for their downloads. Fortunately, users have choices. A customer can purchase full albums for $9.99 or individual tracks from an album for only $0.99 a piece. Rather than paying $16.99 for a new CD at a record store, the user can pay only $0.99 for the one song and end up saving a lot of money. In addition, legal download services compete directly with illegal downloads by offering superior download speeds, better encoding quality, and exclusive tracks, as well as offering a more conventional way of obtaining music. Most importantly, however, such services offer a similar experience to downloading music from a filesharing network, like Kazaa, but operate completely from within the law. Just like any other music redistributors, online music stores split profits between themselves, the labels, and the artists, only selling music from labels they have negotiated which. Downloading albums and songs online has the exact same validity of physically purchasing an album from Wherehouse or Borders; everyone gets their share, and all sales are legitimate. In only a year of operation, legal download services have made significant strides in the industry, outselling even physical CDs in profits. By combining the convenience of questionable services with the quality and fairness of a commercial purchase, illegal downloading has been cut down significantly.  	While many former digital criminals, who now find it much easier and much more rewarding to get their tunes legally, have switched over to legal downloads, some are still not convinced. Nay-sayers hardly regard legal download services as a compromise between the companies and the customers. Seeking a reason for their activities, so-called “Music activists” argue that those who pay for music support a corrupt industry, like pawns in a one-sided game of chess. These people claim that the major record labels monopolize the airwaves and severely underpay their artists, keeping a large percentage of album profits to themselves. However, these claims are exaggerated: an artist's fortune comes mainly from concerts and promotions; not from album sales. Record companies need money to support the artists, and this money comes from their primary product offering: music CDs. Refusing to purchase music legally is not only stealing, it also inadvertently harms the same artists illegal downloaders thought they were helping.  	The music industry may be treated like a special case, but in reality, it is no different than any other industry. Hypothetically speaking, suppose the consumer base for refrigerators is dissatisfied with the refrigeration industry. Perhaps the company is displacing competitors or charging extra for built-in freezers. Whatever the case may be, the consumers decide to prove a point by breaking in to the local Sears one night and swipe all of the refrigerators. The reseller loses profits, the manufacturer loses profits, and because the reseller can no longer buy refrigerators to sell, the industry falls apart, and eventually, there are no more refrigerators.  	Boycotting the music industry will only lead to further complications as time goes on. There are much more effective ways to make the industry suit its consumers than to simply ignore it ever existed. Everyone can contribute to make the musical industry a healthy one. Customers can let their voices be heard by supporting the artists they want to hear, through album purchases and concerts. Even artists not on the Weekly Top 40 can benefit from fan contributions. Concordantly, artists can form personal fan bases, allowing room for feedback and comments. By bridging the gap between the listeners and the creators, the entire industry benefits. And it is only through such active progression that a genuine satisfaction for all parties—artists, customers, and labels—can be achieved.  	I am by no means a conservative individual. I welcome change wherever it may happen. But in the case of the music industry, file theft is simply not the answer. Instead of avoiding the controversies, get involved in them. Support the services you prefer to use, and the artists you want to hear. We have only just begun to explore what technology can offer to society. By embracing change, who knows what we’ll be able to accomplish next?   The following works have been cited:   1. The state of music downloading and file-sharing online.

      Apple's iTunes Music Store has been out for more than a year now, and as the download count reaches the big 100,000, I thought it suitable to look back at how Apple changed the digital music revolution forever.  It was a simple concept, yet it was something no one had tried before: legal downloads. Before them, music listeners had two options for obtaining music, a) go to the record store and purchase and album, or b) use p2p software like kazaa to illegally obtain an individual song file from someone else on the net. What Apple did was combine the two into something that combined the best of both worlds; the legality of conventional purchase, with the convenience and ease of use of illegal downloads.  But Apple did more than just legal downloads; they integrated legal downloads into their award-winning jukebox software iTunes, something that has yet to be duplicated properly even after a year's time. Since I discovered iTunes 3 during my switch to OS X, the app has always been my music player. I had only a few albums at the time, but I imagine it wouldn't have made much of a difference if I had 100; the ripping process was a snap, and in moments, I was able to listen to my music on my computer in any way I wanted to.  However, when iTunes 4 came around the corner, things changed for everyone. Rip Mix and Burn soon became Rip, Mix, Burn, and Purchase, and I can speak by personal experience that the service has nearly tripled by music collection. And the best part? Everything you need is in iTunes from the get-go.  There are so many things that Apple has done to put themselves ahead in the market. Free downloadable singles every week, for example, allow users to freely purchase a single from an eclectic variety of up and coming indie artists. The recently introduced iMix has stirred up huge success. Publishing an iMix is as easy as creating a playlist, and browsing one is even easier. Radio and record charts give immediate access to what's hot in the industry now and what was hot decades ago. The list really goes on and on again.  Its true, I'm speaking from a Mac user's point of view (I haven't even used Napster 2 yet, arguably iTMS's only real competition), but I feel that what Apple has done is amazing. And so, as it approaches to big 100,000 downloads, I wish iTMS the best in years to follow.    Related Links     urlLink iTunes    urlLink Apple

      Gmail: It's the latest thing out there in the tech scene, and I want it. I want it a lot. What's the deal with Gmail, you ask? Well, unless you've been under a rock for the past month of so, you'd already know by now that its Google's solution to web mail. Fast transfers, an innovative "search" feature that basically eliminates the need for moving messages, a new an innovative conversation view when replying to messages, and to top it off,  1GB  of storage.  What's preventing me from getting gmail? The same thing that's preventing a lot of people... an invite. You see, the service is still in beta stage, and Google likes to keep their consumer base as small as possible. That's why they use invites to gradually accept new members. What happens is, if someone with Gmail uses the service long enough, they have the opportunity to send an invite to a friend to use the service. Now, I have a fair amount of friends who use the service. The problem is, none of them have invites. Well, that or they just hate me and aren't giving me them, but I suspect the former.  There are, of course, other methods to getting a Gmail address. One of the leading alternatives is a website called  Gmail Swap , which allows potential gmail users to offer up all that they can in exchange for a gmail invite. Its worked for probably a few thousand people so far, but the competition is pretty fierce. Not to mention that the place is vulnerable to all sorts of scammers and weirdos. I tried it twice and gave up shortly after.  Then there are the methods based on choice- random number or letter generators. I've actually won one of these, but it's been three days since I sent in my entry, and I suspect something didn't fall through.  So what else can I do, but wait? Oh, woe is me.

         Counting the days down to Halo 2 have been made just a little more bearable.  I've noticed that when I'm using my friend's Macs, they like to scatter icons all over their desktops. Maybe if I had more screen estate, things would be different, but I can't stand seeing cluttered icons on the desktop. I guess I'm just a tightwad like that.

Basically, its an up to date comparison of Windows XP and Mac OS X, covering every topic from the login screen to system tools. The website is also surprisingly unbiased in its methods, something you can't say about a lot of places out there.

      It happens once every year: a new Simpsons DVD is released, and fans everywhere are sent running to the stores in hopes of being the first kid on the block to get their hands on a set. It happened with Seasons 1-3, and it's happening again with Season 4, FOX's latest offering in their Complete Simpsons DVD lineup.  Before we delve into the specifics, lets get one thing out of the way: Season 4, for many Simpsons fans, is arguably the best season ever, surpassing both earlier and later entries. While we're all entitled to our opinions, it generally goes without saying that Season 4 is among the best. I personally feel that in all 22 episodes there isn't a stinker among them. With that said, let's get to the goods.   Content   The Simpsons Complete 4th Season DVD comes with 22, count 'em, 22 full-featured episodes. These episodes include:   Kamp Krusty A Streetcar Named Marge Homer The Heretic Lisa The Beauty Queen Treehouse of Horror III Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie Marge Gets A Job New Kid On The Block Mr. Plow Lisa's First Word Homer's Triple Bypass Marge vs. The Monorail Selma's Choice Brother From The Same Planet I Love Lisa Duffless Last Exit To Springfield So It's Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show The Front Whacking Day Marge In Chains Krusty Gets Kancelled   As I've said before, all of these episodes are of the utmost quality. From classics like  I Love Lisa , where Lisa experiences her first relationship with Ralph Wiggum, to such hidden gems as  Whacking Day , where the town of Springfield is caught up in controversy over an annual snake slaughtering holiday, each and every episode is both written and acted out flawlessly. Even  So It's Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show , the show's first of many clip shows has its charm.  Season four marked a landmark for The Simpsons. At last, everything seemed to just fit. Homer's voice had finally matured to what we hear today, and every character, no matter how minor, had finally found his/her place on the show. Some would say the series went downhill from Season 4, and whether this is true or not, the season remains a top contender, despite its original 1992 release date.  All in all, an excellent season with a perfect balance of episodes.   Video   Video quality on Simpsons DVDs has always surpassed that of regular cable, but when compared to other animated releases, it has fallen surprisingly short. This, however, is most likely due to the fact that previous sets had episodes over 15 years old. With season four, the quality has vastly improved, but this is mainly due to the show's constant evolution over the years.  In a nutshell, you're still getting video quality far superior to what you would find on TV, and in my experience, I haven't noticed any major flaws in the transfer to DVD. Sure, you might encounter a small amount of film artifacts, but nothing that will really affect your experience. Color is solid, lines are sharp, and in the end, its really all about the dialog, isn't it?  For the technology available today, the fourth season's visual quality is just fine, especially considering the fact that each disc has well over 6 episodes; that's over 2.5 hours of footage on one DVD.   Audio   On the technical side, the fourth Simpsons DVD features the industry standard Dolby 5.1 Surround sound for every episode. While I had no way of testing this out on the equipment that is available to me, this feature seems to be a bit of a mixed bag. While its nice to have 5 channels of Simpsons goodness, its not terribly practical either.  Otherwise, sound quality is quite acceptable. Compression is not incredibly apparent, and fans are given a choice of English, Spanish, French, or special commentary audio tracks. More on the commentary later.   Extras   Most would be happy with just the raw episode footage, but FOX knows its fans well, and delivers another wide array of extras for their fourth DVD release. Back of course are everyone's favorite commentary tracks--one for each episode, with stars ranging from Al Jean to Matt Groening himself. Cast members from the show, unlike Season three, are surprisingly scarce, but in my opinion they didn't offer much in the way of new insider information like the show's crew did.  The set introduces some new bonus features as well, such as a multi-angled views showing everything from storyboards to the final product of four of the season's episodes. Also provided are two mini documentaries,  The Cajun Controversy  and  Bush V. Simpson , which give fans an inside look at some of the show's most famous repercussions. There's even a brief introduction by Matt Groening in there, although its basically just a visual version of his letter found on the inside pocket of the set.   Final Thoughts   A wonderful set for a wonderful TV Show, The Simpsons Complete 4th Season DVD set has some of the show's greatest accomplishments, backed up by great extras and superior audio and video quality. You simply can't call yourself a Simpsons fan without owning this set.

      To whom it may concern,  First and foremost, thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to visit my blog. It means a lot to me that others have an interest in what I have to say.  This blog has been created as a place for me to post my thoughts. What will you find here, you ask? Everything from movie reviews to nonsequiturial anecdotes on toenails. What you will  not  find here is deep depressing gothic poetry, personal reflections on my day, or complaints on the day's biology exam. If you want that sort of intimacy, you should try  urlLink LiveJournal  instead.  Without further ado, I implore you to check by often for more rants, raves, and reviews. Thanks for stopping by, and enjoy!  Sincerely, Galen Wiley
