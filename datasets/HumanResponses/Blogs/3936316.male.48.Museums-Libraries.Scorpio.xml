      Confucius said  "What I hear I forget, what I see I remember, what I do I understand" .   There are various updated versions of this, along the lines of "we remember 20% of what we read, 30% of what we hear, 40% of what we see, 50% of what we say, 60% of what we do, and 90% of what we see, hear, say, and do".   Add to that, the different learning styles adopted by people and trainers have a lot to think about!  There's lots of info on the net about  learning styles  - try testing yourself to discover your own learning style.   urlLink  The University of St Thomas  links to several online tests.  If you enjoy taking online tests, take a step further and try the  urlLink BBC's What Kind of Thinker are You?  test.

      An interesting site,  urlLink Library Media & PR  is published by Stephanie Stokes Design.   One of my favourite bits currently appears on the home page - a rundown of "Mickey's 10 Commandments" showing what libraries can learn from Disney about attracting people.  From a conference paper delivered by a Disney executive, the list of commandments covers the basics with a bit of fun.  Number 1 is Know your audience - the others are as simple and although based on common sense, useful as a reminder of what we should be doing.

      I'm just getting my head around e-learning and it appears now need to think about m-learning!  In her latest book, "E-learning and teaching in library and information services", Barbara Allan suggests that "the future of e-learning is going to include m-learning ( mobile learning ) based on handsets such as mobile phones, and increased use of the voice via virtual communication tools".  Facet, 2002, ISBN 1-85604-439-4.

      Here in the NeLH team, we've been experimenting with a  Tablet PC  at training and promotional events.  It's been great fun, not least because it has GPRS - at one exhibition, the network crashed so the PCs on our exhibition stands were more ornamental than useful for a while.  But with our Tablet PC, we could go online and demonstrate all our resources on a handy portable and decent-sized screen.  This week's  urlLink E-Health-Media  includes a write-up by a hospital doctor, using a Tablet PC on the wards.  An interesting development to watch.

      The new buzzword is  agile  - as reported in the latest Library and Information Update (July 03) from CILIP.  The article reports on a TFPL seminar - concluding that we should not be content with offering a support service - as librarians, we should embed ourselves in our organisations - "gatecrashing meetings", "getting involved in other departments' innovations".  The article also emphasises the importance of networks for offering support and help - a reassuring message as we launch DLnet :-)

      Interesting  urlLink  article  in latest D-Lib magazine, reporting on an essay contest on  “The Academic Libraries in 2012” .  This article summarises the entries and concludes with an interesting look at how libraries functioned in 1992, 2002 and how they are imagined to be in 2012.  The conclusions consider how the following might change: information available, access to information, study space, instruction, organisational aspects, computer access in addition to other aspects of delivering library services.

      The Medical Library Association conference features roundtable discussions on issues facing librarians.  See write-ups of the  urlLink  2002 marketing  and  urlLink  training  discussions.  These are a good source of ideas, e.g. making "house calls" to departments and wards; information prescriptions; identifying hooks for attracting users.

      A fun and slightly off topic web site -  urlLink Libraries of the Future  - which asked children to describe what libraries are like now, what they'll be like in 2150, what librarians will be like in 2150 and what they like about using libraries.  Some good answers - e.g. "The librarians will all be robots and have really big brains that know everything!!!!!!!!!!!" - as you'd expect, lots of references to robot librarians and magic libraries.  I'm not sure whether I should be comforted or worried :-)

      Dear All,  I am sure some of you may have heard of it , but this is a super little site http://www.amedeo.com/  There are free e-journals and e-books including one that updates solely on SARS. In addition it currently has 24 subject areas from Infectious Diseases to Substance abuse, that are then broke down into sub-subject groups. The one I particularly use is the Oncology section, which is excellent. I informed Fiona McLean, when she was British Library Health Adviser of the site and she thought it very useful resource.

      According to a news item in the August 2003 edition of CILIP’s  Library and Information Update  (page 5), the  UK is considered the world leader  in open access publishing, thanks to recent deals between Biomed Central and the health (NHS) and education (JISC) sectors.  BioMed Central now has more members in the UK than any other country.  BioMed Central have taken an active role in our DLnet masterclass events over the summer.  If you haven’t been able to make it to an event, take a look at their  urlLink Advocacy Kit , designed to help those of you in the NHS and HE to promote this new service to your users.

      Thanks to all those who took part in our conference call this morning, to help us evaluate the DLnet masterclasses so far.  We talked briefly about people's experiences of ordering NeLH publicity - people were generally happy with the speed of service but often had problems getting the publicity they needed, because it was out of stock.  So, the suggestion is to mail any problems you have directly to us so we can act on them much more quickly (to nelh at nhsia.nhs.uk replacing  at  with  @  - trying to avoid spam!).  More foldouts are on order and will be available shortly.   Finally, a plea to give lots of notice if you are planning a large event or mailing and need lots of publicity.  The more notice we have, the less chance there is of running out as we'll have time to reorder :-)

      Can anyone in the know give any indication when those nice fold-out business cards (ref. 2002-IA-1294) will be available again?  The day after the Birmingham masterclass  I phoned the good people on 08453 660066 to discover there were only THREE fold-outs available. They said more were on the way. I phoned again this morning and was told there weren't any [someone obviously snapped up those three pretty d*mn quick!], that they had no idea when, or indeed whether, there would ever be any more, because they just sent them out and weren't responsible for stocking them up.   I don't think this creates a particularly favourable impression.   Happy Friday!  Helga Perry Systems Librarian Cheltenham General Hospital

      At the DLnet masterclass in Manchester on Tuesday, the group came up with a whole load of useful tips for running events.  The Top Tip, voted as the favourite, appears as this week's DLnet Tip of the Week:   Make time to keep up-to-date yourself  which came from Kieran's group  The close runner up (just 2 votes in it!) was to  Make Training Focused  - that is, to know what people need to get out of it, which came from C Powell's group  Here are all the tips by category:   Content   from Kieran's group    Reinforce content after training  Check all live links  Evaluate feedback  Have a back up resource  Target content to the audience  Develop a lesson plan  Be flexible  Have fun and interest generators  Nothing is perfect  Plan interaction - communication is a 2-way process  Be honest if you don't know  Deliver in short bite-sized lumps  Make time to keep up to date yourself    Venue   from MP and JR    Trainers can travel - "bringing knowledge to you"  "My place or yours?"  Training : any place, anywhere, anytime  Ready, steady, TRAIN  All you need is a PC and a connection    Equipment   from Louise, Debbie, Helen, John    Going remote?  Check your leads/cables are long enough!  Back up training materials on e.g. Powerpoint rather than rely on live  Test equipment in situ before use  Ensure trainees can use equipment before training - arrange preliminary mouse-handling practice where necessary  Cache web pages before live demos    Materials   from K Turtle's group     Keep plenty of stocks of materials  Reminder sheets for trainees which aren't too cluttered  Make sure materials are up-to-date  Make good use of materials already available via DLnet    Training tips   from C Powell, E Bowen, K Turtle, FF    Make training focused - know what they need to get out of it  Focus by discipline and level of knowledge  Flexible time and location  Be friendly and proactive  Bitesize chunks of knowledge are more memorable  Don't do training on a Friday afternoon!  Use multi-purpose materials e.g. a crib sheet could also be a mouse mat  Put up promotional materials in toilets e.g. flyers on the back of toilet doors    Attracting non-users   from Jane, Angus, Steve, Rhona    Advertise on intranet  Virtual library service  Promote home and office access to services  Keep it simple  Attend department meetings  Work with your IT department  Speak or have a stand at your organisation's induction days for new staff    Promotion   from Gwyneth, Lee, FF    NeLH URL on paper drip mats (i.e. the mats which go between your cup and saucer)  Make clear and obvious link to NeLH from our own web pages  Doorstep staff in the queue for lunch  Effective use of e-mail  Update mousemats  Smile more  Put flyers on doors where staff come in to the library etc  Make sure promotion is timely and specific - relate to current awareness issues  Use a Quiz of the Week  Table flyers in the canteen    Evaluation   from L Jones' and S Beck's group    Evaluation helps the trainee to see if their objectives have been met  Ensure they know you will act on their feedback  Use incentives e.g. fines amnesty or free photocopying if ideas are implemented   More incentives e.g. each evaluation form has a raffle ticket/prize....    Funding   from LHF    Never say no - or almost never!  Talk "their" (i.e. potential funders) language  Prove your worth using evidence and statistics  Know your place in the organisation and refer to goals and to drivers such as CHI visits  Know your finance source  "Sell" your staff

      1. Can I put a poster up (in your resource cupboard/ward library/by your PC/toilet)? 2. Can I give you a copy of Clinical Evidence? 3. Is now a good time to change the wallpaper on your PCs?  4. I am looking for Dr Smith (he has booked a 3 minute library intro) but since you are here Nurse Jones can I tell you about it? 5. Can I tell you about six million quids worth resources you might be missing out on?  When you finish your library intro dont forget to give then a foldout or business card and one for a friend!  -A word to the wise- if people are running around or there are calls of "CAN I HAVE SOME HELP IN HERE - NOW "  it probably isn't convenient just then. Try next door.  And another thing you might surprised how pleased peopleare being given this opportunity.

Here at Bradford, whenever I get a NeLH Update, NICE E-newsletter or other newsletters/updates; they are sent on a selective global e-mail in the Trust to all health and clinician staff. This has proved very popular. In addition, I put a stapled printout on one of our display boards, this proves popular when people are in browse mode in the library.

      I have just had an enquiry which really demonstrates the importance of searching free-text and thesaurus/MeSH for a comprehensive search.  The question was "find evidence of the effect of mobile phones in a clinical environment."  You need to search for  mobile phone as free text  and  cellular phone as thesaurus/MeSH term  or you will miss out on many useful results.  Then, for clinical environment, I went for healthcare facilities, but as a related term searched for electromagnetic fields and equipment failure.  I thought the mobile phone and cellular phone aspect of the question would be useful as an example in a search skills training session.

      At the last two DLnet masterclasses, we've looked at force field analysis in association with change management.  This is a method which identifies the restraining (hindering) forces and the driving (favouring) forces for change.  We've discussed how to "turn down" the restraining forces and "turn up" the driving forces, in relation to promoting evidence-based decision making.    A brief description of force field analysis is given in a recent SDO publication by Valerie Iles and Kim Sutherland,  Managing Change in the NHS: Organisational Change. A Review for Health Care Managers, Professionals and Researchers, National Co-ordinating Centre for NHS Service Delivery and Organisation R&D, 2001 , which is available  urlLink online .

      Dear All  Dont know if this is the correct place for this but the NeLH link to the US guidelines is linking to their old website so you have to wait while it connects to the new site.  Can the link be changed.  Also - any chance we can have  a more sophisticated search mechanism on the UK guidelines search engine like the US one - ours is very limited if you want to do a sophisticated search (and thats all I seem to get asked for)  Happy blogging mates!!

      NeLH has recently recently received the following from Dr Rob McKinty,  GP-PEC member, Sedgefield PCT. It can be freely used when promoting NeLH/ Digital libraries to health professionals.  "I would recommend this site to all GPs nurses and AHPs working in the health service. Personally I have found it very usefull, easy to navigate and the links are good to other sites. I am on our communication sub group of the PCT and have now had feedback from professional colleagues within Sedgefield who have used the site. They all report that it is particularly useful in situations when colleagues want to find a particular protocol NICE guideline or perhaps the evidence base for a form of treatment. Gone are the days when protocols are mislaid or when colleagues complain that they can’t access the information they just have to enter the site and find what they want. The site even has professional groups listed so that all NHS professionals can use it. I know that our nurses in Sedgefield find it particularly useful. I am the mental health lead for our PCT and I was pleased to see a new addition of the mental health specialist library to the site. No doubt the site will develop further and there will be further improvements but my advice to fellow PCTs is to let professional colleagues be aware of the site and its potential. I think it is great."

Tips for planning training  These tips related to planning for your trainees' needs....  - Find out as much as you can about users and what interests them - Train people with common interests so the session can be tailored - Ensure learners have basic IT skills - Learn your topic well beforehand  ...and for possible mishaps:  - Check any databases/resources beforehand to make sure they are working and haven't changed since you last used them - Check suitability of the venue before training - When training at an external site after hours check that the switchboard does not bar outside calls – I checked everything during working hours and didn’t imagine we wouldn’t get an outside line after 5pm (Diane Thompson) - Check all the technology works beforehand – check for double bookings of rooms, machines etc – and check connections work - Ensure that user accounts are set up in advance for training using licensed resources - Make sure software versions are compatible - Beware live internet demos– have an offline back up or alternative activity just in case - Allow extra time for travel  A key message was that trainers have to be flexible.   Tips for designing training  Think clearly about what you are trying to achieve - some ideas:  - Set clear learning objectives and/or aims for the session - Have very defined course pre-requisites - Make sure trainees know purpose of training before they come and ask them to think of their goals before arriving - Never overestimate trainees’ knowledge and skills - Don’t try to show people too many resources – concentrate on key resources - Contextualise as far as possible (Kay Moore) - Keep training materials up to date - remember to check any exercises and search strategies - Display basic tips on literature searching on your website or near computers (L Ristic) - Display a Hierarchy of resources of evidence card/leaflet next to computers (L Ristic) - Allow time for reflection (Kay Moore)   Tips for delivering training  A key message is to focus on the trainee(s):  - Don’t give out too much paper - Use "bribery" – e.g. food, drinks - Assess what trainers have learned to keep them interested - Get feedback from your learners - Design quick reference cards to hand out - Keep it brief - Use graphics in presentations - Use humour - Make instructions for breakout groups very clear - Keep slides clear – not too much text

      Having run today's event at a less-than-swish hotel, my tip for running events would be always check your venue before the day.  Think of it in the same way as buying or renting a house - go see what it's like but think things through like how convenient it is for parking, public transport.  Think about when you're going to be there, for example, how will it operate out of hours?  You may have examples where even the best planning couldn't prepare you for unforeseen events.  But having aged considerably when arriving at our chosen venue, I would highly recommend a visit and reading documents with very critical eyes to cut down on stress levels!  And if the venue is scheduled to be demolished shortly after your event, take this to be a bad sign :-)

      Here are the  top tips for marketing  suggested by librarians at today's DLnet event in Sheffield - watch out for training tips, to be posted tomorrow:  - persevere and use every opportunity to promote yourself and your service (anonymous) - go for visual impact - use promotional tools such as leaflets and posters as well as the odd freebie (anonymous) - try to reach out to as many people as possible at the same time, through regular bulletins for example (anonymous) - go to the dining rooms in your organisation - you'll find most people there at some point! (anonymous) - focus on the "what's in it for me" elements to sell your service to health professionals (Kay Moore) - draw attention to information by means of an eyecatching unexpected word or phrase e.g. I use NeLH  ASK  me why stickers (anonymous) - Make use of Head of Clinical Department secretaries email lists for important messages (Sarah Sutton) - Update publicity for resources (e.g. Cochrane Library) the same time as the resources themselves are updated (anonymous) - Timing is everything (anonymous) - Get out and meet people (anonymous)  The DLnet events are designed to get librarians sharing ideas and experiences of training and marketing, with an emphasis on reaching beyond the library walls.  Not always easy given the time constraints most librarians face, and that's where we hope the sharing of tips and tricks will help.

      The summer issue of Library and Information Research features a rundown of current and completed  urlLink research in the UK's library schools .  I suspect there are some gaps but it's interesting to see the range of work underway - quite a few related to health, digital libraries, user needs/behaviour/experiences.

      A useful resource on outcomes evaluation -  urlLink Putting Outcome Evaluation in Context: A Toolkit  will help you to identify how your library service contributes to your organisation.  This resource is intended for use to evaluate all types of library service but will obviously be a useful tool for evaluating training provision.    Funded by a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and led by researchers at University of Michigan and University of Washington.  The Toolkit provides 4 steps:  Step 1 -  additional information and resources to help you prepare for evaluation  Step 2 - data collection tips and techniques including sample instruments  Step 3 - help on analysing the data you collect  Step 4 - using the information you collect and analyse, including how to plan and present your ideas

      EAHIL, European Assoc of Health Information and Libraries, held a workshop in Oslo last month.  A  urlLink presentation by Peter Morgan  focused on the use of PDAs, giving a useful insight into how PDAs are and may be used.  Peter also points to the  urlLink Handhelds for Doctors  web site, which accompanies a new book by Mohammad Al-Ubaydli.  The  urlLink EAHIL workshop proceedings  are worth a look - a range of presentations including one on training the trainers (which I'm pleased to say mentions DLnet!) and one on integrating information literacy into the curriculum.

      On  urlLink 19 June  I referred to a study about students using Google.  Jakob Neilsen's  urlLink latest Alertbox  gives an insight into why it's so popular.  Neilsen talks about  information foraging : "The easier it is to find places with good information, the less time users will spend visiting any individual website. This is one of many conclusions that follow from analyzing how people optimize their behavior in online information systems."

       urlLink Free Pint  reported on the recent  Special Libraries Association  conference in New York - some of my favourite snippets from their daily reports:   urlLink   Day 1 “Top tip for information professionals - develop and practice a three-minute  elevator speech  encompassing what it is you and your department do, and why you justify investment when caught in a lift with your Director or CEO?” Something we've been practising at DLnet masterclasses.   urlLink Day 2  -  “there has never been a more vital time for information professionals to aggressively publicise their knowledge of the sheer range of information choices, sources and services out there.”  “Call me an information Professional, call me a librarian, call me a web guru. Whatever. Just call me” – Gary Price talking about the L word   urlLink Day 3  - a round up of latest technology to watch out for – VERY interesting!

      Just to let you know that Eduserve, our service provider, has had major network problems. The library was off line for about 16 hours. An alert email message was sent all dlnet reps.  In future training events you may have to field questions about this extended downtime period. Our actions following this incident will be:  Changing over to a new Interent connection (which was planned ) which will eliminate some of the problems we have had in restoring service and we will be thoroughly reviewing our current arrangements with Eduserve. .   If issues do arise we would be ver grateful if you would please pass on apologies our to users. Thanks Nick

      Jakob Neilsen's Alertbox is geared around usability issues but sometimes features more general advice.  Earlier this month, Neilsen warned of the dangers of  urlLink "information pollution" .  Although Neilsen is talking about all sorts of information, the message is worth remembering :  Excessive word count and worthless details are making it harder for people to extract useful information. The more you say, the more people tune out your message .  And applies to the kinds of information we put out e.g. user guides, signage, publicity.  The  urlLink latest Alertbox  is also interesting : Mobile Devices: One Generation From Useful.  The message is  New mobile devices show a huge improvement over previous generations, but they're still not good enough to score a real win. To get there, we need both PC-integrated applications and specialized mobile services rather than repurposed website content.

      Well, seeing as this topic was my idea, it's only fair I should kick off some discussion....!  I've been searching around, looking for snippets of information on the value of libraries - here's some of the stuff I found - I'm sure there's lots out there:  Articles   Eileen G. Abels, Keith W. Cogdill, and Lisl Zach. The contributions of library and information services to hospitals and academic health sciences centers: a preliminary taxonomy,  J Med Libr Assoc , 2002 July; 90 (3): 276–284  T. Scott Plutchak. Determining value,  J Med Libr Assoc , 2002 July; 90 (3): 273–275  Carol S. Scherrer and Susan Jacobson. New measures for new roles: defining and measuring the current practices of health sciences librarians,  J Med Libr Assoc , 2002 April; 90 (2): 164–172.  Patrick O'Connor. Determining the impact of health library services on patient care: a review of the literature,  Health Inf & Libs Jnl,  19 (1), March 2002, 1-13.  Web-based bits:   the  urlLink Medical Library Association  have a short page on value but the research quoted is early 1990s/late 1980s  the National Network of Libraries of Medicine has an  urlLink Outreach Evaluation Resource Center  which looks at evaluating outreach programmes to measure success  I'd be really interested to hear how librarians are tackling this and to see other useful information you've come across.  Over to you.... :-)

      At one of the DLnet masterclasses, it was suggested we run theme months on this blog.  The idea being that as well as sharing general tips/info as they pop into our heads, that we could also focus on a particular theme every so often.  As we mentioned at the masterclass events, our plan is to produce Little (Online) Books of Marketing and Training.  A theme month could work quite well in pulling together  tips, tricks, know-how, links, information on particular topics  which could translate well to the Little Books.   I thought this was worth trying out - seeing as we have a bank holiday next week, I suggest we run a theme "month" through to the end of September.  If it works, I can pull together the info and put it into one of the Little Books.    My suggested theme for the first month is  Promoting the Value of Libraries .  I picked this one as it's a bit of a difficult one but as has come up time and again, we need to demonstrate why Google etc don't replace libraries.  But there are some hard questions - how do we define value? how can we measure the impact we have within the health community? what information do we have to put forward our case? what information don't we have? who do we need to target? and lots more.... The emphasis here is on promoting the library service as a valued part of the organisation so the focus is more on defining/measuring/communicating value than on promotion in general.  So, fellow DLnet bloggers, what are your experiences?      What useful information have you come across on measuring value and outcomes?  Do you have any tips or know-how to share?  Have you any thoughts about what works and what doesn't work?  Any suggestions on how best to communicate our value?    Share your thoughts, info, know-how and comments  via this blog and we'll summarise at the end of September.

      Following on from the lesson plans developed by the NeLH team and promoted at the Masterclasses, I have set up   Ten Minute Training    sessions which can be slotted into a GP appointment.  It works very well and the response has been very good.  I spend a couple of minutes demonstrating local library resources and then spend the majority of the time on the NeLH site.  I tell everyone about Hitting the Headlines and the NeLH Search Facility.  Then I make it more relevant to individual professions, so for GPs, I show them Prodigy and Clinical Evidence, for community nurses I show them the professional portal, care pathways database and BNF, for physiotherapists I show them the professional portal, PEDRO database and the Allied Health Bulletin on the DOH site.  I also have a session for practice managers and PALS.  When I leave, I make sure they have all my contact details and information on other training available.

      I've had quite a few people booking training sessions way in advance due to holidays or night shifts etc.  and found it easier to send a reminder about the training session a few days before through the internal post, than chase them via telephone when they are busy dealing with patients.  I have found the nelh external postcards useful tools to do this as they look really professional and don't need an envelope, so i just write on the date, time and session they have booked in on and stick it in the post!! So not only am I making sure they remember the training but promoting nelh at the same time!!

      I came across  urlLink an article  in  Marketing Library Services , which usually makes interesting reading tho' not all contents are available in full text online.  This reports on a conference of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) and points to some very useful resources on the ACRL web site:  - the  urlLink @ Your Library toolkit  for  marketing  academic and research libraries  - from the  urlLink same page , a whole range of useful bits and bobs, such as  slogans  you can use,  case studies , 100 Ways to  Reach your Faculty , lots of stuff about  advocacy , useful links and more  - a growing  urlLink best practices page  - only a handful of examples yet but an interesting way of  sharing ideas   - documentation about  urlLink strategic marketing  from 3M, including how to plan, using the  Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action  (AIDA) model

      Interesting  urlLink article ,  Information literacy - is it worth the investment? , in Australian Academic and Research Libraries.  About information literacy in an academic library.  Not related to health but interesting as the authors do go into detail about the costs and staff time involved in delivering a curriculum-based programme.  The same journal issue also includes an  urlLink article  by Asher, discussing the different roles that librarians and academics play in information literacy:  “The librarian can change a life for the better every day by opening a door for a student to a new piece of knowledge. The academic can help the student interpret it. Both of these jobs are important. Both professions teach. But they work best separately. Erasing the boundaries that keep them separate weakens their strength.”

      Well congratulations everyone, you have really got out there and taken advantage of the NeLH literature (over 10, 000 fold outs have been supplied to you ). As has been pointed out it is hard keeping stocks in place! Just to let you know that Fold outs (1294) are back in and are now prepacked in "outers" for ease of storage.

      As many of you know whenever I get an opportunity to talk about NeLH I jump at it -occasionally literally . Perhaps one of the most unplanned occurred  last Thursday . As I got on to the Tube at Piccadilly Circus I tripped and trod on a young ladies open toed sandals. After profuse apologies ( and she insisting I had merely kicked her) we got chatting ( the train was packed!) -she was from Finland [Leicester Square], we told each other some European jokes - Finnish is Swedish spoken under water ,  Dutch is German spoken underwater etc etc )  [Covent Garden] She lived in Croydon  [Holborn]..she worked at  Great Ormond Street in ITU   Ah ha  .. had she  heard you of NeLH YES she had!  -she used it often ..had she used child health / hitting the headlines/ nurse portal   NO she hadn't! [Russells Sq] She left the train here, as GOS is just round the corner. Was that spring in her step an urgency to get immediately  back online or making a limp for it while she still had a chance?

       Sales patter that works?   I think it would be useful to have a training event on the best ways of marketing the NeLH. It would be useful to have a very practical based session whereby we maybe had a bit of marketing theory but where the majority of time was devoted to practical exercises - getting into small groups and working out ways of verbally selling ideas to then present them to the rest of the group - it would be fun and it would increase confidence to verbally market an idea, especially to more senior hospital staff who are sometimes reluctant to see the relevance of new e-resources.  We all have the written bumpf, which fills a publicity niche but verbally selling something needs different language altogether to that which is written in flyers and such like. Imagine we are selling double glazing on the phone - we could all do to come up with sales patter that works. How to market Clinical Evidence in an attractive way?  If anyone has any patter that works, please do share!    Zoë Debenham, Royal Shrewsbury Hospitals NHS Trust

       More aggressive marketing techniques needed?   To market our training, we are currently trying mail shots to specific individuals in the Trust - Consultant Education Leads; specialist nurses and senior sisters. In the mailing pack is a letter marketing our training, a training prospectus and an expression of interest slip. If they send the slip back expressing interest in training, either for themselves or their staff, we will contact them. We're hoping that this more aggressive style of marketing, targetting specific people will be more effective than simply posting flyers around, advertising via our website (which relies on staff actually looking at it and doesn't target the staff who never use the Library) etc. So we will see if it works - we'll report back if it's successful...here's hoping...

      Whilst sorting through various piles of paper which have appeared over the year, I came across this from the MLA conference:  Poster presentation:  Theme of the month marketing  (doesn't appear to be on the  urlLink conference website  yet) From University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center - Dallas, explains how library staff felt marketing of multiple products resulted in "a disorganized Library appearance" and "diluting the messages sent to our clients".  They then came up with the idea of themed marketing, focusing on one product or service each month, e.g. new library home page, OVID Online, PDAs etc.  They cut down on the number of displays and standardised the format of materials.  No information given, though, on impact this had.  Maybe other DLnet bloggers can suggest their tried and tested approaches to effective marketing?  What impact did your innovations have?

      Last week following the amalgamation of two libraries and the move to a new hospital earlier this year we decided to organise a week of events to relaunch the service and promote ourselves to our users - we serve 7 organisations: the local mental health trust and the 6 Berkshire PCT's.  The highlight of the week was to be the Nelh cyber cafe.  I had done lots of publicity for the week - written to the senior partner and practice manager of every GP practice in Berkshire, sent out posters to all the NHS sites, got something on front page of Berks intranet, sent out individual invitations to all board members and 'directors' and done an 'All sites' email (this earned me a ticking off by the Head of IT).  There was free tea and coffee and a prize quiz.  The turn out was rather disappointing, but those who came experienced quality - rather than drop in training sessions with lots of people we were able to do one-to-one sessions.  On the day of the Nelh cyber cafe we put posters wherever we could (its a PFI building so painted walls are out of bounds!) and waited ...  The first telephone training session consisted mainly of librarians so drastic action was needed.  Off we went round the wards - Nick was not perturbed by the fact that it is a psychiatric hospital and the staff were receptive and seemed pleased that we'd made the effort.  After lunch we visited the local PCT HQ - we did have to arrange a guide as visitors are not allowed to wander around unaccompanied.  Those we met were receptive and promised to try the telephone training - even one public health consultant (who I later discovered is a techno-phobe) having originally said he wasn't interested then emerged from his office to find out more.  We then moved on to the local GP and palliative care units - again the staff were pleased to see us and were receptive to hearing about Nelh and having a go at the telephone training - we asked them to tell the night staff so Nick wouldn't be talking to himself!  When we returned things had livened up, Nelh tours were being given and the laptops receiving some use.  Lured perhaps by free Danish pastries!  We showed Nelh to many staff who had not heard of it before or been too scared to use it - they were all impressed and enthused.  Hopefully the consultant who uses Google to find information will switch her allegiance to Nelh now ...  For Nelh awareness week we will be getting out and about (armed with lots of literature) and visiting GP practices/PCT HQ's and anywhere else that has a concentration of our users.

      I came across this  urlLink interview  with Ethel Salonen, President of  urlLink Special Libraries Association , via the CILIP Weekly Information Update.  Here are a couple of snippets, which although focused on a library in the private sector, most are relevant to a health setting too:   What advice would you give to a librarian who is having difficulties providing additional value to their organizations?  We used to say "If you can't change the people….change the people." Meaning, if you are unhappy with your current job, then look for another one. That is easier said than done during these difficult economic times. Whenever I am asked this question, I always ask the person:    Are you totally aware of the business needs of their clients?   Are the products and services you currently provide even being utilized by their clients?   Are there daily tasks that can be eliminated so that your time is freed up to really work on value-added projects?   Do you have lunch with the key personnel in your company?   Do you attend seminars that may be given in your organization?   Are you located near your major constituents?   Many of these questions are difficult to answer and some answers are not pleasant to hear. What a librarian may have to do is to totally re-evaluate the role they currently occupy in the company and re-invent themselves. Solo librarians, the ones who manage an information centre as the sole information professional, have learned to minimize their administrative tasks and concentrate on the assignments that meet the business need of the organization. Once you have identified the client's need, developed the product/service that meets the need, delivered it on schedule, and the client finds it useful, then your value has been demonstrated. We all need to remember that we are a commodity and that every day is a new sales opportunity to sell this commodity - our value!    How would you like the role of a librarian viewed within a corporation?  In the June 2003 issue of SLA's publication Information Outlook is an article by Stephen Abram entitled "e-Sustainability - the Amazing and True Story of Flavius Josephus." The story is absorbing and makes one realize the many issues surrounding sustainability, preservation and very long-term access to information. It is the final sentence from this article that I would like to repeat here:  Knowledge does not persist without librarians.  Librarians are the information resource experts who collect, analyze, evaluate, package and disseminate information. It is this information that drives knowledge and it is this knowledge that drives business decisions. It is the information expertise of the librarian which is vital to the financial health and success of any corporation, as well as any non-profit entity. That is how I would like to see librarians viewed in all organizations.

      On the 25 September, Alison, Caroline (Papi) and myself went down to Prospect Park Hospital in Reading to help out Rowena Perry and colleagues during launch week of their new library.   We carried out teleconference training for hospital and PCT staff while we were there (to test our new 0800 number), for both day and night staff (which is why I am blogging the middle of the night).  We also got out and about talking to staff which was very successful, but we did learn something ..which was to take sufficient literature out with us. Colleagues were so keen to put posters up we soon ran out! So...  When out and about presenting Digital Libraries in your organisation, remember to have lots of literature to give away. Leaving someone without something to look at after you have spent time with them is a missed opportunity.   Well time for bed!

      I went to a study day on Evidence-Based Librarianship yesterday at the Kings Fund - designed to give UK librarians a flavour of the EBL conference held earlier this year in Canada.  A very interesting and inspiring day - and not just because NeLH sponsored it ;-)  Find out more about EBL at  urlLink www.eblib.net  which links to some of the presentations from the EBL conference.  One paper which is particularly interesting is from Alison Brettle, who conducted a systematic review into  evaluation methods in training .  Alison recently published an article on this in  urlLink Health Information and Libraries Journal .

      ...if you press B or W on the keyboard to get a blank black or white screen during your presentation, you need to know how to make your presentation reappear when you're ready again...  Not difficult - press  B  or  W  on your keyboard again and your slides will reappear, as if by magic!

      Delegates at the London DLnet masterclasses were asked to share their marketing and training tips.  Here they are...   Marketing tips    Tell them you can help with CHI reports and help them meet their targets  Use email to cascade messages - use NHS mail directory to find people  Use notice boards and event stands  Use the intranet to disseminate messages  Place flyers at conspicuous points  Keep promotion simple - not listing all services  Work with library champions and make sure they have the information they need  Use postcards (internal and external)  Use a service evaluation survey as a platform for promoting services and resources  Use or develop your own bulletin/newsletter  Purchase pens to give away in libraries, showing local library contact details  Keep re-inforcing the message  Maintain contact with users - email, intranet links, phone, physical presence  Keep promotion relevant to people  Have chocolates/sweets on your stand   Exploit word of mouth - break through to a group of professionals who will then pass information to colleagues  Put up posters  Set up local email discussion lists  Change home pages of PCs to NeLH  Use the NeLH toolbar on intranet and internet sites  Promotional materials need to look professionally produced  Catch them young i.e. students, new professionals  Use local inductions - campaign for a regular library slot  Don't assume everyone knows you're there and what you can do  Have a library stand at key events  Run a week of special events with activities, inviting senior managers  Blanket leafleting  Develop a coherent style so that library materials are recognisable and consistent  Every time a book is issued, give away a bookmark inside it  Use colour in promotional materials where possible  Use regional/national initiatives to grab attention e.g. NeLH Awareness Week  Attend meetings so messages are cascaded through organisation  Use current awareness to promote value of library  Run competitions with nice prizes e.g. champagne  Change screensavers in your organisation to display library messages  Walk around the organisation to meet new people, especially in clinical environments  Don't be afraid to try to be funny - often, humour helps where there are problems  Plug into existing events e.g. open days, conferences, training, meetings where you have a captive audience  Be visible - get out of the library from time to time  Always be helpful when you are approached  Take any opportunity to give your 10 second/3 minute pitch    Training tips    Bite your lip - give people a chance to find their own way round and get their brain going  Ask your audience what they want to get out of the session  Strongly encourage people to 'play' with a system to consolidate their skills  When preparing materials, think from the users' point of view and avoid jargon like the plague - even words like 'reserves', 'indexes', 'citations' are not necessarily obvious in their meaning to non-librarians  If time is short, introduce 1 resource that doesn't need a password which has an easy to remember website  Go to them - don't expect them to come to you  Find out their mouse and keyboard skills in advance  Understand the training environment and users needs e.g. not everyone has good IT links  Customise to level, time, place, individual, group  Piggy back on other events  Plan for all eventualities   Make sure people know what learning objectives are before coming on course  Use different methodologies - demos, hands on, handouts, presentations....  Start with an icebreaker  Know your audience  Sometimes you get a better response from single discipline groups than multidisciplinary groups  Have examples ready but ask for suggestions to keep their interest  Ask for specialist interests in advance so you can  plan the session  Offer follow ups - 1 to 1 or specific support  Take the NeLH tour  If you can spare the staff, work with 2 trainers - to vary the voice and ways of explaining  Offer tips for how to answer pre-set questions  Demonstrate full text access to electronic journals  Give people an exercise - not a subject of their choice so they focus on the process rather than the results  Avoid jargon, be clear  Include humour!  Include simple key messages  Give your audience realistic expectations  Find the right balance in terms of time and don't over-run  Try an informal quiz at the end  Keep groups small and offer 1 to 1 training if possible  Keep the general atmosphere informal  Get participants to introduce themselves  Be frivolous to some extent, to wake people up, helps them to pay attention  Avoid overloading people with too much information  Keep sessions short and simple  Offer to provide training wherever, whenever and however required  Explain that quick and dirty searching is perfectly acceptable but this is all it is - introduce generic principles of good searching  Choose training examples that are directly relevant to an information need that has recently cropped up  Workbooks allow your audience to work at their own pace  Allow for plenty of hands-on if possible and lots of interaction  Have Powerpoint slides uploaded to internet so that users can click on the links to find resources  When demonstrating a search technique, e.g. boolean, tell people they can use it in other systems and interfaces too, though perhaps in a different way  Demonstrate a range of resources, not just the 'usual'  Work in time for consolidation at the end of the session to make sure they've learned  Ensure training room is set up as you want it before people arrive  Encourage users to adjust searches for different databases  Use handouts for reference and follow up contact details for support  Have a CD-ROM back up of your presentation

      At the DLnet masterclass in Newcastle last Thursday, delegates brainstormed some ideas on how best to promote the value of library services.  Here's what they came up with:  Some of the  issues :   We should think of ourselves as important professionals  We need to identify the 'champion' for each user group  When resources fail, people are quick to complain therefore must be valued  We need to support practice, not just courses  Maintaining awareness of traditional library resources  How do you promote to remote users?  Hard to know who is using which resources therefore hard to plan promotion  Get rid of negative messages - the skeleton must go!    Key messages  to communicate:   Libraries are for life, not just for learning  Half an hour in your library will save you hours of your valuable time  We are a starting point for educational process  We signpost people to the right direction  Importance of libraries for continuing professional development  Promoting best evidence  Use libraries as the first port of call to find information as 'we have the skills'  Ask what your library can do for you    Tools  we can use:   Be a member of appropriate committees and groups  Become visible - walk around the hospital  Ask to attend departmental meetings  Be proactive around your organisation's priorities and delivery areas  Publicise our successes  Adopting KM principles - PUSH rather than PULL  Highlight clinical governance issues e.g. in CHI reviews  Target line managers especially in relation to professional development  Facilitate learning events in key delivery areas  Visits to the users' workplaces  Newsletters  Global email  Hosting mailing lists for clinicians  Tasteful publicity (more relevant)  Library stands  Current awareness services  Eye-catching internet access  User needs analysis  Access into clinicians' training  NHSU induction  Persistence

      At the DLnet masterclasses, we've talked about planning a good sales pitch so you have a clear and simple message to tell people when you meet them.  Here are some suggestions which I've come across:  The idea of the  3-minute elevator speech  is discussed by Judith Seiss in her book,  The Visible Librarian (ISBN 0 8389 0848 9):  "Often you will have an impromptu opportunity to market your library,  such as finding yourself in the elevator with someone you want to impress.  Have a prepared 'elevator speech' that has a beginning (to introduce yourself), a middle (the pitch) and an end (to request action, a meeting or a visit).  Start with a provocative statement or question such as 'Did you know that 40% of an executive's time is spent looking for information?'"  Seiss also recommends you plan a  30-second commercial , "designed to tell a stranger who you are and what value you can bring him or her".  In a recent  urlLink interview  with Free Pint, Mary Ellen Bates, talks about how she has developed  10-second commercials :  "I have an example of how to explain our profession, in the book I just wrote, Building and Running a Successful Research Business. The example is taken from Paul and Sarah Edwards, gurus for home-based business. They describe a useful formula for developing your ten-second introduction. The template they use is:  'You know how [describe typical clients' information problem]? Well, I [solve problem] by [doing this].'  For example, 'You know how frustrating it is when you spend an hour looking for market research on the Web and never do find what you're really looking for? Well, my company helps you solve business problems by finding information that doesn't even appear on the Web.' [...] I like this formula because it forces me to focus on the benefits I provide to my clients, rather than simply describing what I do, and it keeps the entire description to ten or fifteen seconds."

      DL Net Lapel badges are now available through our order line 08453 660066. Please ask for reference is 2003-IA-1290 when you make your next order for literature.  As has been pointed out in the blog it is irritating to ring the order number and find out there is no stock. Now you can be irritated (without ringing) when you check the stock of an item from the website as you can automatically do so now.  urlLink www.nelh.nhs.uk/publicity     To prevent further irritation I have ordered larger quantities of literature especially for the run up to Awareness Week. However, where you see stocks are low please order carefully. Currently stocks of 1338 are running down prior to a large order of its updated replacement (very similar but themed with the magnifying glass logo and with a space for an Avery label in right bottom corner to personalise to your library). These new leaflets will be delivered in outers of 50  which we hope you make it easier for you to manage promotional literature.

      For anyone who doesn't do a lot of training or presenting, and is planning on doing some in awareness week, but feeling a little nervous about it, here are a couple of nice quotes from a collection at  urlLink TrainingZone :  "I can never remember being afraid of an audience. If the audience could do better, they'd be up here on stage and I'd be out there watching them." Ethel Merman, US singer, actress (1909-1984)  "It's all right to have butterflies in your stomach. Just get them to fly in formation." Rob Gilbert, Australian sociologist   You can pick up more quotes on a whole range of topics to do with training from the  urlLink TrainingZone pages .

      A big thank you to Siobhan Whitby from the Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic & District Hospital in Shropshire - she's had a fiddle with the original NeLH Desktop Wallpaper and come up with an Awareness Week version.  You can get it from the  urlLink Publicity  pages - scroll down to near the bottom of the page, and then follow the instructions for downloading it onto your computers.  Siobahn's going to try sweet-talking her IT department into setting the wallpaper on all the computers in the trust - if you can get your own IT department to help, that's a very quick way of spreading the word to lots of people.

      This year is going to be a phenominal year for Digital Libraries if the amount of interest in Awareness Week and the amount of promotional literature that we are supplying is any judge.  In the last two weeks alone we have sent out over 35 000 items. This is a huge demand and we are running to keep up. As expected monitor clips have proved attractive and as of now we have dropped to below a thousand..we wont be restocking for a while. However, pencils are destined to arrive next week and we should have enough to last us till AW at least. New stocks of A1 posters will shortly arrive as will a restock of the A3/A4 poster. 18000 internal envelopes dissappeared overnight and we are finishing off the re-order  today and negotiating a delivery date.  Strangely the large AW stickers have ..stuck ..in our warehouse. Please order before they go out of date!!  The idea behind these is to attach to existing literature and triangular displays.  Talking of the giant toblerones they are also going fast ..every library  should have two (at least)!!  urlLink www.nelh.nhs.uk/publicity    Thanks for all your help  Nick

      Elephants...grey elephants, grey elephants (not pink) everywhere. We are just about to blitz our Trust from all angles. Leaflets with payslips, posters, Intranet postings of posters and a programme of our activities during the Week, along with all user emails. I have managed to get spots on our Audit Meeting (which is compulsory attendance for all medical staff) and also the Trust Board Meeting that is conveniently timed during the Week too. For Nurses and AHP's whose meetings were jam packed with agenda items, we just sent a short briefing note about the Week that could be read out at the relevant meeting. We have arranged to have Displays in the main reception of both our sites for the whole Week, manning them for a set time to give out freebies such as bananas with NeLH logo stickers on, sweets and NeLH publicity as well as general library leaflets. We had a Display back in June that was a bit disappointing, but hopefully now that we have great freebies, NeLH toblerone triangles, blue and white balloons, blue and white table covers and stand up leaflet holders to add interest we should make a real impact.

        RLG Shelflife   is a handy publication, reporting once a week on news for information professionals.  The 9 October issue features a couple of interesting snippets:    MORE STRATEGIES TO SURVIVE THE THREAT FROM THE 'NET  An article looking at Marylaine Block's recent book,  Net Effects: How Librarians Can Manage the Unintended Consequences of the Internet .  Block looks at some of the solutions librarians have developed "to survive -- and thrive -- in the Internet environment".     'GOOGLEIZE' LIBRARY SEARCH ENGINES TO APPEAL TO PATRONS  [extract] "In academic libraries nationwide, the same conversation is taking place between librarians who  don't want the interface 'dumbed down' and librarians with usability practice who know that patrons basically want the Google experience," writes library consultant Judy Luther. "It's time for librarians to accept that library users are not interested in being more like us. If we don't understand that the majority of our users are novice searchers who may wish to remain that way, we are missing the opportunity to serve the pragmatic user who is happy with a 'good enough' answer."  You can find RLG Shelflife at  urlLink http://lists2.rlg.org/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?visit=shelflife-from-rlg&id=224862757  - select the issue you want to read.  Also, in this week's   BMJ  , there's an  urlLink article  about the  Cochrane Collaboration  and the debate on whether to accept industry funding for reviews.

      There is an article by Mary C Congleton and Winn Theirl in the September issue of MLA News (sadly, not available for free on the Internet) on internet training.  They give their top tips for " stress-free internet-based training ".   In summary, they advise:   a pre-training interview to discuss details and plan the training  listing equipment needs well in advance  checking Internet access available  scout out the training room e.g. do they have flipcharts?  have a backup in case it all goes pear-shaped  create a portable kit containing extension leads, blu-tack etc  reconfirm with your contact before the day  I particularly like the idea of a portable kit, something I never quite get round to doing so I always end up stealing blu-tack from our Events team.

They are targeting freshers with a campaign "Drink - satisfy your thirst for knowledge", giving away bottled water with the library's URL printed on the label.   There's also an interesting piece by  urlLink Gerry McGovern ,  The age of less gene .  In it, McGovern talks about how we need to  learn to communicate less  - i.e. less long Web pages and shorter and snappier chunks of information: "..we need to stand back and ask whether our communication has become overweight".  So on that note, I'll stop typing now!

      Clinical Evidence Online have developed a  Finding the Evidence Training Pack .  It is very comprehensive and useful.  It contains everything you need to run a Finding the Evidence Workshop including checklist, covering letter to trainees, exercises, evaluation, and trainee's workbook.  You can find it by going to NeLH and clicking on Clinical Evidence.  Under  "What's New This Month?"  there is a heading called   Free EBM training materials  .  It is stored as a WinZip file and you have to register.  NB It didn't work when I selected the  View Trainer Module , so I just went straight for  Download Zipped Word Document , which worked fine.

      Just a line to tell you about the launch of a new web based educational aid for healthcare workers to build their skills in Evidence Based Healthcare. The purpose of the website is to provide comprehensive tutorials about how to access, appraise and apply evidence to everyday practice.  It gives the opportunity to learn (or brush-up on) the skills and techniques of evidence based practice, and work through a case scenario from start to finish. The website enables all healthcare workers to access these skills at any time, particularly when the skills are actually required.  The resource is a collaboration between the Manchester NHS Agency and the Evidence for Population Health Unit, University of Manchester, developed by myself and Dr John Sandars, Lecturer in the Evidence for Population Health Unit and the School of Primary Care at the University of Manchester.    I'd really appreciate your help in 2 ways - publicising the site with your users, and providing feedback to me to improve anything that needs it (as it can be changed and updated easily).  Go to  urlLink www.evidence4u.org.uk  You have to register to get onto the site - click on the Register link, then choose your own username and password, which you can then use each time you want to go to the site. Follow the links for each of the sections.  Thanks in advance for your help - I hope you find the resource useful.

      The new elephant logo for NeLH Awareness Week, can be easily copied and pasted into a label file, providing you with quick and easy labels, which can be stuck onto envelopes, literature searches, anything that goes out to the library members.  The label option which I am using is Avery - L7664 - Diskette.  The logo size can be altered to suit other label options, but be careful of making it too small otherwise you won't be able to read the important message about telephone training.

      At some of the earlier DLnet days, we used case studies, which we collected informally from librarians in early Summer.  These have now been loaded on to the DLnet  urlLink Know How  pages.  The case studies focus on possible solutions to problems associated with  promoting evidence-based information/knowledge for decision-making .  We're thinking about how we might collect case studies and present them in the most helpful way.  In the meantime, these will feed into the Little Book of Marketing, to appear shortly, and the Little Book of Training, to appear a bit later.  If you're having problems accessing  archives  directly from the blog page, links to archives are also available from our DLnet Know How pages - we've just added September's archive.   This may seem like doing the same job twice but following an unexplained incident earlier, it seems the link to June archive is a bit hit and miss.  So to be on the safe side, we're copying archives to DLnet :-)

      WEBMASTRY :  What Google Teaches Us that Has Nothing to Do with Searching  by Gary Price  urlLink http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/nov03/price.shtml  Some snippets:   "I keep asking myself, why as a group, the information professional hasn't seen what Google has done with  word-of-mouth marketing  and begun to use it. It's very inexpensive and, as we know from Google and other companies, can lead to very positive results"   "Google often 'energizes' its word-of-mouth marketing by getting to information  gatekeepers  like journalists, teachers, key members of a company, etc. and demonstrating (or as Mary Ellen Bates puts it, politely "getting in their faces") about what their service offers. Again, doing this costs only time"   "We should do the same and show them that  libraries of 2003  are full of professionals and tools easily used both inside and outside the library building."   "Marketing a training session these days as 'learn how to use library databases' won't work. Instead, title the presentation 'Google Searching and Beyond.' Now, that should lift attendance. So share some Google tricks with them, but then start  demonstrating what you and your library can do  — with blazing speed and clear authority — that Google can't do well or at all.   Worth reading for Gary's  Eight Starting Points,  giving ideas on how to promote library services as more valuable than Google alone.

      The NeLH team were presented with an award today at the CILIP/Emerald Publicity and Public Relations Awards.  We were Highly Commended for  Awareness Week 2002  - great timing as AW03 starts on Monday!  But seriously, this award is to be shared with a whole range of people, without whose contributions, Awareness Week would not have been so successful.  So, as we gear up for AW03 (now I know how Santa Claus feels in the run up to Christmas!), give yourselves a well-earned pat on the back (or even better, glass of something potent) for making last year's campaign a success and for putting so much into this year's Awareness Week ;-)  There were some great winners in the awards - showing creativity and inspiration - more info at  urlLink http://www.cilip.org.uk/news/2003/211103b.html    Enjoy Awareness Week - and don't forget to take lots of photos!

      Angela and I were just practising our teleconferencing earlier today in preparation for delivering our NeLH phone in sessions next week when at the end of the call, we heard a murmuring on the line...turns out a chiropractor had mistakenly tuned in for the NeLH tour thinking it was this week. I explained that we were just practising and to come back next week. Not sure how much he heard of it - hopefully not much! Zoë Debenham

      Nick has asked me to report on our Awareness activities here at Papworth. Our NeLH Awareness events started on 1st November, so we really are having an Awareness month. The hospital held a very successful Research Open Day at which I gave a presentation entitled, "NeLH the Evidence". Over 100 patients, members of the public and health professionals attended the day.   That was followed the next week by a Workforce Development Confederation Stakeholders Day - and as part of the Library display, I went armed with all my NeLH promotional posters, pencils etc. At least I'm warmed up for next week (or exhausted!).........

      From 7 Nov issue of CILIP Vacancies Bulletin : "The Mysterious Case of the Invisible Librarian".  Reports what happened when researchers on recent survey had to chase responses by phone - some switchboard operators didn't even know their organisation had a Library!  They challenge us to make sure the switchboard and reception staff know who we are.  They also quote following figures (tho don't give a reference):   90% of the impression you give of being capable is based on perception  - this breaks down as   30% based on the presentation of your work  30% on the presentation of yourself  30% on being seen to be "doing a good job"  10% on doing a good job  Their conclusion - "This is not to infer that you should spend 90% of your time floating around looking great and not delivering and only devote 10% of your time to doing your job.  But it does mean that you have to be seen - or you may become invisible"  So what can we do to get noticed?  Well, for starters..... urlLink NeLH Awareness Week  is a great opportunity to raise your profile.  As for useful ideas, the  urlLink MLA Communications Toolkit  has some useful tips.  And keep an eye on the  urlLink DLnet pages  and this weblog for more tips'n'tricks.    What strategies have you tried to raise your profile locally?

      Usage of NeLH is at a all time high, thousands more people (50k more visits in Oct) are using it because of your efforts.   Usage is above average at all times of the day..except for between 12 and 7. This would seem to  indicate that our marketing efforts are getting through to day staff, who are in turn converting that effort into a visit during working time. In the case of night staff they may of course be accessing during the day( at home) but they are not doing so at work.   So 1. are they getting the message? 2. are they finding better things to do at night when not caring for patients? 3. is there protected time for night staff to undertake CPD? 4.   Promotion of the night time Phone-In learning Session (PILS)  could be a way of increasing usage to this group. Other suggstions gratefully received.  Nick

      Next in a never ending series we have my summary of some tips from Adrian Dale's  presentation on How to write stories for the press and journalistic layout.  Adrian Dale is the Managing partner, Creatifica.  www.creatifica.com.  Training@Creatifica.com    Need to capture the essence of any message succinctly.  Journalists are taught to write in a ‘V’ shape. Unlike in most education where we write in a diamond shape, starting at the beginning, developing the story and coming to a nail biting conclusion!    In journalistic style , the Headline (no more than 6-8 words for the Times, 3 words for the Sun!) grabs your attention and gives you the essence of the subject.  E.g 'Shock, Horror, Probe!'  The teaser pulls you in to the article and makes you want to read on. E.g 'Find out what really went on when Harry met Sally...' The stand alone summarises the article.  Each paragraph amplifies or illustrates a key part of the stand alone.  The paragraphs are presented in descending order of importance so that the editor can cut the last two paragraphs knowing that the essence the story will remain. Pictures break up the page, attract readers and compensate for bleak stories.  So how would you apply this at work.  All standard web copy could be written in this way.  Content managers could set up text boxes on screen for Headline, teaser, standalone, etc. and expect people to submit copy in this way.

      Hello Just back from the PPRG conference.  Beautiful scenery and nice weather up in the lake district added to the enjoyment.  I am going to post a few things learnt from the conference as I get time.  To kick you off, from the Key note address on Promotion in Perspective by Linda Ashcroft a few tips!   P lan – objectives, marketing strategy  E vents – raise awareness, promotion  R esources.  Make sure that supply can meet demand, if not can be a negative exercise.  Eg Oxford Brookes University held marketing event and gave away apples but they made sure that they could meet the demand that was generated for library services.  Transformer toys were marketed before Christmas but they ran out of toys so people were queuing to get hold of the ones that were available.  S ponsorship.  Make sure that the sponsor ties in with what you are trying to promote.  Eg Threshers off licence sponsored Avon and Somerset police, which sent out the wrong message to drink drivers. Sponsors do like to be associated with good ideas e.g Tesco’s sponsored computers for schools and gained a lot of good publicity.  But make sure that your name is not dominated by the Sponsor e.g. Coronation Street sponsored by Cadburys but everyone is clear who is the sponsor and who is providing the service!  P romote e.g Kew gardens did press release in the Times about a smelly plant and were inundated with new users, staff then talked to them about the other plants that were there  E njoy Success!! Celebrate and publicise your successes and remember that successful partnerships can work again  C ommunication.  Are stakeholders on board?  What about the media?  T iming.  Eg Christmas toys, summer quiet time for news, summer launch  I mage.  Importance of first impressions.  BA strike gave bad impression.  V alue. What is the value of your service to customers?  To advertisers?  E valuate.  Did you meet your objectives

      A bit of a detour from all the AW blogs. In September, Lyn Edmonds and myself won the NeLH competition to spend a week in Lesvos, Greece where we attended the 'libraries without walls' conference. You can read about our experiences by downloading our report from   urlLink www.shelib.nhs.uk/knowledgelibrary/News/news.html  The link to the report is at the bottom of the above page.  Photos taken at the conference are viewable from  urlLink www.cerlim.ac.uk/conf/lww5/conf-photos/index.html  It's just as well that few of you will be able to identify me!  Zoe Debenham

      Thanks to Lucy Anderson and John Addison from the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, we now have a Treasure Hunt added to the  urlLink DLnet Training pages .  And it's not just 1 treasure hunt, but 2! There's a short, 10 question version, which dips people in and out of different resources. And there's a longer version that looks at 10 resources, with 5 or 6 questions per resource.  You can use them as part of your training sessions, as a competition during awareness week, or just to give to new users to get them looking at NeLH.  Hope you find them useful

      Here are just a few ideas that I am using to promote NeLH Awareness Week  •	Copy the NeLH Awareness Week logo, paste it onto address labels and stick them on all your post. •	Attach a NeLH Business Card (with your details) to the monitor clip so that people can see how to use them.  (Incidentally, the monitor clips work well when attached to the bottom of the VDU, as it doesn't block the view, but is still clearly visible). •	Edit your email signature and add the NeLH Awareness Week web address. •	Use the money from your NeLH marketing plan to buy tins of biscuits to distribute to all the practices/departments in your PCT/organisation.  Stick a pretty label with your contact details, on the tin, so that they will always have a reminder of where to go if they need information.  Together with the biscuits, leave some NeLH publicity material, such as internal envelopes, monitor clip and pencils, and literature on NeLH and your library, for them to read.  This is a good way of going out to meet the people you are delivering the service to, so that they can put a face to the name they see on emails and newsletters!   •	Organise a quiz to raise awareness (what does NeLH stand for, what services does your local healthcare library provide, etc), and use money from the NeLH marketing plan to pay for the prize.  I am giving a Christmas hamper as a prize, and hopefully will get someone (Chief Executive) to present it the week before Christmas.

      The Times Online ran a story on Saturday called  urlLink "Brain Drain"  which quotes some interesting stats on information overload:   [...] last year  800 megabytes  of data were produced for every man, woman and child on the planet, double the figure recorded in 1999. And there’s something you didn’t need to know for a start. The quantity of e-mails sent worldwide could have  filled the new-look British Library half a million times over   But the nice bit is the quote about librarians....   For, as the bumper sticker tells us,  if knowledge were power then librarians would rule the world

      NeLH drop-in lunches at Pennine Acute during awareness week were a success. I was overwhelmed by the volume and enthusiasm of staff who attended lunchtime sessions at two of the four library sites.  Favourable comments included a Podiatrist who intended to make the podiatrist portal his homepage and a Consultant who devoted 15 mins of his lunch hour to standing with library staff to convey his personal approbation of NeLH to all and sundry. As one user said "nice sandwiches, shame about the pencils!"

      I used the campaign to offer 4  nights  of training to the staff at the Hospital and discovered how it felt to work from  7.30pm to 7.30am ! I saw a total of 18 people and did a mixture of NeLH training and literature searching. I based myself in the discharge lounge to be central and although tempted to hop onto one of their beds in the early hours managed to find the discipline to catch up on paperwork when not out on wards.   I certainly feel I know a lot more about the hospital after this experience. If anyone would like to hear further details please e-mail me (sue.stevenson@weht.swest.nhs.uk).  Sue Stevenson

      Well I really can say now that I am truly obsessed with NeLH as demonstrated on Friday night.  There I was after the invigorating 2 day workshop ready to tell just about anyone who would listen about the joys of NeLH.  It came about somewhat strangely....  I was sitting in the sauna after being at the gym minding my own business as you do, with one other gentleman in there with me.  Me being a friendly wee soul I started to make small talk, we came onto jobs and low and behold he was an ambulance driver ...and quicker than he could take his towel and run I had cornered him and had sold him on the virtues of NeLH, given him the web address (more like drummed it into him being short of a pen and paper) and offered to give him and his crew one-to-one training when I was back in the office!  Now Nick, you have to admit that definitely stands up to your motorway madness!!

      PRESS RELEASE National electronic Library for Health Launches Child Health and Paediatrics Specialist Library  urlLink http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/childhealth    The NeLH Child Health and Paediatrics Specialist Library was launched today (26 January 2004) in Sheffield. Dr Mark Everard, Consultant Paediatrician at Sheffield Children's Hospital and the clinical lead for the library, said:  “I’m pleased to launch this innovative resource for all health professionals working in child health. The library provides access to a wide range of resources across child health, giving access to the best available evidence.”  The Child Health and Paediatrics Specialist Library has been developed working with many different groups in Child Health. This collaboration has allowed the Specialist Library to index over 1,000 resources at the time of launch.   To coincide with the launch of the Specialist Library a week of promotional activities are taking place throughout the country. An online tour of the Child Health and Paediatrics Specialist Library is also available, with an audio commentary:  urlLink http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/tour/childhealth/childhealth1.asp?script=childhealth&slide=0   Fiona Smith, Paediatric Adviser at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) added: “The library is an excellent resource for all nurses working with children and young people. The electronic mailing list is particularly valuable to alert busy professionals working with children.”  The Library welcomes all feedback to  urlLink childhealth@shef.ac.uk  and encourages you to sign up to their mailing list.

      Using a 'sweets' analogy seems to work quite well. E.g. you are looking for articles about sweets. You want to find articles about all sweets, not just particular ones. If you search by keyword, you’ll have to think of all the names of sweets from fizzy cola cubes and pear drops to aniseed balls and gobstoppers – an impossible task. So instead of doing a keyword search which will only look for the specific words (i.e. sweet names) you type in, you do a subject search in the hope of identifying a term that is used to group all these different types of sweets together.  That’s the general gist anyway, and it seems to click with people.  Zoë Debenham, Royal Shrewsbury Hospital

A total of 44 places (to assure the quality of interaction) will be allocated on a strict geographical basis to ensure initial equity of access.  And don’t worry if you don’t ”make the cut” for FOLIO #1. You will then have an even better chance to participate in one of the 11 other courses, topics soon to be decided by our Curriculum Development Group based on a recent needs analysis, over the next two years.  Enquiries (not applications) to A.Booth@sheffield.ac.uk    Overseas colleagues: We regret that for funding reasons these courses are not available at present to non-residents of the UK.

      One of the tips on DLnet is to link training with national health events. The  urlLink DOH provides a list of health events .  There is also a useful website called  urlLink count me in , which provides details of national events, including a section for  urlLink health events .

      I often have a mixture of people attending my training sessions and find that some spend a few minutes completing exercises and others just don't get to the end.   Rather than have lots of different exercises for when someone finishes early get them to  urlLink tour NeLH resources .   Once they have finished the exercises they can spend a few minutes on a tour as they wait for everyone else to catch up.

      Do you want to train people to become "advanced searchers"? At Pennine Acute we were getting feedback that the introduction to literature searching training sessions were "too basic". A lot of people already know the subject areas of the databases and the difference between freetext and thesaurus searching. How could we develop a more advanced session?  Well we have based it on the popular book,  urlLink How to read a paper . The book has a  urlLink literature searching chapter  outlining common problems searchers have. We translated the problems to meet our needs and guide users through the solutions. Feedback so far has been excellent.

      Our Senior Library Assistant has recently completed the NVQ Level 3 in Library and Information Services. As a 'paraprofessional' in the healthcare library service she wanted something that gave some competency validation for her role. Unfortunately not all areas seem to have this available for their library assistants, but she was lucky to get really good support from a neighbouring region. All paraprofessional library staff should be given the chance to personally develop, to improve and validate their skills and knowledge if they wish, particularly with consideration to 'Agenda for Change'.  The Library has benefitted enormously from her doing the course.  We need to remember that we can learn from everyone.

      We've been having some trouble with emailing very long links to people recently. If they wrap around onto more than one line, then sometimes it's difficult to access the link.  A very useful site is http://tinyurl.com/. It allows you to condense those v long links into much smaller and more manageable urls. As their website says, these URLs will never expire and will not break up in email postings. The website also gives you the option to put the TinyURL link on your browser enabling you to convert links with the click of a button.  Melanie

      Further to the point on tracking training we should bear in mind that the  urlLink Electronic Staff Record  will pay particular attention to skills and training.    This is a direct consequence of the impact of the Knowledge and Skills Framework within  urlLink Agenda for Change .  We need to make sure that full credit is given to people receiving training from librarians.

      Rather than just collect training statistics, it has been suggested to me to keep a record of who has been trained what. This data can be captured in conjunction with a training evaluation form. This means that after a reasonable interval you can contact trainees to see how they are getting on and whether they need any more training. Furthermore, they can be notified early of any developments to a training programme, such as new or more advanced courses. In my organisation, the training department has a broad training database on Access, to which I am able to input who has been on which of my information skills courses. In the future I can use reports to export contact details of interest. This data is more useful than just bald training statistics.

      I'm planning a new training course about full text journals and electronic tables of contents, to help meet the needs of our large numbers of remote users. I'm a bit concerned about users relying on full text rather than doing comprehensive searches in Medline etc. so any participants will have to have had "searching" training before they can attend.   I wanted to say something memorable to warn participants of the dangers of full text bias and my Line Manager mentioned a more evocative name for the concept, "FUTON bias", as proposed by Reinhard Wentz in a letter to the Lancet (Vol. 360, October 19, 2002, p. 1256).   Medpundit, another blog, commented: "Can’t you just see the medical students and junior staff sitting at home on their futons, relaxing to their favourite music or watching television while doing their medical research? Much better than sitting in a stuffy medical library pouring over Index Medicus" (www.medpundit.blogspot.com/2002_10_13_medpundit_archive.html).   So, FUTON bias it is then!  Natasha Davies

      Further to Zoe's contribution, I can confirm what a great course the City and Guilds 7307 is.  I have been a temporary information skills tutor since September 2003 (standing in for someone on maternity leave).  I felt that I needed support, so I took the 7307 Part II.  I took Part I in 1995 and as I needed 30 hours teaching for stage II I could not carry on with it straight after Part I.  When I got this job in September I  had the required 30 hours, so was accepted on the 7307 Part II.  It has been a great help to me, covering lesson plans, teaching and learning strategies, teaching and learning styles, assessment, communication, PowerPoint, etc.  I attended one evening per week and it fed into everything I did in my job.  I have had a wonderful 7 months, both in my work and on the course.  I finish next Monday evening and I would certainly recommend it. Tricia Garvey

      In the first session, I usually spend about 90 minutes training people to use NeLH.  Because there is so much to remember, I have created a table summarising the session, listing the topic covered, and where they can find the answer on NeLH.  For example: * recent health-related articles go to Hitting the Headlines * quick search for evidence and guidelines go to Pilot Search Engine and Guidelines Finder * information to support implementation of National Service Frameworks go to National Service Framework Zones * patient information, diagrams and treatment guidance go to Prodigy * evidence based, full-text articles go to Bandolier * treatment management and diagnosis go to Clinical Evidence Online * filtered search engine go to OMNI * specialist information related to a condition or profession go to Specialist Libraries * further training go to NeLH Tour I cover clinical databases in the second session, because often they aren't familiar with the Internet.  This table is available as an A4 sheet, which they can then display near their computer, as a quick reference chart.  Often they know where everything is during the session, but as soon as you leave them, they get a bit lost, so they seem to find this chart useful.  It also hangs nicely from the NeLH monitor clips!

      To all trainers out there,  Ever considered doing a teaching qualification to enhance your CV and support your training experience? The qualification to do is the City and Guilds 7407 Level 4 Certificate in Further Education Teaching (Stage 1). After Stage 1, you could progress to Stage 2 and then if you're really keen (!),  the CertEd. You would then be qualified to teach in an FE environment. For more information: http://www.city-and-guilds.co.uk  As a first step, you could try contacting a local college to see if they offer the Stage 1 qualification. There are some requirements for Stage 1 (which is a 12 week course) but the vast majority of trainers wouldn't have a probem meeting these. Stage 1 is a basic teaching qualification in its own right and therefore you don't need to progress to Stage 2 or the CertEd if you don't want to. Also, the commitment for Stage 1 isn't huge and the coursework is very manageable.  One thing to note: this does not give you QTS (Qualified Teaching Status) which you need if you want to teach compulsory (pre-16) education. The only way to get QTS is to do a PGCE or equivalent. See: http://www.gtce.org.uk/pdfs/ROUTES_INTO_TEACHING.pdf  Looking forward to my free book?!  Regards, Zoë

For 2 weeks the library staff have included this flyer in any outgoing mail e.g. ILLs & literature search results, and handed them out to users in the library. This has been quite successful and generated more interest in registering for an Athens password and training and even better, it didn't take too much extra effort!

      Here’s your chance to  win  your very own copy of Andrew Booth and Anne Brice’s new book :  Evidence-Based Practice for Information Professionals ….  ….and all you have to do is  blog !  The  first 20 to post  to the DLnet weblog (and it has to be something substantial – “hello” doesn’t count!!) will receive their very own copy of the book.  2 or 3 lines will do – just think of something useful to share with colleagues – it could be an article you’ve come across, an idea you’ve tried during training, tips on marketing, anything which your colleagues might find useful.  Blogging is lots of fun and takes less than 5 minutes so take the plunge if you haven’t already :-)   Of course, you may have mislaid your password since you registered or you may have declined joining the blog so anyone who needs joining up again, get in touch with us and we’ll sort you out asap.  Here’s the blurb about the book you could win:  Evidence-based Practice for Information Professionals: A handbook  Andrew Booth and Anne Brice, editors  Evidence-based practice is a paradigm that originated within healthcare but is rapidly migrating to other fields. It involves applying the results from rigorous research studies to professional practice in order to improve the quality of services to clients. Familiarity with these methods has caused an increasing number of information professionals to turn a critical eye to their own practice. Is it possible to adapt this model to librarianship and information work? To what extent are its skills and techniques transferable to the various areas of professional practice? Is it desirable for information professionals to integrate research findings into their day-to-day decision-making? These and other related issues are discussed in this book, the first to examine this key topic in depth. March 2004; 320pp; hardback; 1-85604-471-8; £44.95 (£35.96 to CILIP Members)  The competition is  open to DLnet Reps only .

      Two months ago the library manager asked me to give a five minute talk on the NeLH to the library committee: the usual mixture of senior health care professionals who are too busy to have heard of the NeLH. As I spoke the manager watched the audience. Afterwards he reported that it was as if the scales had fallen from their eyes. The same day, the Chair of the committee telephoned the Intranet webmaster and demanded that the library be restored to its former prominent position on the front page of the Trust intranet, and that another front page link should be added staright to the NeLH. Both these were added before the end of the day!

      Last month's Information World Review had some interesting bits and bobs:   Beware the march of the Googlistas by David Tebbutt  : "The word is 'marketing'.  It has to become a key part of your life.  Others in the organisation need to know you exist and understand how you can help them.  You have to be in everyone's face, pushing your services, offering talks, influencing the influencers and, perhaps, tipping off every new recruit.  Why not work your way round the organisation, meeting department managers to discover what their information needs are, how they're being satisfied and what value they place on better information?"   "Google has introduced individuals to the world of information.  Capitalise on this now by showing how you can facilitate access to better value information"   Data as pure as spring water by Stephen Arnold  : looks at "stovepiping" (information streams which bypass intermediaries) and RSS feeds   We are the Champions -  interviews with Bob Boiko and Lynne Brindley particularly interesting:   Boiko : "For a start, he believes we should stop using impersonal terms such as 'users' and think instead of 'audiences'.  After all, he says, 'audiences have power - the power to applaud or walk out'.  Brindley : "Lynne Brindley believes 'libraries are no longer the cosy backwaters they once were'.  They are faced with a number of new challenges: they have to remain relevant to their users, must manage and deliver digital resources successfully and must ensure their organisational and leadership skills are up to the challenge."

      In case you missed the announcement earlier this week, Andrew Booth and Graham Walton have arranged for the text of their book, published in 2000, to be made available on the web free of charge.  The announcement says: "We believe that most of the 'how to do it'-type chapters and many of the overviews from this work, now out of print, are still very relevant for health information professionals today. Chapters include:   Health services: a contemporary approach  Health service users of information  Health service libraries  Health service information providers  Consumer health information  Providing direction and management for health library and information services  Identifying users' needs  Making a case  Identifying resources  Organizing information resources  Delivering and accessing resources  Marketing a service  Evaluating information services  Training the users  Formulating the question  Keeping up to date with the knowledge base  This move has been timed to coincide with the publication of our completely new work  Exploiting Knowledge in Health Services  released this month by Facet Publishing. This new work mirrors the structure of its predecessor but covers a completely new range of topics. Chapters of this NEW work include:   Section 1 The context of managing the knowledge base in health services    New structures and principles in health services   The health and social care interface   Clinical governance and National Service Frameworks   Virtual outreach services   National electronic Library for Health   Knowledge Management   Primary care knowledge services   Clinical librarianship   Role of library and information services in supporting learning    Section 2 - Managing the knowledge base     Managing projects   Working collaboratively   Managing change   Developing staff   Providing hybrid information information services   Creating Portals and Gateways   Managing intellectual property    Section 3 - Using the knowledge base effectively: information sources and skills    Accessing the knowledge base   Appraising the Literature   Creating effective web pages   Tapping into sources of funding   Supporting syntheses of the literature   Full details on this new publication and ordering information are  urlLink available online ."

      We've had a passport scheme in Manchester health libraries for some years, but are only now in the process of producing eye-catching literature to hand to potential users. Most libraries in our scheme offer physical access to libraries, PCs etc. Some (us for instance) allow users to enrol on traiing sessions. Very few, as yet, allow external users (you know what I mean) to actually borrow materials, which must be the next step. Speaking as a potential health consumer rather than as a health librarian, I'd find it hard to understand the rationale whereby an NHS could not visist and use  any  library that was convenient. What do others think?

      A regular comment I hear from staff is "I don't work there, didn't know I could use that library".  All libraries in the Avon, Glos and Wiltshire region area have a reciprocal arrangement whereby staff can use any library, regardless of their employing Trust. To complement this we have a Library Services Passport - a nifty little A5 leaflet giving basic contact details for all major NHS libraries in the AGW region. It also details exactly what people can expect access to in terms of services, whether they are AGW NHS staff, NHS from further afield, students on placements etc.   It's useful for both library users and staff as it neatly summarises where libraries are and what  services are available. It's particularly useful if users work across several Acute Trusts which is often the case for PCT and Mental Health Staff.   An online version can be found at http://www.agw-wdc.nhs.uk/pubs/el_lib/el_lib_passport.pdf  The eagle-eyed among you will notice the cover features a couple of nurses engrossed in Anatomy TV - be assured we're working on the new 2004/05 version and the photo will be updated.

      The National Library of Medicine will be releasing an entirely new design and modified organizational structure for its main Web site, http://www.nlm.nih.gov , on May 10, 2004. These changes are a result of extensive usability testing and consumer feedback. The new design retains many elements of the current site, amongst other things it now features:  -"portal" pages for the public, health care professionals, researchers, librarians, and publishers;  -up-to-date news on the home page;  -a top navigation bar including a search box on every page;  -a printer-friendly version option on many pages.   No URLs will change  as a result of the redesign, and the site will download faster than before.

      Should you be planning on flying into Belfast for the HLG conference - and doubtless saving the NHS money by choosing a cheapie airline - it's worth being aware that  * Belfast City Airport is about 3 miles from the city centre * Belfast International Airport is about 20 miles out  Of the bargain operators Flybe use Belfast City and Easyjet the International one. If you're a bit posh and fly a proper airline you'll need to check for yourself I'm afraid.  A Northen Irish friend tells me she never flies into the International Airport as "It takes forever" to get into Belfast and that the taxi fare can cost almost as much as the air ticket.

      Those of you who were also on the DLnet conference in Birmingham recently might like to hear of Lucy's (our Deputy Librarian) interesting idea for using those NelH cigarette lighters that we all won in the quiz. She's taken to carrying it around with her to the three different health libraries she works in - so far, so what, I hear you say, but read on and I guarantee you'll be amazed - and plugging it into the back of whichever computer she's working on!   At first I assumed that this was just some new "yoof" fashion statement, but turns out that as well as being a not very satisfactory cigarette lighter, this gizmo doubles as some sort of removable hard disc for your PC! Again, if you attended the conference you might have observed from watching my masterly attempts to work out how to switch on my new portable telephone (Lucy, please check I've used the correct terminology here, will you?) that ICT is just one of my many accomplishments. Working on the assumption that many of you, like me, might not yet have got around to unpacking this delightful free gift, I thought I'd pass on the above tip for helping you get the most of yours.  P.S. Alison - I think the one I got must have a duff flint in it as I can't get the wretched thing to spark. Any ideas where I can buy a replacement?

      I hope to take this opportunity to introduce you to the Map of Medicine, and, for those who have heard of it, to keep you up-to-date.    The Map of Medicine is an online clinical resource that supports daily clinical practice, clinical governance and risk management. The Map takes the form of 240, and increasing, patient pathways or journeys.   Like an A-Z ‘The Map’ helps clinicians to find and use specialist level knowledge. Each patient journey starts from first presentation e.g. to a Primary Care provider or A&E, usually with specific symptoms, through referral to a Consultant in a hospital and back to Primary Care for further management as required.    The Map of Medicine is fully localisable and has been designed to be aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to use.  The initial development work was carried out at the Royal Free and UCL hospitals and associated general practices. Over 250 clinicians have been involved in creating the Map’s content. Medic-to-Medic (http://medic-to-medic.com) publishes the Map of Medicine.   The Map of Medicine and NeLH are partnered in delivering a programme of work for the National Knowledge Service to integrate NeLH with the ICRS (Integrated Care Records Service) (Toth, B. 2004 The National Knowledge Infrastructure. National Knowledge Service http://www.nks.nhs.uk/docs/The%20National%20Knowledge%20Infrastructure%20v%201.0.pdf).   You may have heard about the Map of Medicine from Dr. Mike Stein, Medical Director of Medic-to-Medic, Muir Gray or Ben Toth, Co-Directors of the NeLH. Over the next weeks and months I will keep you informed of developments by emailing this list and posting to the DLnet weblog. Also, we expect to send many of you a CD-ROM to demonstrate the Map of Medicine later this spring.  Laura

      Following up my earlier posting about information for midwives....  The full-text of the MIDIRS Informed Choice leaflets ARE stilll available free of charge on the Web, but not on the main MIDIRS site linked to from the NeLH homepage.  To find them log in to http://www.infochoice.org/ which takes you to the Informed Choice site itself. Here you'll find the full-text of all 15 titles - each title has two versions, one for midwives and one for the women in their care. Both cover the same ground but the women's version is written in plain English with no medical jargon. All can be downloaded as pdfs.  Incidentially don't confuse this url with the very similar http://www.informedchoice.org/ or you'll be whisked off to Wisconsin and have a lovely choice of funeral caskets and cremation options - an Informed Final Choice perhaps  John

      I dip into the  urlLink Library PR  site now and again - although it has a lot related to public libraries, there's the odd nugget relevant to all types of library.  One of their  urlLink recent editorials  talks about running a communications audit to evaluate all the internal and external communication so you can find out who's listening to you and what messages they are getting.  The article recommends an agency which I'm guessing is beyond most library budgets (!) but it could be something that colleagues could help out with.  Maybe DLnet members could help each other run informal audits? ;-)

      You all know the saying 'you never get a second chance to make a first impression' and 'last impressions last'.  I thought I would say something about beginnings and endings e.g. when you start a new job or a new training session.  At a conference I went to Creatifica (www.creatifica.com) talked about good gestalts and bad gestalts.  Basically, the concept is that memories are stored like strings of pearls, a new memory being added to a string that goes back to the first memory.  So, chances are that if you start well you that is likely to be stored as a good memory and the next meeting will link back to that memory and build on this as a string of good memories ie a good gestalt.  We all know what happens if you have a bad memory - further events will be linked back to that bad memory ie a bad gestalt.  In terms of ending, I know that we all like to feel indispensable and that people need us but I would say that a good aim in training would be to leave people less dependent on you than they were before!

      Further to Zoe's & Tricia’s contributions re City and Guilds 7307, Reps might like to know about The Institute of IT Training, IITT.  I haven’t taken a course yet so cannot comment, but the NHSIA have recommended them.  The following is from the IITT website:    “Membership of the IITT is "strongly recommended" by the NHS, within the document "Professional", this can be found by at:    urlLink http://www.nhsia.nhs.uk/nhid/pages/resource_informatics/prof_qual.pdf   The Training Foundation's TAP programme is the recommended training standard within the NHS for IT trainers.  Through either a three-day (Delivery Skills Refresher) or five-day (Training Delivery Skills) course, you will be assessed as to your training ability using the TAP methodology.   Further information can be found at:   urlLink http://www.iitt.org.uk/public/courses/courses.asp?coursesectionid=2&coursecategoryid=14   If you wish to discuss TAP in more detail, please call Anu Nakra on 024 7641 1288, or e-mail her at a.nakra@trainingfoundation.com”  There is also a link to The Certified e-Learning Professional (CeLP) programme, which “offers over 300 hours of certificated on-line courses for e-Learning Developers, e-Learning Tutors, e-Learning Trainers, e-Learning Managers and e-Learning Consultants, with further study leading to the Diploma in e-Learning.”   urlLink http://www.trainingfoundation.com/certification/sectionindex.asp?CertificationSectionID=1   Allison

      Hi all Just been on The Training Zone website -  urlLink www.trainingzone.co.uk  - and found an article about CPD for trainers:   "The key to success in training is self-discipline, understanding the philosophy and implementation of continuous professional development.  Trainers need to be aware of the latest practices and develop their own approaches to delivering training sessions if they are to keep their work lively and fresh.  Peer Review To manage your own professional development, the first step should be feedback on sessions from a fellow trainer.    Invite a colleague to attend a session and provide a critique on it.    While no-one enjoys direct criticism, objective feedback is crucial if you are to get an outside eye.   It can also be beneficial for the person giving feedback too, as they may well pick up a few hints!"   This can be a daunting and challenging thing to do, but it does really help to evaluate what you're doing, both the content of your sessions, and the way that you train.  If you have another trainer or librarian nearby who's willing to help, it's worth giving it a go.  And then you can do it back to them and get your own back!  Fran

      Today I was showing some users Clinical Evidence online and I remembered seeing  urlLink Best Treatments  on NHS Direct. Best Treatments is a patients version of Clinical Evidence.   The members of staff quickly noted the information down and had a little look on the site.   I think this is a really useful addition to make to a session if you are training users on Clinical Evidence.

      I wonder if you all know about this wonderful website? I was reminded recently when asked about where patients could find out about Consultants, hospitals etc. Try  urlLink Dr Fosters    Claire Rayner, President, Patients' Association says of the site "This is a truly remarkable resource. For the first time, I can find out what I want to know about local health services. It’s the most authoritative measure of healthcare standards available anywhere in the world"  There are also lots of guides for patients and professionals. Free access to all guides for health professionals, much open access for the public, but some areas protected by 'Premium Content' subscription. Just the kind of thing District and Practice nurses will find useful.   We hope to add the site to our  urlLink Worcestershire Knowledge Portal  'Useful weblinks' listing in the near future.

      My first post so here goes....  Here in Bristol we had particular success with a project to provide information skills training for midwives. Nothing new in that you may think. True, but we provided the training sessions on central delivery suite (CDS), using a small resource room within the building - something I'm not aware of having been done before.  It did involve working quite closely with the directorate employing midwives, to set up and iron out any wrinkles. Midwifery took the bookings, knowing that every Wednesday the trainer would be present on CDS for two sessions accommodating four people per session. This helped the midwives take on ownership and not see this as something being imposed on them from another part of the Trust. Working closely with midwifery also helped us publicise the service - we had a launch event with a presentation, tea and buns and from time to time I would visit the wards with a midwifery manager to drum up interest when things were looking a little slack. Being under their noses on CDS meant that they saw what was going on, and often midwives would turn up at the last minute if things were quiet at the time.  The sessions focused on increasing awareness of the range of information sources available online - NeLH and the midwifery specialist library, Cochrane, search skills, and our local NHS library website. One of the key resources was also MIDIRS - I fully appreciate the irony that as of today the NeLH/MIDIRS resource had been discontinued.  It was great to help join services up for users. On one accasion a midwife was interested in finding information to support a job application. We did a search and then identified which journals were easily accessible in the library - "I've not been in the library in years" she admitted. Soon after the training session she arrived in the library and eagerly photocopied some of the articles we had found. It even has a happy ending as she got the job.  Can't really see any reason why this type of things couldn't be spun off and provided for physios, OTs and other professional groups with a little creative thinking. I think providing the training on their home turf really was the key to the success of the project - something which a lot of outreach librarians already appreciate and use to their advantage.

      With presentations at all levels from Keynote to posters, Open Access is a big issue at MLA04. With library budgets squeezed , a partial monopoly of publishers increasing pricing there is a real enthusiasm for open access amongst librarians here.   In a parallel session librarians told of their efforts to get authors and institutions to use the paradigm with one librarian facilitating a completely new online journal. Our own  urlLink Biomedcentral  agreement was hailed as a beacon to lead the way for American librarians.  Nick

      Just come back from a session entitled "Influencing Change", about how computers and electronic resources are changing the roles of librarians.  One of the papers was given by a Gillian Mayman from the University of Michigan, about "Re-inventing Reference in the Digital Age" - how they were moving from traditional enquiry work behind the desk in a library, to other ways of working.  She had some pertinent quotes in her presentation, which I thought I'd share:  This one she translated to libraries: " My home is not a place, it is people ", (Lois McMaster Bujold, 1991)  " In absence of clearly defined goals, we become strangely loyal to performing daily acts of trivia. " (Unknown)  She used this to illustrate how she thinks of libraries: " Sometimes I think we're alone.  Sometimes I think we're not.  In either case, the thought is staggering. " (R Buckminster Fuller, 1895 - 1983)  " I can't understand why people are frightened of new ideas.  I'm frightened of the old ones. " (John Cage, 1912 - 1992)  And to finish with, one of the other participants in the session chimed in with " Library is a service, not a place. "  Which I think summed up the whole session.

      The incoming president of the American Medical Library Association used this phrase to describe the MLA in comparison with some other professional associations. However, in a room with over 2500 other librarians (scary thought) I couldn't help feeling that the power of our combined knowledge and experience was pretty mighty! Then I got to thinking about the power of one. Each one of us has the power to do something big and this conference is all about seizing that power. A news item I saw the other day illustrated this perfectly: a bug flew into the open window of a moving car. The woman driver waved her hands in panic as the cicada flew into her face. Unfortunately she also stepped on the gas. The car careered down the street, demolished a fire hydrant and flooded the entire neighbourhood, causing chaos for several hours and leaving everything mud-caked. The clean-up operation will take weeks. All that because of one tiny bug........  Debra Thornton

      This was the title of the Keynote address here at Medical Library Association conference in Washington DC.  Harm J. de Blij gave a very entertaining and informative talk on the state of geographical literacy in the United States, where only 18% of children are taught geography in schools.  His premise was that this has horrifying implications for the country at a time when awareness of the connectivity of the world in spatial terms is crucial to world stability.  He said the US is in a race against time with three key threats to national security: environmental change and global warming; the inevitable competition with the China as the next aspiring super power; and the terrorist threat in Iraq.  He also had some very amusing insights into the decline of the British Empire and why you should never trust a Brit in the dark!  Sara Whittaker

      This was the programme section I attended yesterday afternoon.  There were 4 speakers, 2 of whom talked about the online interactive tutorials that they've developed using a program called Camtasia, and the success they've had using them.  Camtasia is similar to a program called RoboDemo that Nick and I are experimenting with.  RoboDemo allows us to capture videos of mouse movements on screen.  We're looking at using it to make new versions of the NeLH tours, which will make them much more interactive, and actually demonstrate how to search or display search results, etc, as part of the tours.  We were thinking about this before we came to Washington - and it's nice to now have confirmation from our American colleagues that they do work, and are an extremely well-received way of getting information across.  We'll let you know when we get our first one done, soon after we get home - watch this space!  Fran

      Greetings from Washington DC!  Patricia Thibodeau, President of the Medical Library Association, called on all delegates yesterday to "seize the power and be empowered".  Speaking as part of her presidential address she also looked briefly at the image of medical librarians and medical libraries in the media, the need for a more international perspective within MLA, the issue of scholarly publishing, and the importance of advocacy.  She also identified 3 key themes from her time as president of MLA: the need to revitalise the skill of expert searching, health information literacy within the general population, and the concept of the informationist.

DLNet Reps Sara Whittaker and Debra Thornton were the lucky winners and are now in Washington together with some of the NeLH team. During the conference we will be posting blog entries about what is going on in and around the conference.  During our time we will also be visting National Library for Medicine and learning more about National Health Library Month.  We are looking forward to hearing about some of the American education programmes.   Fran and Nick

More info on RSS feeds and aggregators at  urlLink http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/xmlhelp.asp .  Other RSS feeds available from NeLH include Hitting the Headlines, What's New and Document of the Week.  Have a go at downloading or using an aggregator - I downloaded SharpReader this afternoon and am already addicted.  I've loaded up feeds from other blogs (some of the links from this page) and other places such as the BBC.  It's fab fun ;-)

      Ever since we started producing publicity for NeLH a constant feedback theme has been for customisation of publication so that individual libraries can highlight there own services. Additionally the ablity to segment resources for individual professional groups or sub groups has been sought( eg resources for Nurses in SCBU or OTs in Primary Care.   Poster on Demand allows you to produce high quality publications( posters, leaflets, certificates, signage, reports etc)using your printer or photocopier and paper stock ordered from the NHSIA order line. Targeted at short to medium length print runs the system also employs the just in time principle (as long as you have paper in stock!)  We need your help to quickly pilot the process as we are still developing it but it has to be ready for the Autumn!!.   Please order 30 sheets of "POD Blanks" and go to  urlLink .../dlnet/postersondemand.asp  for more detailed instructions and the word files.  Please let us know at nelh@nhsia.nhs.uk if you are taking part in the trial or any other clarification. Comments can be posted here on the blog  Thanks in anticipation ..F,A,N.

      While we are on the topic of NeLH publcity goodies, I thought I would share with you that I have created a little display box for my NeLH freebies in the library - nothing grand mind you, but it looks presentable and keeps the bits and pieces tidy.     I used the top of a photocopying paper box covered in white paper (it was green before) and then I cut up a large NeLH poster (sacrilege!) to put slogans around the side (eg the address).  I also printed out an A4 sign using the NeLH powerpoint slide background.  In the box I have postcards, business cards, fold-out leaflets and monitor clips.  I was also hoping to incude pencils, but alas! It's situated by the photocopier and the monitor clips regularly disapear!   I have asked Fran and the team to consider if NeLH or NLH would create a more professional looking display box in flat-pack style to draw attention to these delights and to keep them tidy.

      Just a couple of thoughts on publicity materials.  1 NeLH pencils are always gratefully received by our library users, but not many people tend to use pencils once they've achieved the ripe old age of eight. How about cheap NeLH pens for our more grown-up users?  2 The enamel Digital Libraries badge sets off the navy of my suit extremely fetchingly, but has so far been conspicuously unsuccessful in attracting advances from other healthcare workers, or even fellow librarians. How about replacing the somewhat confusing 'Digital Libraries' with 'NeLH' on ther next run?

       Monday 5 July : 9.30 and 3.30  As part of the  urlLink FOLIO  module on Change Management, Dr Graham Walton (who wrote the chapter on Change Management in the new Walton and Booth book) will be giving an online lecture which will be open to anyone who is interested.  The lecture will take place on 5th July - at 9.30 and repeated at 3.30.  As usual, you’ll need to dial in a few minutes before the call starts so we can start on time.  All you need is a phone, an Internet connection and 15 spare minutes!  A great opportunity to learn more about change management from an expert in the field. On the day: 1) Find an internet connected PC next to a phone, preferably where you will not be disturbed.  2) Call  0800 3583795  (freephone) and when prompted enter the access code  771239 , followed by  # .  3) Log on to the Internet and open your web browser. The presenter will guide you to the tour presentation during the conference call.

      I am sure following my previous blogs you have rushed out and are now happily getting the benefits of aggregating Really Simply Syndication (RSS)feeds. For those undecided or without sufficient time or those who no idea to what I refer I have created a Bloglines demonstrator.  I hope you can see how to put together increasingly useful information in one place together with less work related items. In the working demo I have included all the NeLH feed including DLnet together with Hubmed search strings( select a keyword search and the results are constantly updated), BBC feeds together with Microsoft secutity fixes, eBay alerts and a Dilbert comic strip.  To access the  urlLink Bloglines  account User=nelh@nhsia.nhs.uk pass=library. Feel free to add your feeds and dont worry if it it gets broken I will fix it.   You can slectively export from this account to your own simply by clicking on tell a friend link.

      Did you know that NHS employees can purchase a full copy of Office 2003 Professional to use on their HOME PC for £17.31 including shipping and VAT?   To obtain your software( no manuals) you will need an NHS email address. If you are interested drop us a line as you will need a "program code". Initially we believed we had the code for the NHS ..unfortunately not so. We are currently investigating where in each trust the code can be obtained from.

      We managed to get a stand at our local PCT's TIPS event - this stands for Time for Improving Patient Services and is their name for Protected Learning Time.  It was held at the Madjeski Stadium (home of the Biscuit Men).  There were over 50 stands and around 300 people attended including exhibitors.  The idea was to showcase your service and show off what you do.  We did a large poster about the library took lots of leaflets and did goody bags.  I use goody bags from partybox.co.uk - blue paper ones and stick Nelh stickers on the outside.  Inside are Nelh goodies (pencil and monitor clip), fold out Nelh leaflet and our leaflets and a snack sized chocolate bar.  These turned out to be an excellent way of enticing people to our stand and word soon spread  - the lure of chocolate seems particularly effective!  I can also report that lots of people said yes when we asked if they used Nelh which is excellent.  Rowena Perry

      Hello Fellow Bloggers,  Despite joing this a year ago, this is my first posting so here goes.  I was very interested in Caroline Papi's ten minute training session slot yesterday. I was particularly interested in the way she had customised her training and concentrated on different sites for different groups. What I was thinking of was using the POD and producing some single sided guides to resources for the different groups - really just URLs and one or two lines about the resources. Has anyone done anything similar that they are prepared to share?  Thanks  Sharon  North Bristol Trust

Reason for this is that the previous template didn't display  comments  so there was no way of knowing if anyone had commented on a post without clicking the date link.  This template indicates if there are any comments so makes it much much easier :-)  If you'd like to comment on a blog post, simply click on the "x comments" link at the bottom and it will prompt you to post a comment - it will ask you to login so you'll need your username and password handy.

      Many years ago as a member of CAMRA I was delighted to see the devastation dealt out to Watney's brewery as a result of their attempt to turn the synthetic gnat's pee they brewed under the banner the Red Revolution into the nation's favourite tipple. Thanks to CAMRA's well-judged adverse publicity Watney's had to withdraw its brand name, repaint all its pub signs, and recommence brewing proper beer. If a group of bearded drunkards can bring a brewing giant to its knees in this way I see no reason why a group of well-motivated health librarians can't deal a crippling blow to those elements of the publishing industry which so obviously deserve it.   I'm sick and tired of publishers' withdrawing their journals from Proquest out of fear that there'll be a huge drop in the number of their print subscriptions - and I'm sure I'm not alone in this.  Let's pick on a publisher - BMJ journals would be a good start - and all cancel our subscriptions to their stable of journals. Let's tell our library users that we won't be stocking these journals until the publisher changes its ways, and that anyone wishing to read one of the papers in a BMJ journal will have to apply to British Library, at the full, non-NHS subsidised rate, oh, and that their requests will go to the bottom of the pile because we're very busy for the next month or two.   I don't believe that patients treatment would result from this drastic action: I have sufficient respect for my fellow health librarians' judgement and discretion to know that they'd make exceptions in those cases where patient treatment was an immediate issue, and that clinicians would lose no time in telling us which cases thoses were. At worst, one or two consultants might have their noses put out of joint, and at best we'd strike a might blow for freedom of scientific information.   To the barricades...

      For those who have not visited this site before midwivesonline is a very useful, informative and easy to navigate website for Midwives, Healthcare Professionals and New Parents. They have recently revamped the website, so those that haven't visited it recently may want to take another look.  They are also set to launch an exciting e-newsletter for midwives. Recognising how little time midwives have to surf the Internet for information relevant to their practice, they are offering midwives a  free , monthly, informative, single-sheet e-newsletter.  The core purpose of the newsletter is to inform midwives about the latest free, web-based resources to help them 'stay ahead' in clinical practice.  It will also include relevant new sites that may be of help to the mothers/families midwives care for.   To receive this helpful newsletter for free go to:    urlLink http://www.midwivesonline.com/midwivessub.htm   and complete the short form.

      The demonstration CD I mentioned at Easter is available (without the interactive module of the NHS version, I'll post to this blog when it is ready) at www.mapofmedicine.co.uk/intro.   The Map of Medicine and the National Library for Health are hoping to run a 'taster' event in mid/late September. We hope this event will introduce/ further inform you about the Map of Medicine and how you can become involved. In mid October we hope to run a training session per cluster, further information will be available in a few weeks via the DLnet pages. Membership to DLnet will be required so please encourage colleagues to join.  I'm presenting at all the Roadshows so if you have any questions please come and find me, I hope to see many of you there. Alternatively, email l.tucker@medsch.ucl.ac.uk with any questions.

      You know how you like to think what you say matters...  After filling in one of their online questionnaires over a year ago, the web site design team invited me (and lots of others!!) to show them how I used the site. They asked me things about searching and then asked me to find certain things - which I did - eventually... using their site search engine. A lot of the time I gave up and said, "I'd use Google now..."  Well whatever we said has resulted in web page that now has been given this weeks Best New Website Webuser Gold Award (Webuser Issue 89 5-18 August 2004 p18). It says that the homepage  urlLink www.nhs.uk  - NHS Gateway - is cleaner and provides simple access to NHS information and services.  So in my own little way I like to think...

      A pleasing letter in the latest issue (169) of the oft mentioned Computer Active talks about IT access via public libraries.  It includes the statistic that 52,000,000 online hours are available to library service users.   I found this an interesting way of looking at things.  Quick sums show that my library offers:   15,000 online hours   70,000 seated hours   A few hours of laptop use probably don't change the figures too much!  I wonder how many online hours and others we offer across all NHS Libraries?

The National Programme for IT has won "Most Appalling Project" at Privacy International's 6th Annual UK Big Brother Awards.   urlLink  &nbsp;  It's all to do with the electronic patient record and the fact that&nbsp;most&nbsp;&nbsp;patients have little choice&nbsp;over opting in or out of the database and for the most part don't what is being input about them. It puts a lot of information into the hands of the NHS and could be used against patient interests...&nbsp;according to Privacy International.

      To those of you who Athens Administrate in London NHS&nbsp;  This sounds like the usual Tuesday morning “at risk” message and is largely to do with Athens administration – not the access to KA24 itself.   The usual advice from our end is to avoid Tuesday mornings for any major Athens Admin processes.  We will circulate Londonlinks if there are any major hiccups resulting from the server restart.   There will be a break of up to five minutes between 07:00 - 08:00 BST on Tuesday 3 August 2004 for the following services:  • MyAthens • the NHS England and NHS Scotland self-registration schemes • the DSP administration interface  The break will occur while one of our servers is restarted.&nbsp; User authentications and access to all other Eduserv Athens web services will not be affected.

      Looks like the recommendations from the recent parliamentary report are beginning to take shape with this British Library announcement. Considering the NHS has a big input into Medical Research, there seems a bit of an obvious&nbsp;seat missing from the table??  £3 million national framework for UK research information announced Research Libraries Network promises UK researchers 'joined-up' services  A new national initiative - the Research Libraries Network (RLN) - announced today, is set to transform the way research information is collected, organised, preserved and accessed across the UK. The RLN will bring together the UK's four higher education funding bodies, the British Library, the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales and the eight members of Research Councils UK to develop the UK's first national framework aimed at addressing the information needs of researchers.  The financial, technological and organisational demands on university and research libraries are huge. They include the transition to electronic publishing, the increasing volume and cost of information, new models for publishing and disseminating research (such as Open Archives), researchers' changing patterns of behaviour, massive growth in the volume of publicly-funded research, and government initiatives to foster innovation and technology transfer.

      I know some of my work colleagues are probably very tired of my evangilism on Mind Mapping -&nbsp;but for those of you who like to dabble in ways of doing things slightly differently...  Mind Mapping is making use of pictures and words to remind you of what happened in meetings, articles, books. Instead of pages of notes - try and encapsulate a whole meeting on one sheet of paper (landscape) using single words or pictures. Like notes, it is there to mentally aid you - only visually and concisely. It definately concentrates the mind on those key points you need to come away with at those many meetings you attend.  I must admit, I do scan those "help organise yourself" and "personal management" on the bookshop and library bookshelves, either buying or borrowing with every intention of doing something positive to "improve myself" However most of them are read until the first "practical test" and then never read again. Tony & Barry Buzan's "The Mind Map Book" however was a totally different matter. I couldn't put it down. Read it from cover to cover in&nbsp;four days commuting. I may read it in half the time because I've got Tony Buzan's Speedreading book...  Anyhow, since reading The Mind Map Book, I've been Mind Mapping,&nbsp; in my own way, both on paper and now via MindManager  urlLink http://www.mindjet.com/uk/ &nbsp;one of around 5 or 6 mind mapping softwares available.  I suggest you read the book first, because the philosophy behind the technique is quite important and also the spin offs for improving remembering and problem solving are useful as well. Then dive in.   It takes a little bit of time to stop yourself writing reams of notes on one page - but with everything it develops with practice.   Then I won't be the only "weird one" in the corner drawing pictures during the meeting!!!

      ProQuest upgraded their search interface on 17th July with ProQuest Smart Search.   Though I know we encourage everyone to search the bibliographic databases first, I do use both ProQuest and EBSCO’s search interfaces, especially when I’m looking for things not medical or clinical which probably won’t be covered by the Dialog databases.   The main thing I found different with the new ProQuest software was the Topic Guide section, which has a lot of suggestions when you are looking for topics.   I’ve not looked at it in any depth, but would be interested to hear any feedback, positive or negative.

      I did suggest that I might be able to link KA24 Athens username and passwords to local electronic holdings of AJR.  However I discovered that although Highwire journals such as BMJ were Athens enabled, it was down to the publisher (not the e-journal software publisher) to apply for Athens enablement.&nbsp; AJR haven't done so - yet... The good news is that they are looking at it as a business case and may in fact enable AJR - but as it is a cost to them this has to be taken into consideration.  So in the short term - local username and password access still seems to be the solution.

       Just posted this to Londonlinks   The following has been released to various lists by BMJ.   The new pricing model for BMJ should not affect any electronic delivery via KA24.   There are ongoing negotiations with BMJ over national supply to the NHS and academic sector and we expect a positive outcome in the near future and BMJ should become a core content resource.

      Eduserv Chest is pleased to announce that the Agreement for STAT!Ref, the Electronic Medical Library from Teton Data Systems, is going ahead from 1st August 2004.&nbsp; This is a 2 year agreement with access to a number of core medical references, in full text book format with tables and graphics, &nbsp;such as Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, Hurst’s the Heart and PIER (Physicians’ Information and Education Resource) the American College of Physician’s electronic, evidence-based guide designed to improve diagnosis and treatment of diseases.&nbsp;   This agreement is open to Academic Institutions and NHS Organisations in the UK and Republic of Ireland.  Other NHS Organisations or NHS Affiliated Sites where Main Site does not subscribe: Annual payment: £1,250 which includes the £100 fee for Athens Authentication.  VAT should be added to the above figures.&nbsp; Fees may be pro-rated on a monthly basis for organisations joining after the start date.  Notes: The cost for Affiliated NHS Organisations is incorporated within the cost for the 'parent' academic institution, provided the ‘parent’ academic institution subscribes.&nbsp; If the NHS Affiliate is using its NHS Athens Org ID rather than the university Athens Org ID there will be a charge to Athens of £100 per organization for which the 'parent' institution will be charged.&nbsp;   Affiliated NHS Organisations should complete the Addendum form which needs to be signed by the ‘parent’ academic institution as well as by the Affiliated Organisation. The administration will be carried out by the academic institution.&nbsp;   The cost for NHS Affiliated Organisations will be included in that for the parent academic institution provided that use by the academic institution is not adversely affected by excessive use by NHS Affiliated organizations.&nbsp; Use and turnaways will be monitored to ensure this.&nbsp; If it is found that academic institutions are subject to an inappropriate number of turnaways the pricing for NHS Affiliated organizations will need to be reviewed as it may be necessary for Eduserv Chest to purchase additional concurrent users to overcome any problems.  NHS sites which are not affiliated to an academic institution or Affiliated NHS organizations where the 'parent' site is not licensed will pay £1,250 annually (this includes the £100 for Athens) and will need to complete a separate licence.

      It is now available! I've sent to the London Domain Administrators and asked them to distribute to their administrators, but I will follow up with an email to all adminstrators tomorrow. It seemed to be an easy job when I mind mapped it out... however much tougher to produce, especially with Microsoft Word. It is a good job Barbara Cumbers and myself no longer share an office together as my donations to the swear box would have been generous.....

      Aaaarrgh. After back to back meetings plus some problems with storage of the latest version on the network - this probably will be sent out on Monday morning. It has been one of those weeks, with big meetings taking more time than anticipated.  Apologies

      Dear Colleagues  I did promise an Athens Adminstrator Manual by the end of last week for all sub domain administrators…  This proved to be a bigger job than I anticipated… and it will probably be out sometime later this week, once a few eKAT staff have removed the Lincolnshire / West Midland colloquialisms so that most of you can understand it!  We will still enable the new self-registration domains from the 23rd August as planned.  Regards,  Andy

      The London consultation days are this week on Wednesday 11th and Thursday 12th August at Friends House in Euston. You probably may be be able register still if you are quick!  urlLink http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/dlnet/roadshows04.asp  This is a major consultation so if you are unhappy with aspects of the NLH proposal, if at all, then here is your chance to say so.  I have major concerns over regional teams such, as eKAT and where they might fit in. Also, if NLH is following PRINCE2 methodology, how come there are already deliverables before the consultation has taken place and NLH is confirmed as being a viable concept?

      Posted on DLNet Blog site ( urlLink http://www.dlnet.blogspot.com/ ) today by Alison Turner  How to get involved in National Library for Health If you'd like to get involved in National Library for Health developments, or would like to be kept updated as projects unfold, visit  urlLink www.library.nhs.uk  to register your interest. Although it's most likely we'll be following up after the NLH roadshows finish next week, I'm looking in particular at the moment for individuals who want to get involved in the study on user needs; a study on CPD/training needs of library staff; and a new publicity/awareness group. Take a look and sign up - no obligation if you later find you don't have the time and an easy and quick way to contribute your ideas etc to the development process.

      You know how you like to think what you say matters...  After filling in one of their online questionnaires over a year ago, the web site design team invited me (and lots of others!!) to show them how I used the site. They asked me things about searching and then asked me to find certain things - which I did - eventually... using their site search engine. A lot of the time I gave up and said, "I'd use Google now..."  Well whatever we said has resulted in web page that now has been given this weeks Best New Website Webuser Gold Award (Webuser Issue 89 5-18 August 2004 p18). It says that the homepage  urlLink www.nhs.uk  - NHS Gateway - is cleaner and provides simple access to NHS information and services.So in my own little way I like to think...

      I know this has nothing to do with electronic databases or journals, but I've just come across Tom Roper's Weblog (now at Brighton and Sussex Medical School) and, sadly for me, his tip of the day last Tuesday (27th July) Byron, in the Betfair Cup - which won! Not that I know much about horse racing - but I might have been tempted... Mind you looking further down his blog, not everything wins!  urlLink http://tomroper.typepad.com/

      Dear Colleagues  Following on from our recent Athens Administrator meeting and Electronic Information Resources Working Group (EIRWG) meetings, plus some very useful feedback from those meetings – it looks like our “kick off” date will be Monday 23rd August 2004 for the new version of Athens.  The prefixes will change from the present iwl, nlc, sel, swl and tpm to nhs. Those currently with the “old” prefix will still be using them, but from 23rd August, all new registrations will have the nhs prefix. We will gradually change the old prefixes – mainly through the renewal process - over the next six months and further details will be sent to Athens Administrators.  From 23rd August the new self-registration page will be enabled. This means that anyone registering on an NHSnet machine will get a username and password emailed to an email of their choice almost immediately (note: there is no insistence that they put an an NHS email address - as at present). Athens subdomain administrators will automatically receive an email of all new self-registration users registered to their site.  Self-Registration outside an NHSnet connected machine is subject to a maximum of 15 working days, as they are manually checked to see if they are legitimate users. Users are notified on the Self-Registration form of this and advised to go to their nearest NHS library to register on site– but probably, like most of us, will not read it! If you are an academic Janet library – self-registration will be subject to this manual process – so present in-library registration schemes would be advised, where library staff registers NHS staff as personal users on Athens. Similarly for local government social service workers and hospices – on site library registration is quicker.  There is no requirement to attain a signature from the user to use the service. We will still keep the electronic paper application up on HILO. Some libraries still find the paper format useful to keep so this is down to local decision. Please be aware that self-registration users are not required to physically sign anything.  All present named sub domain administrators for the current Athens registration method has been transferred as the named administrator under the new set up.  Those Athens administrators who attended the Athens Administrator meeting in July have details of the new username and password to access their appropriate WDC / SHA Athens administrator area. All named Athens Administrators will receive full instructions on the new process by Friday 6th August. The actual normal registration for personal accounts is little different from the present process. The formation of the username itself does change and there are some new user groups, including Dentists and Social Services – but essentially apart from the new username and password to get in, the process is the same.  We will keep you updated on Athens over the next few weeks. HILO will be suitably altered to reflect the new processes available to register. Please feel free to ask any further questions.
