      i'm a crap insomniac. i sleep too much to be any good at it. if i was any good at not being able to sleep then i'd be able to operate on less than 4 hours sleep a night. as it is i barely make it past 3AM before i start feeling sleepy.   it's just not good enough.   maybe Red Bull will help? answers on a postcard.

      so can anyone answer me why it is that all the great ideas that pop into my mind for filling up space here happen when I'm miles away from a PC only for the said thoughts to evaporate when I get within typing distance? who knows. who cares. it's probably the alcohol.

      I'm not one for religion.   I'm not one for anything remotely organised so religion is an instant out for me. As for fate, I'm not big into that either (it's the whole "predetermined" thing; I'd like to know I'm screwing up of my own accord and not because that's how it's been planned). However sometimes things happen which make me wonder.  Take today for example; I lucked out with two tickets for a gig that I didn't think I'd be able to go to.  Technically I did have a ticket, though thanks to an unfortunate series of events, it never made it to my grubby mitts. The mate who'd purchased them suffered an accident involving a cab, his wallet (where he kept the tickets) and a surfeit of cider. On top of this of course the gig had sold out, hence the venue laughed loudly when matey phoned up to see if he could get replacements. It's easy to see why I was resigned to missing the show.  So far, so ordinary. A drunk guy with 4 tickets for a gig manages to lose them and the venue won't replace them. But I was especially gutted as I missed the band in their NME slot back in January; when I got the bad news that the tickets had gone west I spent several minutes crying into my Guinness.   Some time passes; the gig is still sold out, there's not a ticket to be had and I've blanked it from my mind. And last week I find out that, thanks to Sky & the Premier League, the Portsmouth v's Arsenal game has been  urlLink rescheduled  to silly o'clock on the same evening as the gig. The upshot of this is that 2 season ticket holders can't go, so this morning I got offered the spare tickets. One for me, one for Matey The Wallet-Loser.  Yay for me. But there were 4 of us going originally, what about tickets for the other 2 guys?   That'd be the other 2 guys who didn't go all that much on the band when we saw them last year (but raved about them after the NME gig, natch). That'd also be the 2 guys who are also season ticket holders for Pompey so are likely to go to the game rather than the gig.  Cue the Eddie Murphy style " urlLink Aha! "  OK, so maybe it's not divine providence, maybe it's more poetic wossname. Who knows, but it filled up some space here (and freed up some space in my brain). And I get to see Franz Ferdinand again, which is nice.

      so here we go again. after my failed attempt at keeping a blog going over at  urlLink BoltBlue  (where I gave up due to its ever-so-tempramental attitude to retaining what I'd typed in) I've been spurred on to have another go.  whoo.  big whup.  does anyone actually read these things? I don't know. but maybe it'll keep all the stuff that spills out of my noggin from hitting the pavement. or maybe it will become cyber-pavement. who knows. either way, it seemed like a good idea at the time.   I've found that many things do.

      Just over a year ago I got an email from my good chum Banto tipping me off to this fantastic Internet radio station that he’d stumbled across.   He’d been looking for something English, something Alternative, and he thought he’d found just the very thing when Windows Media Radio Station Guide suggested a feed from Oxford.  Several clicks later and he discovered there’s more than one Oxford.   As well as the hotbed of academia and boat racing that’s just north of Reading in the UK there was also, it transpired, an Oxford in Ohio, USA. Banto had stumbled across the Future of Rock’n’Roll.   He’d found  urlLink 97X .   After a few weeks of heavy listening he had to tell someone equally anal about music about his discovery. That’s where I came in. Initially I wasn’t 100% sure about tuning into an American radio station. I’d heard “things” about American radio, it wasn’t all like  urlLink WKRP  but more a bland parade of manufactured pop acts and commercials.   Not entirely unlike British radio stations then.   With my famously weak willpower it wasn’t long before I caved in and decided to give this wunder-station a listen. I was hooked within the first bars of the first song I heard (to my shame I can’t remember what it was but I know I loved it).   From then I listened to 97X most days at work. When I logged on first thing in the morning I immediately called up 97X and listened until I left in the evening (with only work occasionally intruding on my listening pleasure).  It was strange, a station thousands of miles away that appeared to have not only raided my CD collection but also had lots of suggestions for new items to be added to it. And items did indeed get added. I’d never heard of  urlLink King of Woolworths  or  urlLink The Postal Service  before.  urlLink The Decemberists ,  urlLink The Shins ,  urlLink Rilo Kiley ,  urlLink Over The Rhine ; all added into the playlist in my brain alongside  urlLink Franz Ferdinand ,  urlLink U2 ,  urlLink Venus Hum ,  urlLink Gomez ,  urlLink Super Furry Animals  and so many many other bands that this tiny station conjured from its gargantuan repository of music.  I found my fingers clicking through to arcane websites to obtain CDs by bands that hadn’t a chance of nationwide US release let alone appearing this side of the pond (though there were notable exceptions). Soon my shelves were creaking just a little bit more than before.  I had my 97X and all was good in my world.   Shivvy Shiv and The Bakerman got me through the morning, then came Barb who made the afternoons fly by and to who I made the occasional request (OK, so she didn’t play the EXACT Super Furry Animals track I’d asked for, but she played something nearly as good).   And I’d find myself wondering what was on offer this week at the Oxford  urlLink Kroger .  Working overtime at the weekends? Not a problem. There was  urlLink Sounds Eclectic  and the Blues and Reggae hours to make the “joys” of server rebuilds and network upgrades go just a touch smoother.  But even the best romances never last.  In January the bad news came falling like chubby rain on a sunny day. Unexpected news to all and sundry, 97X (as we knew it) would be leaving the airwaves. Banto phoned me up to check whether I knew but I’d already seen the  urlLink posting  on the website. Hence I could tell him that it was only the airwaves that would be going quiet: the internet would still hum to the sound of 97X.  At least that was the plan.  But it’s a funny thing this internet business. It transpired that it’s more expensive to run a pared-down internet radio station than it is a proper “broadcasting over the ether” radio station.   The hoped for funding never materialised and you can guess what comes next.  Last Thursday at midnight EST the great radio station called 97X, the radio station that I wish I’d discovered so many years before, the radio station that I’d come to depend upon to keep me going through the day, went off the air.   And since then neither Banto nor I have really known what to do.   On Friday morning he phoned me up to tell me that he hated me. He’s a bit jinxed when it comes to discovering good things and then seeing them turn to dust. He thought he’d better tell me he hated me just in case I went the same way as  urlLink X-Ray magazine  or our favourite radio station.  We’ve both scoured the boards at the 97X website for possible alternatives. So far it’s not as bleak as we feared; there are a few internet stations out there that are nearly as good,  urlLink one  even admits that it was inspired by 97X. But there’ll never be another WOXY.  I feel lucky to have been able to listened to it for as long as I could. I’m sad that I’ll never get to cruise round Oxford, Ohio, with the radio blaring out my favourite station, looking for  urlLink Jungle Jim's . And I wish it was still around. Though, as the Bakerman said in his final sign off speech (which you can download from  urlLink here ), the station went off the air being the best it ever could be.   And it’s always best to quit when you’re on top.
