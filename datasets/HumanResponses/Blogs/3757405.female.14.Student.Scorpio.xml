      I am slightly happy. Nothing really to get excited about but, I am slightly happy. Very slightly. I found a nice layout. it was nice. I'll try and get it to work. Maybe my happiness will rise...only slightly though. I was glad(slightly) that it still reflects my gloominess (gloomyness or gloominess?) sigh* I'm glad. I guess

      Sigh...today was...so bad. Mother turned up unexpectedly at the door. It was so...random. Well, anyway, I had to pick out clothes so she could get back to Bundaberg. Then me and my brother were having and arguement about...actually, I have no idea what we were fighting about but, I was pretty pised at him. Thats right, pised not pissed :P. Then we had to go food shopping and stuff and I saw the cutest guy arranging the apples ^^ he was really, really, really, cute yet, not as cute as Johnny Depp ^^ I really do not know how to change the templatey layout of this...how...arritating. Wait - i think I do. Yay!!! kudos for me :)

BUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ok, on with the issue!   Super-de-dooper Staff!   +Chiaz(Editor) +Wei-Ling - Music and Entertainment +Lisa - Random Funk +Susan - Gossip and Rumours +Courtney - Heath and Celeb    [reminder: even if you all have your own sections, you can still do main stories eg. coverages of events etc. please send any thing (information, events, whatever. yno?)to moi]     rumours in the midst...   +Emily and Mark?!!? +Chiaz and Johnny Depp??? (lol, i wish...) +Editor still cannot go to Sydney but Michelle is!! (i hate her...grrr) +Susan and John should get back together. Make your move on him girl!     YASMIN & DRE.. what do people think?   Yasmin and Dre obviously seem to be the topic of most conversations if the word 'couples' come up and either ending with a 'they don't suit' or 'cute together.' "Well, at first i was like: woah! not sure if they'll have chemistry or not but, when i saw them together, they were cute enough but still, they don't actually suit. I'd say they'll go out for another three to four months and it'll be over. Problems which could cause a break-up could be A) another girl/boy maybe, B) breaking up for no reason *cough* Susan *cough* (sorry, bad cold) or  C)pressure from their friends i'd say," says the Editor as she sat at her desk, obviously looking pretty sure of her opinion and grins like a cat after she coughs. Even though, it was obviously a suprise to people when they got together as their personalities seem to clash. There have been rumours that Dre is quite a pervert and flashes his genitals on MSN. I think all would love to see how Yasmin reacts to that!  "I think they are a unusual - but cute couple. I can picture them eating Marshmallow sandwiches together in a retirement village, yet can see them hating each others guts ina few years like cats a dogs. There relationship lasting a long time is something of a believable matter" says Courtney, a student in Yasmin's class, looking a little bit high, yet keeping her cool yet crazy demeanor. When Yasmin first started liking our boy Dre, rumours said that he hesitated a while to answer her because of his reputation. Supposedly, he had built it on the fact he did not go out with the girls from our school.  "Conflict between Ellie & Luke, and Dre & Ellie's friendship will stir things up a bit between the two couples," says a person. Although there has been rumours of jealousy and fighting between Yasmin & Ellie over Dre, it appears it hasn't harmed either of their relationships. Sources have reported the the couple were not fighting at a recent outing to Movie World.  People have also said that Dre is too "fugly" for Yasmin which may, or may not be true. The writer thinks either of them will dump each other until Yasmin likes another guy or vice versa.  "They will last a while, maybe till the end of term 3. They don't really suit! Yasmin is loud and Andreas isn't! They're good for eachother but they will get bored." says one. Whether they last or have a sudden split will be entertainment for all of us. "Andreas and Yasmin... I think it's stupid, the two of them going out! I think Andreas could find someone better" says another, obviously strong on their opinion and finally one with a definate answer.  "I secretly had a love affair with Yasmin and she really wasnt that good at pashing! I dont think Andreas will be impressed!" Says an unknown person. Not so good at kissing? I wonder when Andreas will find that out. I'm thinking she'll have time to practise, if they last that long that is. I guess we all have our opinions on the subject but only time will tell where there relationship will go from here.
