      So I decided I needed a page to post personal information, updates, and so on about things going on in my life.  Stay tuned here for updated information, resume, and other articles I will be publishing here.  A good number of things that I have posted on Cyberpunkz.org will be mirrored here.  So enjoy the read.  -rob

      In the next few weeks I will be posting bits and pieces of a book I am writing to a website I currently haven't been using for anything.  I am attempting to come up with some of my own ideas of a whole new age of vampires in the technological era to come.  Something semi "futuristic" but at the same time retaining the basis of vampires as they have been known throughout one story after another for ages now.  I certainly hope that those of you interested in these types of things will feel free to contribute your thoughts and ideas as I start posting portions of the book to the website.  For obvious reasons I will not post the entire thing online as I plan to push it to be published at some point in time.  I don't expect it to be a fast process because of work, school, and other personal related issues that I have to deal with in my real life outside of the internet.  So with what time I will have to dedicate to this effort I certainly hope those of you that do read portions of it will email me back and let me know what you think of the materials that I will be posting.  The more credible feedback I get the better I hope to make the book for those to read it in it's complete form.

      So for the last several months I have been debating going back to school and finally the end of June I decided to commit to this decision.  The problem came in trying to figure out where to go and how to do it.  Time is such a precious thing and needing flexibility to go to work was also a huge factor in this decision.  I ended up opting for University of Phoenix since I could do the FlexNet schooling and have time to do what I needed for work and other events such as seeing family and what not.  It's a fairly decent program from the looks of things and even though it's not the top rated school, if I can get my BS taken care of I can study my for my Master elsewhere if I don't like the classes for the MBA level schooling.  All in all I think I've made the right choice.  I can't say that I am feeling comfortable with all of it but at least I am putting an effort into this and attempting to make a progressive move for my future that could help secure my career with a reputable company in the future.  The only thing I can do is hope and work to better myself each and every day.
