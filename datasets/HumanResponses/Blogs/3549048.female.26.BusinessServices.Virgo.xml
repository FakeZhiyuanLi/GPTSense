      So, broke up with dick head Jon a couple weeks ago... turns out he didn't want to be with a girl with a kid... well, that would be ME!  But, that's ok cuz I was only in it to get laid and OMG... could not get worse!!!  Lets just say now I know why we 'don't go back'!!!  Am still seeing my little hottie from ERAU on occasion... when needed. ;)  Which is, basically, as often as our two busy schedules will permit.    I'm taking the summer off but will be going to Yavapai this fall.  All the classes I wanted to take were full so I ended up in a couple blow-off classes just to keep the grant money coming in until next semester when I can get the ones I wanted.  It would help my "scholastic progress" if I had ANY clue what I want to do with my life.  Apparently there's no majoring in "buzzed" allowed...   Fourth of July is coming up soon... which, around here, means the annual rodeo-cowboy-fest.  There's something perpetually creepy about white men in tight pants BUT... considering that there's NOTHING else to do around here I'm gonna end up right in the middle of it all.  Should be fun, though... I guess.  I'll get to flirt with clueless young men (the cowboys NEVER know what to do with a girl like me) and I'll get to have an excuse to start drinking budweiser at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  Never know... it has potential.  Am going to make it my personal mission in life for the weekend to get my friend some ACTION.  It's just NOT RIGHT that there's a woman in the world who isn't gettin it GOOD an a regular basis.  If them fugly hos on Maury are gettin' laid then the rest of us should have our pick!  Besides, I'm tired of being the only one tellin' rugburn-glory-stories!  ;)  My 2 year divorce anniversary is coming up on the 24th.  Very mixed feelings about that.  Haven't talked to him in almost 4 months.  It's weird to know someone... and I mean KNOW someone... for 10 years and then just not talk to them anymore.  I know tht the ER trips and broken bones should deter me from wanting to talk to him but I can't help it for some reason.  It's always been me and him.   Like Ross & Rachel only with a dash of Springer thrown in... and a whole lot more headboard bangin. ;)  That's it for now... will write again...

      OK, so... Friday.  Went to see Harry Potter III.  It was good.  Was quite 'true' to the book.  Went to see it with Cody.  Had hoped to go with Jon, but he is no more.    I've got the car for the weekend so I won't be home AT ALL.  Which is good.  SO tired of these same walls.  I have an appointment with the massage therapist tomorrow... can't wait.  I'm always a good half an inch taller by the time I leave her place.  For $40 an hour it'd better be good.  Tomorrow night...night out.  Am going to hang out with a client and go see some bands play.  Should be a mellow night.  Am on the hunt for new skin, though, so you never know.  ;-)  94 degrees tomorrow... ouch... MTT for sure!  Till  then...
