        Everyone   out there can u all tell me wat is the&nbsp;  MEANING   of   F  R   I   E  N  D  S   or   F  R  I  E  N  D  S  H  I  P ??        &nbsp;    Ermmm to me it is a very stress thing if u make with a friends tat are bad or those are very irritating...        &nbsp;    As i say i am not picky with friends but i still wanna say wat is the meaning of  GOOD FRIENDS  ...  To me is not those sharing thing together is whenever which parties happen something or feeling  moody &nbsp; show care to them...       Y i say tat is becos i have this kind of problem before, when i am feeling  moody , i really had this feeling of wanting people to at least jus ask me  ARE U OK!!!  But it is so hard to do tat cos people really dun know how u feel everyday or everytime...Maybe they have ask u but u are not feeling  moody  at tat time so u answer as  NO  i am not feeling  moody ...Then they will treats it as u will not be  moody  anymore from there onwards but tat not the true...      It does not mean today u are not  moody  tomorrow u will not be  moody  rite??      But i wun angry with me friends cos they are still caring with me but as i say sometime i really need them to jus say ARE U ALRIGHT !!! to me only...      So people out there if u saw wat i have wrote here, start to care for ur  F  R  I E   N D   S  cos in ur  whole&nbsp;world  u can only trust ur  PARENTS  and  FRIENDS  cos they the only person u can talk to...So show them u are still caring for them...    At least ask them how u feel today izzit fine??? Cos u dunnoe who might be the one tat need care, and they might be happy too...      Ok people pls give me comment if u got anything to tell me...
