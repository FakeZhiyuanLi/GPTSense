      Time to try blogging I guess. I remember my friend Mario showing me Mosiac in the early 90's at work (I've worked at IBM since 1986)and wondering if this World Wide Web thing would take off. We'd been using email and instant messaging on the mainframe through the 80's but the world at large hadn't experienced it yet. And now it's come to this. I could never have predicted blogging technology back then.  Well I got married at easter, see  urlLink Jo and Alan's Wedding  for some pictures. It worked out really well, I had proposed to Jo back in January. We met at  urlLink Strathvea  in 1996; a group of us have been going there for Easter every year since the early 90's. We thought it would be right to get married there, but of course many friends and family wouldn't be there, so we're holding the reception in July to celebrate with all those people. Best of both worlds really. The wedding was great, couldn't have been a more perfect day for us really - and we did catch everyone by surprise, which was the main aim!

      I'm spending my days at the moment working from home. Since Jo is now working full time that means she heads off every morning at 7:30 and I spend the day doing the grocery shopping, or laundry, etc. I really miss the days when she was working part time and we could go out for lunch or coffee during the daytime. Of course I do actually work when I'm at home; it's just a nicer environment to be able to sit on the verandah with the wireless laptop to do my email, or watch TV as I edit course notes. Right now I'm watching the Czech Republic whoop the asses of Denmark in the replay of the last Euro 2004 quarter final. Poor Danes - I am one quarter Danish so I would have liked them to win, but the Czechs look just too good. Two weeks until our wedding reception, really looking forward to it. And the week off afterwards as well of course!

      Just watched England win (shakily) against Switzerland in their group match. Soccer is the only sport I'll support the poms in, and it's a nightmare supporting them! They managed to lose 2 - 1 to France the other day after leading at the 90 minute mark. Now France are playing Croatia .. I had a few hours sleep but I have been up since 11:30 pm. For some reason I find watching the games live so much more exciting, it seems worth it to miss the sleep. Guess I need to get in training for the baby anyway. Bun is coming up on 14 weeks, and we have 4 weeks until our reception, which will be an interesting event. More surprises for the attendees! Hehe. My plan is to announce the baby to the world as part of my speech at the wedding reception. Should see a few jaws drop then I think. This weekend we head to Sydney for the night on Saturday to see Australia - Scotland rugby test, and the following weekend we have tickets for Australia - England rugby at Suncorp Stadium. Lots of sport at the moment!

      Second last day in Bangkok - the food is good, having fun so far. They've cleaned up the streets a lot since I was last here! Traffic is still ridiculous, but manageable. Jo had the nuchal scan of  Bun  on Tuesday, I was presenting to a class but waiting nervously for an SMS on my mobile phone. Anyway, it was good news .. easiest thing is to give her report:   Whew!  I was a little worked up of course and then they called to tell me they were running about an hour behind schedule.  When I got there, I still had to wait another 20 minutes.  There were three other ladies waiting each  with their husband so I felt very lonely hehe.  Then another woman walked in and I thought "beaut, I'm not the only abandoned one here" .. but then she called her hubby and said he had 15 minutes to get there.  Oh well, you'll  just have to be there for the next visit!  The good news is, I have a video tape of the ultrasound .. which is just as well because the three printouts I have are really hard to work out.   Although it will still be difficult to understand what you're looking at on the video without the operator saying here's this or that.  And the really cool thing was being able to look at Bun in 3D!!  Bun was lying in a perfect position for the nuchal translucency scan so Theresa got that measurement first.  Then she went scooting around looking at Bun's heart (fluttering away very obviously), stomach and bladder (I took her word for those two!).  She also showed me Bun's legs and arms so he/she got full marks for having everything where it should be!  Bun's arms were covering the face for a lot of the time (shy already) but near the end he/she had a wriggle around and it looked way cool.  Apparently Bun is lying anterior (towards the front) so we won't feel any movements for quite some time - probably not til around 20 weeks whereas a posterior baby can be felt from about 17 weeks.  I'll read up on this though.  Anyway, then I went off and emptied my bladder (ahh) and Theresa prepared the results.  She called me into an office soon after and straight away said they were excellent results.  She sat me down with a flowchart of options.   Just walking in without any tests, my chances of having a Down's Syndrome baby were 1 in 139.  That's based primarily on my age.  Then the baby's age, my blood test results and the nuchal scan get taken into account and I had a nearly tenfold reduction in risk (1 in 1,385).  A perfect score for me would have been 1 in 1,390 but Theresa said she's never seen a perfect score so my result is pretty awesome.  We went through the flowchart which I'll have to show you rather than try to explain.  However, I'm booked in for an amnio on Wed 7 July at 9.30am (groan) so that we can check all the other chromosomal combinations (as well as find out if Bun is a he or a she!).  Of course, we can skip the amnio altogether but we'd already agreed to have it so the excellent result today  probably doesn't change that decision.  I loved your text message!  I smiled all the way back to the office.  xxxxx   So  woohoo!  is all I can say to that - go Jo and Bun! hehe.

      I'm writing this on QF 001 as I wing my way towards Bangkok, where I have to spend the next week for work. At last QANTAS have introduced laptop power in business class as part of their new SkyBeds. yay. Previously I was dependent on the laptop battery life, not good when I do so many long business trips. I'm not happy leaving Jo and Bun for a week, right in the critical 13th week too, the end of the first trimester. But I suppose I have to pay the bills somehow and soon we'll be back on one income. It's 16 years since I was in Bangkok - in 1988 I was awarded an IBM Marketing Excellence Award which means you get to go to the IBM Recognition Event. Back in the 80's they were pretty impressive events. My friend Steve Ferreira and I took the opportunity to cash in the airfare and do some travelling in Europe first - we stayed with friends in London, Richard Thompson and his wife (Richard died of a brain tumour last year). Then we hired a car and drove around England (a trip that I repeated in 1992 with my friends Drew Morgan and Rob Gray). We flew to Paris from Heathrow, spent a few days there (Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, Louvre, etc), and caught the TGV bullet train to Marseille. From there we picked up another car, drove along the Riveria through Nice to Monaco, then over the Alps to Geneva, Switzerland. From there we drove through Austria to Germany - Munich and finally Frankfurt from where we flew (eventually) to Bangkok for the Recognition Event. There, I was actually leading back to my original point. Anyway now that I'm thinking of my previous trip I should jot down the significant memories from that trip. We went to evensong in Westminster Abbey, just wandered in accidentally around sunset. Beautiful, ethereal atmosphere. In Paris we found a restaurant called "La Reine du Caves" where two pretty french girls let us flirt with them and signed a card for us "Bissous xx". The station master in Paris refused to understand my french and wouldn't talk in english until it was clear I wasn't going to move until we got our boarding tickets. In Marseille we were afraid the French Mafia would get us. In Nice we blundered into Carnivale and partied on the streets. A woman hit our hire car from behind in Nice and since the only french I knew for that situation was "d'accord" we let her drive away. We returned the car in Frankfurt - the car company never complained, thank God! Since we didn't see the Alps on our road map we ended up getting in to Geneva very late, and had no Swiss currency. We ate McDonald's on our hotel beds, and went to a very seedy "Casino" that we found while wandering the streets. Munich was beautiful: palaces and old saint's bones are my strongest memory. And staggering across the square from the beer hall, dropping and smashing the glass stein we'd stolen.  We went to Dachua concentration camp. Grey, stony, and I felt sick. We flew out of Frankfurt airport, and it was just after the Lockerbie bombing so airline security was greatly upgraded. Our plane started to taxi and an engine failed - I ended up being put on a Lufthansa flight to Bangkok instead, which entailed a 9 hour wait in Frankfurt airport. I didn't speak German, and when boarding the security guard ripped open my carefully gift-wrapped Swiss Army Knife which I'd bought in Geneva, said "Good knife!" and gave it back to me. I couldn't understand the German announcements but followed the rest of the passengers out on to the tarmac where you were supposed to identify your bag before they would load it into the plane. Of course mine wasn't there, it was probably still on the British Airways plane that was getting its engine replaced. They let me on the plane, but 12 hours later I was in steaming Bangkok with the clothes on my back and nothing else for 2 days until they got my bag there. So let's hope this trip is more comfortable!

      Today Jo and I went for our second appointment at the obstetrician. We went a month ago for the first time, but  Bun  was only 7 weeks old at that stage and that's a bit early to start talking about being pregnant on a public forum! Everything seems to be going well though, so I thought I'd start a journal of what happens for a father through a pregnancy. What the heck is a  Bun  you may ask? Well it seems to be a good idea to have a code name for a baby before it's born, makes it easier to talk about. So as near as we can figure  Bun  was conceived on or around Saturday 27 March 2004. On that day we went to a wedding of our friends Cherie and Curtis at  urlLink Bundaleer Rainforest Gardens , and  Bun  is the oven, so to speak, so that's how the name came about. Incidentally also on that day  urlLink Campbell Newman  was elected Lord Mayor of Brisbane (so we had to vote too - what a busy day that was! Hehe). For some reason Jo resisted my idea of  Campbell  as a codename though.  Bun  it is.  Anyhow, that makes  Bun  11.5 weeks or so today, and today we got to hear the heartbeat, thumping loud and strong in amongst all Jo's gurgling bowel noises (lol). Well I guess we were waiting for lunch at the time. A month ago the doctor had done an ultrasound so I got to see the heartbeat way back then as well. There's not too much at 7 weeks, just a blinking pixel on the screen, but Dr Bretz assured me it was good strong heartbeat. So far so good!  Jo of course is a legend champion mother - no morning sickness, no strange cravings. Of course she could be having symptoms and she'd never tell you, but I think she's had an easy time of it so far. Fingers crossed that can keep going! She's doing some Pilates exercises a few times a week to stay in shape for the birth - that woman plans ahead.   Next week I have to travel to Thailand for work, which is bad because week 12 is when you have the first major scan called a  urlLink Nuchal scan . Nuchal means neck, it's a test where they where they measure the thickness of the back of the neck and it can help identify  urlLink Down syndrome . At Jo's age there's around a 1 in 300 chance this could happen, so we will be quite nervous about the outcome of that test. At this stage all I want to hear is "Normal, Average, Par". We don't have to be super human, let's just be OK. It's a nervy time. Once the first trimester is over (13 weeks) the baby has completed initial development and things are set in place. I look forward to coming back from Thailand, watching  urlLink Euro 2004 , and celebrating making it to 13 weeks with Jo. Then we will breathe a little easier.

      On a QANTAS plane to LA at the moment, enroute to Seattle WA for a week of work. This week (the week after the reception) we took holidays and spent most of the time up at Bribie Island in an apartment with Jo's parents John and Denise. Very relaxing, days of reading, crosswords, or watching DVDs with the occasional outing to eat dinner at a restaurant or watch a movie (we saw  Spiderman 2  at the Bribie Island cinema - I think we were the only people in the cinema!). Now, unfortunately, I have to work in the IBM Office in Seattle. We're writing the Certification Exams for the  IBM Certified Sales Specialist - xSeries  certification, which is quite a hard job. The exam is used worldwide to qualify sales people to sell the IBM xSeries servers and ... oh you don't really care about this do you? Anyway .. I'm looking forward to getting back home already. We have our big Bun scan on the 27th. Fingers crossed.

      Well at  long last we had our Wedding Reception at the  urlLink Brisbane Marriott  on Saturday night, 10 July. It was exactly 3 months after our wedding ceremony, but we got to share and celebrate with all the family and friends who weren't around for the ceremony because it&nbsp;had been&nbsp;a surprise.   A truly excellent night - Jo had organised candles, lighting, and draping on the ceiling of the room so it looked beautiful. We had about 80 guests on&nbsp;nine tables which were themed as the Solar System - "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", etc etc to "Pluto".   Jo and I stayed the Friday night in the hotel using some of my Marriott points, and on Saturday they upgraded us to the Presidential Suite of the hotel - very nice! Also our parents and many of our friends took the opportunity to stay in the hotel for Saturday night so I'm sure many of them had a great time. We certainly had the night of our lives!   Our MC,  urlLink Calvin Bradshaw , had to rush to hospital on the Saturday morning (poor Calvin and Mae, we're so sorry that they missed the event) but thankfully Jo's younger brother Tim stepped in at the eleventh hour and filled in doing a fantastic and professional job. I feel guilty because I think he was so stressed out on Saturday that he didn't get to enjoy the night! But thank you Tim!    We had a slideshow going through the dinner showing pictures of our lives together and in particular our times at Strathvea and our Wedding Ceremony. The speeches were all heartfelt: my dad Bruce Waite spoke and welcomed Jo to the family, Jo's father John Pike gave a great speech and toast, Tim Pike spoke lovingly of his sister, and Jo spoke and proposed a toast to absent friends. we cut our wedding cake which was a very nice white chocolate mud cake, and that was distributed as dessert.   Then I did my speech, which of course culminated in our now customary surprise announcement - that we were pregnant, and  Bun  is due in December. I introduced my sister  urlLink Jen , who performed one of her new original songs  "Love Comes Falling"  while Jo and I danced our bridal waltz. Beautiful. Finally the DJ started and we danced to the songs from our youth in the 80's and 90's until they kicked us out of the room. Jo and I went upstairs and just talked until about 2 AM, we were so buzzed up.   Photos of the magical evening will be available soon, when I get around to organising them! &nbsp;
