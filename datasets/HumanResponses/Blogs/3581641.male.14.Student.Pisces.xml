       Welcome to 9694 Photo! On this Blog I post some of my best Pohtography, Give Photo tips, and recieve feedback on the pictures I post here. I am in High School, so there is not much time to take many pictures. I usually take shots of nature, but other times I will have sports shots. I'm taking a photography class at school, so I hope to get better. You can e-mail your photography to me and, if you want, I can Post It here as a Guest Photo. My E-Mail Is  urlLink j_knight@att.net .
