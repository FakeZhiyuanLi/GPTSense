      Sometimes human relationships are just a great mystery. How do you explain chemistry? The synchronocity of movements and thoughts, Is a gift from the man above. To remind that life is magical, and full of pleasant surprises.  At that very same moment, it brought both of us near. Even while I'm on a train, and you on your path home. We were so close, never really leaving each other.  Why did you look up? why did I look down?  I cannot find an explanation for this. I do not intend to. I just need to feel. Let life work its own magic. =)

      Well... The econs test was pretty ok..  Hehez.. am glad its over... But oh boy... project deadlines and exams coming right up!  My ex bf 'D'called me to ask me out for coffee as he was around my place while working... He's doing sales now..  GOd.. the nerve he has.. I really have no idea.. I'm so surprised! I never thought he'll call me... Since we both broke up in a very messy manner, I thought maybe he felt bad and wanted to be friends.. But I don't think I'll meet him.. thank you very much.. Its just all very awkward for me..   I'm also facing some racial issues among my project mates.. But there is really some misunderstanding.. Why do some people from minority races think that we put them down for their skin color, when what we are unhappy about is their working attitudes? If they say we are being racist, then aren't they being the same for categorising themselves when we have never thought about that ourselves? ANyway I do not care anymore that I have to kiss other people's asses to make them feel better.. I have to take care of my own.. That's life... Food for thought.. I have to learn to protect myself and not be made used of.. I have to learn not to be worried about other people's feelings when they have no regard for mine..  Anyway I'm going to sleep now.. Tomorrow is another project day.. Nite =)

      A guy from my past came running back into my life recently.. What is the point of regret? I ask, Both him and me.  The objective in life is to look forward Nothing is stagnant, everything changes What is left are the memories.. Faces that once brought us above and beyond. Are vividly imprinted in our minds..  However hard you fall,  No matter how much he had hurt you.. They are just past tense...  When you miss that chance, you miss it forever.. It hurts both ways.. Somehow I hurt too.  But it took me here. What's left to regret? I ask myself again.  Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow. Yesterday is far, and distant Memories makes it seem so near. Future seems to beckon to me, reassuring me that its alright. And I move on today. I hope you do too.

      This is what I learnt today. The definitions for a soulmate are: 1. Can you have a fantastic day with this person by literally doing nothing? 2. Are you able to do something as simple as having dinner together, and yet feel inspired by the effect that this person has on you?  With her, I stand firm to persist in staying as myself. As she never fail to remind me of what really matters in life.  I am fortunate to have met such a wonderful person to be my comrade in this voyage we call life. Stay walking with me, k?  Thanks. =)

      I had a great day, I must say.. Don's extra nice today... Apologised for sleeping through yesterday and ignoring me.. Went home and stared at the stars on my way back.. HAha... Looked like an idiot with a grin on my face.. And I bought Conduct Zero vcd too.. The show we watched together on our first date.. His mom cooks really divine fried rice... With sprinkled bacon bits on top.. Sinful but nice.... yum yum.. Wish I can cook like her...  K.. gonna watch more tv now..nite!   Love is not blind - it sees more, not less. But because it sees more, it is willing to see less. Rabbi Julius Gordon

      Have you ever wished that you were somewhere else instead of right here? Well that practically sums up my whole day... Spent my Saturday in total boredom Went for lecture then read a 50 page paper.. Original plan was to go shopping at Bugis together with bf. But he had a cross country run today.. Thus, I decided to be a good girlfriend and let him have a good rest. See the halo on my head? I earned it! I'm an angel... A fallen angel.. Hell I wish I was the devil... I might have more fun.. =p  Anyway my investment lecturer is a very perculiar guy.. Have you ever wondered why ancient chinese vampires (jiang shi) hops? According to him, it started in the Song dynasty. The vampires were actually soldiers who were sent for wars in foreign lands When they got killed, these soldiers would get their bodies returned to their hometowns. The chinese believed that deadbodies need to be transported back to their hometowns so that they can be reincarnated and not be wandering ghosts. The legs of these dead bodies would be tied with a name tag at the end when they are being transported back. However, the bodies would only be transported at night as they have a stench and also to prevent frightening the villagers. These transporters would carry a bell and ring it as a sign to instruct villagers to close their windows and stay indoors while they transport the bodies.  Therefore, taoists use these bells to 'call' spirits now. They also use a whip for their horses.. Thus, those villagers hiding inside their houses would imagine that the 'spirits' are hopping their way home to the whipping sound and the ringing of the bells.. However, he told us that the traditional Jiang Shi do not suck blood, its the Hong Kong shows and western influence of vampires that evolved into the Jiang Shi we know now..  hehe.. Interesting investment theories dun cha think? Anyway just food for thought..  Loneliness seem to exist in many different forms There are still periods of loneliness even when one is in a relationship.. Don't you think?  I wish Sunday would be a better day.. Am crossing my fingers here...

      I just got back from my economics lecture.. Feeling quite good with my new haircut... Sashaying down the mrt escalator like I'm some princess.. Actually its because I'm late so I had to rush down the escalator.. hehe...  Something really embarrasing happened today. I was printing some stuff out in the lab.. As I still have not had my lunch, my stomach started growling! There were these 2 guys beside me and I heard one ask the other;"hey are you hungry? Wanna go eat something?" Then silence for a while n I heard some murmuring... Eeeks! Ah agony! the pain of embarrasement!!  Then I still had to stand right there and pretend that it wasn't me as the bloody printer is still not finished yet... I couldn't even dare look behind to see if they were pointing at me or what... Somehow I feel they were! Why? Why god? Why do these mah lu stuff always happen to me? N I was feeling so babelicious with my new haircut! Then this have to happen!  Saw this gal wearing one of those pink j-pop pleated short skirt today...  Singapore's been invaded by J-pop wannabes who all think they look like Jolin Tsai or Ayumi... Bright pink with bright green?? Big dangly pink earrings to go with that? eeks... yuck.. puke...   Nuff said... I'm going to study now for my investment test tomorrow.. See ya! =)

      Went for a haircut today in the afternoon... Hehez.. feeling quite good now as my hair dun tickle my neck anymore.. My hair looks more like a bob now.. I was puttiing off cutting my hair to save money.. But my mother looked at me today and said..  'Ah hui ah go have a haircut. your hair is covering your eyes already and its long behind your neck also! You look very untidy..'  Seeing my hesitant face she knew exactly what stopped me from going.. Then she shoved me 15 bucks tell me go go go.. Ahh.... I love my mother... There's no one in this world who would have more love for me..  The hairstylist was pretty funny with his malaysian accent...  He's a little on the 'soft' side as most male hairstylists are.. But he's a ok chap... really chatty guy blabbering non stop about taiwanese variety shows... hah... he actually think that I'm a secondary school student! Sad....  My brother's girlfriend took mc again today and stayed at our place the whole day.. I wonder when my bro is gonna marry her.. He's already 32! Pah... Men have longer 'shelf life'...  I have to go study for my investment test on thursday.. I shouldn't complain.. Its a blessing to have a chance to study.. But it really really sucks! Praying that the test would be smooth sailing..

      Just got back from Don's place.. There was this really noisy malay couple with 2 kids on the bus stop Both of them had tattoos on their bodies and looked pretty young to have so many children.. The kids were acting like the little rascals... which made my phobia to have kids even stronger...  Eeks! but I gotta have kids one day don't I?  Anyway its more 'profitable' to be married and have kids in Singapore nowadays than be single! Check out all the benefits and paid leave.. Poor singles would have to slog it out while the other happy mothers take their leave to give birth ... ;while the workload is piled up on the singles, working late and being stressed out.. Worse still.. nobody actually feels sorry for them..  who ask them? go n reproduce la! haha... I dunno which side I'm gonna be on... Me going to pray that there's someone willing to sign the 'contract' for life with me..=p  Although the malay couple looked poor to me and totally stressed out... The mother has this really washed out and sian face most mothers have... But she seem to be happy.. When the hubby looked and smiled at his wife while their baby gal made faces at the other passengers and was creating havoc with her brother.. I can see the love oozing out when they looked at each other man.. They look so proud that they had produced this gem from their love.. To them la... To the others the little gal was like an irritant or a bad itchy rash.. Most of the passengers were having post monday blues as it was sunday nite n most wanted to sleep on the bus.. Isn't that what life is about?  Love? instead of money money and money? Call me a dreamer but just let me be that for today.. What the hell.. I'm tired so i'm going to dream now.. Oh me goodness I'm so lame...  K nite blog..

      Tired as hell now.. Went for morning lecture.. was late by half an hour.. but who cares, the lecturer was late himself.. Then went to do project as suggested by yanjun..   Tomorrow is Mel's first day of school... just wanna wish her good luck for her first day... but when i got home it was too late! I wonder if i am able to wake up early tomorrow to call her just before she leaves for school.. Who has lecture on Sunday?? My poor gal.. My life is not so great having lecture on Saturday too...  I went to orchard today to meet Donovan... Am so happy to meet him since I only get to see his king kong face once per week.. Anyway we went to the esplanade The date with him was one of the best today... Normally I just hang in his place... not that its bad or anything but today was something more special.. Pity I was having period so I felt pretty uncomfortable sitting on the rocks! haha.. =p  Received an sms from Daphne my long lost poly friend.. Really surprised to hear from her.. Am really glad that she remembered me.. I really miss her sometimes... But I guess that's what happens to friends when u grow older.. As in we all have so much to do and so little time... But what's important is that our paths crossed.. Friends... one word but means so different as you grow older I find that I no longer need to cling to them as hard as I used to anymore.. What's important is the ride, the experience, and not possession.. That you had played a part in their lifes, and them to my own too.. Life is about experiences.. and I damn well intend to have alot of that stuff before I am 'recycled'. hehez...  Anyway I think I gotta go to bed soon..going over to Don's place tomorrow  Byebye

My best friend Mel tells me that its absolutely fine to go.. But seems like my body can't take it.. was rolling on the bed all day after going.. Am never gonna do that anymore!! We went to this JAcuzzi where only Mega gym members were allowed in It was really relaxing in the hot jacuzzi.. then i went into the cold one... ohh... felt so good but now have to suffer the consequences man  My stomach still hurts alot and my back is aching really bad... Yikes tomorrow still gotta do project after my investment class. Gotta go.. see u my blog

      One more paper down! Last exam paper would be on monday! I hope I do well, though I didn't get to finish the paper Missed a question so that's 4 marks down the drain..  Went to watch 50 first dates today.. Enjoyed that movie totally, Its funny and yet leaves a fairy tale kind of sweetness.. Don't we all need a little fantasy in our mundane and monotonous existence?? Or is it only me and my exam moodswings that need that?=) Hahaz... Not gonna waste my brainjuice pondering over it...  There is a yakun kaya toast stall in Northpoint now! AH.... Bless kaya toast... I feel that Yakun is a great place for hanging out and catching up with friends.. Come on, how much do we have to spend in Starbucks? A glass of barley water only costs a $1.30 in Yakun, and the seats are not bad too, value for money. Call me uncool but I'll choose Yakun anytime over starbucks.. Well maybe one of the reasons is that I'm hyperallergic to caffine! I can never take too much coffee or I'll get edgy and hyper...  Lately, the clubbing streak in me seems to be surfacing.. I miss the days when I would go Lox with M.. Dancing to Rnb, checking out guys, being checked out by guys.. Ya all that... PARTY!  I just found out from my brother that 90's music is considered to be retro now. Songs like Horny, Tubthumping and Don't call me baby... God I'm getting old.. And I thought retro was something like electric dreams or summerain!  I'm thinking of going to Devils Bar since my bro told me wednesday is ladies night.. Though the music is not that fantastic, I heard its pretty decent too.. And the place is nicely done up with a good atmosphere..  Ah.. Ok got to wake up.. HAve to strive for exams n projects.. Till then...  Toil now, play later la!

      My all time favourite song  Where Is The Love? Black Eyed Peas  What's wrong with the world, mama People livin' like they ain't got no mamas I think the whole world addicted to the drama Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah Badness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how a nigga works and operates Nigga, you gotta have love just to set it straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach And would you turn the other cheek  Father, Father, Father help us Send us some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (Love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love The love, the love  It just ain't the same, always unchanged New days are strange, is the world insane If love and peace is so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug If you never know truth then you never know love Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't really know) Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't really know) Where's the love, y'all  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach And would you turn the other cheek  Father, Father, Father help us Send us some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (Love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (Love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love The love, the love  I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder Most of us only care about money makin' Selfishness got us followin' our own direction Wrong information always shown by the media Negative images is the main criteria Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria Kids act like what they see in the cinema Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity Whatever happened to the fairness in equality Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive to lovers bound, and ask yourself...

      The worst is over.. Investment Exam is OVER! The paper is a well known serial killer, thus, I'm aiming for a pass.. Everyone was in a bad mood after the paper. I left the hall half an hour early. What is the point of staying when I have written down everything that I knew?Feeling very edgy, I called M.. It was comforting to hear her voice, even if we didn't get to say much... After the phonecall, I felt better.. Bless... Eveyone needs a friend.. =)  Janet called me on my mobile and said she couldn't answer the calculation questions.. She was panicking and kept asking me what will happen if she fails her major? Well, my opinion is that she's not the only one who finds the paper hard.. Even LCW; the 'super smart, bao ka liao in project' guy had a gloomy look on his face after the paper. So I pray that the lecturer will be more lenient..  One more thing, I just found out that the 'joker' in our lecture has a nick name for me. Miss fidgetey! I heard him calling me that when I sat down! well I can't help fidgeting on my chair during exams when I'm nervous! I thought it wasn't that noticable, but seems like he noticed! Damn that guy, I hope he fails! Curse his paper, may he forget everything he learnt haha...  2 more papers and a major project deadline to go May 13 is the day to my freedom,  Exams, check, Projects, check.. all done! May 13, My own christmas! =)  Then its Bintan! Here I come! Beware!

      Argh.. Help! Mindblock! I seem to be suffering from the brainfreeze syndrome.. No matter how hard I try, I can't get anything into my brain! I seem to be staring more at the books than I study.. Eeek! Nothing seems to make sense...  Am I getting old? My memory is failing me...  God I hate theories..  What is the point? You try to cram everything into your brain, vomit them out for exams then whooosh! They are out of your life forever....  Theories are only the 'feeder bus' passengers of your brain! What is the point I ask? I hope, I pine, I relish the day when there are no more wasteful management theories that devours our youth away.. Argh...  Forgive me everybody,  Its the exams!

      exams! ahh...  Woke up to find that I have 3 more days to doomsday... My mom's been close with a neighbour lately She's one of those modern moms, which is very unlike my mom.. N I saw the change yesterday! My mom tailor made a top which is quite revealing I must say! The first time I saw my mom looked like that! But I thought it looked pretty elegant on her.. Love my mom, she deserve to have a bit of fun after so much hard work  hheez.. the power of friends... =) smiles

      Exams exams exams... Argh...  Though I managed to catch an eye for a guy yesterday.. I actually find the show quite entertaining! I can't help but enjoy myself watching all these guys bitching. And Rachel sure has nice 'racks'.. Well, I thought she did Singapore proud by showing the well endowed foreigners that we are not to be trifled with! =p  The highlight of the show is still about da guys in my opinion though.. Liked the silver bracelet that one of the dudes gave her as a present.. At that moment, I wished I was her.. Come on, don't lie ladies, I'm sure you love to be worshipped. Its evident all the way back to Cleopatra..  Watching that ang mo cringe when Rachel tells him that her friend saw him with his girlfriend is pure justice brought onto tv.. I thought that guy was an arrogant SOAB. He reminded me of some of the ang mors at clubs.. Sleazy! Some of them really have no respect for asian ladies, thinking that they can score with any chick they want.. Just because they are white.. Thanks alot SPGs!  Sorry, but I would rather have my true blue Singaporean guy, no matter how boring he may be. Sincerity always wins the lady's heart at the end of the day... And presents too!  haha...   Love her bracelet.  Think I'm gonna get Don to buy me one.. Worship me you unworthy one!! hhaha... I'm praying that he doesn't read this EVER!

      I had a great weekend.. I'm now well rested and all prepared to conquer the stress of my coming exams!  Here's what I did on saturday:   1. Went to watch HellBoy  A very entertaining movie... It's much longer than I expected; over 2 hours..  And we did not go dutch this time! Don just got his humble pay from the army... hehez...    2. Went shopping  Saw this really cool pair of 'supalow' jeans at Giordano. I had wanted to buy it through Judy for the 20 percent staff discount. However I was not able to contact her, thus will have to keep it under KIV. It is a great buy for 50 bucks, & after the 20% discount it will be a killer buy! Love the color too, sort of a replica of tab1 Levi's..  Don bought me a halter top from B.U.M. Very pretty one with rainbow stripes and a adjustable strap in front.. Cheap too... only costs 15 buckeroos.. One more to add to my wardrobe..  Yippee!=p   3. A walk at the esplanade  This is the highlight of my weekend... Me and Don shared a really special evening taking a walk down the esplanade.. There was a band playing and they sounded fantastic. The lead singer sounded alot like Tom Jones.. Really sexy.. =p  We spent a wonderful time just chatting, enjoying the breezy weather.. It has been so hot lately, thank god for cooler evenings..  Shared lemonade together bought from one of those mobile food vans..  He was wearing what I like too, checkers short sleeve shirt with jeans and sneakers... I know he hates to wear shirts, and that he is wearing that for me.. I appreciated that.. =)  I told him that the espanade was my solace, a place where I have many many fond memories of.. Most with my best pal, and also my other mates too... He nods his head and listens.. smiles...  We talked about our future He told me how many kids he wants and where he intend to go for our honeymoon.. Which country he is bringing me to for our first holiday trip when he starts working... Haha.. call me a dreamer for planning too early, but I think I'm too much in love to know rationality..  Ah.. bless.. I love lemonade!

      Its 9.15pm now...  I'm currently listening to the new jazz compilation my bro bought.. Lately, I have developed a liking for Gold 90.5 FM.. Sometimes, I will switch to that station on my handphone and stop there   Am I getting old? I really hope not...  Jazz... my new love... Bless.. =)    I wish you love [Lisa Ono]   I wish you bluebirds in the Spring  To give your heart a song to sing  And then a kiss, but more than this,  I wish you love   And in July a lemonade  To cool you in some leafy glade  I wish you health, and more than wealth,  I wish you love   My breaking heart and I agree  That you and I could never ever be  So with my best, my very best,  I set you free   I wish you shelter from the storm  A cozy fire to keep you warm  But most of all  When snowflakes fall, I wish you love   My breaking heart and I agree  That you and I could never ever be  So with my best, my very best,  I set you free   I wish you shelter from the storm  A cozy fire to keep you warm  But most of all  When snowflakes fall, I wish you love   When snowflakes fall, I wish you love  When snowflakes fall, I wish you love  When snowflakes fall, I wish you love...

      Sometimes in life, just a few things are more than enough to make you happy. Blue skies, Sun shine, Best buddy... And a swimming complex... All for a mere amount of 50 cents  (I still pay children's tickets to the public pool, never yet been caught! haha)  I'm going on a trip to bintan with my family from May19-21.. Yippee!  Asked my best buddies J and M along... Really really hope that they can make it! M says that she has a project to hand up.. Hopefully she will be able to finish everything by then and go with me..  Its wierd that I'm actually feeling bored when my projects are done.. One more to go! Oh I forgot.. and exams too.. sheesh...  Think I gonna go take a nap.. It's been ages since I get to sleep properly.. Nitenite

      These few days have been absolute hell for me! I stayed at my project mate place till 11.30pm on sunday Got home around 1pm... Then had another morning lecture on monday.. More project after lecture.. Life sucks! And there's been alot of misunderstanding going on with my project members anyway.. The common case of the free riders syndrome.. One of the project members have not been consistent with her work.. This is causing alot of unhappiness among those that have high expectations to score for the exam.. And now I have to act as a middleman.. What am I supposed to do? Argh..  They are thinking of not putting her name down in the project n letting her fail. I guess I just have to take things one step at a time.. I will prevail! Just do my work and talk only when I need to..  haha.. reduce the need to be in the spotlight.. I hate to be a middleman... Its really not much of my business from the way I see it.. Just do my work with the others.. until next semester.. Its bye bye to whoever is not contributing... I guess there would always be conflicts when working in groups.. Well I'm going off now.. bye

      We had a major quarrel again... He said he couldn't stand my wierd temper anymore... Told me he couldn't understand why I would keep quiet when I'm angry with him.. How the hell is he supposed to know why am I angry if I don't talk about it? I know I tend to shut down when I get hurt or angry.. But that is how I am.. I find it hard to tell him because I know he will shout at me anyway.. I actually went all the way from choa chu kang to hougang just to get to his place.. And he left me alone to play online games! And it seems like tv is more interesting than me... I feel so unappreciated... There is just no more surprises in our relationship anymore.. Its been really long since he had done anything special for me.. Even when I tell him about it, he would say that I'm being unreasonable again...  I was the one who initiated the breakup.. I told him that I don't believe I would not be able to find another guy who treat me better as he does...  Is everything my fault? That I always bottle everything up and cause fustration?  His last sms was he hope I can find another guy who can tolerate me for as long as he does. If there is such a guy around, that is.  How can he hurt me like this? How can he say something like that? I don't believe in love anymore..   Its over, I won't go around in circles anymore! Somebody pinch or trash me if I go back again... I mustn't!

      I'm tired, but I'm going to make myself type.. Because I want to write down everything that happened in Bintan.. Want to remember this experience forever...  It would be an understatement to say that I enjoyed myself in Bintan..  The sea is so crystal clear, you can practically see every fish or seashell in the water... This is the first time I have snorkelled, and I fell in love with it! Although I nearly drowned myself by swimming too far offshore... Eeks! I wasn't too familiar with the snorkelling equipment, water got into my snokell set, and I couldn't get it out.. Lucky I managed to swim back onshore!!!  But hey, that is not gonna stop me from snorkelling.. What's drinking a little sea water?? ITs totally worth it... I'll never forget swimming with the fishes around me.. Colourful tropical fishes... Reminds me of Nemo...  I feel like I'm one with nature.... Although I did see 2 jellyfishies! Eeks!! Avoided them as fast as I could... =)  There was once when my brother and I were sitting close to shore and there came a school of little fishes hovering around us! hehez.. They nibbled on my toes... hehez.. ticklish...  The bintan beach was practically empty while we were there... We had the whole beach to ourselves... And the view was spectacular... I'm sure gonna miss it so much...  And the stars! I have never really seen stars before my trip to bintan.. The nightsky was filled with stars.. big ones, tiny ones, all sparking bright..  The pub which is in the middle of the pool was so cool.. You could read sitting on the seats with your feet touching the water... The cocktail tasted wonderful.. I ordered a Bananarama... Yummy..  My brother took us for a ride on the banana boat.. I loved the speed of riding on the sea!  The guy on the speedboat was being naughty by constantly U'Turning the boat and letting us fall.. I fell three times!! Lucky I had my lifejacket on as I was in the middle of the sea.. But my butt hurt so much from each fall... yikes.. =)  The ride was so fast that J cried and had to be carried off.. I felt sorry for her, but she seemed pretty regretful that she missed it... I was consoling her and told her we can do other stuff.. It was sad that she couldn't join me in snorkelling as she can't swim.. But she soon cheered up anyway suntanning and picking up seashells!  The seashells were bigger than beaches in Singapore.. There is a type of sea coral called 'sea coins' They are so beautiful, with flowers inscribed by mother nature on the surface of each sea coin.. Picked a couple home for my friends.. Its hard to find perfect ones as they were pretty fragile and breaks easilly.. I got some near perfect ones nonetheless... Think I'm quite lucky. hehe..  Waking up in the morning with the coconut trees and the sea greeting you makes me wanna live there forever..  The islanders were pretty friendly too.. Even the gardeners greet you good morning..  My brother asked me if it was my first holiday trip.. I told him its my first trip to a beach.. He said not to worry, there will be plenty more in the future.. I certainly hope so! =)  I told him that I enjoyed myself so much.. Thanked him non stop... hehez..  Plenty more adventure awaits... I can't wait! Life is too short!

ABSOLUTELY ROCKS!!  It is worth every cent.. ahh... I love them! Very rock n roll... Reminds me of Oasis's old songs... The wondewall era... Ahh....  ROCK N ROLL FOREVER!!  Okok.. now I'll tell you what happened on friday.. I went clubbing on thursday with Jand found out what a fine piece of meat I am.. hahaha.... But I felt like a bimbo.. I actually let 2 guys i didn't know send me home!! I'm just damn lucky that they were pretty nice guys.. Was given a dressing down by Don when I told him about it.. I told him that J was in the car with me too.. He said, yeah, that's good, more meat for the wolves.. sheesh... Okie I was actually regretting it halfway.. Scared I must say.. Stupid gal!!! They told me that there is no nightbus.. But there is! I have not been clubbing for quite a while but they must have! Anyway I gave 2 guys my number in return so its not totally free.. BUt anyway they were pretty cool when I told them I am attached..  That's it. I'm never gonna be so gullible again.. I'm just god damn lucky..

      Presentations are finally over!! I didn't sleep a single wink last night... Stayed overnight at J's place finishing up the presentation.. We didn't even have time to rehearse for our presentation.. I'm glad everything went well...  I had to borrow formal clothing and shoes from my project mates! hehe.. it was funny wearing another person's clothes. But I think she chose a great outfit for me.. I was expecting they might choose something they hate for me.. haha.. Know that there are no true friends in SIM Each for his or her own.. I'm pretty fine with that actually.. Helps me prepare for the harsh working world in the future  It was hard having to finish everything within a night... But our presentation went quite well except for a few glitches... hehez... The lecturer liked my flash animation! SHe complimented that it was creative.. hehez... All the hardwork didn't go down the drain...  I just plopped onto my bed and slept for about 2 hours... Ah.. I miss my dear bed!  Its over! All the toiling is over! Bintan! 6 more days! Here I come!  =)

      argh.. actually I'm kind of tired now... Just finished my part of the project for now.. Still more to come! J says there is no need to meet up for project on sunday... Actually she n YJ is doing most of the project... sigh.. What can I do? YJ says she wants to use dreamweaver for presentation. Problem is I'm only familiar with front page! So she says she is going to get other ppl to do the job... I feel useless... Sigh...  Now I wanna talk about my best friend M... She is like an angel to me... Who never fails to influence me with her cheery and positive attitude.. There is no one who can bear to be down around you. You wouldn't allow that...  I think u can be a guru or muse u know.. hehez... Always able lifting people up from their sadness.. I have been taking the advice that you have been giving me.. And I'm cured from most of my pain.. When I am feeling sad, every conversation with you will start from tears and end with laughter. How do u do what you do?  Thank you gal.. You da gal~ Stay with me for life ya? =)  Black Eye Peas will be in Singapore on 25 may!!! And I only learnt about it after watching TV mobile on my way to Don's place! I can't afford to go!!! The pain! The pain of not being able to go! I love them! I adore them!! Argh!! Feels like an arm has been amputated!  Okie okie enough of my whining..  I woke up at 6.30 am, reached Don's place at 8.30am with breakfast. Cleaned up the whole room, gave him a massage too... I am learning to be a good gf.. Come on I should give myself credit.. I have always done stuff like that for him.. I only can hope he appreciates what I do...  D my ex msg me again yesterday at 2am for a chat! Haha.. as if i'll call him... 2am!! I do not care if he is lonely.. I'm not obliged to talk to him again.. After he has done me so much hurt in the past. I'm no saint!  Tomorrow is Mother's day!! I bought a nice meal for mom with a flower.. kept her company for the whole day... hehez... she seems to be happy... My brother's gf also bought her a bag. Ah... Everyone loves my mom... She is a great lady... hehe...   Anyway I pressurized Don into buying a present for his mom on mothers day.. He stopped buying pressies last year! So tml, I'm going to his place in the morning again.. And pry him out of the bed to go buy something for his mother... I wanna buy her something too because she cooks fantastic dinners for me all the time... Then I'll go home to my mummy again... I do not care if he is going to play mahjong tonight until 4 am... He better do something for his mom.. NO EXCUSES!  I just read YJ's blog and boy is she angry with A! She made alot of mistakes with her surveys.. And YJ totally blasted that girl to bits.. She cursed at A in her blog.. Now everyone knows.. Y? Y do things turn out like this? A said she didn't mean it.. Sigh.. Dun understand Y she made so much mistakes. Somehow I feel sorry for the whole thing.. I do not like situations like this.. Who does? But its inevitable... We are all humans! Not saints...    Take care blog...

      I patched up with Don... I apologised for my selfishness... I'm so confused right now.. He called me over the phone just a while ago.. He sounded different. Maybe I have hurt him too much. I asked him if everything would be the same again and he said yes. Am I heading for self destruction?  He told me while on that night we quarrelled, his ex called him. Shes in need of money fast... She got cheated of 10k by his boyfriend.. Don't ask me how...  Don say he's gonna lend her some money.. Since when he's schooling she helped him in his finances too...  I'm confused. What right do I have now to say anything? He assured me he just wan to repay her n nothing more. I guess I just have to trust him.  I'm taking this chance.  Isn't it ironic?  I think its karma. Never take someone for granted.  D my ex called me yesterday too... Said he broke up with his gf. That she treats him real bad. And he says its retribution. Is he refering about me? I have no idea. ANd I don't even care.  So Don did help me get over him. He did so much for me. I knew from yesterday that I didn't care 2 hoots about my ex anymore. No matter how charming or glib tongue he is. I just didn't care about him anymore. I feel resentment towards him. The nerve he has to call me n talk about his ex. I felt that I'm just wasting my time talking to him on the phone. Why the hell did he call? I couldn't even last 1/2 an hour talking to him. I told him I needed to sleep and hung up on him. At the end of the conversation, I was just looking forward to hang up. He's no longer interesting to me anymore. Why did I take so long to get over this jerk? Why didn't I treasure what I had?  I have no idea if it would be too late now. To treasure this relationship. But I'm taking this chance

      I am sitting here, at a loss. I'm devastated, and sad.  I broke up with Don yesterday. Shock. Horror. Pain. Sadness. All in the matter of a day.  Things has been simmering between us. I never really thought of it as serious. The fact that we seldom share our troubles. That we have a communication problem. Maybe I knew, I was just running away from it Because its easier to ignore.  Until he broke his silence and told me that he was not happy in this relationship. That he feels that I take him for granted. That I don't love him enough. I admit that I'm one of those people whom when busy, I'll totally shut out everyone. I'll forget to call, forget to return sms.. I forget to care about him, how his day was. And always talking about my problems and neglecting his own. Not caring to ask how his day was, expecting him as ok. He feels that I don't put in enough commitment. THat I don't love him. He says he's unhappy and wants me to change. To stop being so selfish. We had a huge quarrel over it. Words that I never wanted to hear again were exchanged.  He got mad and said I don't love him enough. He said I'm selfish and love myself the most. That I always expect him to pacify me, but I never cared for his feelings. I do what I wanna do and I'm wilful. And being petty, with my small insignificant problems. When I didn't even ask him how his day was in the first place. That I'm a bad girlfriend. Am I? Maybe I am.  It is a wonder how a person who says the sweetest words can end up saying the most horrible words in the end.  He said so much yesterday. I never really knew him. I was in a dream, thinking everything was ok. When he was so unhappy, I was so insensitive. I never even cared if he was sad that day. I never bothered asking. Its my fault. But yesterday, the words were too hurtful. It left a crack I know will never heal. That nothing will be ok again. He began churning out things from the past. That I will come crying to him when I'm having stress.. About my ex contacting me. He was there for me all along. I was always absent in his life. When he's sad I don't even care. I never thought he kept so much resentment inside him for so long. Its my fault for being insensitive to his feelings. I'm so tired. So tired of this relationship. Handling schoolwork is taking over my life. Maybe I have really neglected him alot.  I have no intention of hurting him further. I never thought i had hurt him that much.  I have no courage to face myself. I still have a major project coming up. I can't bear to break down, stop and reflect. My performance will affect everyone in my project group. I can't afford to let them down, not after seeing how much effort they have put in. I can't bear to disappear from my responsibilities. Maybe I'm selfish. For spending too much effort on my studies n myself, that I put him second. I don't deserve his love  For now, I only want to focus on my studies. I know that things is going to be hard for me. Whatever it was, I chose this path myself. I shall continue walking. I must be strong.

       Do tears outnumber the laughter in your relationship? Have a read, its on today's paper..    Beware stealth bombers    Often, it is not a major crisis such as adultery, but stealth problems that quietly creep into a relationship that end up choking it     By Tee Hun Ching     THERE were no deep gashes, just little wounds that refused to heal.  Rows were common, but hey, who didn't have them?  So for three years, we hung on, thinking that things would get better, willing that day to come soon as tears watered down the smiles.  There was no heinous crime that required a dash for the exit. Neither of us had strayed, neither was a partner-basher and neither was getting cold feet.  It was just, you know, the usual things like anger fits, petty quarrels and jealous tantrums which grew in frequency and chipped away at the core.  They were rarely resolved, but hastily papered over to secure an uneasy truce, only to erupt again with each fresh fight. So even as the old cracks remained, new ones appeared despite our best efforts.  Then, the futility of it all sank in. Very reluctantly, we gave up.  If we had been married, my attitude would have been different.  I subscribe to the notion of making things work at all cost once you say 'I do'.  It didn't mean that I invested less heart and time because vows had not been exchanged. It just dawned on me that not all couples are suited for a walk down the aisle.  Just because there is no major crisis such as adultery or abuse doesn't mean that a relationship is a good one.  Very often, it is what my friend calls the 'stealth problems' that end up choking love.  He should know. For two years, he was devoted to a girl who always fed him the line that it was his privilege to date her.  She would throw his stuff out of the flat whenever they fought, make him pay for everything, and openly display boredom and impatience during outings with his family.  He finally snapped when she threw a fit after he took his parents on a rare outing on his day off instead of spending that day with her, as he had always done.  'They weren't what you would call major problems,' he says of her behaviour.  'It's not like a heart attack that gets your attention right away, but a cancer that eats away at your body without you realising.   'That's where the danger lies, because you will brush aside the little aches and pains until it's too late, like when you get married, and things become unbearable with no way out.'   WHEN asked to account for the spike in divorce rates, family counsellors often cite the low tolerance of today's me-me-me generation as a reason.  Unlike their parents, who would dig their heels in and weather hardship as a team, they say younger couples tend to put themselves first and bail at the first hint of trouble.  But even before they get to the altar, there are also many who cling on desperately to a relationship running solely on the fumes of hope.  As marital splits soar - recent figures point to a record high of 5,825 in 2002 - reminders that all relationships require hard work to maintain have grown stronger.  This is an invaluable message that can bring expectations of romance shaped by Hollywood in line with stark reality.  The irony is, it can also warp your notion of love and blind you to danger signs.  You start to believe that love and problems will always arrive together in a prickly, fragile package, rather than an evergreen that can weather the elements.  Happiness is thus defined as the absence of conflict, rather than the sheer bliss of having and enjoying each other.  Another friend put up with a girl who cheated on him twice, suspected him of hanky-panky with his female colleagues if he didn't call her at lunchtime, and called him 'disgusting' if he shed tears over the stormy relationship.  Referring to those three years as 'the Dark Ages', he tells me: 'I thought if I could stay with someone who was difficult to love, it would be further proof that I loved her. You always hear things like 'the course of love never did run smooth', so I assumed it was the norm.  'I just kept hoping that she would change. I even resigned myself to the fact that I would never be truly happy.'  A girl pal suffered the indignity of having her every move questioned for three years, also in the name of love.   If guys were included in a scheduled lunch, her boyfriend would kick up such a fuss that she would end up feeling bad and skipping the appointment.  It didn't matter that these friends were married or gay.  He also inspected her shopping buys and pressured her into dumping tops he deemed too revealing.  'I lived with it because I thought that's just the way he is. When you love someone, you have to take the whole package, warts and all, unless something really major erupts,' she explains.  The irony was, he was the one who wanted out eventually.  She says: 'Even after I broke up with him, I didn't see his behaviour as a huge problem. It wasn't till I met someone new that I realised how liberating it is to be in a relationship where the guy doesn't control you or lay guilt trips.'   NO ONE expects love to be a bed of roses, so no couple should call it a day whenever a problem crops up without first trying their darndest to resolve it as a team.  But neither should love be a thicket of thorns.  The rule of thumb, says a colleague who has been married happily for four years, is that if there are more tears than laughter, something is wrong.  'The flowers should always, always, outnumber the thorns.'

      I just took a test entitled Are You A Great Flirt? I scored a 50 percent and here's what it says   urlLink http://www.lovetest.com/greatflirter2.html   Jessie, your witty comments and your seductive looks hit the bulls-eye every time. If somebody knows how to flirt then it's you. No matter if your heartthrob is shy or a go-getter, you know exactly how to bring him out of his shell and twist him around your little finger. When you're interested in somebody, you'll really get things moving. Because you are sensitive and know how to put yourself into your heartthrob's position, it's easy for you to give attention to your partner.     Oh really? I always seem to suck when it comes to the guys department.... I never approach guys now, I did that when I was young, but now I'm a sitting duck... hahaz... ~quack quack~  =p   Spent the rest of today reading my romance novel and chilling at home... A guy friend K actually asked me out  tonight but I was just too tired mentally to go out... I think it must be due to yesterday's intensive shopping... Or maybe I'm just being anti-social.. Gosh am I getting worse?  Sometimes I'll rather stay at home and chill.. Not that I don't like to hang out with K.. He is a really cool guy with alot to talk about.. But I'm just too lazy to go out and talk to guys anymore.. One way or another I just feel like hibernating myself away from guys.. Well maybe do a little flirting with guys when I go clubbing, but that's about it.. Need some girl time for myself now, after being in a stormy relationship... A break from all them guys.. I need to find myself, cliche as that may sound.. But I want to be selfish for once. Do what ever I desire, with no need for explanation. But because I darn well feel like it. Before the next gruelling semester starts..  I bought a Clinique lash curling mascara and I love it! Its smudgeproof and my lashes astonishingly curls up all by itself! Haha..... Now I have Natalie Imbruglia eyelashes as complimented by my best mate.. She always makes me feel better about myself.. These days I have been feeling fat, ugly and old.. Ok ok... I'm having my girly mood swings, I know.. But M always makes me feel good about myself.. Not even my ex could do that... I love her to bits..  anyway I'm goin back to my junk novel... Ciao

      Yesterday was my last day working at Sentiments Kovan.. Lina told me last minute yesterday that the new girl would be coming today.. I was kind of disappointed when I knew about that...   Woke up today to find that I do not have to prepare for work today. Don't have to iron my black pants and shirt anymore.. Don't have to pour water inside my gigantic nike water bottle that will last me for the whole day.. Don't have to wear my big round silver earrings... No more being forced into listening to N and her desperado for boyfriend nagging.. No more cleaning up the glass shelves and mirrors.. No more stocktaking, No more surviving on sushi.. No more taking bus 854, sleeping on the way. Don't have to inform the customers that we are having a storewide sale of 20% to 60% discount, and getting ignored at times.. No more making small talk with aunty customers.. No more laughing at N's naive ways with my manager and her desporado syndrome... No more listening to the advice of my mature and wise manager about the facts of life.... No more rearranging the shawls, bracelets, earrings, sunglasses, necklaces and pouches... Not gonna get to feel a sense of satisfaction when praised about my good service and clinching of a sale... No more greeting the nice security guards who showed me the way on my first day of work...  Sigh...  I actually miss those things! And I feel that I miss working in Sentiments more than I miss my ex! yikes! I actually wished that I could have worked longer there! Double yikes! What am I thinking?? I actually feel sad about leaving the shop, leaving heartland mall.. I felt a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose serving customers and having a job.. Having such a relaxing job as a salesgirl forever is so tempting...  Yike yikes yikes!!  Ok ok... I'm going shopping now, after serving people for twenty days, its my time to be served now... =p Maybe I'll feel better...  Take care blog...

      Well, well... I have not been updating my blog because my pc was down! Totally missed the internet so much... My monitor broke down, and even now I'm borrowing the monitor from my brother's pc... Sad... Gonna get me a new one..  I have been busy working as a temp sales promoter at a jewellery shop called Sentiments.. Life is pretty hectic but at the same time i enjoy working there.. Meeting all sorts of customers has made me more streetwise and flexible when interacting with people... Though there was one glitch! I totally couldn't stand a colleague of mine, N! She is damn irritating, always talking about guys and trying to put me down.. Well, I know that I'm much better than u, so talk to the hand baby! but i am just so fascinated with her naiviety sometimes.. She really thinks that having a boyfriend would change her life.. She is one of those loner types of people with no friends.. Well, ok I shall stop talking about other people...   I finally had decided on breaking up with Don ONCE AND FOR ALL. No more chances... What is the point of being in a relationship where none of us is happy? I am moving on, and this time I really mean it.. I'm actually quite surprised that I am taking it pretty well.. I don't feel that hurt anymore.. I feel numb.. And I am looking forward to being a singleton again! Being an individual, having complete control and freedom of my life.. Not having to explain every single thing that I do.. No more quarrels, no more nagging, no more being put down.. No more feeling guilty and thinking that I am the cause of all problems.. I guess that is life, you lose some, you gain some..  Anyway I had my eyebrows trimed, a new hairstyle and a facial with compliments from my mom!  My sista has been really supportive too... She has made me realise how foolish I was going round in circles. I thought about what she said, and the conversation we had made me wake up from my nightmare.. She has been always there for me.. Thanks!  I know that even without Don, I do have people who love me.. I am not alone.. =) Smiles..   Gotta go have my breakfast then go off to work! See ya!

       Clubbing&nbsp;     Jessie    &nbsp;  Primitive beats.  Constant and meticulous.  Merrymaking.  A meeting of the physical breed.   Saunter, not walk.  Lightheaded, not awake.  Alcohol is water.  Juice is toxic.   Let’s dance to the music,  Conversing with movement.  Exchanged glances,  Hunger for love.   Beautiful yet hideous,  Camouflaged with makeup and fabrics.  Lavishness is celebrated.  Surrender to your fragility.&nbsp;  Escape to a manmade heaven.  Oblivious to reality.   A temporary cure for the urbanites.

       Desire     Jessie    Sitting by the lake,  Hesitant but craving.  Two souls entwined.   Accidental touches, little sparks of passion.  Stars, water, pungent barbeque smoke.  Shuffling sounds of slippers.   Maybe I will steal a sip.  just a sip.  Savoring the exhilarating moment.  Thirsty for more.   Blinded by just a taste of sin.  Heartbeat racing.  A sparkle develops into a raging blaze.  Submissive to impulse.   Hazardous yet stunning,  As flames of passion ignite.  The devil has won.   No boundaries, no rules.  Just feel.   Indulge.

       Song     Allen Ginsberg     The weight of the world  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is love.  Under the burden  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of solitude,  under the burden  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of dissatisfaction   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the weight,  the weight we carry  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is love.   Who can deny?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In dreams  it touches  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the body,  in thought  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constructs  a miracle,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in imagination  anguishes  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; till born  in human--  looks out of the heart  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burning with purity--  for the burden of life  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is love,   but we carry the weight  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearily,  and so must rest  in the arms of love &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at last,  must rest in the arms  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of love.   No rest &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  without love,  no sleep  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without dreams  of love--  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be mad or chill  obsessed with angels  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or machines,  the final wish  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is love  --cannot be bitter,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot deny,  cannot withhold  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if denied:   the weight is too heavy   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --must give  for no return  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as thought is given  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in solitude  in all the excellence  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of its excess.   The warm bodies  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shine together  in the darkness,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hand moves  to the center  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the flesh,  the skin trembles  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in happiness  and the soul comes  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joyful to the eye   -- yes, yes,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's what  I wanted,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always wanted,  I always wanted,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to return to the body  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where I was born.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Jose, 1954

      My Immortal  i'm so tired of being here suppressed by all of my childish fears and if you have to leave i wish that you would just leave because your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone   these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  you used to captivate me by your resonating light but now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone and though you're still with me i've been alone all along

      After class today, I went for KTV with my classmates.. I absolutely made a fool of myself man... I was singing so loudly that I didn't care... I was standing up, shouting lovey dovey sad lyrics... Dancing prancing around wit YJ all day... Maybe its because I was feeling sad over my last relationship.. and hearing those soppy love ballads was absolute torture that I have to destroy them all.. I had loads of fun getting my classmates into fits of laughter.. But I really wonder if that was necessary now.. Wonder if they are gonna gossip about me.. I had to tell them I'm single again.. They will find out one day anyway.. I had an announcement of my once again failed relationship...   I find that one of the most hardest thing to do after a breakup is facing up to the reactions of other people.. Other people refers to aquaintances.. Being strong, acting that you are still happily getting on with your life... Not allowing others to feel sorry for yourself... Wanting others to feel that you are not weak at all.. That u need no pity.. It just sucks..  Its been two weeks since my breakup, I still hurt nonetheless.. Still in a state of uncertainty.. Still in a state of missing him.. Still stuck in my own self pity wall of loneliness.. Not wanting anyone to know how miserable I get sometimes... Feeling that I will never love again.. That I will never meet anyone who loves me... Everyone around me seems to be happily attached but me... Maybe love just doesn't happen to me.. To low profile people like me.. What do I have to offer? I'm just boring, overly sensitive, stupid.  I now have these pangs of loneliness where all the memories will suddenly creep up on me... Then it gradually disappears as I use logic to convince myself we can never be.. But its hard to get over these pangs of self pity.. I need to find strength within myself..  Its only in my blog that I can be truthful.. And I'm having a pang now... God I miss him.. I miss his hugs, his kisses, cuddles.. His mother's cooking.. His room, his face, his stammering I miss holding his hand.. I miss watching tv together, midnight dao huey.. I miss the feeling of having someone by my side.. Ten months of memories.. IT hurts so much, I feel half alive... I feel half empty..  Has he met anyone already? Maybe he has a new gal now... He seems to have forgotten about me totally.. I hate him.. How could he ever hurt me like that? Why did I hurt him? What have I done? Why does my relationship fail all the time? is there something wrong with me? I screwed up again.. I just pushed him away, as I had done with others..  I can't sms him. I know I will only hurt myself even more if I do that. I know i'm being illogical but sometimes I really wish to see him again. And feel the familiarity of his hand and his smile when he sees me.. The feeling that he loves me.. The feeling of being loved.  SOmetimes in life, we have to go through pain to learn. Its a part of the whole journey... I know that. But I'm only human. So let me wallow for now  Fuck it with the whole world

      I wished I was a man yesterday! I was having a servere case of PMS.. But I feel much better today.. Thank god..  But I'm still fretting over my meeting with K today.. I think I remember why I'm so anxious about the meeting.. I just recalled that our last meeting went very badly.. Forget about the details, but we just didn't click.. Gosh lucky its only the movies or I'll just die right there.. Not much conversation involved when you are at the movies..  I will survive!  School starts on 5th of july! And that's only two more days! Yikes!

       Fourth of July  M.C.  Trembling Starry eyed As you put your hand in mine...  It was twilight On the Fourth of July Sparkling colors were Strewn across the sky  And we sat close enough That we just barely touched While roman candles Went soaring above us and baby  Then you put your hand in mine And we wandered away I was trembling inside But I wanted to stay Pressed against you there and leave the world behind On that Fourth of July  So starry eyed On the flowery hillside Breathless and fervid Amid the dandelions  As it swept over me Like the wind through the trees I felt you sigh with a Sweet intensity and baby Then you put your hand in mine And we floated away  Delicately lay entwined In an intimate daze A crescent moon began to shine And I wanted to stay  Tangled up with you among the fireflies On that Fourth of July  Thunder clouds Hung around So threateningly Ominously hovering And the sky Opened wide Showering  Then you put your hand in mine And we ran from the rain Tentatively kissed goodnight And went our separate ways  And I've never truly felt the way that I Felt that Fourth of July Truly I have never felt the same inside Like that Fourth of July Truly I could never feel the same as I Felt that Fourth of July

      My friend's father is getting better.. I'm glad I was there for him... I will go see his dad again today and then watch fireworks together... Am so looking forward to shouting WAHH while admiring the spectacular sparkles...  Went for my poly gathering at suntec, then watched a midnight movie... The Notework is one of the most touching movies I have ever watched.. I wish there would be someone who loves me as much as the old man... It was so cold inside the movie theatre! We had to share my shawl as none of us had brought a jacket.. I should have brought my warmer black shawl!! Brrrr.....  Anyway Marina square GV should fucking think of being  more accessible while under renovations.. We spent a frigging long time trying to find it!  It was nice to meet up with my poly friends.. I felt so nostalgic seeing familiar faces again.. Brought back alot of memories of my poly days where life was simpler compared to SIM...  Does love last forever? Well maybe it does happen to the 0.1 percent of the human population... Gee..  I was freaking tired and fell asleep all the way home in the bus... When I opened my eyes, BAM! I am in Yishun!  God I feel hungry,,, gonna get something to eat! Ciao..

      I just found out that one of my friend's father is suffering from cancer.  Sometimes life is just full of surprises, no matter if its good or bad. I had wanted to distance myself from this person, It wasn't anything personal but I was terrified of the possiblity of getting into another relationship. When he said he wanted to talk to me over the phone I gave some lame excuse of my mom using the phone... I ignored this person for days... Until he told me over the icq that his dad is in hospital...  I can't be so selfish.. He needs a friend now... He told me not many of his friends knew about this..

      jessie, you're single because you don't want to slow down   Whether you're working all hours, busy with school, or planning a cross-country move, it sounds like you just don't have time for anyone else in your life...right now, that is. Your timing may be off in other aspects, too. Chances are, you've met that perfect person who just so happens to be married or planning their own cross-country move. So take a step back for a moment. Is there something underlying this? Could it be you're afraid to get involved for some reason or another, and are therefore attracted to people who are simply unavailable?  Whether you're secretly sabotaging yourself or not, try a little exercise. Open your mind to those who are around you (and available!) right now. Then let up on your schedule to let that someone in. That is, unless you want to get married to your goals, and not Mr. or Mrs. Right.    How come I feel that I'm so free now that I'm still a student... hahaz IRonic
