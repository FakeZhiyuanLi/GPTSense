      The  urlLink Pontiff has warned American bishops  that American life is in danger of becoming soulless.  I would say we are already there, most people's lives are soulless, despite all of the supposed soul-searching that goes on when Americans consume self-help books.  The Pope makes a much-needed critique of America's obsession with materialism.  Of course, I don't agree with the Catholic Church and I think the quicker it dies off or changes the better.  Nonetheless, the Pope is right about the big picture.  It's not very pretty.  However, what we don't need is Catholic dogma to replace the materialistic market fundamentalism that dominates America's consciousness.  What's needed is a awakening of the mind, a cultural transformation.  One componetn of this change is the emergence of critical mindset in more people.  The critical disposition is one of the things that made the thoughts of philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle so essential to the development of individual freedom in Western civilization.  Thanks to the mindlessness of market fundamentalism our society no longer seriously honors the skeptical or critical mindset.  Instead there is a tremendous emphasis on blind faith, whether that faith is in Jesus, the New Age, or the stock market.  To me this indicates a fundamental psychological breakdown in many people's ability to cope with complex social/political reasoning.  A large part of this psychological breakdown involves socioeconomic anxiety about not achieving a particular "status level."  It would be interesting to see psychological research studies applied to the contemporary American political psyche in a way that might shed light on why so many people refuse to think clearly about society, culture, and politics (BTW, this foggy thinking is evidenced on both the Right and Left).

      My bet is that the Iraq invasion was a confluence of several interests.  From neo-cons's ideological interests, to Halliburton's financial interests, to Israel's and Iran's geopolitical interests.  In this mystery many suspects had a motive.  Unfortunately, since there are so many suspects, none of them will ever be found completely guilty.  A perfect crime against the American people.

      OK, it's really a  urlLink good speech  and will go down in history as an important moment when the Dems seemed finally to realize what they are up against (after 30+ years).  It's obviously a very thoughtful speech as far as conemptorary political speeches go.  When was the last time, if ever, a major politician mentioned Habermas?  Do people who vote for Bush even know who Habermas is?  Much less what he wrote about?  This speech has placed Gore as a serious leader for liberal Democrats.  As another  urlLink blogger  mentioned where was this Al Gore in 2000?  Nonetheless, as an Establishment politician through and through, Al Gore misses the point.  The Radical Conservatives have been able to achieve dominance by exploiting the anxiety generated by an economic system that puts human needs and wants second after the needs of abstract systems of production (e.g. corporations).  I believe that this is inversion of values leads to an  urlLink inverted totalitarianism   What is to be done?  Will the system crack and erode?  Will implode?  Will it explode?  My hope is that progressives will finally get their act together and take politics as seriously as the RadCons do.

      Tuesday's Village Voice has a good article on  urlLink conspiracy theories .  It makes a good point:   Hofstadter's prescience is amply evidenced in Michael Barkun's A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America (2003). Barkun has ingested Hofstadter's imperious tome whole, and his book does little more than regurgitate its polemical eurekas. Barkun informs us that the "essence of conspiracy beliefs lies in attempts to delineate and explain evil." Ergo Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and most other organized religions qualify as conspiracy beliefs, though Barkun neglects to say so. Barkun identifies three principles "found in virtually every conspiracy theory," to wit: Nothing happens by accident. Nothing is as it seems. Everything is connected. Clearly Freud, Plato, Leibniz, and Einstein all suffered from at least one symptom of conspiracism; fortuitously, without mentioning any of them, someone has finally exposed these thinkers as mentally ill.    There is a fine line between madness and genius (a moe than a few geniuses including Von Neumann have actually crossed that line).  Thinker Robert Anton Wilson said the following in an interview with Richard Metzger:   At Esaln, a guy in one of my workshop groups told me "I used to be the District Attorney of Santa Barbara, and I can guarantee that every time there's a major land deal there are at least 25 conspiracies fighting over who's going to get the biggest profit out of it."   This quote highlights three important facts about so-called conspiracies:    1.  They usually involve economic gain    2.  They are usually pretty mundane and boring (sorry to all the Da Vinci Code            fans out there)    3.  They are more frequent than we would care to acknowledge  In this light we begin to have a more realistic view of how the world works.  It is unlikely that mystical secret societies wield much power.  Human nature being what it is many elites conspire to increase their own wealth and power just because they have deep achievement needs.

      A  urlLink Danish company  has come(no pun intended) up with a new fringe benefit for employees.  Admittedly this specific case sounds a bit ridiculous but it would be interesting to see if sex makes employees more efficient and relaxed.  This could be used to make an economic argument against the Radical Conservative's vision of a sexless society.

      Here is a an article showing how Wal-Mart (aka Mall-Wart) takes  urlLink money from the taxpayer .  The problem with libertarian Republicans is that they will whine incessantly about spending most people consider normal and directly benefits them and their families (e.g. education, environmental, medical, etc.) but when it comes to outright corporate welfare they are either quiet or all for it.  I like the way the Mall-Wart spokeperson said that they return $30 for every dollar in welfare they get.  I wonder how that study was conducted and I wonder how Mall-Wart's community return on investment compares to education spending.  How does it compare to a socially responsible company that seeks to train its employees and develop valuable human capital?  How does it compare to investments in graduate school spending?  How about teaching workers to effectively use computers? You get the point. What sort of asshole is a spokesman for Wal-Mart anyway?

      The morons for Bush are whining about how no one appreciate the chimp-in-chiefs masterful governance of the US economy.  They whine that "nearly 900,000 new jobs" have been created in the first month of this year.  But Krugman points out that what they fail to mention is...   during the first four months of 2000, the last presidential election year, the economy created 1.1 million new jobs

      Here is a  urlLink great cartoon  by Don Sutton at the Village Voice.  Even though I can be described as a bleeding heart liberal I agree wholeheartedly with the Catholic Church's decision to deny Communion to politicians that violate Catholic moral teachings.  I think it is about time that the Catholic Church takes tougher stands on the issues it believes in even if I do disagree with them.  A lot of liberals whine about churches getting involved in politics without realizing that religious people were heavily involved in progressive fights over the last two centuries, esp. in the anglophone world (abolition, civil rights, workers movements, etc.)  Religion and spirituality necessarily influence one's political beliefs.  Religion and   Now having said that I am very much a secular humanist and I think the sooner the Catholic Church rots away the better.  However, I must defend the principle that an organization should  take tough stands on political issues even when I vigorously disagree with them.  What I find problematic here are the liberals who continue to associate with the Catholic Church despite its reactionary positions.  Our criticism should not be directed toward a Catholic Church taking tough stand on issues it deems important.    Rather we should be criticizing politicians like John Kerry who continue to associate with and implicitly condone an institution that is inherently sexist (what other group could get away with denying executive positions to women?), guilty of covering up sexual abuse of children, and responsible for the psychological damage associated with brainwashing people into irrational sexual beliefs.  The psychological literature is full of individuals who have suffered from the anti-sex neuroticism that the Catholic Church promotes.  It's time for these clowns to be condemned by liberals and progressives.  The fact that many progressives are devout Catholics should not mean that we continue to put up with the nonsense coming out of the church.  How many kids have to grow up utterly confused and neurotic about sex before the Catholic Church is criticized?  How many children have be sexually abused by an organization that systematically and deliberately covers for its abusive members?  How many spiritually inclined women have to go through life with a subconscious belief in their own spirtitual inferiority because the Church does not women the same opportunities as men?  When will this massive irrational bureacratic institution ever be put under the strutiny it deserves?  Let's ask Sen. Kerry and other pro-choice and progressive politician why they continue to associate with an organization that is sexist, guilty of covering up the worst crimes imgaginable, and engages in systematic brainwashing that has pronounced negative effect on its members.

      In today's editorial the NYT talks about  urlLink John McCain and laments how more Republicans aren't like him .  Unfortunately, they don't see the bigger issue here...They don't seem to understand the political dynamics that have led to Republicans like McCain being marginalized and Republicans like Inhofe and Santorum taking center stage.  The issue is not one of Republicans versus Democrats.  The underlying problem is that the Radical Conservatives have been very systematic, dedicated, and uncompromising in their efforts to take control of the federal, state, and local governments.  Liberals, on the other hand, have been disorganized, chaotic, and generally defeatist and apathetic.  Guess who won control of the government?  The RadCons.  There is a vast conservative infrastructure in Washington, DC that has been working deliberately and systematically for at least the last 25 years.  I am very familiar with it because I interned at two of the most successful conservative institutions in DC that many people have never heard about: Americans for Tax Reform and the Leadership Institute.  The RadCon network is very tight in DC.  Well organized (at least relative to the Left) and most of all organized and devoted.  The Left is in a state of disarray and frankly most young liberals I know seem more interested i poetry jams and what indie band is playing this week...Not that there is anything wrong with culture, but for Christ's sake culture and politics are linked and eventually you have to get off your ass, get organized, get active, and most importantly LEARN how to win in politics.  When liberals begin to take politics seriously again we will once more have a progressive Republic that will be looked upon fondly around the world as an example of what a great society should look like.  Right now we are looked down upon around the world as a decadent greedy imperialist power thanks to the RadCons inept management of social policy and foreign affairs.

      It's funny radical conservatives will get worked up about a chick selling her body but not about a president  urlLink selling out America .  Wall Street is finally stepping up to the plate for the GOP.  I remember when I was a conservative activists in the 90s thinking that the GOP, esp. the conservatives, needed to make clear to Wall Street that their interests would be represented best by radical conservatives in DC.  For example, the partial privatization of Social Security would be a goldmine for the financial firms.  I was told by other conservative activists at the time that Wall Street was reluctant to come out swinging for radical right-wing proposal like privatization because they feared the controversy might not be worth it.  Now they have nothing to fear as America's progressive forces are either to lazy or incompetent to pose a genuine challenge to the most extreme RadCon policies.  Wall Street understands that their future is intimately linked with the success of the RadCon wing of the GOP.  Now they are finally ponying up big time money.  Keep in mind that much, if not most, money in politics is funnelled through soft money operations, esp. 501c groups as described in this  urlLink excellent piece  from the Washington Monthly.  What Wall Street is giving to these 501c groups can only be imagined as we will never know until they disclose their financing a year after the election.  Even then we won't know for sure.  Furthermore, there are other clever ways to get around campaign finance regs.  For example, when I worked as an intern at Americans for Tax Reform rumor had it that an association rented out a little office inside ATR HQ.  The catch is that ATR supposedly charge this association super high rent so that the rent from that little office covered a disproportionate share of ATR's rent payments.  No one would figure that little scheme out.  Keep in mind that what I heard was just rumor, but it would not surprise me in the least if it were true.

      I hope this  urlLink story  gets more play in the media outside Capitol Hill.   For those not familiar with the story a chick on Capitol Hill basically prostituted herself and then told the world about it on her blog.   What Jessica Cutler did is no big deal.  Her only crime?  Telling the truth.  She poses an excellent question:   "Most of my living expenses are thankfully subsidized by a few generous older gentlemen. I'm sure I am not the only one who makes money on the side this way: How can anybody live on $25K/year??"   Good point.  It should make us wonder why are our public servants paid so little.  I can tell you the way Capitol Hill is run is absolutely disgusting.  Hill staffs are frequently dominated by kids who are subsidized by their rich parents.  This explains why so many of our government policies favor the wealthy (e.g. the average federal corporate tax burden is less than 10% of corporate income after factoring in the generous tax breaks are Congress has crafted).  Of course, if you don't have wealthy parents you could always prostitute yourself.  It is absolutely unbelievable that our government pays some of the most important professionals in our democracy only $25,000 a year.  And we wonder why our democracy is danger of becoming a plutocracy?  From the way a lot of young female staffers (and occasionally male staffers) behave in the bars on Capitol Hill I am not surprised at all that many of them engage in prostitution.  It just goes to show that even with a so-called Christian in the White House there is still a lot of hypocrisy in DC.

      Some Radical Conservative pseudo-Christians have decided now to  urlLink secede  from the Union.  This actually isn't a bad idea.  It would be great to ship all of these people into one geographic area and maybe they will shut up and leave the rest of us alone.    The nut leading this movement is unclear on the specifcs:    For now, Burnell prefers to shy away from specifics on the precise laws governing the country.   "Independence first, details later," he says   Hmmm.  Why is he so reluctant to share the details?  Maybe because they want to outlaw things like sodomy?  Such a desire is not only bizarre but it seems to be a pretty clear violation of basic civil liberties.  Keep in mind that some anti-sodomy laws ban such things as blowjobs and other forms of hetero sex.  Banning sodomy is one of these nuts' goals as indicated by their complaint that "Sodomy is now legal..."  I'd like to see how their little so-called Christian republic works out.

      Retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni courageously forewarned the Bush administrations of the dangers now so apparent in Iraq.  For his courage, he had to face ugly  urlLink accusations of anti-Semitism  from the neo-con crowd.   urlLink Tonight he will articulately lay out his concerns .  Finally he has a mainstream media opportunity where the American people will be able to hear and understand him.  This is further proof that opposing the neo-cons schemes in Iraq is not limited to bleeding-hear liberals.  Zinni makes several excellent points, which is expected from someone who has served his country for so long and courageously opposed the short-sighted aims of the neo-cons.  His best point is one about simple accountability:   The fact that no one in the administration has paid for the blunder irks Zinni. "But regardless of whose responsibility [it is]...it should be evident to everybody that they've screwed up, and whose heads are rolling on this?"    Well said.  One of the marks of a true leader is his or her ability to hold his people responsible and to take necessary ation to discipline those who make gross mistakes.  Bush clearly does not have this ability as no one has been held accountable for 9/11 or for the failing effort in Iraq.

      Nicholas Kristof likes to occasionally support idiotic causes just to show his readers he's not a knee-jerk lib.  I recall an earlier set of articles about how American feminists seem not to care about child prostitution in Southeast Asia.  Katha Pollit of The Nation pointed out how  urlLink ignorant  his claims were.  Now Kristof is coming to the rescue of the weak and unprotected yet again.  This time instead of rescuing girl prostitutes he is rescuing Rummy.  Yes, Kristof has managed to convince himself that Rummy should stay because he does not bear "direct responsibility" for torture.    Nicholas my friend, I concur that Rummy should not be fired for sexually humiliating innocent Iraqis.  He probably did not order the insertion of glowsticks into prisoners rectums.  I doubt that we will ever find evidence of such orders.  The Rummy needs to go is because he has demonstrated utter incompetence.  BTW, I was a fan of Rumsfeld for sometime.  I recall that he has been one of the few voices in Washington requesting more reasonable Defense spending, even after 9/11.  I also agree with Rummy's attempt to make the military into a more flexible fighting force.  I was impressed with Rumsfeld's leadership for some time after I became disenchanted with the rest of the Bush Regime.  Nonetheless, Iraq has turned out terribly.  Just like a CEO who runs his or her company into the ground should be fired so should Rumsfeld.    Liberals have to be careful to focus on the big picture and not become obsessed with the torture and sexual humiliations Rummy's goons have meted out in Iraq.  I am just as disgusted by the behavior of some of our troops as the next bleeding heart liberal out there, but nonetheless America's interests come before the problems associated with Torturegte.  I know that sound harsh, but oh well.  The fact is Rummy has so grossly mismanaged this conflict that his continued presence as Secretary of Defense undermines our ability to reach a peaceful resolution in Iraq, to win the global public relations battle with the terrorists, and to re-construct our military to deal with the other looming threats such as North Korea and the possibility of non-Al Quaeda terrorist with nukes.  In other words, Donald Rumsfeld has demonstrated that he is no loner capable of being an effective secretary.  This is evidenced by his incompetent preparation for the Iraq war and his inability lay the foundation for a transition to a self-governing Iraq.  Kristof does point out that Rumsfeld was just taking orders from Bush and his neo-con cronies.  Just doing his job?  That's bullshit.  No one's job description includes leading the US into a conflict it is completely unprepared for.  However, the Secretary of Defense is supposed to provide the leadership necessary to achieve out national security aims.  Part of leadership is not just blindly doing what your boss tells you, but also making sure your boss is aware of the reality of the situation and the consequences of particular courses of action.  Powell provided resistance to the Bushies war aims.  Powell did his job.  Rumsfeld failed miserably in his.    Fire Rumsfeld now.

      Consider this fact:   [the] percentage of students who describe themselves as liberal has increased significantly over the last year — from 36 percent to 44 percent   This is from an excellent NYT  urlLink article   about how 9/11 has affected the political imaginations of todays college students. I knew this was going to happen.  I predicted it on 9/11.  I was still fairly conservative then, albeit an anti-war conservative.  I knew that there is nothing like war to turn young people (esp. the smarter ones) against conservative policies.

      I can't wait to see this movie.  Better yet I can't wait to see the reaction Bush's army of mindless pseudo-conservative morons has to it.   BTW, in an earlier post I mentioned that Disney attempted to censor this film.  I saw a poster whine:   It is only censorship if the government stops it from being released. You can't force Disney to release this piece of trash. It’s not like they are even stopping the movie from being released. Maybe you should find out what your words mean before you try to use them in a sentence.   I can't believe the stupidiy of the average moron for Bush... Here are some  urlLink definitions  for "censor."  Despite popular misperceptions censorship does not necessarily imply government action.  This is something libertarians have conjured up.    I would agree that the worst form of censorship is that done by the government but it is not the only type.  Unfortunately, this poster failed to identify himself or his website.  Of course, if I were an ignorant moron I wouldn't want to identify myself either.  Disney did in fact censor Michael Moore's prize-winning film. This type of corporate censorship underscores the danger of media conglomerates attaining excessive power.

      The party of war and religious fanaticism is getting  urlLink worried  about their fearless leader, King George II.  They shouldn't be.  I have predicted for well over a year that Kerry will be the Democratic nominee and that he will lose to Bush in a close election.  I am sticking by this prediction.  The radical conservatives are becoming a little more realistic now and realize there is a danger they might lose a lot of what they worked 20+ years to gain in Washington.  They are going to re-organize themselves.  This will cause them to win in November.  Why?  Because liberals have been and still are hopelessly disorganized.  I have been following politics for the past 12 years and I am getting tired of so many pundits and pols saying how they have to be moderate and court the middle.  Has the GOP become more moderate over the past 12 years?  Absolutely not.  I know because I have been involved at a very low but very active level in radical conservative politics before realizing the errors of my ways.  The Democratic party has pathetically tried to court the middle and they have failed across the board to win.  Clinton helped to undermine the Democratic party.  Politics is about intensity.  Being blandly moderate doesn't pull people out to the polls.  It does not energize your base which can serve up a whole accompanying chorus of writers, pundits, experts, activists and other leaders.    Liberals have failed to build the institutions necessary for consistent political victory.  This time around is only marginally different because they have such an egregious opponent.  But beneath the anti-Bush obsession of many liberals lies no coherent belief system that is capable of creating and maintaining an institutional identity.  The Left is virtually non-existent in Washington, DC.  The RadCons, on the other hand, have an elaborate network of fundraisers, think tanks, Congressman, activists, lobbyists, and most importantly, youth groups focused on growing the next generation of radical conservatives.  The Left has the necessary components.  There is a left analog for every conservative institution or group. The problem is there is no thought given to creating an animating set of  ideas .  Robert Reich has made the most compelling case for reconstructing the Left in America.  His new book  urlLink Reason  is an excellent introduction to the type of thinking liberals have to engage in now.  Read it.  Liberals identify with a variety of movements, but seldom understand the necessity of politically organizing these movements around a coherent set of ideas.  Dare I bring up the "M" word?  Marxism.  Yes, Marxism at one point provided a unifying worldview for many on the American Left.  I would not call for a return to blindly ideological Marxism, but I would argue that any sensible person should recognize the significance of Marxist critiques without getting carried away with the fanaticism.  However, in addition to the straitjacket of its ideological constraints Marxism carries the baggage of experience.  It absolutely cannot serve as a unifying ideology.  In fact, it is best to avoid ideological commitments altogether and focus on building a coalition around progressive causes united by  handful of vague but intelligible axioms.  In large part this is how the conservative movement has succeeded.  They not only promote ideas, but far more importantly they promote the  interconnections  between ideas.  This creates strange bedfellows (investment bankers and Bible believers) but it WORKS.  And it will continue to work unless the radical conservatives mess up so badly that they practically give the government to the Democratics party.  In short, this is why I am still predicting a Bush win.

      I am glad the RadCons are looking out for all those poor starving families making $300,000+ per year.    Meanwhile, the Rad Cons aren't letting those fat and happy families below the poverty line to get take too much advantage of the rest of us.   For example, a married family with two children and an income of $12,000 gets $125 per child. The House bill would speed up by one year a planned increase in the size of this credit, giving low-income families a one-time average benefit of $150 per child. This remedies -- belatedly -- last year's mean-spirited omission of these families from the accelerated increase in the child tax credit enjoyed by higher-income taxpayers. The cost of this meager improvement: $1.8 billion.    By the way, the tax cut for the rich will cost "$69 billion through 2014"  Although I find this  number somewhat suspicious.  That's assuming 6.9 million $1000 tax credits per year for ten years going to the rich. That number seems overstated.  Let's hope the Post doesn't get its stats wrong in its zeal to indict the hatefulness of the Bush Administration.

       urlLink Is this story true ? So much for freedom of press.  Three Reuter staffers claim they were captured by some of Rumsfeld's goons and subjected to sexual abuse.  They claim that Rummy's goonsquad even knew they were working for Reuters.  Furthermore, Rummy's sadistic underlings apparently have a homoerotic anal fetish.  They apparently forced the victims to put their fingers up their butts and then lick them.    What sort of sick freaks are in Rumsfeld's military and why isn't he being held responsible for not implementing procedures to screen out psychologically disturbed individuals?  I really hope this story isn't true.  Unfortunately, the military  urlLink investigation of these claims did not even include interviews with the supposed victims .  According to David Schlesinger, global managing editor for Reuters:   "The military's conclusion of its investigation without even interviewing the alleged victims, along with other inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the report, speaks volumes about the seriousness with which the U.S. government is taking this issue,"    Here we have an experience world journalist who is being shunned and ignored by Rumsfeld's inept organization.  Let's not forget this is our tax money at work here.  YOUR TAX DOLLARS pay Rummy's paycheck...

      If it is true that an American helicopter crew  urlLink massacred  innocent men, women and children, this is indeed a sad day for Democracy.  Let's hope this did not occur....but if it did this further weakens the Bush Administration's case that they are promoting freedom and democracy.  An Iraqi said it best:   "This was a wedding and the (U.S.) planes came and attacked the people at a house. Is this the democracy and freedom that (President) Bush has brought us?" said a man on the videotape, Dahham Harraj. "There was no reason."   If this really happened I wonder what excuses Rumsfeld and crew will use to dodge responsibility.  In one of my earlier posts (the very first one, actually) I ridiculed right-winger Michael Barone's belief that liberals are weak-willed and don't hold people responsible.  Is that true?  Sometimes, yes.  But the biggest issue in the world today is the disaster occurring in Iraq and it is clear the Radical Conservatives have absolutely NO INTENTION OF HOLDING DON RUMSFELD ACCOUNTABLE for the way some members of his organization are behaving...  This reminds me of a point Robert Reich makes that Radical Conservatives avoid holding elites responsible and instead accuse the poor, underpriviled, and powerless of not being accountable.  What can compel someone to have such a perverse worldview?    I don't know for sure, but this is a theme I plan to return to in later postings.

      As more hard evidence comes out about how this administration is utterly incompetent it will continue to lose credibility with the sane portion of the American electorate.     urlLink Here  is the latest news out of the Bush Administration.    Apparently the radical conservative group known as the Apostolic Congress has met with and  given advice to  Elliot Abrams (of Iran-Contra fame).  This group is nutty as hell.  Here's one thing they believe:   They fear an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza might enable just that, and they object on the grounds that all of Old Testament Israel belongs to the Jews. Until Israel is intact and David's temple rebuilt, they believe, Christ won't come back to earth.   This makes sense, you know, because you know god plans the unfolding of the universe around American Israeli politics... What morons.  Furthermore, this group has an ongoing relationship with the Bushists:   While the language of apocalyptic Christianity is absent from George W. Bush's speeches, he has proven eager to work with apocalyptics—a point of pride for Upton. "We're in constant contact with the White House," he boasts. "I'm briefed at least once a week via telephone briefings. . . . I was there about two weeks ago . . . At that time we met with the president."    What does it say about the Republican party that it plays on the apocalyptic fears of morons?  According to the article the White House refused to tell the Voice whose "job it is in the administration to study the Bible to discern what parts of Israel were or weren't acceptable sacrifices for peace.."  This goes to show you how the Bushies make their foreign policy decision...Pretty much the same way fanatical Muslims do, just consult the craziest theologians you can find and believe whatever they say.  Here is some info about the Apostolic Congress's rep in Israel, who appears to have escaped from the lunatic asylum:   An ecstatic figure who from her own reports appears to operate at the edge of sanity ("Two of the three nights in my apartment I have been attacked by a hair raising spirit of fear," she writes, noting the sublet contained a Harry Potter book; "at this time I am associating it with witchcraft"),   Truly these people represent the numerous morons for Bush that will make his election possible.

      Here is a RadCon  urlLink article  about how Rumsfeld did not personally go over to Iraq and sexually abuse Iraqi prisoners.  Of course, since he wasn't there playing around with naked Iraqis that means he has NO accountability.

      Sgt. Samuel Provance has  urlLink courageously  claimed that there is a cover-up under way at Abu-Ghraib.  He has done this despite orders from his nefarious commanders not to speak with ABC.  Thank goodness there are some people with a good conscience in our fine military.  Of course, keep in mind this could be one loony soldier trying to make a name for himself, but I doubt it.  What sort of military is Rummy running where sexual abuse is systematically covered up.  This is a pathetic and ruinous breakdown in Pentagon leadership.  Where is the accountability.  No where.  According to Cheney, who could be bothered to serve his country in Vietnam, Rummy is the best Defense Secretary we've ever had.

      This  urlLink article  is great, it discusses how so many conservatives are starting to say they were wrong about Iraq.  Wonderful.  Now we have NO reason to trust these people ever again.   urlLink Dennis Kucinich  makes a good point.   "What's happening," Mr. Kucinich insisted, "is that events are starting to prove that I was right. When all else fails, truth has a way of protecting its own."   Amen.  And I am glad to see Kucinich is still out there even though he has no chance people need to know be reminded of who was right from the beginning about this conflict.  Maybe this will cause some Dems and progressives to re-consider jumping on the bandwagon of the candidate who feels right at the moment and think about supporting the guy who is going to be right over the long haul.  I still have my Howard Dean bumper sticker on my car.

       urlLink Sonia Gandhi  that is.  Being that I am a proud Blue American (i.e. smart liberal) I am actually somewhat aware of what is going on around the world,  urlLink unlike  the Red Americans (i.e. dim right-wing nuts).  Now that India is no longer controlled by the Hindu version of the Republican Party maybe some progress can be made against widespread poverty and the AIDS crisis.  Here's the rationale for ending loony right rule in India:   "Basically it is the anger of the working class," said Sawali Rai, 34, who works in a public sector bank. "Privatization, no government jobs, prices rising. On the pressure of the World Bank they are pressuring the common man."   Amen, brother Sawali...That's what we need in the US of A... Working class ANGER!  That's the only way to kick Shrub out of office and destroy the death grip of our own nationalist party.

      Former Senator McCarthy has pointed out some  urlLink comments  by John Derbyshire, a wingnut writing for National Review.  In a sane world these comments would be right-wing self-parody.  Since we live in an insane world run by crazed neocons these are probably Derbyshire's real feelings.  Former Senator McCarthy adds:  There should be an annual John Derbyshire Award for Conservative Self-Parody, starting with the link I just sent.  Boy-girl sex consensual sex is bad; sticking a glow-stick up a bound prisoner's rectum is good. Does Derb have some traumatic British public school experiences he needs to relate to a shrink?  There's a reason they call it the vice angalis, I guess.  (La vice Anglaise is usually taken to be sadomasochism but sometimes it seemst to mean homosexualit.  In this case, both fit.)   Not only should this quote be nominated for the Conservative Self-Parody Award, Derby wins the morons4bush freak of the week award for these remarks.    I bet Derby is just drooling at the opportunity to meet up with the now pregno Pfc. England so she can yank him around on a leash while father-to-be Charlie GRaner works his magic with his rubber gloves and bananas.    OK, that was really sick, but these people (the torturers, Derbyshire, Rummy etc.) are really sick.

      The  urlLink Hawk  asks:   "Why doesn't John Kerry beat Bush over the head with Iraq?"  Good question, Kerry has not been as aggressive as he could be on what is arguably one of the worst foreign policy blunders in 200+ years of American history.  Hawk elaborates:   "What is Team Kerry's response?  They decide that instead of making a simple argument, they will declare for the only thing more unpopular than having our troops stand around in a foreign land to get killed:  They will call for our troops to be placed under international command by the UN to stand around and get killed.......perhaps the only response that could be a political loser in this situation......Stupidity never ceases"   That's right.  So why won't Kerry call for full withdrawal?  Because economics trumps politics every time.  Let me explain.  Kerry serves the same corporate masters Bush does (OK, so maybe they are not as evil or stupid).  I know that sounds wacko, but money-making is the real reason the US is stuck in Iraq.  Corporate America cannot afford to have oil routes to central asia controlled by others.  As much as I attribute the Iraq fiasco to the neocons even the neocons are pawns in a much larger game.  Economics drives politics, not ideology.  What's needed is a major political realignment shifting power away from elite super-rich (the top 1%) to the broader population.  America has one of the most unequal societies in the developed world.  Pretty soon we will start looking like  urlLink Russia .  I wonder what effect income distribution has on the propensity to go to war.  Has anyone seen research on this?

      The  urlLink NYT  reports that now the CIA is under investigation for using torture.  Keep in mind this may be just a distraction from Rumsfeld's accountability for his mistakes in Iraq.  These include not using enough troops, not paying his troops enough, not ensuring that command and control exercised close authority over the prison system, etc. etc.  Basically, remember Rumsfeld screwed up in Iraq because his Defense department is terribly organized.  IT WAS A BREAKDOWN IN COMMAND that allowed the prison torture and sexual humiliation to occur.  The CIA is a different story.  These people have been using torture for years, so it's no surprise.  However, in this case there seems to be no evidence of a breakdown in command.  BTW, I don't necessarily agree with the CIA's use of torture in controlled settings (as opposed to the chaos at Abu Ghraib et al.)  However, some have made good arguments for the use of torture (Alan Dershowitz comes to mind).  This CIA story should not distract us from Rumsfeld's incompetence in handling his Department.

      Here is an  urlLink article  about how some Republican strategists have become enamored by the notion of a mysterious group of people called the "Influentials" and how tapping into these "Influentials" will win W the election.  The Bushies have this idea that these mysterious Influentials are the trendsetters in their communities and will create an echo chamber for the Bush campaign's message.  How does one define this group that holds the key to W's big victory?  Well, here is a description of this demographic from the book that popularized the idea:   "There's a group of people, Keller and Berry posit, who are responsible for driving trends, influencing mass opinion and, most importantly, selling a great many products. These are the Influentials, the early adopters who had a digital camera before everyone else and who were the first to fly again after September 11."   So these people are the trend-setters, the thought leaders, the folks on the cutting edge, the progressive minded???    Who are the Infuentials?  the real trend-setters?  Well, one thing is for sure these people are not likely to be found in Bush Country (Red America) where they want to turn back the clock 50 years or more.    The sad news for the Bushies is that Blue America has set the cultural trends throughout American history.  Now that the crackerjack right has waged it's Culture War and divided America, we are left with the obvious result that all of the smart progress-minded places (cities and university towns) are solidly Democrat and all of the backward places are solidly Republican.

      On Mother's Day wingnut columnist George Will decided to show his tough side lest you think that he's a little wimp who could never make the baseball team as a kid.  Georgie yaps like a little poodle about Michael Barone's new book "Hard America, Soft America: Competition vs. Coddling and the Battle for the Nation's Future." (Barone is another Beltway nerd who is still dealing with never having made the baseball team as a kid).  The Poodle yaps about how fellow nerd Barone is soooo right about the differences between big, strong, manly, tough Red America and weak, wimpering, effeminate Blue America.  Barone calls Red America "Hard" and Blue America "Soft."  He makes an absolutely hilarious claim:     Soft America depends on the productivity, creativity and competence of Hard America, which protects the country and pays its bills.    Georgie the Poodle is barking up the wrong tree here as he is totally oblvious to the  urlLink facts    For a while, Soft America, consisting of those sectors where there is little competition and accountability, threatened to extinguish Hard America. By 1950 America had what Barone calls a Big Unit economy -- big business and big labor, with big government often mediating between them. This economy was, Barone says, "inherently soft." Security, a concept not relevant to the Hard America of the novel "Sister Carrie" (1900), was central to the corporatist world of conformity -- the world of the novel "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit" (1955).    OK, so the 1950s represented the triumph of "Softness."  That's right it's all those "soft" liberal hippies who just love conformist, big business culture and they liberals really, really, love gray flannel suits.  No way was this era representative of what the "Red" Americans want to return to.    Here is some more amusing drivel from Will/Barone:   New financial instruments (e.g., junk bonds) fueled hostile takeovers. Capital gains taxes were cut, stimulating entrepreneurship. Between 1970 and 1990, the rate at which companies fell from the Fortune 500 quadrupled. The portion of the gross national product accounted for by the 100 largest industrial corporations fell from 36 percent in 1974 to 17 percent in 1998.    And of course all of this rapid change is due to the mysterious phallic powers of big, hard, red america.  None of these changes could be due to say.. technological changes that were a result of heavy Federal R&D spending.  No way!  That would mean that once upon a time the Federal government did something and as all good rightwingnuts know that's NEVER TRUE!!!.   I find it funny Georgie the Poodle decided to include this bit in his column despite recent events.   What institution is consistently rated most trustworthy by Americans? The institution that ended its reliance on conscription, that has no racial preferences and that has rigorous life-and-death rules and standards: the military.    Any institution that allows its members to insert glowsticks up the unlubed asses of Iraqi prisoners is an institution that has my utmost respect.  The Poodle really makes a fool out of himself with his closing paragraph:  Barone believes that promotion of competition and accountability -- hardness -- is the shared theme of President Bush's policies...    Yep, that's right.  When the worst terrorist act in US history occurs and no one loses their job despite having had ample warnings, that's accountability.    When the deficit skyrockets to historic proportions and the administration refuses to pay the bills, that's accountability.  When the worst case in US history of systematic abuse, torture, and perverted sexual sadism is uncovered and the Secretary of Defense has to realy on Seymour Hersch to inform the president and said Secretary keeps his job and is PRAISED for performance, that's acountability.  At least in the Bush White House.  We live in a world turned upside down.

      A few months ago I decided I had some time to waste so I went to a Kerry Meet-Up (it was indeed a waste).  The hottest issue there was voting machines.  Several Dems were really pissing their britches over this issue.  As usual these hyperventilating Dems struck me as completely clueless.  They seemed so desparately obsessed with the last election and how it was stolen, blah blah, blah.  Sure these are important issues.  What really pisses me off though is that not a single Dem at that meeting (there were 30+ people wasting their time there) addressed a much bigger issue: increasing voter turnout among target Democratic groups.  Off the top of my head these include minorities, gays, young single women, unions, students etc.  Dems seem to be so upset with the latest GOP/Diebold conspiracy that they fail to realize that they would not have had to worry about losing the presidency based on a few hundred votes if they had pulled more of their key demographic in Florida out to the voting booths.  More importantly if they had not pissed off so many hard-core liberals maybe Nader would not have gotten so many votes in FL.  Apparently, the issue of  urlLink electronic voting machine s is still causing folks to get pissy.

      CIA veteran Tenet resigned as Director of Central Intelligence (a descriptor similar to "Holy Roman Empire" in that the CIA is neither centralized nor intelligent).  Maybe he figured Al Gore was right in wanting to get rid of him.  Seriously, my guess is that Tenet smells a sinking ship here.  His job is to be more in the know than anyone on Earth.  He cited personal reasons, which as anyone with any career experience know is just an employee's excuse for getting out when the getting is good.  I am curious to see what Tenet knows about the Bush Administrations antics that the rest of don't.  This resignation is not a good sign for the Bushist Regime.  There is tremendous infighting in Washington prompted mainly by the neo-cons arrogance in pushing the US into one of the most unpopular wars of all time.  Tenet and other career bureaucrats worked their asses off an entire lifetime building up a certain way of doing business in their departments.  The Bushists made a big mistake in upsetting the Establishment Beltway culture.  Their arrogance prevented them from seeing the number and importance of the enemies they would make, including, possibly, their very own Colin Powell.  I am not one to defend the Washington Establishment.  Frankly, they are assholes.  Nonetheless, if I were prez, I would certainly not piss them off.  In the spirit of bipartisanship, let me note that Clinton made the same mistake with his(her?) effort to push through their national health plan.  BTW, we all know who wears the pants in the White House, Dick, right?  Cheney's first name and W's last name seem so appropriate.  They really go together in that good ole traditional patriarchal male/submissive female fashion conservatives love so much.

      A piece of progressive writing not mentioned frequently enough is Jerry Farber's piece " urlLink The Student As Nigger ," written in 1969.  In it Farber makes the provocative claim that the plight of university students is similar to the plight of blacks.  His insights are stunning.  To often it seems progressive (and conservative) student activists are up in arms about every issue except those that most directly affect them.  Antiwar student activists are a good example, as are students active on behalf of living wage campaigns.  There is certainly nothing wrong with looking out for others, but it becomes a problem when sudents forget to fight for their own rights (and they currently possess few).  I am reminded the "STudent as Nigger" article by the recent piece in the Village Voice about how  urlLink students fail miserably to look out for their class interests .  Why aren't there more student unions?  Why don't students have more real power to make decisions that have a HUGE impact on their lives?   Instead these decisions are too frequently left to faceless university bureaucrats.     Why don't graduate students automatically get health insurance?  The list of pertinent questions go on and on.  If interested read either of the articles linked above.  It may surprise you when you see students as basically being screwed.  "STudent as Nigger" although over thirty years old still has some very relevant critiques of the status of students.  The way students allow themselvs to be stomped upon is a great example of how an entire class of people can come to regard themselves as basically unworthy of the respect shown to other members of society.  Perhaps the revolutionary slogan could be "Students of World Unite, You have Nothing to Lose but Your Debt."

      The  urlLink Washington Times editorial  makes a point that there is a connection between Saddam and Osama.  So far the only people I hear going on about this are the Weekly Standard crowd.  I have not had a chance to research this in depth.  I tend to doubt neo-cons just because they have no philosophical problem with telling "noble lies" as Leo Strauss taught them.  Nonetheless it does seem that the mainstream press (which is admittedly to the left and has become more so in recent months) has not taken an active interest in challenging the neo-con perspective that there was a link between Hussein and UBL.  I still doubt that any link between the two villains would be so strong as to justify the war and its attendant problems.  I find it interesting that conservative and liberals both focus on their own mysterious links.  Liberal focus on the links between the bin Laden family and the Bushes (e.g. Michael Moore) and conservatives focus on the Saddam-Usama link.  What gets lost here is the big picture.  This phenomon is similar to conspiracy theories in that it distracts otherwise critical minds from the larger issues that influence actions in the world. I refer again to the excellent article by the Village Voice about conspiracism that I mentioned in the previous post.

      The Village Voice follows up there article on conspiracy culture with this  urlLink one .  The article makes several good points:   In an introductory essay, Peter Knight, editor of the 2002 collection Conspiracy Nation: The Politics of Paranoia in Postwar America, attributes modern conspiracism to "the pervading sense of uncontrollable forces taking over our lives, our minds, and even our bodies."     This just good ole alienation as explained by Marx.  The article actually mentions several Marxists (Jameson, Althusser, etc) but does not mention the original thinker himself.  I am far from an expert on Marxist thought, but I find that progressives use a lot of the ideas he came up without giving him credit.  This is a shame.  I understand that during the Cold War attributing anything good to Marx was verboten, but now may be the time to revive a popular interest in the Marxist critique.  Of course there have been a gazillion offshoots from Marxist thought, but nonetheless it is important for leftist activists to understand the original work.  This helps to develop a frame for analyzing the world and understanding social phenomenon.  The reason I make this point is that progressive activists (though not necessarily progressive thinkers) desparately need a tool for interpreting and acting on political, economic, and cultural events.  Too often progressives are deeply fragmented and issue-focused rather than ideology focused.  A an independent thinker I dislike ideology as much as anyone.  However, we must understand that politics deals with the uncomfortable realities of the current historical moment.  These must be addressed strategically with a view to the long term.  Frequently this requires doing things that many progressives dislike:  message packaging (PR, advertising, etc) simplistic solutions sound bites etc...  In short progressives must embrace the use of political technology.  They have not done so in a serious manner since at least the Civil Rights movement and even then there were very serious flaws in the leadership (most notably the way black women were occasionally treated, this is still true in black culture as evidences by hip-hop culture).  The most important point I want to make in this blog is the progressives must  not make the perfect the enemy of the good .  However, political technology is not philosophically neutral.  Techne and philosophy are linked and inseparable.  The question for progressives is how do we use political technology in a way that does not undermine longer term goals but at the same time is still effective against the RadCon political machine that has come to dominate the US.

      Monthly Review(http://www.monthlyreview.org) is definitely a "Marxist" publication and they have some pretty insightful commentary there.  I wouldn't call them idiots.  Also, economist Paul Sweezy was a Marxist and he provided very insightful commentary.  Also, a prof at GMU has claimed that the Spanish Anarchist Chomsky praises were not entirely nonviolent http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/spain.htm  I point this out to butress my original point that progressives should not immediately run from the word "Marxism"  A better response would be I am not a Marxist,but he had some good points...  Would the right-winger eat that up? Of course.  A lot of leftists are terrified of being called names, look at their political results over the last 30 years: a reactionary Congress, White House, and many state houses.  The right on the other hand is not so sensitive.  They are now reaping the benefit of their verbal aggressiveness.  To win in politics one should not be afraid to tell the truth and the truth is Marx had a lot of good things to say.  One of the reasons I became a right-winger is because I refused to take Marxists ideas seriously, I just accepted the right-wing generalization like most young people.  Leftists were certainly not going to inform me of the better points of overall Marxist thoughts they were too scared of being called mean names by big bad right-wingers.  As a high school student I was not likely to run across Monthly Review.

       urlLink Mark Fiore  offers yet another entertaining cartoon critique of Radical Conservative policies.  Privatizing military functions really not all that different from the other privatization schemes dreamed up by radical conservatives and their  urlLink corporate cronies .  The key difference is that in war negative market outcomes are more immediately discernible.  However, here in the Homeland there are negative consequences to the blind worship of marketplace.  Let's take as one example the ad wizards whose major purpose in life is to brainwash people.  They play a special role in making most people's lives rather pointless.  David C. Korten produced the best summary of the role advertisers play in what he termed the "Downward Spiral of Deepening Alienation."  It's basically a circular flow, so there is no start or end point:  ADVERTISERS: assure us their products will make us whole, which leads to => BUYING THEIR PRODUCT: requires more money, which leads to => QUEST FOR MONEY: widens the gaps between ourselves, family, and community => DEEPENING ALIENATION: creates inner sense of social and spiritual emptiness => ADVERTISERS: assure us their products will make us whole, which starts the downward spiral over again  This is taken from Korten's wonderful book  urlLink When Corporations Rule the World

      UTS has a  urlLink post about skewed media coverage of the recent hostage rescue .  This is one example among thousands of poor reporting by the mainstream media.  This poor reporting usually favors the current power structure.    I think there is little hope to change this situation by making this into an issue of solely of journalistic integrity.  I believe it has to be incorporated into a larger context of  what is happening to our society.  A quick summary of one way to attack this:  People have become disenchanted with politics or anything else that challenges their capacity for critical thinking.  Part of this is a result of a worklife that is so hectic that they do not have the time to think critically about news.  If they do have spare time it is spent engaging in vapid pop culture activities such as being brainwashed by television.  This is issue is tied into work related issues because workers have ceased their demands for more reasonable working hours and arrangements.  Without achieving these objectives how are people supposed to have the leisure time required to turn a critical eye toward official news?  Employees, especially in the U.S., need to get serious about who really owns their time.  They do, not their corporate paymasters.  It comes down to time management.  All too frequently a person's time (i.e. their LIFE) is managed not by their personal concerns or the concerns of their community and familiy.  Instead, they must prioritize the concerns of their business superiors to the detriment of community, family, and friends.    Less time being engaged in their community, especially the global community, means less time to strutinize the news that is vomited up by the shoddy journalism of the major media conglomerates.  Therefore, issues such as  urlLink taking back our time  and pro-peace activities really are intrinsically linked with one another.  I make this point because I have noticed radical conservatives have been very successful in their PR efforts because they approach the world with a general working framework rather than getting narrowly focused on one issue at a time.  Instead their is a tendency to demonstrate how any one hot issue ties-in to a broader radical conservative agenda.  This is a way to link the disparate forces of the conservative movement such as anti-abortion Baptists and atheistic bankers, into a more coherent whole.  This holistic approach is one reason for the success of the RadCon agenda.  When will progressives ever learn to seriously emulate their success?

      My guess is that the mainstream elites have chosen Kerry.  I also would not be surprised to see Kerry get about the same number of votes Bush does.  However, this does not matter because of the electoral college.  I think there is a real possibility of Kerry winning more votes than Bush, although not necessarily a majority because of Nader.  However, I have predicted and continue to predict Bush will because the radical conservatives are well organized.  This is evidenced in polls showing that Bush has leads in swing states even though his national numbers are down.  My biggest concern is that progressives are simply not organized in such a way to have an impact on politics.  Support for this concern is 20+ years of neo-liberal advancement on almost all fronts.  This has happened not because of the desire of the "corporations."  I believe this is the biggest fallacy afflicting the Left today.  Corporations are mere dabblers in the game of politics.  The reason such a pro-corporate environment has taken shape is because of the success of the radical conservative movement.  By pushing the public agenda to the right they have made the world safe for corporate excesses.  It's very important to understand that these conservatie activists do this BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT IS FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD!  I have not met or read any serious leftist who takes this idea seriously.  As long the Left remains blind to the reality of the situation and continues to prattle on endlessly about evil corporations, those corporations will continue to increase their power.  Corporate power won't increase because of any explicit design of the corporate class, rather it will increase as a toxic byproduct of the radical conservative's success in pushing their goals.  I have yet to see any progressive plan of action that takes on the radical conservative establishment on its own turf.  Let me suggest a very brief sketch of such a plan.  First, progressives need to build institutions in Washington, DC that can provide a base of operations for work done in the city itself.  This work needs to include bringing together progressives street activists and other hardcore radicals with the left wing of the Democratic party.  It also includes doing the necessary coalition building in the way that the radical conservatives have done over the last 25+ years.  How to do this?  A good place to start is by researching the conservative movement, not just in books but by learning from those familiar with it, acquiring in-depth knowledge of their methods of operations.  Then we need to determine what has been successful and make that our own.  The fact is far too many "progressives" and "radicals" get excited about street marches/ protests, direct action etc. but get utterly lost when it comes to actually organizing to achieve real political POWER.  Then they wonder why corporate right-wingers control Washington, DC!!!  It seems like for too many leftist activist protest is merely a form of therapy.  Maybe their rebelling against a conservative father who didn't go to their soccer games or something.  Frankly, I couldn't give a fuck.  What progressives need to do is get serious about power.  Be willing to seize and use it.  Otherwise Iraq, Bush's tax cuts, etc are just the beginning....

      John Patrick Diggins has a  urlLink terrific article  on NYT demonstrating how Reagan did not blindly adopt neocon policies.  I have some disagreements with this article, but in general it reveals an important truth without explicity stating.  Namely, Reagan was a real leader, while Bush is merely a follower.  Reagan could make sensible decisions such as removing Marines from Lebanon.  Regardless of the criticism one can make of the Reagan administration, Reagan nonetheless appeared presidential.    However, Bush appears amateurish.  Indeed,Bush has never excelled at anything in his life.  Every so-called success has been because of his father.  Despite ridicule about his acting career, Reagan was nonetheless a fairly successful professional thanks to his own efforts.  The same is not true of Bush and it shows in his lack of real leadership.  This is most apparent in foreign policy.  By no means was Reagan a peacenik as some commentators are writing.  However, he was more balanced than a Bush could ever hope of being.  I say this not to defend Reagan, rather to shift the ire that leftists rightly feel towards Reagan to the real culprit: the radical conservative movement.    As I mentioned before radical conservatives and their institutions in DC should be the proper focus of the Left.  Reagan was a tool.  They worship Reagan because they need to identify a "successful" rightist tradition in modern American politics after they were humiliated in the early part of the century by the New Deal and civil rights legislation among other popular progressive victories.  When you scratch the surface their are plenty of complaints about Reagan among right-wingers.  The bottom line concern for the radical conservatives is that they could only control Reagan to an extent.  He was a skilled enough communicator that he did not have to rely soley on the right to keep his presidency successful.    The radical conservatives tolerated this situation and vaguely realized that Reagan was one of them.  However, he was still strong enough in his belief in himself that they feared they could not keep total control over his actions, hence his tax hikes and his stance toward the USSR which was less hawkish than the neocons desired.  I remember being perplexed as to why so many movement conservatives jumped on the Bush bandwagon before the 2000 primaries.  Now I know why.  Because they saw Bush as not having enough talent or independence to govern without them.  Because he could be easily influenced Bush was a better candidate than Forbes, Keyes or others who could really get RadCons excited at rallies.  Bush was not exciting but to the movement elites he was controllable, probably moreso than Reagan.  Don't get me wrong Reagan was no independent spirit.  I am not a American history scholar. but my best guess is that both Reagan and Bush rank far below average in terms of independence and leadership compared to other presidents.  My point here is that Bush ranks far below Reagan.  This means that is all the more urgent for leftist to shift their attention from the surface phenomenon (Bush) and focus on the institutional structure that made Bush possible.

      Reagan's image has been produced by a long-term concerted effort of the radical conservative movement centered in DC.  How this works is not immediately obvious.  First, Reagan worship is one of the pre-requisites for being in the conservative movement.  Now the conservative movement does not consciously plot to lionize Reagan, although some do such as Grover Norquist.    However, the radical conservative movement does a superb job of identifying, recruiting, training, and developing conservative activists.  Specifically they excel at teaching basic PR and marketing techniques.  Since all these good little right-wing trained monkeys are in part screened (unofficially usually) on their love of Reagan this means that thousand of Reaganphiles, well-trained in PR, go out into political activism, lobbying for issues or industry, journalism, etc.  Since the radical conservative movement is small it is possible for these people to remain close and tightly coordinate their efforts.  In the short term this has no discernable effect but after many years one can start to see the message getting through to the mass media.  This is one of the key operational successes of the radical conservative movement.  They do not necessarily consciously conspire on a grand scale.  Instead they focus on screening and developing their human assets as they say in the corporate world.  I familiar with this process because I was part of it as a conservative activist in college.  I remember clearly one of the books recommended to young conservatives was Dedication and Leadership by Douglas Hyde.  The purpose of the book was to teach Christians how to recruit and organize using methods that Hyde learned as a Communist activist.  I really wish more progressives had realistic understanding of how the right works.  So much stuff is comically inaccurate.  One cannot engage a political opponent if there is no clear comprehension of how the adversary operates.  Honestly, I sometimes wonder if progressives are serious about winning in politics.  Sometimes they seem to have no clue what or who they are up against.

       urlLink The Hamster  has a good post up showing how unabashedly pro-Reagan the recent media coverage has been.  Just wait a little while.  Eventually thoughtful liberals and progressives will start commenting seriously on his legacy and how it undermined America.  It does not make any PR sense to do so now because everybody will just accuse you of stomping on the recently deceased.  However, it is vitally important that progressives challenge not just Reagan's legacy but the institutional right itself which propelled Reagan to power.   Attacking Reagan is OK, but unfortunately it is far to easy for progressives to get caught up in attacking the most visible source of the problem that they discount the right-wing infrastructure that made Reagan's ascent to power possible.  This is a strategy for long-term defeat because it leaves the Radical Conservative power structure in place so that it can create another Reagan or even an army of Reaganesque ideologues as it demonstrated in 1994 when Radical Conservative leaders won control of Congress.  Reagan did not make the RadCon ascent possible, the RadCon movement made Reagan possible.  Progressives need to keep this in mind.  Some progressive magazine should cover the Reagan death by putting an image of the RadCon leaders who helped orchestrate the right-wing victories of the past 25 years.  This would emphasize that Reagan was a helped immensely by a vast RadCon infrastructure that took time, money, and patience to build.  With that in mind maybe progressives can hope to emulate some of the successful organizing strategies of the Radical Conservatives.

       urlLink NathanNewman.org  commented on a scathing critique of Reagan from the Right.    People need to pay more attention to those on the Right who criticize the right. mises.org and lewrockwell.com offer some great commentary from conservatives who oppose Bush. Also, the new magazine American Conservative (www.amconmag.com) has a great interview with Ralph Nader. Democracts and progressives should start using these dissenting right-wing voices to form new criticisms of the Bush administration. The more right-wingers who sit home this election the better.

       urlLink Libertarianjackass.com  posted a link to an  urlLink excellent column  by newly "converted" right-wing anarchist Joseph Sobran.  I have been perplexed by right-wing anarchism for some time now.  It was anarcho-capitalism that pulled me away from conservatism, but its attraction did not last long.    There were just too many unanswered questions in particular  how  we were to achieve an anarchist society?  The anarcho-capitalist are good about whining endlessly about the current statist status quo (BTW, anarcho-capitalists use their favorite insult, "statist," in every other sentence they write).  It was in searching for these answers that I found left-anarchism.  From this point I was attracted to some Marxist thoughts because he actually proposed plans of action to achieve an anarchist society, whereas most others were content to sit in Parisian cafes and whine.    I slowly began to realize that achieving an anarchist society means more than just sitting around reading Rothbard.  I remember when I first posed this question of strategy to an anarcho-capitalist.  He, they're almost all male, responded in a word "education."  Good point.  However, the desire to educate others for the sake of a better society seems to conflict with the whole anarcho-capitalist fascination with the profit-motive.  Digging a little deeper I began to realize that mere "education" was not sufficient.  It had to be an education in the best sense of that word.  It must lead us out from the darkness of an unrealistic view of power and into a consciousness of what power really is.  In short, political education must give us the eyes to see the man behind the curtain and realize that the supposedly all-powerful Wizard of Oz is a mere fiction deriving his power only from the twisted false consciousness of the ruled.  I have read quite a few articles on right-wing anarchism and nowhere have I found a strategy for leading us to this much ballyhooed anarcho-capitalist utopia.  I have concluded the reason anarcho-capitalist are so silent on this issue is that to thin seriously about anarchism one must realize that capital itself exists because of the protection the state gives it.  For example, in yet another brilliant  urlLink article on conspiracism  the Village Voice points out:   Justice Hugo Black noted that in the first 50 years of the Fourteenth Amendment's existence, " 'less than one-half of 1 percent' of cases in which it was invoked had to do with protection of African Americans, whereas 50 percent involved corporations."   Interesting fact.  The state and capital are intrinsically linked.  Property rights are not natural, despite the statements of anarcho-capitalists.  I think it's more than mere coincidence that an amendment passed as the result of the Civil War resulted in more rights for corporations than for the citizens for which it was intended.  I believe the Civil War was more a triumph of capitalism than a triumph of humanitarianism.  Lincoln's biggest supporters were the industrialists not the abolitionists.  In the brillian article Sobran writes he makes the following observation:   Yet it’s the state that is truly chaotic, because it means the rule of the strong and cunning.   And who would rule under anarcho-capitalism?  The strong and cunning.  In fact, my bet is that the strong and cunning would conspire to set up a state structure so that they can reap the benefits of their relative strength.  So where does anarcho-capitalism bring us if there is no corresponding "enlightenment" of a critical mass of humanity?  Right back to state capitalism except maybe a little worse this time around because the traditions surrounding law and order have been destroyed.  Sobran ends his article with an insightful observation:   Christians, and especially Americans, have long been misled about all this by their good fortune. Since the conversion of Rome, most Western rulers have been more or less inhibited by Christian morality    Despite all of the problems in Western civilization, this statement has a large element of truth in it.  However, this is exactly the point an informed leftist would make.  We can only rid ourselves of state power and its concomitant evils by working toward a change in consciousness.  This is what Christianity sort of achieved.  Nonetheless, however much I respect the beliefs of sincere Christians like Sobran, we must recognize the fact that Christianity has been at work for 2000 years and it has not successfully brought the change in consciousness necessary to end the state for good.  It is important to keep in mind that Western leftism owes a debt to Western Christianity for it's inherently subversive and radical themes.  Christ's Passion was a tremendously subversive act against the state and ecclesiastical authorities of his day.  It inspired many progressive reformers from abolitionists to civil rights leaders.  We must go beyond Christ now.  He left us with so much more than what institutional Christianity has become.  We need more advanced tools to promote an anti-statist agenda.  The tools provided by Christianity are too simplistic, too immature to combat the great centralization of power that now threatens our freedom.  With that in mind I will conclude with the same quote Sobran concludes:  "...as St. Paul says, there comes a time to put away childish things."

      I wanted to write a post on what I see as the coming collapse of the bubble in real estate prices.  However, I can not summarize the problem any better than  urlLink Doug French  at lewrockwell.com.  Even though I don't agree with much of what lewrockwell.com stands for they are one of the few voices that have consistently addressed the Federal Reserve's role in causing unsustainable housing bubbles.  I have noticed that when I mention that real estate prices may fall people just give me a blank stare.  Then I explain that real estate is an asset just like stocks and there is no magical reason it cannot fall in price.  Another blank stare.  After that I give up.  It will be interesting to watch this unfold.

      I remember when I was in college it was very unfashionable to make comments critical of other cultures.  On one occasion I made a remark that praised Western civ and criticized African cultures where women are treated poorly.  About a dozen African-American hands shot up around the room and they all commented to the effect that I was oh so insenstive to foreign cultures.  Well, yes I am, especially when they condone this sort of  urlLink abuse .  The problem is there is not enough vocal criticism of "traditional" cultures from the American Left.  You can criticize the misogyny running through Ethiopian culture with being a racist.  It is important that progressives clarify their message.  The only way to do that is to downplay the identiy politics that causes so much angst and agitation, esp. on college campuses.  In its place there must be a unified worldview that transcends ethnicity, gender, education, etc.  The  urlLink Star Wars framework Nick proposes  is a good start.  However, we need not look to Ethiopia for examples of human depravity.  As the  urlLink Post reported  there is officially sanctioned abuse permitted in the US military.  Progressives need to start making the connection between isolated cases of horrific abuse, whether it be interrogation techniques or rape.  We need to see that this abuse sheds light on the darker side of human nature.  Where does someone find the inner capacity to let loose such terror on another human life?    Perhaps this inner demon arises from a grossly misdirected attempt at connecting with others.  In the case of rape this is likely as the man wishes ultimately to know another person intimately but cannot overcome the internal barriers preventing him from dealy with the "other" as a full person.  Instead he can only seek fulfillment in the utter objectification of the other.  Rape is the ultimate in the commodification of the human person.  But what about the less obvious case of torture and humiliation?  Can we really believe that horribly distorted desire to know another person is at play here?  Yes, even in the eyes of the most sadistic torturer the is the   Paradoxically, human objectify one another in the vain hope of connecting with another human being.  For the distorted mind other human beings are so hopelessly alienated from the tormentor's own consciousness that they become objects.  This is the only way he can relate to them.  He fears autonomy in the other because it is a threat to his own sense of identity.  Why?  Because that identity is bound up in the prejudices and impressions that have been implanted in his mind by the culture in which he is born.    In order for such a false consciousness to continue its own existence it must  never  recognize independence in others because independence implies that this false consciousness is not all there is to the world.  Since this prejudiced identity is predicated upon the presuppositions it has uncritically accepted since childhood, any graying of the black and white worldview is not the mere develop of nuanced judgement but rather a terrifying threat to the whole cognitive schemata that has taken over the individual's identity.    More explicitly, critical challenges are a threat to the very  existence  of the person who has false consciousness.  So, this fake identity can only maintain itself if by the objectification of the other.  But how can this be instrumentalized in day to day life?  Think about it.  As opposed to day-to-day existence, extreme situations make it very clear who is doing the ojectifying and who is the object to be manipulated at will.  Examples of such extremes are torture and rape as described in the linked articles above.  It is not a coincidence that torture and rape involve violations of the human body.  For it is the body that forms the barrier between ourselves and others.  Or is this just false consciousness?  I am reminded of a quote from French filmmaker Marina de Van:  urlLink "It is through my body that I am in the world, that I am connected with others.  If I am no longer my body, what am I? Where does this desire come from to want to see what the body is and if I am 'inside'?"

      I wanted to address these questions in a separate post.  What do we stand for: 1. Living Democracy:  Participatory democracy is a good in its own right, just as much as economic efficiency is, if not moreso.  Quality of life should take precedence over quantity of consumption. (this is taken from Korten's W urlLink hen Corporations Rule the World .  2. Civil Rights: Progressives must continue in the direction set by our ancestors who fought for emancipation (both slaves and serfs), worker's rights, racial/ethnic minority rights, women's rights (whatever happened to the ERA?), prisoner's rights, sexual rights etc.  3. Economic prosperity for all: increasing quality of life distributed throughout society, not concentrated in the hands of a few.  4.  Support of science, culture, and all creative endeavors: Creativity takes time and money, it is not possible to support it using purely free-market means.  This requires taxing people and redistributing wealth and power to Cultural Creatives.  This should not be viewed in conventional terms of wealth redistribution of stealing from Peter(the rich) to pay Paul(the disadvantaged).  Rather we need to reframe the issue.  The original re-distribution occurs when a corporation uses legal coercion to privatize the cultural commons and then profits from this theft.  Example: drug companies that make use of NIH research.  If we must talk in terms of theft let's make it clear the original theft occurs when corporations steal from the cultural commons without giving back.  5.  Full employment and increased rights of labor: one of stated goals of government policy must be that anyone who wants a job can get one that matches their qualifications OR get the training necessary for it without accumulating debt.  Let's end chronic unemployment and especially UNDEREMPLYMENT (no more kids with masters degrees working at Starbucks, OK?)  6. National health insurance: it is socially unjust and economically inefficient to continue with the current health care distribution system.  People need to understand the most important component of the health insurance system is already socialized: the risk.  In fact the entire mass insurance industry works because risks are legally socialized.  7. Steeper Progressive Taxation: Economically this makes sense based on the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utulity.  (e.g. $10,000 is actually a lot more satisfying/useful/productive when given to someone making only $40,000 than when given to someone making $250,000.)  8.  Protection of the environment: re-frame the debate into one where coporations are stealing from the natural commons (just as they steal from the cultural commons).  9.  Localism in the context of universal human rights: Go a step further than the conservatives and advocate stronger municipal self-government.  This is real decrentalization unlike the state's right nonsense pushed by RadCons.  Municipalities should decide what impact corporations will have, not states, not the Feds, and sure as Hell not the anti-democratic WTO.  However, human right must be protected at all time and in all places.  This is what differentiates right localism from left localism.  The rightist have few problems with localities oppressing certain humans (e.g. Southern oppression of black and workers).  By putting a shield of universal human rights over all citizens a genuine and humane localism becomes possible.  10.  Student Rights: see post below on Students as Niggers.  I want to keep this to ten, there are more, but these are the biggest ideas I can think of right now which answer the question of what do we stand for?

      This is from a comment on  urlLink morons4bush   Jay: Why would you make it point to differentate between court decisions, and democracy? The courts are all we have to maintain the illusion of legitamacy! Don't get me wrong, I fall into the extreme left wing. However, I don't make that obvious, because I know that doesn't help my cause. I question your indirect insistance that left wingers like myself aren't tackling the 'real' considerations.   I bring this up not to create a "schism", but rather to create a consensus. Niether of us are clear on our actual intentions relating to: Who gets what, why, and how.  You are an ex-con, I'm an ex-radical. We both have a great deal to benifit from each others knowledge. You say that you want a political victory. I pledge that I will help you. We just have to find some sort of understanding before that happens. Am I wrong? (quoted from Walter Sovczech) Big Lebowsky quote... sorry.  Again, we are both on the same side; I make that judgement on the basis of our dialogues. The question is: What do we stand for, how are we going to do it, and why?  P.S. This is the Internet, so one must present themselves more intense than they are in reality  (In reality, I address this question as an intellectual curiosity, as I imagine you do)  Lets get into the nitty grity,  Nick   Onthe issue of Diebold, it is not in Diebold's self-interest to rig elections.  Frankly, the GOP can win without their help if the Dems don't turn out their base.  Now to address the above comment.  First of all, you are coming at it from a very different perspective than traditional left-wingers.  You are focused more on bigger picture ideas and theories.  We need more of that.  You're certainly not the problem.  Where the problem lies is in the leadership of progressive organizations and their sympathizers, not bloggers and young activists/thinkers.  I disagree that we need mutual understanding before political victory.  That has seldom worked.  What we need are alliances and coalitions, frequently very uncomfortable ones similar to what th Right has forged between anti-abortion activists and pro-choice investment bankers and union members who vote how the NRA tells them.

       They[right-wingers]have a language machine in place – a very well-supported machine run by a man named Frank Luntz who uses all this think-tank research to come up with a manual of how to talk about each issue. Not just how to talk about it, but how to think about it, how to reason about it, what the arguments are from the Republican point of view   This is from this  urlLink article   The important point above is that Radical Conservatives have learned to THINK and REASON about an issue in such a way that it frames the issue on terms favorable to the RadCon ideology.  This is nothing more than basic PR strategy.  In fact RadCons were teaching this stuff to 16 year old interns at the Leadership Institute when I interned there.  I can only assume that Dems get the same training.  However, what Dems lack is a serious underlying philosophical framework.  And the ones who have that on the Left are frequently to radical for the tastes of the Democratic Establishment.  This establishment is quickly rotting away.  The  urlLink Washington Monthly  even went so far as to say that the Democratic Establishment is a myth.  Ultimately some movement is going to have to replace the Democratic party power center in Washington, DC just as the Radical Conservatives replaced the old school GOP.  To do so progressives who are not Democrats need to join their local Democratic parties just as the Radical Religious Right did.  From there they gotta do the grunt work of proving their commitment to the party, understanding the internal levers of party power, then TAKING CONTROL.  From there it will be possible to develop winning language because many progressives do have a way of THINKING and REASONING about the world.  This allow them to develop the language necessary to frame issues.  Framing does not work in a philosophically neutral context.

      Here is another response to Nick (the previous one on Marx was a response to  urlLink Nick at Net Politik  too) Chomsky also makes the distinction between early and late Marx.  Basically, early Marx is libertarian socialists and directs his attention toward the concept of alienation, which is where he is especially relevant today.  However, Marx was also an activist and a complex one at that.  I know little about him.  His call for revolution  BTW, what is inherently wrong with violent revolution?  Why when Thomas Jefferson or John Locke talk about it's the greatest thing since sliced bread?  But, man, if Marxists talk about it it is absolutely horrific.  Also, Marx focused most of his attention on revolution in industrialized countries where there was a proletariat.  The countries where so-called Marxists seized control were almost all rural.  Considering Marx's view of history this was unlikely to work.  I think it is still unlikely to work because of the nature of economic development.  Also, Chomsky has an incredibly unrealistic view of working people.  They DO care more about horse races (nowadays American Idol, but what's the diff?).  Chomsky is brilliant when it comes to facts but when it comes to organizing he is pathetically naive.

      Saw the  Stepford Wives .  Don't see it, it is absolutely atrocious.  However, it did bring to mind a thought I had ever since I saw the original.  Namely, wouldn't it be a lot more relevant and a lot less silly if the women had been brainwashed rather than killed and robotized?  Maybe it would be too relevant, since nothing less than systematic brainwashing is what goes on everyday thanks to the mindless, bougiefied consumerist culture in which we live.  Mind-numbing "everything is OK" ideologies permeate EVERYTHING.  Just look at the magazines on sal targeted at women teaching them how to be good little super consumer super sluts.  Of course, the same massive publishing concerns also target men now, so we have equal opportnity brainwashing.  The problem with this movie is that by making women into robots it makes the scenario so far-fetched that weak minds won't make the connection between the fiction and our own non-fiction world.  It would be a lot different if some technique of mass psychological coercion was used instead since that is really what goes on as pointed out by Douglas Rushkoff in his book  Coercion   Another problem is that the movie just retread boilerplate feminist bitchings.  This is no threat to the power structure.  I more relevant critique would be directed on corporate ideology governing our society (which despite what some critics say this movie does NOT target)  If you ask me women have not made a whole lot of progress since the 70s in many ways they have gone backwards.  This is because despite all of the feminist identity politics of the last 30 years no connection has been made between opression of women and the corporate hegemony which has come to dominate and define our social interactions.  It's time to remove identity politics for wymmin and other "opressed groups" from their place in the Left's priority list.  Identiy politics only serves to obfuscate the real issue which is a society dominated by legall-santioned and subsidized finance capital.  Stepford could any of thousands of suburban communities in Ameria (Loudoun Conty comes to mind immediately).  Instead of the messiness of robots we have the convenience of a culture completed dominate by messages encouraging women to view the world in solely crass materialistic terms.  Even the so-called "spirituality" our self-help industry vomits into the receptive and eager young minds of women is nothing more than a mindless "Everything is OK" "Be proactive" You can do it!" bullshit.  Most of it just tells women not to think hard or deal with difficult issues and by no means never be sad or depressed because if you it's gonig to reduce your chances of landing the right job or man.  As if either of those things are objects that can be realistically manipulated.  I am reminded of this by a little radio program I heard this morning targeted at Christian women.  It basically said don't let ungodly thoughts into your head such as pride or self-pity.  Instead it advised to just replace those unpleasant thoughts with happy thoughts about Jesus.  This is utterly idiotic.  Anyone with common sense would advise just experienciing reality for what it is and dealing with it rationally.  Sometimes you're right to pity yourself sometimes you're right to be damn proud of yourself and so on.  However, this Christian nonsense is straight out of the corporate-sponsored and subsidized self-help industry.  The goal is not to live a genuine authentic existence, but to program yourself to be a machine to fit into a bigger machine.  Indeed, there is a huge subset of self-help lit called "Nearo-Linguistic Programming" that teaches you to program youself like a computer.  BTW, this stuff is really sponsored by corporate America as my dad was once told to read an NLP book about getting people to like you.  Even more curiously there is a big subset of NLP dedicated to teaching loser guys to basically brainwash girls into sleeping with them.  Let's not single out NLP thought, I used to read a lot of this pop-psych lit and still stat abreat of the field, and I can tell you the basic principles are fairly the same.  They pretty boil down to inducing as much of a hypnotic-like state as possible then start pgrogramming.  What few people figure  out is that a far more high--tech version of psyc programming is done on a massive  scale with disastrous results.  Below is how it works as pointed out by David Korten in When Corporations Rule the World .   ADVERTISERS: assure us their products will make us whole, which leads to => BUYING THEIR PRODUCT: requires more money, which leads to => QUEST FOR MONEY: widens the gaps between ourselves, family, and community => DEEPENING ALIENATION: creates inner sense of social and spiritual emptiness => ADVERTISERS: assure us their products will make us whole, which starts the downward spiral over again  When it the technique is exposed it seems so simple.  Like all great scientific achievements it is beautiful in its simplicity, esp. considering the fact that it has arisen not by conscious human design by an evolutionary economic process.  What this means is that the notion of "Stepford Wives" obscures the bigger problem.  Although it is important to continue the fight for women, it must now be linked explicitly to the fight against a sytem no one has designed or controls, a system that is devaluing our lives and our relationships with one another.  There may be no Stepford, CT, but there doesn't need to be.  We live in a Stepford World.

      Atrios has a  urlLink post  about the how utterly pathetic many in the media are.  Press coverage is never going to improve until America becomes a real living democracy.  That's not going to happen until more people are using their brains for thinking rather than letting them rot as they watch insipid sitcoms.  All of these issues fit together.  People get piss-poor media coverage because very few people have the time or inclination to think seriously.  This is not going to happen until we collectively break the vicious cycle of mindless consumerism, which goes like this:  ADVERTISERS: assure us their products will make us whole, which leads to =>  BUYING THEIR PRODUCT: requires more money, which leads to =>  QUEST FOR MONEY: widens the gaps between ourselves, family, and community =>  DEEPENING ALIENATION: creates inner sense of social and spiritual emptiness =>  ADVERTISERS: assure us their products will make us whole, which starts the downward spiral over again  Anyone disagree?

       urlLink This  shows the utter insanity of Beltway Right.  The fact that these right-fanatics take their cue from the  urlLink Moonie Times  underscores all the reason we have got to fight the Radcon establishment in DC.  Unfortunately, too many progressives forget that the RadCon Beltway crowd will remain in power once W is gone.  And they will still funnel their propaganda through the Moonie Times and other Moon-controlled organizations.  It's a telltale sign that the major media does not seriously address the impact that the freaky Rev. Moon has on conservative politics.  The reason they don't is because progressives have little power to make it an issue in the Washington media.    For that to change pogressives need to learn the media techniques RadCons have used to get their message out.  We certainly can't depend on the Democratic Party because their were nutjob Democrats at Moon's crowning too.  As a friend says:  "And the cumshots inside the Beltway wonder why the rest of America scratches their heads at our government.  The douchebags up there need a good beating for this."

      I got this from Mike in Raleigh NC on http://blogforamerica.com:  What country do I live in?  In my country the president was not elected by a majority of the people.  In my country the government leaders make decisions in secret and refuse to inform the public.  In my country you are not guaranteed that your vote will count.  In my country the media often acts as a propaganda tool for the government.  In my country I can be arrested and jailed without a trial.  In my country I can be held without trial and without communication-I can disappear on government orders.  In my country my telephone, letters, email, purchases, and other activities are secretly monitored by the government.  In my country the government spends most of the tax money on weapons and military.  I live in:  (a) the USSR under Stalin  (b) Italy under Mussolini  (c) Nazi Germany  (d) The USA  Any questions, class????????  Posted by Mike in Raleigh NC at June 17, 2004 12:05 PM  Are we better off under Bush than under Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler?  Absolutely, there is no moral equivalance between Bush and that evil trio.  however, these are interesting questions nonetheless.  I like the way conservatives are making the case for torture by saying stuff like "oh it's not as bad as Treblinka"  Great, so I am supposed to Republican because they are better than Nazis.  Sorry guys, this is America and we need more convincing reasons to vote for someone.

      I find it interesting that  urlLink Australia's right of center PM like Midnight Oil's Beds Are Burning .  It reminds me of Laura Bush's supposed fondness for Langston Hughes.  This is something that should make conservatives wonder....Why do conservatives have so few artisitic achievements?  It seems like every young conservative I know listens to music that is completly at odds with their political beliefs.  Nothing is necessarily wrong with that, just makes you wonder why conservatives don't really produce much culture that is interesting.  Why?

       urlLink Nat Hentoff has an excellent article  in The Village Voice that touches on a subject I think is very important: the successful tradition of the anti-authoritarian movements.  Progressives need to engage in a sustained, coordinated PR campaign to publicize the fact that today's progressive movement is an outgrowth of the successful progressive victories of the past, victories we have come to take for granted.  Frequently progressives are accused of being unrealistic, overly-idealistic, out of touch with reality.  Too often progressives themselves cave in to these accusations and back off on their more ambitious goals.  However, we must continually remind ourselves that conservatives have consistently been on the wrong side of history.  A PR campaign focused on reviving the memory of progressive successes will go a long way toward revitalizing progressives and discouraging conservatives and potential conservatives.  However, this is something that centrist Democrats can't do.  Centrist are not believable when they claim to speak in the tradition of progressives.  They seem as if they are merely exploiting the movement rather than working in its tradition.

      A  urlLink Washington Post article  points out some key problems Sen. Kerry has.  These problems can all be distilled to one main problem and it afflicts almost all Democrats.  Namely, Democrats seem not to stand for anything.  Is the fault of people like John Kerry?  Is it the fault of the DNC and other appendages of the Democratic Party.  No, absolutely not.    Politicians naturally seek their self-interest.  Democrats have done this, so have Republicans.  What makes one lose and the other win? Organization.  From my experience most political activists are NOT radical conservatives.  However, the radcons are much better organized.  Specifically, they are far more productive so that the people resources they do have are more effective the vast number of street marching, letter writing, left-wing activists.   urlLink Productivity  is about getting more bang for your buck.  Conservatives have had to learn how to do that as they viewed themselves not just going up against radicals and progressive but also against the liberal DC establishment built up by FDR/JFK/LBJ.  Sure, liberals have been good about organizing in some respects.  NAder's early successes and Emily's List come to mind.  However, the key difference is that radcons operate from a unified cognitive framework that allow radcon activists to see how various conflicting components of their agenda fit together.  This assists not just in building expedient political alliances but also in identifying, recruiting, and training younger operatives that grow and develop in the close network of radcon institutions.  For example, let's look at the case of Grover Norquist. His activists network is one of the strongest and most successful in RadCon circles.    From what I understand Norquist rightist values were first inculcated by his dad who was fond of buying little Grover an ice cream cone then taking a lick and saying "that's federal taxes," then taking another big lick and stating "that's state taxes."  A few more licks for local taxes and fees, tariffs etc. and pretty soon little Grover had barely any ice cream left in his cone.  This is enough to make anyone anti-government (or if they are saner it will just make them realize that their father is a nut).    Grover also read  Witness  which is the bio of Whitaker Chambers who outed Alger Hiss.  Chambers was not just anti-Communist but he also emphasized the importance of a belief in God and by extension could be viewed as a proponent of traditional values.    So little Grover was emotionally involved in the conservative fight (from all those upsetting taxes on his ice cream).  He was also intellectually involved through his reading of Witness and other conservative literature.  So we have a nice little ideologue here, not so different from lefty ideologues.  However, the difference emerges in college.  At Harvard Grover was involved in College Republicans met up with other like-minded radcons.  He eventually went to Harvard business school where his thesis was about reforming the College Republicans.  He also served as a leader of the national College Republicans, a post he used to cultivate other right-wing connections.  He also was an early student of Morton C. Blackwell, who is one conservative more progressives need to learn about.  Morton big thing is training the next generation of radical conservative activists.  From there Grover got sucked into the radical conservative scene in Washington, DC.  I don't know the specifics of how he built his personal network, but the fact remains that there was a network already in Washington, DC that Grover could build on.  This is what happened.  Norquist started building a power center with other right-wing geeks.  This culiminated in Wednesday group meetings where the right-wing geek squad could go off on the topic de jour.  He also started having frequent parties (or at least what right-wingers call parties) at his townhouse in Capitol Hill.  So here we have someone who is committed to the cause, well organized, Harvard MBA, and understands the linkage between the grassroots activist conservative and the more refined philosophical conservative.  This creates a powerful combination when managed by someone who understand the power of effective organization and strategy.  Norquist has a clear vision: to cut the government in half.  He has clear ambitions.  When I interned with his group, ATR, another intern asked him what would happen when we (i.e. the radcons) took control of the White House, kept control of Congress, and won a majority of the statehouses.  Grover's answer was one word: "the world."  This is what the pathetically disorganized left is up against.  They need to disabuse themselves of all their little notions about corporations ruling the world in a secret conspiracy and open their eyes to the very unsecret coordination of the radical conservative movement in Washington, DC.  Sure corporations are greedy and psychotic, however, they do not have the sort of strong consciousness of being a political movement that the radical conservatives possess.  This idea of being part of something greater than yourself is what motivates members of the radical conservative movement to take low-paying jobs in DC working for the "movement" instead of higher-paying jobs in the for-profit sector.  I was something of a conservative activist in college and I remember when I decided to take a job for corporation my conservatives friends kidded me about "selling out" because I did not work in the movement.  The radical conservatives have done what radical progressives never even dreamt of doing.  Despite being a tiny minority of the US population, espousing views that many Americans would consider nutty, they have managed to seize control of political power at the highest level.  Some progressives choose to view this pessimistically as yet another issue to despair over.  I view it as just the opposite.  The triumph of radical conservatives should be an inspiration for radicals everywhere.  IT demonstrates that through effective focus organization radicals can take over the government and push public policy in their direction.  This is akin to a peaceful revolution.  However, it is a long-term revolution, not the quick and fun affairs leftist usually imagine.  It took at least 25+ years for its practical implementation and about a another 25 years before that for a coherent "modern" conservatism to take form.  If you are not in it for the long run, then why are you in it at all?  Progressives should keep this mind as they consider alternative organizing strategies.  Considering the success of the radical conservative agenda, I have decided against the left taking a decentralized approach.  I have not seen where this has been effective.  Instead it leads to fragmentation and infighting.  We need a centralized approach to take on political power.  Since Washington, DC is arguably the political capital of the world now, we desparately need professional progressive operatives in DC who are willing to see themselves as fighting for a particularly worldview and philosophy of life instead of merely fighting for issues and parties.  There need to be regular meetings in DC, organizations that identify, recruit, and train progressive operatives in the study of politics and how to succeed.  I have a very Washington-centric approach because DC is the city of politics.  If you want to do politics, go to DC.  It is at times an immensely boring city, but so is the daily task of fighting for a better world.    I am sure some of this organizational infrastructure is already in place or is being established.  However, there is a ways to go in emulating what conservatives have done.  I should note that progressives should not simply copy conservative strategies in techniques but merely learn from and come to grip with the cold hard fact that on many fronts conservatives have just out-organized progressive while having fewer activists on their side!

      The radical free-market types tend not to get caught up in the details of how the market actually works preferring their neat little economic models to business reality.  One are were this is glaringly true is in executive compensation.  Why is it that  urlLink bad CEOs  are paid so much despite declining performance?  The ansewr does not lie in the dry abstract world of economics, but in the very real world of corporate power politics.  The executive class in America has basically colluded to set laws and regulations in their favor and to the detriment of their corporations stakeholders, including investors, communities, employees, and customers.  Anyone with common sense knows that the marketplace for corporate compensation is severely distorted but rigid adherence to free-market ideology prevents the public from doing anything about it.  This lack of public activism, in partiular the lack of shareholder activism, prevents the economy from functioning at its peak.

      Most Americans would reflexively associate "family values" with the Republican party and centrist Democrats.  However, when it comes to actually doing something for the children of America's families the GOP and Democrats come up short.  The US ranks lowest in per capita social spending and has a child poverty rate of about 1 out of five children.  Must it be this way?   urlLink Absolutely not Nordic countries spend significantly more on social expenditures and have a child poverty rate of about one out of every 25 children.    Five timer lower than the US. .  Economist and business leaders need to keep this in mind and ask themselves if the US can have a truly competitive workforse in the future with 20% of kids growing up poor.

This is a textbook example of what I believe has to be done.  This is such an inspiration  I am surprised Kucinich's organization is still going.  Clearly he is intent on building a permanent grassroots organization to push for progressive causes.  Let's hope the Naderites will be willing to work with the Kucinich people.

      I am shocked at what sort of crap passes as academic research.  A  urlLink study of media bias coming out of UCLA  claims that the media are biased to the left.  It's methodology strikes me as absurd.    Basically, the authors define a media outlet as biased to the left if they cite so-called "left-wing think tanks" more frequently than right wing think tanks.  The implicit assumption is that all think tanks are created the same.  Of course, this is bullshit.  Anyone who has ever worked at Heritage or even knows anyhing about the way they do business knows that Heritage is a marketing organization more than a think tank.  Brookings and RAND have a lot more credibility.  I seriously doubt even a serious right-winger would disagree with that.  Now if you are a journalist what are you going to cite a right-wing propaganda group or think tanks like Brookings and RAND which have strong historical reputations for accurate work?  I want to know who funded this study and why this has passed peer review despite such a pathetic mistake as treating all think tanks as equal.  Anyone even remotely familiar with DC knows that rigth-wing think tanks are more marketing oriented than are the old-line liberal think tanks like Brookings and RAND.  This study proves nothing other than that sloppy research can easily slip through the cracks.

       urlLink Christopher hitchens  is still trying desparately to carve out his niche as "the sensible left-winger who supported the war in Iraq."  Fortunately, no one really cares what Hitchens has to say any more.  Hitchens reveals his stunning insight that Moore's a propagandist.  Thank you, Mr. Hitchens!  Gee, I would never have guessed that Moore's films are not well-reasoned balanced documentaries.  What an idiotic critique.  Hitchens sounds particularly testy in this article, as if he has a very bad case of hemorrhoids.  Perhaps he is upset that Moore has achieved popularity that Hitchens can only dream of, regardless, I am sure even conservatives will write more sensible criticisms of F9/11.  Most amusing is Hitchens final paragraph:   If Michael Moore had had his way, Slobodan Milosevic would still be the big man in a starved and tyrannical Serbia. Bosnia and Kosovo would have been cleansed and annexed. If Michael Moore had been listened to, Afghanistan would still be under Taliban rule, and Kuwait would have remained part of Iraq. And Iraq itself would still be the personal property of a psychopathic crime family, bargaining covertly with the slave state of North Korea for WMD. You might hope that a retrospective awareness of this kind would induce a little modesty. To the contrary, it is employed to pump air into one of the great sagging blimps of our sorry, mediocre, celeb-rotten culture. Rock the vote, indeed.    First, notice a phrase in that last line "celeb-rotten culture."  Funny for someone who writes for Vanity Fair to call our culture "celeb-rotten."  Anyhow, on to my point.  In this final paragraph Hitchens accuses Moore of holding ridiculous positions based on mere implications.  In short Hitchens engages in a bit of anti-Moore propagand.  However, Hitchens whole article before this paragraph consists of condemning Moore for using shameless propaganda methods in his film.  What rank hypocrite, what a pathetic figure Hitchens is.  Hitchens apparently cannot think in nuanced terms.  With him you are all for war or else you support Baathism.  One expects this from an uneducated right-winger, not from a former left-wing writer once known for his critical faculty.

      Here are some comments regarding a post I made on Democratic Underground.  My original comments are in italics   Anonymous said...    Face it folks, Reagan is popular because he believed in something, and fought for it.What did he believe in?  Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, etc. What did he fight for? Death squads, arms for hostages, support for Islamic fundamentalis goverments. Great stuff.   Clinton, what was it that he believed in again? Triangulation? OR whatever Dick Morris told him to believe that week. That people can work together to make the world a better place. That nobody has the ultimate truth. That truth unfolds in time through a communal process.   Hate to break it to you Dems but until the Democratic part has real progressive visionaries as leaders recent Dem presidents are going to be less popular than Reagan.     I used to be like you, but I grew up   As far as what Reagan believed and did: He believed in a radical conservative agenda.  He fought for many things.  Yes, including the abhorrent things mentioned above.  However, my point is not that these things are great, but that Reagan and his followers had a deep commitment and this is one reason why radical conservatives have been so successful.  As far as the second remark.  This is truly bizarre.  Working together with Newt Gingrich.  Working together with people who will do everything to sink you using the most lurid details of your personal life?  Democrats had better visit the proctologist and have their heads removed from their asses.  The radical conservatives don't want to work together in some wonderful dance of the dialectic.  They want all out war. This is indicative of the defeatist mentality that has permeated the Democratic party.    The fact is that because Clinton was a centrist he could never articulate a serious LONG TERM strategy against the radical conservatives, which is one reason we have Bush now.  I am interested in the long-term.  I am wary of another Clinton.  I am concerned about the effect it will have on the progressive movemetns attempt to influence the Democratic party.  If Kerry's language and campaign organization convinces me that he is serious about giving progressives a large place at the table then I will be all for him.  As yet I am not convinced.

      Interesting  urlLink scientific findings about happiness .  I have long suspected that happiness, as the psychologist define it, is not all it's cracked up to be.  It is interesting that people psychologist definie as "happy" are more likely to have an unrealistic view of reality.  I think this ultimately sets them up for failure.  This shouldn't be a real insight.  All I am saying is that people who can grasp reality aren't going to deal effectively with it.  However, this just the opposite of the pop psych self-help gurus who peddle the "power of positive thinking," or "learned optimism" as it is called by more professional psychologist.  Unfortunately, not only is pseudo-happiness defective for the individual it has even worse consequences for society as the whole mass of the population becomes deluded into thinking everything is OK.  This is what leads to the politics of mindlessness.  It is not surprising that "happy" people are more likely to be politically engaged.  Many politically engage people are really ignorant of the issues and cannot stand serious debate.  These "happy fools" run the local party apparatus and quickly make life unbearable for anyone with a shred of intelligence.  This reinforces the viscious cycle and pretty soon we have two political parties that are utterly pointless.  Despair, anger, even depression are the real motivating forces behind political change.  Unfortunately, progressives have tied their fate to the Anybody but Bush Democratic Party rather than trying to take over the power structure of that party.  Until progressives do that, it will just be more of the same.

       urlLink This  is pretty amazing.  Now I understand the need for breast implants for reconstructive surgery, but why would any woman undergo this for cosmetic purposes?  Of course, the answer to that question is straightforward.  They have been convinced to do so by a hyper-consumerist ideology.

      Here is a post from DU about why no one gives a shit about progressive votes.  This is my theory, anyway--not much to it really.  In recent history, even when pandered to, progressives are not able to elect a candidate. Now these definitions are a little murky, but even if you limit it to something concrete like Dean/Kucinich/Nader supporters, it still holds, because none of these candidates can amass enough votes to get anywhere on the national scale. Now some would note that Dean is not as 'progressive' as the others mentioned, but even he with a more mainstream kick was only able to build an impressive campaign and organziation--once the votes started the nomination slipped away from him.  The big myth is that the 50% of the nation that doesn't vote is waiting for something new, something not represented by the mainstream. Unfortunately, there have been several instances where they have had just that, whether in Kucinich, Nader, or in the more mainstream Dean--they do not come out in any significant numbers to vote for any of these folks. It's okay to say that the two parties have a hammerlock on 'electability' which effects Nader's numbers, but even in the primary progressives so often lose out over more 'establishment' candidates--why is that if most people want a progressive candidate who is different from the two parties?  In my mind, I try to take a coldblooded view to politicians--I don't trust that they have anything in mind beyond getting elected or advancing themselves. If their actions can be explained by either, then those are the motivations I usually attribute to them. Some (Kucinich is one) strike me as really being true to their statements and honestly trying to do what is right, but it seems to me most will stretch their values to get elected or advance themselves one way or another.  Given that, why should any politician court progressives? If we can't elect them, what good are we? We've had some great progressive candidates, and we can't nominate or elect one? I guess I can't expect a politican on the national scale to pander to progressives, because in recent years the history of folks who do that is not the most encouraging in the world. Whether through the influence of the media or just general ignorance, people are NOT voting for these candidates, and so long as that is the case I can't see politicians deciding to go with what seems to be a losing strategy.  What do you think? Is this the problem, and if so how do we start to solve it?
