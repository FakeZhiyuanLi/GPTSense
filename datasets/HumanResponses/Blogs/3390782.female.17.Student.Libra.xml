        Everyone has done something they aren't proud of. You can't do much about them because you can't change the past. However, sometimes these demons from our past come back. Then what are you to do? I have a demon...many demons. I am not proud of most of them, but one of them was a beautiful disaster. Everyone has been in a really screwed up situation once in their life. I have been in many, but the one involving he who is called Chester is the one I don't regret... my beautiful disaster...my immortal. All things have a consequence and I have a consequence to my beautiful disaster; I love him. More than I wish to admit. I used to love him before, but then he drained my heart and made a spade. However, I now can feel for him again and I don't know why. How can someone who once poisoned my blood now cause it to flow so freely? I feel my life and my death inside him. I hope that death comes first as life would not have meaning if I can't have him.

        Sometimes, I sit back and wonder just what exactly my life is about. I mean, isn't everyone supposed to have a reason for living? Well, I can't help but wonder what mine is. I'm not a nice person, I fake that I like people who I can't stand, I use people and abuse the feelings they have for me, and I don't contribute to the world in any profound way. I'm just a waste of space and air. No one really cares about me. Everyone will say, "I love you," but how many of them actually mean it? I don't think anyone does. I mean, saying it is one thing, but actions speak louder than words. If someone would actually show me that they loved me, then I would believe them, but I have yet to have this happen. I feel like life is a journey and I'm left to wander alone. Occasionally, someone will join me for a few miles, but then they just go off onto another road like all of the others. Then, I'm alone again. I get so lonely sometimes and it makes me depressed and mad. I get mad at myself. I wish that I had someone that I could connect with, even if it's just for a minute, because that's what life is...a series of moments.

        I haven't lived a very long life, but I have experienced things that go greatly beyond my years. I mean, I think that life is something that you must take for granted. You never know when Death will come and take it away, so you should enjoy yourself while you can. I get called a Slut for having a few "encounters", yet I see it as me enjoying myself in a way that I find suitable. Also, I learned the reality of love. Love does not truly exist in the world. I mean, you may say you love someone and you may have feelings for that person, but love is such a strong emotion that I don't think anyone is capable of feeling it. My friend John tells me he loves me and, for amusement, I asked him why. He told me because I make him happy and when he's around me he feels so comfortable and he thinks about me all the time. He said that I make him feel a way no one ever has. Mind you me and John never had a relationship. He has such great feeling for me and he believes that the only way that it can be described is love. I had a boyfriend tell me that he loved me and I believed him. He said that he loved me because I made him happy. He, then, broke up with me because he no longer felt the same way he used to. Does that mean he no longer loves me? I think so. I think love is something that lasts forever and if marriage is an eternal bond of love, then how do you explain the 75% divorce rate?

        I'm sick of parents. What is the point of having someone go around grounding you for lies and&nbsp;for hanging out with the people that you have a connection with. I have a lot of difficulty opening up to people, but when I finally do open up to someone, they force me to no longer speak to them again. That sucks so much!! I feel like I lost my best friend! I can't bring myself to gain the courage that I need to stand up for myself and those that I care about, so I am forever a coward. That's all I am. I will do just about anything to get attention and recognition from others, but then I hide from everything. I'M SICK OF HIDING!!! I just want to crawl out from under this rock of fear and take a stand. I want a lot of things. I want my family to lay off of me. I want my friends to be happy. I want Ty and Jy to get laid, (Not with each other!!). I want to be happy. I also want this wicked heartagram lunchbox I saw at Hot Topic for $20, but seriously, I am sick and tired of doing what everyone tells me to do. For once I want to do what I want. I just want one thing in this world; HAPPINESS. I'll never get it. Happiness is a sharp razor and a willing vein away.

        Why is everything always falling down on me? I try so hard to make everything work out and just when I think my life is perfect, BAM!! I hit a fucking brick wall and everything is shattered into a million, jagged, pieces. Then, when I try to pick the pieces up, I cut my hands and just end up drowning in a pool of my blood and I have no one to blame except myself. I wish that just once, my life wouldn't be a fucked-up mess! I thought I found happiness. I thought that I would no longer be this angry little Goth who hates everything unless it will destroy her. I thought I had a reason to wake-up in the morning. I couldn't have been more wrong! I have nothing, NOTHING!! And I believe in nothing! I AM NOTHING! I just wanted to be happy and this is what a get. I can't even lay down because of all the fucking knives that are in my back! I wish that, just for once, instead of me bleeding for everyone else, I wish someone&nbsp;would bleed for me. No one has ever bled for me. I passed out last night, for some odd reason,&nbsp;and I woke up with the most fucked-up headache and no one cares. I don't even care. I have no purpose in my life except to destroy myself. I don't even have to do it because everyone else is doing a great job destroying me. I have suffered for so long and I don't see an end. Someone, anyone, please hear my cry and if you know me, or even if you don't know me, if you care, then let me know because I feel so alone right now.

        Ah, yes, another day for me to fathom my meaningless existence. I have spent the last few days evaluating my life. What does it all mean? I have learned that nothing is forever. As much as you don't want it to, everything will come to an end. Also, you have to live your life for yourself. I have spent years trying to make everyone happy. I have hidden the true me in random cuts and scars that cover my body. I make myself this way. I hide away all of my emotions so that I will fit into this cruel and enforgiving world. I find myself on my knees, begging for acceptance from others while I lose respect for myself. I don't even want to spend any time with myself anymore because I hate who I have come to be. I am going to say it now, loud and proud, for the whole world to hear it! I AM ASHLEY COLLINS AND I AM A GOTH!!! There, Mom, Dad (whoever you are), all my relatives and all my friends...I AM A GOTH!! Deal with it! I am not going to change who I am just to please any of you!

        Why is everything so hard for me? Am I the most fucked-up person in the world? I can't deal with all of this torture anymore! I am so sick of everyone just acting like their so much better than me and walking all over me like I'm a piece of shit! I'm human, too, goddamn it! I have feelings that get hurt just like all of you! I wish that someone...anyone would just take a minute out to care about me for once. To care about how I feel and what I want. I'm always doing things that male other people happy and I don't even care about myself. I'm so sick and tired of faking happiness, of putting on this facade to make everyone believe that I'm happy when I'm not. I'm dying on the inside! Every moment that I have to live this fake life, I want to die!
