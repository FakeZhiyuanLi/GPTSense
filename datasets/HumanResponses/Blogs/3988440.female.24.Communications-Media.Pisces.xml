      there had been a lot, and I mean a hell lot&nbsp;of heart aches just this monday night and I really got pissed....so much that&nbsp;I'd&nbsp;said "fuck!" the whole three days and "shit!" every second...then someone told me "never accept heartaches,&nbsp;give it back to the person who wants to pass it on to you" Right, I don't deserve the fuck! So now atleast I got that sinister grin again... &nbsp;and return the favor...ò

      Got drunk today,  Didn't go home---refused to eat. I AM so angry that I want to bite people who glance my way.  MY HATE could be transparent with my face wrinkled and my eyes glaring like mad cows'...  I Had a terrible fight with father. Though rain thunders our roof, neighbors could still hear that high pitched scream (i usually do) when I'm already out of reasons. (yes, unlike other fathers who slap their children when they answer back) My father lets me scream and glare at him and reason out.  HE knows me very well...that I do need my ounce of shouting and endless reasoning on why I was an outlaw with his RULES.  Father tried to&nbsp;talk me into something&nbsp;but I AM a Lawyer of my own opinions after all IT's MY LIFE!!!  That was it, my father shut up--which people around us say what an incompetent parent my father is or what a terrible  person I am (to have shush my father). Neighbors often eavesdrop and say, "what an ungrateful bastard" I have become.  SILENCE...but the silence which my father usually practice over me is like a&nbsp;vast space that makes me think&nbsp; to&nbsp; run away and forget&nbsp;--leave my father in peace.   His silence works like magic over m. Never fails to lessen the pounding anger, never fails to make my reasons clear up and see the stupidity of shouting and making a scene. He pushes it on my face that I can't seem to ignore it.  THE HARDEST part of every fight is whose pride would bow first, whose white flag would be fisrt raised. In our case It's usually my dad's  It's always dad who comes into my room and bring me milk before going to sleep or buy me my favorite burger meal, or show me the latest comic strip he finished, or fetch me over from a friend's house or wakes up earlier than I do on school days or adds another 20 bucks to my allowance.  It's usually dad-always my dad's pride though he never seems to mind. Oftentimes I think taht maybe He lost his pride eversicne I came into this world That I've trampled on his pride, crushed it, buried it, coverd it with all&nbsp;of anger and fight and hatred.  But now it's diffferent  I went far away today where no friend knew or no phones or anything but prayers could connect me to father. And i don't think my dad could follow me here or maybe, with all the hurtful words I've said-maybe this time He wouldn't bother finding me.  "This is what I wanted after all," i tried to convince myself. "my own rules, my own decision, my own way of living my life". Now you think, (as i would like to believe) that I am strong enough to be away from dad.  By nightfall, everything slowly went dark. No moon tonight, for the clouds over the east is heavy with rain. With no money in hand, where'd I stay? With no dad and only with my PRIDE, where'd I go? That east wind will soon drive the rain clouds over my unsheltered body, clothed with Pride....only pride.

      there was this place that only the two of us find only in our minds do we set those footprints no one knew...  picture perfect under the moonless night embraced by the wind touched by a mist of you...  no words ever said not even a whisper not allowed to touch nor blow a kiss but i felt.  some memory left but scent lingers and that moment  dawn must have come for the mist that was you faded to be kept at the deepest and loneliest part waiting for the stars to shine again.

      Think it over...who is it that is greatest in the eyes of a father; the son who is summoned and said he will come but did not or the daughter who is called upon and declined yet  came to the house of the father?  this applies to my quest in life.  I was not coming to the expectation that my father is hoping that I'd become. So I refuse to see him or him finding me. I have to call myself first and know who and what I am before I march down to his gates. Until then, he'll just know I'm around. I know he wouldn't mind me wandering off.  The sooner I find myself, the sooner I'll be knocking on your door dad.Ü.

      I am quite crazy right now. I don't go to church for many questions that has surfaced this time of my life. And I did find myself when I have answered, as honestly as possible the following questions. It's not the end of the search for oneself but these did help in a sense that sometimes, we need to deny certain dogmas, forget religion, be distant to your God and just....be in this world.  1. What are the things that you need for the next 5 years? 2. What are the things you want to have? 3. After # years of your life, what have you achieved for yourself which made you happy? Do you owe this to anyone? 4.What is it that you need most to happen/own/achieve in the next 6 months?Why do you think so? 5. Can you say that you completely listen to the needs of your body or do you feel pain or dis-ease but doesn't know where it comes from? 6. Do you fill your body's needs and wants? 7. Buy something that you need. Something you want. 8. after all this, read over what you have written and answer the following: a. Do your wants make you happy after getting them? b. Do these wants and needs make the person you are? c. Can these needs and wants be absent in your life? 9. What are you most afraid of? What are you most afraid to lose? 10. What is it that you feel unqualified for? 11.Do you ever feel cheated/mistreated?When and How? To whom do you blame it when you feel them? 12. What is/are your fantasy/sies or wishful events?  ...let's just say that your God is not in any way making these happen. Just think of yourself, your life and the world...happy hunting.

      by: Cynthia Alexanders  Woke up this morning I was staring at the ceiling cracks, and roadmaps, and landscapes, and highways.  I have seen, I have been to places far and deep in my mind Only to find comfort in your strangeness  Of moving shadows while I call the wind by name Brushing fire, water in the dark of the clouds  We are slaves to the crimes we commit In fits of passion we shame We are nothing, we are nothing, we are nothing We are nothing, we are nothing, we are nothing  The dust on your fee Dying to be born again Singing etho, water, fire Singing earth, sing air

      I realize that though how many achievements you've received or happy memories you've gathered, they don't really matter now, at present. They are like food. They get tasted, digested and thrown. The experiences of a person can be likened to an exotic food; you remember eating them but they don't nourish you now.  I also realize that life has no meaning or purpose. You are just damn lucky like me who happen to be given the chance to exist and enjoy. So never-ever be sad or desperate. Enjoy life, you don't deserve to be lonely or to be made to accept sad facts.  You have no responsibility over the world. Rememeber that the world also has its own way of refreshing itself. It had existed before you and survived the people before and will survive those after you.  Problems may give you the bumpy ride but it is to discover your inner strengths and they could be turning points to discover the things you miss or chose to miss. Problems arrive to give you a push or make you face the other direction.  I also realize that  like you, other people or other living things were also given the special chance of life so RESPECT that life and never hurt that LIFE Because just like you and the rest of the earth, they deserve to be completely happy.
