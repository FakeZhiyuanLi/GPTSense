      Perhaps the CUUPS folks should attend this event and see if others are interested:  The majesty of a mountain overlook, the mystery of a deserted beach, the quiet of an old growth forest, or the bright sparkle of a mountain streamWhat is it that draws you back to a place? What is it in us that responds to a particular favorite spot, that gives us a feeling of anticipation as we approach it, a feeling of satisfaction or re-creation as we take in its essence? These topics and more will be explored at the day-long Spirit and Nature Conference at Chatham College, Saturday, October 16, 2004.

      Summer is passing and the grounds and gardens at Sunnyhill are reflecting the efforts of many people who have contributed to their nice appearance.  A number of work parties were held in May and June.  In May, the back patio and front and rear gardens were readied for our annual picnic.  The gutters were also cleaned of the growing maple wings.  In June, three work parties were held during which the many yews were trimmed, the trumpet vine shaped, and tree branches which interfered with cutting the grass were removed.  In addition, general weeding and sweeping of the front patio and the gardens were performed.   You have probably noticed the results of considerable effort to remove six yews and the Thornwood bush at the entrance to the north parking lot.  These were removed to provide another parking space and to improve the visibility of the lot making it unnecessary to enter and leave to see if there was a spot available.  It also helps traffic flow on the Sunnyhill entrance driveway when there are a lot of people entering.  The resulting tree branches and yews were reduced to mulch using a wood chipper.   All of the above work could not have been accomplished without the help of the following:  Carl and Liz Bergmann, Vijay Chandhok, Charlie Cook, Larry Comden, Margaret Hamstead, Mike and Mary-Jo Hennessey, Joe Lodge, Margaret Lindquist, Andy Loverich Bernard, Keith McGough, Emily Marlier, Kimball Nedved, Steve and Angela Suarez, Pat Troell, Jerry Walsh, George and Patty Williams, and Robert Williams.   Our thanks to all who have helped maintain the Sunnyhill gardens and grounds.  More work parties are planned to make Sunnyhill ready for the fall opening.  So, it is not too late to provide your expertise to help.  In addition to meeting fellow Sunnyhillers, you also become eligible to participate in the annual Garden Party party to celebrate our efforts during the year.

      This is copied from the 2004 SUUSI catalogue:   Ekstasis - A New Worship for Unitarian Universalists Ekstasis is an exciting and innovative worship service which celebrates being fully human, welcoming and taking pleasure in the whole body's amazing ability to sense and to feel and to think within the realm of worship. Ekstasis invites participants into a physical and cerebral worship, encouraging everyone to enjoy their bodies‚ wondrous, natural responses and sensations, in primal human yearnings to engage ecstasy, as well as their rational sensibilities.   Ekstasis allows and promotes the Œhallowed use‚ of modern technology: computer generated art, visual slide shows, live video feeds, dynamic sound systems, and Œtechno‚ dance music.   Ekstasis offers worshippers a time of reunion with their ancient human impulses to sing and dance and move into the flow of sacred time and place and drama.   For over thirteen years, the Reverend Thomas G. Anastasi has been parish minister at Shoreline Unitarian Universalist Church near Seattle. Thomas‚ background is diverse and non-typical. He was reared as a Pentecostal Christian and later worked as a professional singer and musician. He brings this spirited energy to his ministry, continually exploring new and creative ways to engage and embody liberal religion in the world."    Out of curiosity I attended this "worship service" at SUUSI. Someone's report on this could not have been believed had it not been personally experienced. UU Pentecostalism has been marketed for some time by this relabeled pentecostal.    The initial observation was to say that "It was placed incorrectly in the schedule. It would have been great had it been in the entertainment portion of the evening NOT in the worship category." However, after some amount of reflection, the distinction is retracted since a worship service usually utilizes forms of entertainment. This "service" could easily been replaced with a round of liquor.   In pursuing that line of thought further, I get more authentic religion from some of the entertainers while at SUUSI than the clerics. The clerics use often issues in life to tell me how I should act and what organized activities I should support. Meanwhile, the entertainers, who act like the sages in past times, present the sometimes searing issues of life in the form of metaphors and narratives then allow me the wisdom and motivation to act in the manner of my choosing.   In analyzing the activities of clerics, I offer that a large number should leave the "ministry", undertake social work and leave religion to those who take religion seriously and are better equipped to teach serious religion.

      Pittsburgh UFETA's (Unitarian Universalists for the Fair &amp; Ethical Treatment of Animals) Sunnyhill's Schweitzer Group  Our focus is promoting the seventh principle of Unitarian Universalism, "respect for the interdependent web of existence of which we are a part", while acknowledging the need to extend the other 6 principles to include all living beings, whose welfare is inextricably linked to our own.  Our goal is to increase awareness by educating ourselves and others about animal suffering, to re-connect with and inspire reverence for the natural world, and to realize the far-reaching consequences of our daily choices and actions. With monthly discussions on the second Sunday of each month at 10:15 a.m. (as well as on-line discussions), volunteer projects, an animal blessing service (and hopefully other animal-centered services), guest speakers, potluck dinners (vegan, naturally!), cooking classes, and other member-driven activities, we hope to be a vibrant and inspiring presence at Sunnyhill.  Our first meeting of the year is Sunday, September 12, 2004 during Lifecraft (10:15). We'll be discussing the toll Factory Farming takes on our environment. This is an issue that needs to be addressed for our movement toward "Green Sanctuary" status with the UUA.   SPECIAL EVENT: 7 pm, Saturday, September 25, 2004   The first Pittsburgh-area screening of "Peaceable Kingdom", a documentary film that tells the powerful story of former farmers and animal rescuers working together to turn the tide on industrial farming. Light refreshments and childcare provided, and discussion to follow. FREE.    http://groups.msn.com/SchweitzergroupUFETA-Pittsburgh

      Our Minister, Rev. Lynn Brodie, presents three Sunday services each month, while the Sunnyhill Sunday Service  Committee  is responsible for arranging for the remaining services. The committee of dedicated volunteers plans, organizes and coordinates one or two services per month. It utilizes speakers from outside as well as from our own congregation. Services offer various viewpoints ranging from humanitarian to philosophical to theological.  Meetings of the committee are generally held on the third Sunday of each month, following our final service.  Please join us.  Your ideas and perspectives are most welcome.  The next meeting of the Sunnyhill Sunday Service Committee will be after the service on August 29th.  Please note that there will only be one service on that date starting at 10:30 am.

      Maurice has put the final schedule together for the popular Science and Spirituality group. Check it out. Of course, things can change in the future.   Perhaps this blog can be a place were other pointers and discussions can occur as a spin out of that group?

       "the number of people with no faith was rising but nobody was paying attention to where they were coming from."   It becomes obvious why we are hearing so much noise from the "America is a Christian Nation" crowd. They feel threatened by the loss of being able to assert they are the status quo having enjoyed an assumed certain privileged position. To do so, "Protestants" have had to embrace "Catholics" as fellow believers. Quite a reversal. Remember the noise made even when the first JFK ran for president just four decades ago. We can expect more "circling of the wagons" as the trend continues. People like D. James Kennedy are milking the people who are sensing the loss of their "freedom", their being the dominant religious (moral in their thinking) voice.   Your comments are welcomed.

      In religion, the use of metaphor is significantly important. To put this in perspective try the exercise below.   While sitting at your desk, lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles. Now, while doing this draw the number "6" in the air with your right hand.   Your foot will change direction and there's nothing you can do about it.   There is much to learn about how our minds work.
