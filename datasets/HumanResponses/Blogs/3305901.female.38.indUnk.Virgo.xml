      So fuck, you live your life trying to be a nice guy with a reputation for giving head to bisexual chicks, no problems except for the usual shit. So a few nights ago I was home watching "Deliverance" with my room-mate - no queer jokes please, I get enough of those from  urlLink cootersnap . And hey, it was on, it wasn't like we went to the effort to put in a tape. Anyway, Ned's big scene was coming up in maybe 10 or 15 minutes, I forget which, I hadn't watched it for the past couple of months. Anyway, I had just eaten a big hamburger pizza (don't forget the pig is a filthy animal) and the pressure in my lower regions was calling to be relieved. So I thought I'd hit the can, do my business, and get back with a few minutes to spare for Ned's career-defining role. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case.  As soon as I sat down on the throne I knew something was amiss.  However, out of deference to some of my fairer readers, I will not go into the graphics of the ensuing mishap that, suffice it to say, felt like my entrails were being ripped out in a staccato fashion. This went on for what seemed like hours, but really only lasted until the next commercial break during "Deliverance". Yes, I missed Ned's stellar performance, but certainly put on one of my own. Did I squeal like a pig? What are you, some kind of sick fuck? Pigs are unclean... I already told you. I'd like to think I bellowed more like a bull in heat.  Up! I gotta call. Seems like Mrs. Schuber needs a ride to Hy-Vee for her afternoon coffee clatch. Man, these afternoon hacking shifts are boring as fuck.

      1. People who roll their eyes when you ask them where to find something.  Does your minimum wage ass have something better to do right now other than your job?  Beatdown.  2. Clerks who yap their traps on the phone the entire time they are ringing up my shit, never even bothering to make eye contact with me.  Beatdown.  3. Customers who insist the grapes are $1.76 per lb., not $1.79, requiring the rest of us to wait while management scurries off to check the sign and inform said customer 10 minutes later that she is wrong.  Beatdown.

      Simple: People who can't shut the fuck up and thus make what should be a 10 minute meeting take an hour and a half, discussing such things as which hotel rewards programs are better than others, so I can't get my own work done, and will now be here until midnight (after leaving to play softball and coming back).&nbsp; They, and our opponents tonight, get a beatdown.

BEATdown. 4.&nbsp; Sales clerks at Von Maur who follow you around when you're dressed in your gardening clothes but wanted to stop and look for a dress for a semi-formal occasion the next week before getting dirty and then point you to the sales racks to look at leftover mumus because your overalls used to belong to an old,&nbsp;incredibly obese&nbsp;farmer named Harlan who was four feet tall and they think if they take their eyes off you you're going to shove the over-priced $400 dress inside said overalls.&nbsp; I'm still beating that bitch down.&nbsp; Down, girl!! 5.&nbsp; My ex-boyfriend, Twit, and his new girlfriend, Twat.&nbsp; Much beating.&nbsp; With big sticks. 6.&nbsp; The people who program the stoplights incorrectly so my poor car has to lurch to work because of a three second delay.&nbsp; Beatdown.

      1) If you smoke later in the evening and complain about the smell in the morning, you get a beatdown.  2) If you think it was a smart move for Mr. Kerry to let his wife speak at the DNC and open her up to political attack, you deserve a beatdown.  3) If you judge a way of thinking without reading it, beatdown. (I'm reading it to see what the psychosis is about)  4) If you blame the weather for making your hair friz, and not the wild romp in bed you got the night before, you deserve a beatdown.  5) If you're female and don't vote on my poll on my site, you deserve a beatdown.  6) Democrat? Beatdown.  Courtesy of  urlLink Johnny5

      1. If you smoke in the morning and then sit next to me on the bus so that I get to smell a wet ashtray all the way to work, you deserve a beatdown.   2. If you say that Teresa Heinz-Kerry is too mouthy and opinionated and you conveniently ignore the glaring double standard between men and women in the public eye, you deserve a beatdown.   3. Scientologist? Beatdown.   4. The weather is so muggy that my towel has not dried out for two days. Beatdown.   5. Ann Coulter, you deserve the biggest beatdown of all for being such a twat that you would attack  Max Cleland and belittle his patriotism and his war wounds. The guy lost three limbs in heavy combat during the Vietnam War and you accuse of him of lying about how it happened? What kind of fucking insect are you? I'm sorry, I do a disservice to insects everywhere by associating you with them. You are a goddamned turd and I hope you choke on your tongue.   Courtesy of  urlLink Sloth

      I know this is a free service, and perhaps I'm a selfish, ungrateful bitch for looking a gift service in the mouth...but sometimes Blogger deserves a beatdown! And I think we all know why. Like right now, when I am unable to create a new paragraph. For that, Blogger, you get a beatdown with a wireless mouse.

      To people who join homeschooling groups, make the group all about them, their children's needs and their own agenda and then NEVER show up again.  Phone calls are answered sweetly, plans are made, but nothing ever comes of any of it.  I'm sick to death of you people.  I have a busy life, I do not need to be picking up the shit you left behind in your wake and now you've made it impossible for me to start my own homeschooling group here in our teeny tiny town.    Beatdown with my unused school supplies.

      Mangers who are annoyingly paranoid about launching my new product because he/she doesn’t think I have thought of every single last contingency and continues to insiste on delays.   Yes, I’ve got all the normal contingencies in place (technical, non-technical).  No, I don’t have a contingency in place in case an 8-foot half-man half-Godzilla creature decides the product is too small for him/her to use.   You paranoid pessimistic bitch.  Beatdown with my left shoe.

      Drunk grrrls who act a fool and say (type) stupid things...... definately deserve a beatdown.   "I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."  "I may be drunk but at least I'm not insane."  "I don't have a drinking problem 'Cept when I can't get a drink."  "There ain't no devil, there's just god when he's drunk"  "Well, the first rule is not to try to drink with him. (When asked about what it was like to write with Keith Richards)."  "Pour me a cab, I just can't drink no more."  "The piano has been drinking, not me."  "Oh yeah, I remember my first beer." (to a waitress dropping a tray of drinks)  "the drinks are free and everything...but they hit you up at the door on the way out..."  "I thought I heard a saxophone, I'm drunk on the moon"  "I've got a bottle for a trumpet, a hatbox for a drum..."  "I sold a quart of blood and bought a half a pint of scotch"  "And I'm standing on the corner of Fifth and Vermouth...using parking meters as walking sticks."  -Tom Waits

      People who are blatant about bringing back a silk nightgown in a beaten up gift box.  With no receipt.   5 years later.  With a 3-inch tear in the seam where the security tag usually is.  And say that it was a gift and that she received with the rip.  Best of all is how she expects to be given $68 in cash after all that.  Nuh-uh.  Beatdown with a gift box.

If you can't find anyone, at least try to charm me... tell me a fucking dirty joke, good gossip... anything... just make the hour and a half I wasted on the phone with you worth while. MORON

      People who work in bagel places/delis and do not understand the meaning of "a little bit of cream cheese."

      1. Customers who ask you a question about what they want to buy and then answer their CELL PHONE in the middle of your answer.  2. Women who come into your store and say, "I'd like to try on everything you have in size 12. I'll meet you in the dressing room."  3. People who return clothing that they have clearly worn to an event. It smells like sweat, the tag is taped to the inside of the sleeve and they are soulless asshats.  4. People who don't understand that hitting on a person who has NO OTHER CHOICE than to be nice to you is abominable. Don't you get it? You can be a complete pig, but if I'm on commission I still have to kiss your ass. And even if I'm not, I still have to be polite or risk getting fired.  You all deserve a beatdown with overpriced leather luggage and power suits still on the hanger!!
