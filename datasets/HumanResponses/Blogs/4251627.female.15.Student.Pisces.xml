      Hope, dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye Roped me in so mesmorizing And so hypnotizing I am captivated I am...  Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong I am right, I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intention Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isolated So motivated, I am certain now That I am..  Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong I am right, I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  So turn up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defence is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in too deep down To ever swim against the current  So let me slip away, so let me slip away So let me slip away, so let me slip against the current So let me slip away, so let me slip away So let me slip away, so let me slip away  Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong I am right, I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  Like hope, dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption

      Lately I've been wandering Off the narrow path  You've given me so many things that I've never had   And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through  If you reach deep inside you'll see my heart is true   Cause I hate the way I feel tonight   And I know I need you in my life  Yes I hate the way I feel inside And I promise to make the sacrifice  The world I know is pulling me More and more each day I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray Spiteful eyes are watching me With everything I do  In the midst of darkness Lord   My spirit calls for you    Cause I hate the way I feel tonight   And I know I need you in my life  Yes I hate the way I feel inside And I promise to make the sacrifice  *You know sometimes deep inside I feel like this*
