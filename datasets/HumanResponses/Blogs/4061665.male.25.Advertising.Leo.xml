      I can't wish it was how it used to be. It's been this way for a while.

      When all the houses have fallen down, and there's no one else around. I will stand on my own two feet, and fight to stay incomplete.  Then I thought I heard a sound, water drops fell to the ground. I turned around to pick up pace, tears mixed with rain ran down my face.  I gathered what was left of my strength, and held it out at arms length. I set it down and ran away, I will come back to fight some other day.

      Why must I paste this look on my face and act in ways I don't feel.  When did the world decide it's better to hide so that no one will know what is real?  It's hard to see how it would all be if we took off our masks and began to heal.

      I try to relax and let it all go. I die for a while, it's the only thing I know. Sometimes I just stop, I can't take anymore. Human beings can be such a bore.

      Learning from the bravest souls to fall I’ve found in life, that time isn’t time at all So it goes, lying here in my nest for naught Ordered, assembled and paid for, without a thought  If the night will, Place it’s gentle arms around me, Wrap me up and keep me.  If the night will, Fight this sad war without me, And carry on despite me.  My comfort alone, the only comfort I seek Tellingly, outside of mind, it's the labels that speak Forced by choice with eroded conscience rare Much better, for tomorrow, with closed eyes would I fare  12:23am – 01/12/04  c
