       I recently saw the movie Super-Size Me and I must say that it sucked and you shouldn't see it. But if you really have to see it download it of Kazzza (copyright thing)or some other P2P program.  I'll review it later.  Till next time.....  Zero Percent aka Trent Smith

       This is my review of the Apple IPod  Intro: I recently found out that my dad had bought home a 20gig IPod, my first thoughts of the IPod was that is was a expensive (but stylish) paper weight, but I soon found out I was wrong.....  Outside It: This would have to be the most stylish MP3 player I have ever seen, it reminds me of the snow for some reason. It has no sharp corners or weird sticking out things, and is a smooth as a baby's bottom.  Inside It: Well I cant really tell you much about the inside coz' my dad wouldn't let me take it apart and it looks to hard to just simply "pull-off" the back.  Software: It comes with ITunes 4 and the software installed on the IPod, ITunes 4 is great but I still use Media Player for organizing music, the software on the IPod its-self is easy to use and simple. Also it looks like you can up-date the software on it as it has version info. One thing else is that you cant play WMA files on it, don't ask me why I don't know, must be something to do with evil company's competing or something.  Sound: The sound quality is very good on any thing from 128 to 320. It has some rather uncomfortable ear-pieces though. I personally prefer the sound of MD Players better.  Overall: the IPod is the best MP3 player on the market at the moment and will be were hard to bet, if your after the best get the IPod and you wont be disappointed.  4.5/5  Till next time.....

       My Thoughts: This is so cool I can say what ever I want and you cant do Jack Shit... (except maybe complain to Google)   First things First: My names Trent Smith and im a 14 year old Male, from Adelaide, Australia.   I decided to create a blog in the hope of getting a Gmail account before my friends, (In case you don't know what Gmail is, it's a email account with 1gig of space and a better interface than hotmail) but I haven't seem to have gotten one..... yet.....
