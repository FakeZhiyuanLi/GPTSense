      today went to have lunch with vincent and groups... shouldn't have been there or maybe i should... cause we saw ee kheng with her boyfriend, holding hands together... why i shouldn't have been there because i don't know what and how to react... why i should be there because i don't want vincent they all to keep things from me, i don't like the feelings when friends hide something from me...  i guess she didn't saw us... but i was very uneasy... maybe because of the way they tease me, but come to think of it again,&nbsp;maybe i really care about her... is it because the&nbsp;thingy is still going on so i have to&nbsp;be concern&nbsp;or because&nbsp;i really like her? i took some time to calm down... ponder over it... ya, i think i have a crush on her...   but wait... then i took time to think again...&nbsp;doubts was somehow cleared, i guess i just paid too much attention on her because of the thingy... i'm just over-reacting... false alarm... *phew*

      haha... today was really an enjoyable day... during cme... joyce was asking me about my ambitions and i told wei kheam to employ me in the future... haha... then we start a small discussion group (the 3 of us along with pei qin), fantasize about our dream houses...   we thought of building a condominium with 42 apartments... cause we have 42 students in our class... then each unit have its own lift... haha... then we continued with the facilities... having all the fast food restaurants around us... and recreational facilities like spa, swimming pool, basketball court, netball court, soccer field, etc... heehee, then we will all have a public address system install in our houses... the phone are inter-linked... then we have inter-families competitions every month (the winner get to live in the pent house for the month) haha... oh and a hall as well... (though i don't like what it is use for) next we have a common dining room with the long stretch of tables you saw in the harry potty movies... haha, crazy, isn't it? we went on to the many laboratories, chemistry lab, radioactive lab, and even a room use for torturing... haha, sadist... hey, we'll also have bungee jumping... haha...&nbsp;the subject&nbsp;continued on after school... haha, so entertaining...  well, that's our fantasies, haha, so lame yet interesting.... but the idea of the 42 of us living together is real cool, don't you think so? haha, i think the topic will go on for quite some time...

      whahahahaha... today was a tiring day... erm, no, everyday is a tiring day but today was exceptionally tiring... haha... cause we had a game of netball which lasted for a hour... with almost the entire class participating... haha, seldom we have&nbsp;such big group playing together, in fact this is the 1st time we are doing this... imagine 30 over people chasing after a ball, haha... it was chaotic... plus the jokers in our class, surely they had increased the amount of fun we had...   but it was&nbsp;real exhausting, and it sure was time consuming for the ball to get into the net... the 1st ball took about 10 minutes... of course, with the ball going around the court... haha... so glad to see many enjoyed the game... =D and you can see the whole crowd rushing to the water stall and then over to the chemistry laboratory later on... haha, seldom you get to see this scene...

      today participate in a chinese quiz... i think i'm over concern about winning... but anyway, 4e3 is real good because they have&nbsp;students excellent in chinese like an xin and wee ping... the quiz will continue next week, hope that i will not be too concern about the results of the competition, but use the chance to compete with other people who have more knowledge about the subject... i'm starting to worry, "what if i didn't get a A1 for MT?"  &nbsp;  i think that i a bit over doing something, making myself very zuo zuo... like i'm living in other's shadow rather than being me... haiz... and i seem to be sensitive to her name and pay more attentions to her nowadays... think that it's because of... i don't really know too, haha... nevermind =D

      the ee kheng thingy is getting a bit out of control, found that it's even harder to even interact with her, i guess the fault lies with me... sometimes, i really worry that i'll jia xi zhen zuo... but let's hope it is a false impression...  &nbsp;  life is getting tiresome... cause my granddaughter, laylay, had decided to forget about him (wonder if it's true this time round) so i can't say her anymore... boohoo~! haha, that's what she said...

      i wonder how people feel about my failure in getting into the top 10 for the annual road run... the ranking really matters to them a lot... i guess i had let some people down, especially mdm rao... i don't feel sad for the part that i had lost, in fact i am glad that i stopped during the race, it sort of reflected my life... to take a break or even let go of the things that i had been holding on to... i managed to put down my pride and stopped, i guess i'll never been able to do that in the past, i had changed, a lot...  &nbsp;  let people say all they want, i don't mind... =) i'm tired of having to keep remaining in the top 10... excuses... perhaps... ; )

      went to play pool the 1st time in my life yesterday... made a sum of mistakes at 1st but managed to get a hold of it later on... but it also seem to mark the end of the fun days... i had the feeling that we will seldom get to have this much fun like we did in the past, i certainly hope that i'm wrong... i wish to have a enjoyable time in this last year of secondary school life of mine... but time running short, we really need to prepare if we want to do well in the Os... i hope our relationship will last and i'll try to treasure every moment of it... = )  then i woke up early this morning and got to church much earlier than i usually to... to practice what i had learn from wee ping 2 days ago... i manage to get the hang of it after a long time of practice but still not very well done... hope that i will not be out of practice and get to finish learning the song at least...  i didn't went to youth today, i don't think there's such a need to, cause it will definitely be boring without friends there.... and i don't want to go for the sake of going... the activities there don't suit me and i seldom get into contact with the youth so i decided to go home earlier... and here i am now... slept a little and woke up to find myself having a spinning head, hope that i'll be well by tomorrow...

      whahahahahahaha.... attended pam's birthday party on friday... but that was after my oral... i did badly i think, didn't look forward to the party anymore... but alicia insisted that we should at least go and congratulate her and so we did... words about our oral exam were passed around quickly, before we even reach, it seem like most of them had know how we had done... i tried very hard to act like myself, but my actions didn't tally with my thoughts... i went to the kitchen to have a view of the "iron chef" competition 1st and was chased rudely out (hur~! how dare they do this to the judge...) then i just wanted to laze around and enjoy some peace but it invited even more attentions... it seem to be like i 'm gloomy because of the oral when i was only trying to find some peaceful moments... well, so i decided its better for me to do something, just then, i saw wee ping and so once again we talked about her piano career, she is very talented in music but a little not confident of herself... i asked her to teach me piano right there and right then and she gladly did... i hope i didn't annoyed her to death cause i'm a pretty slow learner... heehee... we spent most of the time in front of the piano and didn't have much appetite, so we ate very little... (i didn't even get to taste or even look at the so call iron chefs' dishes...)  well, i saw her being quite antisocial, it looked like she doesn't have much friends in this class, i actually intended to talk to her but jessie was always with her, even if i was to talk, i will have jessie's replies instead of hers... so in the end, i just went on with my piano learning session... (with laylay and her gang disturbing me...) pam was the birthday girl so went to have a ride with her in our bicycles.... many people attended the party, invited and unwelcomed, and they all drank a little, it was rather boring because there was nothing to do much but it still was fun in a way, a way that i can't describe... =D  wee ping was bothered by her friend's problem, about quitting poly and join the workforce, she was afraid to supported her friend of the wrong choice but her friend kept insisted that it will be better off for him to quit now and join the workforce, since he didn't enjoy what he was doing now, so wee ping could only hope that his choice was the right one and support him...

      today was the day of the release of MT O Level results... i was so excited when i was told by my friends that i got a A1, i just couldn't contain the excitement and ran all the way down to steal a peek at the results in the middle of the class... (anyway, it was MT, and as you know, i always heck care about my MT teacher) what shock me even more is i got a destinction for my oral... i thought i had screwed up my oral... of course, there were lots of friends that was not satisfied with their results... i hate the feeling when some are glad while some have to be disappointed... especially for those who had put in great effort but still they did not did well... i felt that i do not deserve the A1 sometimes because others had been so diligent but i can say to had done last minute studying and yet pass with flying colours... i hope that they will consider over about retaking at the end of the year and score... shaun they all are strong, i wonder what will i do if i did not got my A1...  k... forget about it, i got a A1 and it's over... fullstop... the feeling of success is always a split of second... now i have to forget about my result and study for my coming Os... by the way, i'm having EL O Level Oral tomorrow... i'll be meeting up with joyce and kellyn later to try to minimise the mistakes that i will make and to achieve the maximum marks that i could...  by doing well in each subject... i a bit closer to my goal... to my promise... whahahahahaha... tomorrow also pam's birthday... get to see her again... but wonder if i'll get to talk to her... we don't seem to have similar topic beside school work... haiz, so sad... "awwww", i can imagine lay lay saying this already... haha... tata~!!!

      life have been good for me lately... after the national celebration on friday, the group of us went for lunch, though there was some unpleasant incidents but it turn out to be alright, fun... =D we were making a scene wherever we go... we went to tampines but it was pack... so after a LONG discussion, we finally decided to head for the airport... i and alicia got separated from them... erm... or rather, we chat for a long time b4 we realised that we 2 were at kembangan... 2 stop away from where our actually destination (Tarah Merah) well... then we head for the airport by ourselves and meet them... after lunch, we went to swensen... and there, we too were making a scene, using the name of 'Bedok South Seconday'... haha... the fun only end when we bid each other farewell at the basketball court...  haha... then the following day... we went to sel's birthday party... she was there too... *Blush* haha... shaun was as usual, funny in his every action... cause sel made a plate of potato balls (is it what you call that?) erm, nvm jus balls made of potato... shaun was like aiming for so long at the plate... we all thought he was going to give face and try the potato balls... then suddenly, the fork went down and came up in a flash... haha... he pick up a lettuce... whahahahaha... i did gave face and tried ok... i ate it with lots of chilli... and it taste... erm... hot... heehee... then we talk about ee kheng's boyfriend... and about her practicals... (whahahaha... her practicals are pathetic, oops) then after that, me, shaun and shane send weeping to 85 to meet her friends... we had desserts there and talk for quite some while b4 we head our separate ways (erm, me and shaun same la...)  i got the chance to talk to some of them and understand them a little bit more... and i discover that most of them are not what they seem to be... all are weaker than they seem... anyway, i found out something from her... they had broken up... and from a friend that ken is not a good guy... and that he had even told some of his friend that ee kheng look ok only...

      i don't intend to go to JC actually... in fact the thought had never came across my mind until only when my brother say it will be necessary to get a degree sooner or later... only a matter of time... i prefer poly, because it allow more freedom, more space for personal growth and it's more relaxing... i always don't want to end my education life so early too... if you have notice, life really not easy in the workfore, my brother is a good example... i can hardly talk to him nowadays... or even met him... i want to enjoy life a little longer...  pam really having a hard time disciplining the class... especially when its our class, just her luck... cause we are the most active class among the graduating classes... can see that she's quite stressed by her post... because this is the 1st time she doing this kind of job... also we are giving her quite some problems... tried to help her if i could... at least for the sake that she is my 'dear' (forgotten why it happened...)  i felt sad for wilfred... surprising,right? that i will actually feel sorry for him... but the way we treat him seem to be a bit too harsh, way too harsh and overboard... but we initially didn't intend to do that, we will have welcome him if he wasn't have been trying to 'act' like one of us... we don't need another vincent or wei kheam... he could be one of us if only he be wilfred...  today is chicky birthday... and for once she is the princess... haha... but time runing out, when the clock strike 12 and she will turn back to the good old chicky... can see she enjoy her birthday today, the yaya also did a good job in preparing and celebrating her birthday... best wishes to sel...

      finally, we talked, from a long time since then... it seems like she is not particularly concern about the rumors so i won't have to do the avoiding all the time anymore, but its still better to keep a distance... i had found out many intend to go to TJC, but i'm sorry to say that... few will make it... it is one of the top JC in Singapore and it's not going to be that easy as we think... i chose TPJC because of 2 reasons and i discovered the third one today... heehee... 1st, it was my elder brother former school, 2nd, i know even if i make it into TJC, i won't be able to adapt to life there, it just a different world from us... thirdly, she going to TPJC too... *blush* haha, but i not even sure whether i can make it even into TPJC... but that's not what i want, i want to get into TPJC with the result of 10 points, to prove to my brother that i had not forget our promise, or rather a word that i had made... to get into TJC... but i guess life is not for me in there, but i have to show him that i had made it... i had failed once... not this time... actually, i'm not even sure of going into JC after the mini career talk yesterday, especially the lecture part, i'm not one that can focus on one thing for long... plus my english is not that good, it will sure to be a obstacle to my studies in future...

      haiz... nowadays so tired... especially trying to figure out who's friend or who's foe... everyone disguise themselves so well that i don't know who might stab me at the back the next minute, who might lend a helping hand when i most need them... but what's trouble me most is her... trying to avoid her and somehow i feel like she's doing the same thing... so for a few days we didn't get to talk to each other, not even close... its best to respect how she feels and reacts to the rumors, now that we learn that she got a boyfriend... it will not be a good thing for her boyfriend to know about this...  can't get down into the mood to study, either i can't get the chuck of infomations disgested into my brain or i simply fell asleep while studying... i know that the prelim are coming and i'm positive that i won't be able to finish my revisions, but i'll try my best to do what i can... the chances seem so slim but i still have got to give it a shot... i realised that i had given too lenient to myself... if you are good to yourself, life will be harsh to you... if you are harsh to yourself, life will be good to you... i can really see examples of this in my surrounding... my elder brother, whye hong, had been working very hard since he graduated, not saying he was easygoing on himself, in fact, he actually ask a lot from himself, he's the most diligent of us three... so, i'm always beneath him in whatever i do... people around me believe that i can do better in the common things but i couldn't get myself to work that hard...  i had always believed and always said that the three of us are brought up in different ways, different environments, differents methods... my elder brother being the 1st son had always work very hard for everything, perhaps because he's the most senior, he can depend on no one if he encounter problems, he can only rely on himself, he believes in that also, therefore he also expected the same thing from the 2 of us, my mom trust in him a lot and leave him on his own... my second brother pays little attention to his study and is rather impulsive, thus he made a lot of mistakes in life, and i can see that he has many regrets too... because of this, my mom care about his future a lot, he had also been very filial and organised, he manage to show leadership in some part of life and work things out... as for me, i'm brought up in a way of comparision, whater i do will do taken to compare with my brothers, i always said to be the most rebelious, you can said that of all the three of us, i am the worst... perhaps that's the truth, i rely on my brothers a lot, i turn to them whenever i had trouble... but in recent years, i learn to rely on myself, i learn to trust only myself, i learn to bear all kind of situations, circumstances... i want to be stronger, stronger than what i've been before, i want to stand firm, go on even where there is no one that i can cling on to... so i don't talk unnecessary, that might only reveal my weakness... i hate to be compare with them, i am me...  in school, i just look like a carefree guy who lame around, have fun together with my peers, but if you have notice, i never talk about myself a lot, or thing related to me personally, i don't want to let people know in depth about me... this only make me have more worries... though recently, i started to be soft on myself, i wonder is that good or bad... when i look at friends in the past, it seem like we have lesser or no topic to start on, it occur like as we grow up, we have more things to keep from one another, more things to remain as secrets...
