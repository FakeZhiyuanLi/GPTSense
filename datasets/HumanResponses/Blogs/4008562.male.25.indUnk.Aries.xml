       get to see 3 of my friends bands tonight. it is actually my first time to see them since i became friends with them. very excited. but on another subject. talked to a friend of mine today that i never really considered a friend. always made fun of him. turns out he has been right about stuff all along. he opened my eyes. i was just another one of him. no more special, not less special, the same. and all the advice he gave me i threw away when i shouldve listened. no he is married and i am jealous. i want to belong to someone. sick of the games. sick of the broken heart. so miss everything that i am looking for....Holler if ya here me!!! Hurry up and find me!!

       was easier than I thought. No studying problems. And got assigments in way ahead of schedule. Pat on the back. Felt good to relieve some stress by opening up on here. I deleted some stuff that I am not sure I should have done. Why bend over backwards? If you dont like what you see...see that little x at the top of the page? CLICK it. But I shouldnt have posted some things. Only cause it hurt someone that believe it or not I do care about. But for someone else to take offense ridiculous..but then I have to remind myself. This judgement is coming from people who held a grudge with my ex for things she did and forgave her like it never happened...all the while holding a grudge with someone that has been there for me for things he has done failing to realize the hypocrisy behind it..as well as if it weren't for him...half the friend sthey have wouldnt exist. Save the judging to God.  Cause none of you are close to being him!  Done. =)    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Quote of the week : "I am so sorry, never meant do do those things. I lost my head. You mean the world to me. Please open your heart. Let me in. Even only as a friend. But I am sorry. I am so fucking sorry! But I wont cry over anything"

       How hard is it to open your heart a little and let someone in? Someone you've known for awhile and has not been themselves as of late. Someone that has given you nothing short of their soul and heart. How hard is it to realize that we are not all built the same way? Some are weak some are strong..and some can give all of them to one person and get physically sick when it is taken away. How hard is it to realize a person is not what you think of them because of little things others do and say? A broken heart can do more harm than most people know to someone's head. I know from experience that it can make you do and say things you don't mean or say . I am sorry Sarah. Sorry for all the mean things and craziness. I couldnt help it. And to this day sometimes I STILL can't help it. I hate it to know that someone took my heart..and still has it. So this is just another bad day in the dumps. Won't post much.

       Yesterday I had a nice little post going on getting anything and everything off of my chest. Mostly had my take on greenfest and what it led up to. But I got a little carried away I think so I deleted it. Only thing I would like to say about that is I am still waiting on the person how made up the rumor that I hit Sarah to come forward. Some still think I did it and it's ridiculous. So mr. 3curl..just admit it..you are the only one that stupid, ignorant, and drama ridden to do something like that. And your silly little power walk to "fight me" is what really gave you away. You can think you were gonna do something to me all you wont. You and I know better since the last time at CopperTank when you had said you'd put me in the hospital next time you saw me but what did you do? NOTHING! Guess you gain a couple of feet when cops are behind you. What you dont understand is..youre a joke Brian. You bitch about women all over the message boards and then expect the ones that read it get with you? You need a new game bro. You are too old for the "sympathy" game. Only sympathy I know you get is..well none. Never heard a nice thing said about you. And you say I AM despised? please dude. You may think you'll get her. But you'll have to peel her off Django first.&nbsp; But that's how I got her plus&nbsp;off a&nbsp;19 year old kid so who knows. Might have a shot. &nbsp;    "You're...not so brave..when I'm the snake..and you're my prey..and let me tell you I'll eat all day"      &nbsp;  Anyways, our new puppy had to have emergency surgery yesterday. Apparantly the folks at the PAWS center don't know how to spay a dog and did it wrong. But she is ok now. I am really getting excited about this upcoming weekends Blue October show in College Station. Alot of people to meet this time with a sober head. Can't wait!!! Off to buy a new desk.

       I have been getting up around 5 am lately which is ok but I have been going to bed at 3am. So I stay up a couple of hours, get some reading done, then sleep til 2pm. Well I woke up today to dad being home and saying we are going to the animal shelter. If you don't know we lost our chocolate lab, Dixie, and our 21 year old cat, Susie, all in one week last month so it has been up to my crazy ass cat for entertainment. Well dad had a yellow lab picked out so we brought her mom. Sweetest dog in the world. I am very excited cause I get to sit at home with her all weekend since I have to house sit while parents are in Midland. Our neighbor down the street has some work for me to do that brings in $15 an hour and he has a friend that is wanting to talk to me about working for him. Things picking up a little bit. Still wish I could talk to Sarah. It's&nbsp; the weirdest thing in the world to not at least hear her voice every now and then. Guess I was fooled into thinking I was in a great relationship and loved each other when it was all just a game and a way for her to get over her divorce. I am very bitter about this situation. Can't let it go without closure. But that is one thing she is denying me. Thanks to her bitch fucking friends..they know who they are. Anyways, school is going good. These classes only take 5 weeks at a time so really no excuse to fall behind. Want to get a couple of A's to get my GPA then get in to Texas State. Even thought about dorming for a semester since I have never really had the true college experience. Good way to meet people too. Everyone around me, including those younger than me are graduating making me realize the mistakes I have made. Shouldve never left Corpus. Id be done with school by now. Would have eliminated a great deal of heart and headaches as well. Oh well...time to look ahead. "The accelerator is the one on the left...now step on it Gage. " -anonymous....;-) &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;    BLUE OCTOBER IN 7 DAYS!!!!!

       This is my third attempt at an online journal yet I made the others while drunk and forgot the passwords and usernames. Today school started. I am excited. Time to get the life on track. However I had a visit from the depression bug today and wanted to talk to her. I dont even know how to get ahold of her these days. I need closure. And after closure..I want my best friend back. If it weren't for the...and I want to puke when I say it..."cool kids" we would either be together or at least on speaking terms. That I know for a fact due to someone in the inner circle. Why talk shit about me? Do they not know that I invented the words revenge and retaliation? Do they think I will sit quiet forever? My silence should speak a hundred words. When I am silent..I am thinking and letting things build up inside of me like a time bomb. But I am keeping this one inside. I have the power to ruin some people but wont do it. They should appreciate that and do the same for me. Sarah...I miss you ..and all I want is to talk to you.     &nbsp;      8 MORE TIL BLUE OCTOBER WITH iSOLA IN COLLEGE STATION!!! WOO HOO !!!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Today really hurt me. People are making fun of me cause I am suicidal as well as thinking my intentions arent good. Something my dad has said about me recently is I have a good heart. I feel like I have the worst heart in the world with my lack of friends and lack of support. I sit in front of a comedy on tv laughing one second then crying the other. Then without thinking I call SArah and by the time I catch myself its too late. Guys sometimes I p ut up a good front, but I am forever in love with this girl. I am so sick of not being happy. I am probably the most unhappy guy alive. I cant and wont do it anymore. I have tried to reach out..and at sometimes have been very immature. but its over for me. I dont want this at all anymore. Sarah..cant say anything but I hope your family in Florida missed the hurricane and that I love and miss you. I hope none of you hold what I am gonna do personally. I did it to myself.

       This is exactly why I have become the way I am. So ready to just take my life with every situation no matter how big or small. This is my place to vent. MY place to get things straight in my head. Anyone with negative feedback can go to hell. It takes alot for me to hate...but thats all I feel now. The people that bash me now..are the ones that LOVED me when I was in the inner circle of the music biz i.e. pg. Now that I am not...seems they were never true friends at all. There is a common theme with this group..when you are down ..they kick you to make sure you stay down. Caused major problems with Sarah and I when we first started dating cause of the circumstances on how we met, I get suicidal and they spread untrue rumors..now they disown Hogleg for his actions..dude...just shut up already. People do what they do for reasons beyond what you know. Sarah did the same thing and she turned out alright dont you think. You guys think you are God and have the right to judge..I am able to laugh at your judgements cause I learned alot while dating Sarah. None of you have ANY room to talk to look down on anyone. Me perfect? Hell no. I am not innocent by a long shot. But my intentions with Sarah have ALWAYS been the best and she knows it. Whats funny to me is I know SArah knows the real me deep down ....and for someone that is so good at throwing away friendships and relationships she is able to override that with anger and being annoyed. But. I am ok knowing that she knows better. You choose to read this site..I can not stop you...but I would appreciate it for once...to shut the fuck up about me and leave me alone. You people act the way you do and then talk about God and religion when you are the biggest hypocrites to ever hold a Bible. Live your lives according to his plan...THEN...preach..but not before.

       I am on yet another failed attempt to medicate my self. I am gaining a shit load of weight. And am crying for no reason. When it affects everything around me, it's time to give up. But I wanted to let someone now just how much I think of them with a couple of things I wanted to say.       1. The grocery stores are now carrying Finding Nemo cereal. And I found Nemo band aids. Miss hula hooping in walmart.      2. Angry pasta. The angry comes from the sauce. Look for Arrabbiata when dining in Italian...thats the sauce.       3. I miss you      Don't break my heart again. We're one in the same. Baptised by tears. Washed in the blame. You can let your heart go. But I will hunt you down. Your love is all I want to win. Don't break my heart again.It's hard to find love.....It's hard to find love.....PG

        If my name is so easily beat on and included in so many rumor mills...why should I hold back the secrets I know? You would think some might think of that before starting shit. My turn.

       There I am walking into Gold's Gym at 5:30 this morning when I see a familiar face. Holy ballz it's Cathy McCrary. She is the girl I had to move away from my senior year in high school. I have kept in touch with her off and on and she's the closest person to knowing everything about me to Sarah. She asked how I was doing and immediatly could tell I was not good. The girl gave up her work out to come talk over breakfast with me. My parents nearly shit when she walked in. Now if you know this girl, giving up a work out is a big deal. She used to run at least 2 miles while I would still be on 1. Anyways, saw a ring on her finger but didn't ask. Couldn't tell if it was a diamond or just a fashion statement but didn't want to be  obvious. Very good morning!!!=)

       I have never thought more about doing something stupid than I have recently. How can so many people rather laugh and watch me suffer than just simply be a friend? It is beyond my thinking how people can be so cruel. Yeah I have done my share of fucking up, but I have ALWAYS taken responsibility and admit fault. I fucking hate life. I hate myself. I hate everything. And it kills me to know that there are those out there that will probably laugh at this post rather than give two shits. I used to turn to what used to be called a "Texas Music family" for all support. My friendships have all been fucked cause of one thing, me dating someone they didnt approve of. Well to those that didnt approve...I loved that girl more than anyone will ever love her and I still do. Did I act stupid during the break up..yes..but you try losing something so important to you and falling back on...NOTHING. If you think you wouldnt act the same...I call Bullshit!!!  I have thought about stupid things to the point that people say put up or shut up. All I want is my best friend back. I havent had a friend like Sarah since high school. If Renea and I can put grudges behind..I know I can with Sarah. I am sick of crying all the time. Am sick of not being able to sleep. Sick of bawling at tv shows for no fucking reason. I dont know what to do. I have lost anything and everything. Some say I just want attention..that is not true at all. There is one person I want attention from. And that person wont even have the decency to pray for me. I fucking hate this. I have to get out of town.

       I have ever seen is my new 5 month lab being harassed by my cat to the point she just walks around with my cat attached to her back trying to pick a fight. Could make some kinda of Americas Funniest Pet shows.    It is 3:15 am and I still can't sleep. Cant remember the last time I slept straight through the night and not waking up. Wait..yes I do..when someone had their head on my shoulder. Why does my happiness and health rely so much on burying the hatchet with someone I care for so much. And why is it the one thing that I can't get? Does she want me t his way? Is it humerous to know that every where I go people think I am on drugs due to the circle around my eyes. it sucks. It's like I am a terrorist and am being tortured. K..maybe thats a little extreme. =) Still..I want my life back. I only want to be happy again.

        I try so hard to mend nearly lost relationships only to run into brick walls. Why are there people out there that conform their perspectives just to go along with their friends? When you are with me....you hate this person....when you are with that person..you hate me. Cause its the cool thing to do? I have convinced myself that I am a good person. Anyone that feels differently are just the ones that don't know me and only see the broken hearted upset me. Cause believe it or not, it CAN make you do silly things and act kinda weird. So...fuck the judgement.        Anyways, school is so boring. I have to take this damn orientation course to get used to the online interface but really..youd have to be an idiot to not figure this out.        Lacy, hope you are feeling better. I feel like a ticking time bomb again. Too many buttons being pushed for any med to work. Hope to see you at a Blue October show sometime soon. I am going on a run the next couple of months. Anyways. Adios
