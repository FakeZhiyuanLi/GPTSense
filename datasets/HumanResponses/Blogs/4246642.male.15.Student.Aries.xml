      Hi guys,  Today was Exoday, and I have to say it was pretty awesome... we had two bands play... Rocketdogsuckdotcom and the band that features our friends: "The Poo" aka. Ratpoo, aka. Matt Jones and Brad Smith... their band, For What It's Worth.  Lots of fun, can't explain with words. So here's a photo of mine and Joanne's feet.       We had dual-iPods at one time, and yeah, it was great. I took around 300 photos and some movies. I uploaded most of the photos here:     urlLink  Check out the photos!      Sorry about the dodgyness of the gallery, it was the best I could do for now. Um, the movies will probably join the pictures soon, however not yet. I have a really funny video of Sian eating a sausage sizzle thing, and then I tell her I'm recording it, and her facial expression just changes from normal to  completely shocked  -- it's sooo funny.

      I have my Science board at home, gosh it's fawking huge.  I am so spray-painting it red. Oh and, I punched Mark in the arm today, and cut my hand in the process. Dang! :P  Ware wanted us (Simon, Nick, Geoff and I) to be "buddies" with the Japanese students at school, he said we had no choice... I didn't want to, so I just walked out during the little assembly. Phew.   Nick0@The Crossroads says: awww, what's wrong with Trent? When life is gettin' you lonely, you can always go... Ach! Doon-toon says: he's a peacock   That just happened, so I had to include it.  Ummmmm... today our maths teacher didn't show up, so that was totally cool. Except I didn't get to annoy Sian! :  Oh wells, in Science we made like 50 "Teresa-is-short" jokes, so that was good enough for me :P  Okay, anyway, I'm going to go do something else, so ner.  Also, thanks to Jack today for giving me a lift home :D (So I could take my board home too!)  :D :D :D :D

      Real Player have announced 49c songs, "half the price of Apple" - a few weeks back they cracked the iPod compatability, Apple were pretty annoyed with this.  urlLink RealPlayer with Harmony Technology - Real.com  Anyway, you may ask, "Why the hell do we care?"... well, checkout the little copyright notice:  The use here by RealNetworksÂ® is for identification purposes only.

Wow, sorry.  ps. I finished my Science Assignment!

           Ahahaha, this is a spin-off of the HSIE joke today, "two wongs, don't make a white."  This is actually a t-shirt promoting a laundry service. Pretty classy, I'd wear one.  Speaking of cool shirts, I have to post this really cool (geeky) unix shirt I found. Nick thought it was funny... you should too!

         So, google seems to have "shifted", their previous image (as seen below) was a little too exciting for our younger viewers.  Interesting.

      Ocean was looking at Paris Hilton "images" in the library. And, um, "talking" to the screen.  AND BRANDON, CTRLALTDEL CROSSED THE LINE MAN.  Nick0 - !~ ThINk ~! says: then we got onto how Daniel said that a Sian & Trav relationship would only be illegal if it were sexual  Hmmm...... okay.... I hope he doesn't read this but, does anyone else think Daniel is really freaky? And WTF does he start to yell when he reads infront of the class?  "um, okay, i'll read: AND SO THE COWS ABDUCTED THE SMALL MINDED BOY AND" it's soo annoying.  Oh and in English today, HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEC - wow, I complain a lot huh. Well, tough. I better do my science assignment... meh... um.  Yeah, in Maths, I was stereo-hit, I told Tash I'd get her a GI-Joe for her birthday, with the underwater suit thing so she could play with him in the bath, and we (sian, me, tash) started laughing, and they hit me at the same time... ouch.  Okay, okay, rambling, so what! Um, until next time (which, is, very, soon)  Goodbye!

       UPDATE:  Geoff is stupid, apparantly the Excel formulas he was using were wrong. So he doesn't actually have $15,000. He's probably got more like a dollar, not enough to ride the bus home. Oh he just said, it's $9862, okay, so we've LOST money  (-$137, which is a fair bit different to gaining some $5000 in a day) . Well done Geoff.  ________________________________  We're in the library right now, yes, so, um, yes.  Apparantly, two wongs don't make a white. Nick wanted everyone to know that. Geoff is going on about some portfolio, apparantly it started at $10,000 - now we're at $15,130.30c in ONE DAY! That's pretty cool. Oh, apparantly they are "his" shares. But, bleh. :P  If Geoff can figure out how, i'll put a photo of the graph up.    urlLink     Okay, there we go...  Wow, I have to do my Science assignment when I get home... we have so much to do, but then we get our Ski trip, so it's okay.  Apparantly the coke costs $2.50 a can. So, yeah, start saving. Also, it's 7 months and 4 days till my Birthday. (It's so closer than your crappy 1 month Sian!)      This gal, is apparantly (well, firstly, female) and secondly, named "Courtney McCool". I found this on Yahoo. So, here's a plug for Yahoo. McCool.       urlLink     Bla, bla, bla, someone just called me a Fruitcake. :(

       Australia: the dopey country ( urlLink dopey state )  Hey, according to  urlLink this article , "  One in five young adults uses cannabis weekly and one in 10 users becomes dependent on the drug, Australia's top drug researchers found."  Top drug researchers huh? It's always drug "researchers"...     PEOPLE concerned about drug-induced psychosis can call the SANE Australia help line on 1800 688 382.    				  Make sure you check your parents! According to statistics, one in 10 of the original one in 5 are dependant,  so, if there are 4,000,000 adults in Australia, 80,000 use it weekly, and of that 80,000, 8,000 become dependant.  I blame Queensland, they call themselves the smart state. Nobody there is smart, it's just a big marketing con! Viva la Victoria.  Okay, okay, i'll go do my stupid English thing now.

           I'll start this morning's post off with a big, what-the-hell? Is it just me, or are the Greek a little too excited? Take a look at this prime example that Google is using... tsk, tsk...  Hmm... I have some homework to do before classes today, lets see, mathsmate (easy), english (peh) and um, that's it. Well, that's not too bad actually...  Oh and today we have Commerce, except Oeltjen isn't going to be there, so we get to bludge in the Library, that's pretty tops. So, how is everyone going with assignments? I've got a few left... Science is nearly done, English - I've got my ads, Commerce - Starting today, History - Haven't started... also for some reason, we have a  Tech Drawing  assignment.  What a rort.
