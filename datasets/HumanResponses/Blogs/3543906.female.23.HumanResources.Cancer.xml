      I came into work with puffy eyes today - luckily Sandy was the only one who noticed - and she dismissed it as "late night partying" eyes.  I did have a late night, but it was anything but fun.  I spent my night on the phone with Mike, trying to figure out my college situation.  Invoked my an argument with my mother (which lead to crying, hence the puffy eyes this morning), we discussed all the options, and I think I'm going to apply for Financial Aid.  If that doesn't take, I'm going to put off starting on my degree until the winter session and save up money.  I just *have* to be committed.  It's such a catch though.  I don't want to sacrifice my current career by quitting and going back to school full time, but my career can't/won't go anywhere near where I want it to w/o a degree.  Sandy gave me a nice compliment yesterday...  we were coming out of a Government Contractors Special Interest Group Meeting (they're a sub-group of my NOVA Society for HR Management affiliation) at Patton Boggs and we were discussing the difficulties of complying with the numerous regulations the government gives to Federal Gov't Contractors (like us) and out of the blue she just started telling me how in mentoring me, she realizes how much she regrets not getting into HR at a younger age..... that she sees immeasurable potential in me and is sure I'll be making six figures in no time...  would be nice...  Maybe then I could afford to buy Mike and I the Local 16 restaurant and turn it into our fabulous house with a bar (and cabana boy for Jen) in every room.    All kidding aside, this place is gorgeous, and I'm 100% serious about buying it if I ever have the loot to do so.  *goes and buys a lottery ticket*  Maybe I can talk a certain wealthy gay man I know into buying it for me. ;-)  Chances are low though - I heard Neil is refusing to buy Richard a plane ticket to Paris - and Richard gives him sex - I give him only kisses :-)  In other news, Mike and I are doing fabulous.  We were on the phone today and both admitted that although it was late in the day, neither of us grabbed something to eat for lunch.  His building in Rosslyn is only about 20 minutes away, so we decided to meet for lunch :-)  I love unexpected visits like that.  And, even better was that we went to Teresa's restaurant, so I got to see my favorite roommate as well :-)  This weekend will be incredibly fun...  Tomorrow night I'm going to Cubik @ Nation for Richie Hawtin!  Yay!  Afterwards Teresa and I are driving out to Centreville to stay at Jill's for the night so we can wake up early enough on Saturday for the Annual Potomac River Poker run...  like I said in my other journal, this is such a fun tradition. I believe this is the 3rd Annual Poker Run that our All Girls Boat (tm) has participated in..... Lots of sun, lots of alcohol, lots of seafood and junk food and my favorite girlies right beside me to hold my hair back when I vomit into the Potomac. Best way ever to spend the summer.  After the poker run I fully intend on making it to Mike's house sometime - even if that mean's him driving all the way out to Centreville to pick my drunk ass up.  We'll spend the night in, and Sunday afternoon Neil is having his annual Pride Brunch at his place before the Gay Pride Parade in the city....  this should be fabulous also (the brunch - don't know if I'm going to the parade)... we'll be eating fabulous breakfast foods and getting trashed on Bloody Mary's, Baileys/Coffee, and of course, Mamosa's.  :-)  I heart drunk weekends :-)  I plan on spending the rest of the day on Sunday ravaging my hot boyfriend in between packing his stuff up for his move next weekend.

      So this is actually my second blog...  who has time for two blogs?  I usually don't, but it's friday, and I'm in quite the slacking mood...  I haven't done a lick of work yet, and don't intend to until well after lunch time.  I love days when your boss is out of the office.
