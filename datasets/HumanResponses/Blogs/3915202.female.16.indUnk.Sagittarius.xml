      u know this whole deal with him is driving me crazy...ever since i have started talking to him i can't get my mind to do nething but think of him.....damn my mind....i gave him a wall paper yesterday n he asked if i were mad?...am i? may be yeah...but he didn't have to say it.....cuz it hurt ahell lot.....for the first time in my life some guy has the power to make me cry......i have never cried for anyone....will he ever know how much i like him?....will he ever know that i pray for him in every namaz and he is the reason i have started offering five times prayers? he runs after her....n i run after him....that may be sumday he'll get tired and stop and look beside him n see me.....sumday may be.....but what if he doesnt stop? what if he catches her?....will he ever notice that i was running beside him to care for him n give him support all along?....will he ever know that i have loved him and only him for the past 9 months......will heever know who i really am???? i hope he stays happy wherever he stays...whoever he stays with...me , her, anyone....as long as he is happy.....
