      Yes, you've read right, I ALMOST forgot to post today, but read again now, I said ALMOST, that means I am going to post, so I didn't completely forget. So heres my day.  First period we had a speaker at the career center, but I can't remember her first name. I think it was a 'W' something, but I'm not sure. I know her last name is Spini. Damn, I have it written down somewhere. Well, anyways, she was here to talk to us about a medical school kinda thing or something. I realy need to excersize my memory. I remember her talking about cadavers, and fermaldihide(SP?) I remember when she was talking about bipoler, she said something like "You may just be sitting next to somebody with bipoler right now and never even know it." and as soon as she said that I poked the guy next to me and said "Hey, now ya know," the kid just looked at me funny, I don't think he understood.  I read my book second period again, all period long, ended on the last page with just one more paragraph, but I finaly finished it off in third period. I realy hate finishing a book, it always means that the only time I can ever pick it up again is when I want to kill time or something, the story is lost to me because I had already read the ending once before. It was a very suprising ending though, I would recomend it to anyone. "The Messanger" combines the story from "The Giver" and "Gathering Blue" See the descriptions at the bottom of this post.  Third period we had a sub, and a test. I pretty much ace'd the test, and showed the sub how to do number two from the test. (lol) After I finished the test, I went right back to the amazingly surprising ending to "The Messanger" After I finished my book, the sub and murphinit were chating about school stuff, like how murph was going to skip geomatry and go strait to Algebra 1B, and how he decided to go to ASU when he got out of highschool. As soon as he said "ASU" I told him that I had a copy of Microsoft Office pre-registered to ASU. He asked me where the hell I got it, and I told him to google the word "Warez" Then I got to talking about my blog, and my advertisement workarounds, and my 1337 html/css/javascript active desktop, then saying how I wished they would allow freshmen to take advanced classes such as C++, java scripting, etc, but only if they had parent permision and had passed some sort of test or something. He agreed, and called me a geek. I told him I was born a geek, when the doctor held me up when I was born, he said to my momma "This boy's gonna be a true geek."  Fourth period I kinda remembered the third stanza, but I couldn't remember how the last two lines ended, and needed alittle bit of help with it. I told the kid who sits behind me (one of the very few who had not been forcibly moved to the front) about how I saw him in his old beatle yesterday, told him that it made my year seeing somebody I knew in a beatle as old as that.  Fifth period I was able to run the track even faster and better that usual again, I was able to run the whole thing with out stoping till the very end. I think I am starting to get back into shape. After the track we went into the gym again to play some BBall. I just stood there waving my hands like an idiot to make myself look like I was actualy participating. It worked, but I don't think I could do that all year round.  I had yet another salad for lunch today. I got the last of the weird green things in the fourth thing. I tryed to grab 2 milks today, but the bald guy was standing there this time, I grabed 2 and he just stared at me and smiled. It scared the shit out of me, so I tossed the second back as if it was by accident when I had grabed it. I realy wish they would double the size of those tiny cartons, I have to burp just to tast the damn thing.  Sixth period I had the test, it was realy easy, number 20 asked what my favorite teacher was, so not wanting to lose points or anything, I wrote down "Herr Williams" because I knew he would be grading it himself. I cheated for the german teacher one, (#4) I had writen it on my desk in blue pen so I could spell it right, and when I was done with it I could just rub it off and nobody would suspect anything. The rest of the test was easy.  The tire was flat again, so I went up to the 7/11 with my friend Raul to pump it up, then headed home. Raul came over to visit earlyer, we had took turnes drag racing on NFS:U, I have it for PC because I don't like console games, so there was no 2 player to it unless you had a second computer right next to you and played over the net with others or something. I had already had everything unlocked, and had some custom vinyls, I may post a screeny of it one of these days.  Thats all for now, so here is the descriptions I promised.      The Giver  In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy.   Gathering Blue  Kira, newly orphaned and lame from birth, is taken from the turmoil of the village to live in the grand Council Edifice because of her skill at embroidery. There she is given the task of restoring the historical pictures sewn on the robe worn at the annual Ruin Song Gathering, a solemn day-long performance of the story of their world's past. Down the hall lives Thomas the Carver, a young boy who works on the intricate symbols carved on the Singer's staff, and a tiny girl who is being trained as the next Singer. Over the three artists hovers the menace of authority, seemingly kind but suffocating to their creativity, and the dark secret at the heart of the Ruin Song. With the help of a cheerful waif called Matt and his little dog, Kira at last finds the way to the plant that will allow her to create the missing color--blue--and, symbolically, to find the courage to shape the future by following her art wherever it may lead.   The Messanger  Strange changes are taking place in Village. Once a utopian community that prided itself on its welcome to new strangers, Village will soon be closed to all outsiders. As one of the few people able to travel through the dangerous Forest, Matty must deliver the message of Village's closing and try to convince Seer's daughter to return with him before it's too late. But Forest has become hostile to Matty as well, and he must risk everything to fight his way through it, armed only with an emerging power he cannot yet explain or understand.

      It's today again, and maybe you may or may not have noticed, but right about now I usualy post what my day was like. So here we go.  First period was realy dumb, nothing much hapened. One of the juniors was doing chinups from the portable's ceiling, the teacher didn't realy care much though, she was counting how many he could do. He stoped at 46.  As you probably guessed, I read my book all through second period. I'm gonna have to do a book report on 2 books in a few days. I hope I can find something on the internet or something, book reports completely ruin books.  Third period was math as usual, but this time he had us copy down 20 problems off the board, and work them out for homework.  Fourth period I have to memorize the third stanza of the poem I posted earlyer.   And both that morning equaly lay In leaves no step has trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.   Fifth period we had to run the perimiter of the first fence. I was able to do that without stoping to catch my breath this time for some odd reason, I guess I am getting better or something. After that we went into the gym to play BBall and stuff, I just stood in some places trying to make it look like I was participating. I REALY don't like sports.  I had another salad at lunch today, very delicious. They had the actual dinner rolls again, not the corn bread stuff in platic shaped like a roll. I was able to sneak away with 2 milks this time, I'm glad too, just one of those things is just never enough  Sixth period I have a test tomorow, I'm not gonna study, as long as I can spell deutschlehrer(in), then I'm good.  Yet again my front tire was flat coming home, again with the 7/11. My friend didn't come over today, he'll probably make it tomorrow or something.  I still have no ad's at the top today, so that's a good thing. I realy didn't want to spend 10 minuts to clean up the mess.

      Well, it's gone again, but only in firefox ATM. There's no telling when it'll be back. All I did was use the display:none; in the CSS thing for the 3 div's created for the NavBar. I hope it stays gone to.  EDIT: Well, I think I fixed it completely again, but IE still has a --> at the very top, but what kind of MSMoronâ„¢ could you be to use IE anyway? Just check out the source code if you wan't to remove it too. If you find any better way please tell me.

      Well, it would seem that the bloger people found away around my little NavBar remover thing. I hate that POS, it doesn't fit my style at all, and I realy HATE advertisements. I wish they would stop adding unneeded "features" because it is realy getting annoying to find a new work around each day. Well, I'm off to try to remove it again.

      Well, if you ever read my blog, then you know what I am about to post. So lets get on with it shall we.  First period we had a notebook check, but not all my notes were checked and I got 100 anyway. If I realy have that many notes, then I guess freshman year is gonna go bye quick seeing as I take so much notes I can pass anything I want.  As usual, I read all through second period, took awhile to snap back to reality when the buzzer rang to pass to next period.  Third period a friend of mine was arguing with the teacher about how to show his work. He's lucky he didn't get kicked out. He wasn't showing his work on his homework, claiming he can do the whole thing in his head, it may be true about the head thing but it is required to show all work on each problem in that class. Otherwise he would be accused of cheating. I did the same thing when I took 1A the second time, but then I just stoped doing homework all together, and at the end of the year I had to make up everything, with no extra credit.  Fourth period EVEN MORE students were put on seat restriction for having an F in either accademic or citizenship grades. At this rate I will be the only person in the back of the room by next friday. The seat restriction isn't doing much to help either, almost everybody in the class knows each other already, and are willing to talk to anyone. Cheating alone will take 50 out of 100 citizenship points, gum is 20, talking out of turn is 10, cursing is 20. They all know this, and still they continue to chew gum, speak out of turn, curse, and cheat. Hopefuly she will realize that this system isn't gonna get her anywhere and just send those fucktards to detention or something.  Fifth period we played hocky. (with an actual puck this time) Some asshat decided the team would benifit from me being goaly. Everybody knows by now that I can not hit, throw, run, jump, or block for shit. It ended up as a tie game, but I knew we could have won if somebody else was goaly. At the end of the period the idiot coach wouldn't unlock the doors and let us in to get dressed. I was 10 minuts late for lunch, and had to get to the back of the long line.  Lunch I again had a salad, with everything, turkey, a role, and ranch dressing. I don't know what it is, but I just can't stop coming back for more each day. I was caught trying to get 2 milks again, but this time I tryed to grab a chocolate and a white thinking it would be ok. It wasn't. They realy don't want me to quench my thirst do they? My friend came to the conclusion that my other friend's head looks like a dick head, because he shaved his head bald for ROTC. I started bustin up laughin right there on the spot. People thought we were crazy lol.  Sixth period we learned some new stuff. Reviewed some old stuff. We already knew that fahren means to ride, but with that conjugation thing it comes out as fahrt when coupled with a Ihr. Everybody busted up laughin when he said "Ihr fahrt ein fahrrad."  My front tire was flat again on the way home. I went to 7/11 to pump it up and met up with my friend Raul. He said he'd come over to my place tommorow on his bike. I told him to bring lots of water lol. I was going to burn him a copy of Halo, because some ass hole broke the other copy I made. It's only gonna cost 75 cents this time. I got home to find the shiter was cloged, my little bro playin NFS:U and my littler bro watching cartoons with his pants unziped and without a shirt. I flicked his ear to get his attention and told him "Zip up your pants and get a shirt on, your not a male striper." He's always trying to pull this shit, he's realy bulgy in the stomache area so his gut hangs over his belt. I realy hate it when he tryes to pull this shit, he looks like a fucking striping trucker who has just been forced to bathe.

      I made a few more changes to the template, put back the original commenting system, but left the trackback for some odd reason. Added a google search thing, but I cant figure out why it don't work, but I think that indexing thing isn't instant. If/When I do get it to work, all you have to do is hit enter when your done typing. All I did was hid the submit button with a style="display:none;" if you want my code just view the source code:  urlLink Firefox  users click  urlLink here   I also added this realy cool expandy/contracty script to the comments (like on my 1337 desktop:) ) Thats also viewable in the source.  I removed the stupid navbar at the top by commenting out the original closing head tag and opening body tag and adding a new one right after the comments, but in IE (use firefox ;) ) it has a --> at the very top

      Well, it's today again, I hoped it hadden't come, but it always does. As always I'm here to post my end of shool recap. I'm not the best writer in the world, but as I get better, and older, I will make this alot more interesting to read. Also if you can send me some money I can keep yall updated while I'm at school on my new notebook computer that I used with your money (please contact me if your interested in sending me money ;) )  As usual, I read all through second period, but since I finished my other book (Gathering Blue,) I am now reading the next one. (The Messanger) This one combines the story from The Giver, and Gathering Blue, it has pretty much all the same characters (Jonus, Gabe, Mat, (now Matty) Kira, Seer, (Kira's blind father)) and a whole batch of new one's, so I'm realy getting into this one. I am glad second period is an extra period for me, because with how my day's are, I hardly get to read at all anymore.  Third period was boring as always. A kid I know last year tranfered into my math class, the same idiot that was boo'ed off stage during that freshmen assembly deal when he decided to run for ASB. This kid's not only completely unpopular, he is also EXTREMELY annoying.  Fourth period even more students were moved to the front of the class for failing grades. Pretty soon I'm gonna be the only one in the back of the class trying to keep myself from going insane because of all the noise coming from the front. This is rediculous, these kids only come to school to talk to their buddies, they don't even care about getting good grades, or even passing the 9th grade at all. Hopefuly something will come along one of these days that will make them shut the fuck up.  Fifth period we had to run the football stadium for our first time. We had to run up the stairs, across the top, down the last set of stairs, across the field to the other side, up the stairs, across the top, back down the last set of stairs, check in with the coach, and do it all over again a second time. I made it in 16 minuts or so, but I was supposed to shoot for 12. I'm glad she didn't record the times. After all that was over with, we all went into the gym to cool off.  I had another delicious salad for lunch today, I tryed to grab two chocolate milks this time, because I was realy thirsty and those things are to small. The woman at the cash register must have noticed me try to take the second one and yelled to me "ONE!" It realy suck's that they would give us such a tiny ass carton of milk that would probably be enough for a first grader, and expect us to take only one. Somebody has got to fix these people so that they THINK.  Sixth period wasn't much to talk about, just learning some new words, and reviewing the stuff we already know. Also did some grammer stuff and some basic verb conjugation.  My bike tire was flat again. Had to take it to 7/11 again. Pump it up AGAIN. I swear, these desert thorns are a pain in my ass. I realy need to buy myself some of those unpunctureable solid rubber tubes.

      But who doesn't realy? I just finished all my homework for today, and its realy boring, and gets repetitive fast. I wish they can make homework into a FPS game sometime. That would be a sight to see. As usual, I'm gonna post a recap of today. So here goes.  First period was realy wet from saturdays rain, everything on the walls were destroyed when we came back from the weekend. It's a realy old portable, so it's to be expected. It's just a shame the girl to my right wasn't the one who was wet ;)  Second period I read and finished my book. (Gathering Blue) I almost wanted to yell out "HOLY SHIT" when I read that Kira's father was still alive, and had found his way back to Kira through Mat. Very great book, it's a shame though that it was only a couple hundred pages long. I started to read the next book I have (The Messanger) but after a page or two, the bell rang (or should I say "Buzzer sounded" lol). Both books are a continuation of another book that I liked alot called "The Giver," or so I heard.  Third period was the usual math, corecting the test from friday, and begining on our homework.  Fourth period I was forced to move to the back of the room because like 80% of the class had an F in either academic, citizenship, or both. I was one of the very few who had an A, so I can sit anywhere I want, as long as it isn't in the front where the trouble studen'ts are assined. So I have a choice of 10 seats, but only if I get there before everyone else. I don't know why these idiots even come to school if they aren't going to do anything and earn a grade.  Fifth period somebody stole a ball that we were gonna use as a puck for a game of court hockey. I can't belive someone would steal a BALL! I MEAN ITS A FUCKING BALL!!! WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU STEAL A BALL? I mean seriously, if I wanted a ball, I would go out and buy a new and better one for probably $1.50 at the most. Again, I say, why do these idiots even come to school? It was hot and the coach made us walk the track untill either the bell rang, or someone had found/returned the ball. This is rediculous.  At lunch today the salad lady already had my salad ready for me lol. She knows exactly what I want each day. 1 salad with everything on it, turkey, roll, and ranch. I don't know what it is about them salad's, I just like them so much. I needed a reason to eat more greens anyway ;)  Sixth period the teacher's son came into the class and Mr. W had him stand up at the front of the class so we can all ask him the new german questions we just learned, and his son would answer in german. I didn't make the connection between Mr. W and his son for like 10 minuts, and then I realized "Hay, doesn't Mr. W have a kid with the name Colin?" Talk about your major blonde moment lol.  My front tire was flat yet again, so I had to walk all the way to 7/11, then go in and hope my bike wasn't stolen while I ask to have the tire pump activated, then I had to walk back to my bike, push the button to turn it on, put the tube back into the tire, then put the tire back onto the rim, pump it up, and hope that it doesn't explode or stay flat. Then I have to ride home realy fast so that the tire doesn't deflate while I am riding. I realy want some of those solid ruber, indestructable kind of tires. Them desert thornes realy get me too. The desert is realy not the best place to ride a bike.

      Well, its time for the end of the day recap.  I woke up.             I posted this. Well, that has been the end of the day recap.  Thats basicly how boring it was today, nothing realy happend at all today. All I did was watch Spiders and Spiders 2 on the Scifi chanel. I did work on my desktop a few hours, so now when I press the ~ key it shows up, and is defaulted to hidden. I am still working on a way to change it to hide/show based on how it was last time I hid/shown it. I'm guessing its an advanced CSS thing with javascripts or something. I still want to figure out a way to delete the Desktop.htt file and refresh the desktop through javascripts. I want to be able to change the html file and see what was changed when I refresh instead of having to goto the display property's and reaplying the html as my wallpaper. I still need to come up with a readme file and upload it to somewhere.

      As a few of you might have noticed, a day or 2 ago I said I wished it rained here more often. It rained, it poared, and I couldn't plug in my computer for fear of lightning, when the rain finaly subsided, I couldn't connect to the net. So I waited. And waited. And waited. So finaly I said to no one in particular "Damn, I wish the net would work," and then my little bro came screamin into my room and yellin "It's back on, it's back on," apperently he had been sitting trying to get to google the whole time.  I have come to the conclusion that I have psychic powers or something. Today has been the freakyest day EVER. I wonder if anything will ever happen like this ever again. I did get alot of reading time in though.  An hour ago I made some progress on my desktop, now when ever I double click somewhere on it, it will hide EVERYTHING. If I can find some good webspace I'll upload it for you. (gonna have to come up with some version numbers, I'v been working on this for a while)

      Well, I had a thought a few minuts ago, I have this quotes thing on my desktop so that it will display a new quote for each day. And the coolest thing is, is that all the quotes are from Einstine himself. (xept for 1 or 2 wich I thought were just to hilarious lol) So I was thinking, It would be cool to do something like that for my blog. And then I realized, all it was was a few stratigicly placed java scripts. I'm gonna try it later and see how it playes out, if it gives any messages when loaded or anything, I will have to remove it.

      Well, It's friday again, and I got a new commenting system set up (all thanks to  Ali Mahdavi, and the HaloScan guys) I might change it again if I ever find something free, ad-less, and better.  Well, heres how my day went. First period wasn't much interesting, nothin realy happened. It's one of my most boring classes.  I read my book (  Gathering Blue)   althrough second period again. I love reading, I just don't have time to read all day. Oh, how I wish the earth can rotate just slightly slower so that the day is longer, and I can have a few extra hours to read every day.  Third period we had a sub, and a test, I'm sure I aced it. It was only review stuff I did once already before It's a real shame they screwed up so badly when I was a seventh grader, I could have been in Algebra 2 by now. It's a long story, basicly I was so smart in my 6th grade math class, the teacher decided to recomend I go strait into Algebra 1A, so I got into 7th grade, and was put into Algebra 1A. I was doing pretty good, and then I had to move down to Apple Valley. I got into a new school, and was put into PRE ALGEBRA, because thats what they assumed tipical 7th graders needed. So I complained about it, and they wouldn't let me into Algebra 1A. So 8th grade came, I had to do 1A again. I complained some more, and since I wasn't bumped up last year, they made me do it all over again. So now I'm in highschool, and I finaly got into 1B, and everything's a review, AND I could be in Algebra 2 by now.  Fourth period I had to recite the second stanza of that poem, and since I had a test in 3rd period, I accidently forgot to repeat it all day. I got half way through and screwed up badly. She also had us move around and while she was outside waiting, just so she could list our names in order of where we were sitting. She missed one of them, but she got the rest right. I could have realy used that 15 extra credit points for later on. One student tryed to cheat and say she got his name wrong. He lost 50 out of the 78 points he had left.  Fifth period was alot cooler than the rest of the weak, but we still went into the gym to play BBall. We had to run 2 laps before we did that though. I realy should have done PE last summer.  Sixth period I had a german test. Got an A-. It would be better, but I mixed up the question words (who what where when why (wer was wo wenn warum))  My tire was flat once again, so I went upto the 7/11, filled it up, went to the Jack in the box, filled up my water bottle, and headed home. I saw some lightning near the mountains. I realy wish I didn't live in the desert, I love rain. I wish I could read in the rain, but I don't want to fuck up my book.

      Its officialy the end of thursday (in my books at least) and its prety much the same as it always was, and always will be. It was hot, and not much happened, but I'll tell ya what I remember happening.  Second period I had a assembly thing, I tryed to read the whole time but they were just talking to much and to load so I couldn't remember if I was reading or listening, so I put my book away. They weren't talking about much either, at least nothing I haven't already heard. I also got the full scoop on that afterschool design class, It was one of them ROP classes so by law they wouldn't let freshmen in. It was still quite rude of him to give me the boot with out answering any questions.  Third period I found out I have a math test tomorrow, but it being reviews and stuff I learned in 5th grade math (I was quite advanced for my age, not to sound to boastful) so I'm sure to ace it.  Fourth period I have to memorize the second stanza of the poem I posted earlyer. I can't even remember the first. I'm gonna have to repeat it to myself again. It's not gonna be easy when I have to recite the WHOLE poem from memory.  Fifth period was hot again, so we all went into the gym to play some basketball. I actualy tryed to participate this time. I think I finaly memorized my locker combo too. I think.  Sixth period I found out we have a test tomorrow. (hence the "german test friday" in the title) I'm getting fairly good, german is a simple, and cool language to learn. I'm gonna ace this test too.  After school my front tire was flat again, It's annoying because I have to walk it in the opposite direction of where I'm supposed to be heading just to pump it back up at the 7/11, and then I have to ride all the way back to the school and go on from there. I realy hate these thorns that lie around just WAITING for a bike to run it over so that it can put a tiny hole in it and slowly deflate it. Even the slime wont protect you, you have to get those realy expensive heavy duty tires made of solid ruber, and I only have it on the back tire.  I got home and had a bunch of sweat stains on my shoulders from my book bag straps.  Again, if you would like to send me money to pay for a new notebook computer, please contact me. I would realy like to do stuff while moving lol.  Also I would like to ask, is there a way I can make my desktop picture in the sidebar auto update itself? Please contact me or coment on this post if you could help.

      Well, I guess it's obvious, I didn't go to that back to school thing. I wonder what I missed? Well, thats just life I guess, you take one path and don't know what you could have saw if you were to take the other path the other path.  I'd like to thank  Ali Mahdavi for supporting my blog. Thanks Ali ;)

      Well, I guess it's probably getting annoying reading about how my day at school was, but nobody actualy reads me anyway so here goes.  First period was boring as usual, nothin much to talk about. Second period I read my book the whole time, but I heard on the very brief announcements, the words "Photoshop" "Illustrator" "Dreamweaver" "F10" and "After school" so I asked the teacher to read me back just that one part after the speaker was done rambling, and got a bit of the scoop. So I went down to F10 afterschool to see what it was all about, and some tall dude pointed towards the door and told me to get the fuck out. I was all like "WTF?" so I tryed to say something, and before I could get a word out he repeated himself, wich I think is VERY annoying, and tryed to say something about it, and before I could say anything else he started yelling at me for not getting out. So I slamed the fucking door just before I called him a stupid ass fucktard, and went home.  Fourth period was exactly the same as always: Teacher bitchin, students talkin, Teacher bitchin bout talkin students, I should have done summerschool or something. Next time I'm doing PE in summerschool. Only five weaks, and since its so hot durring the summer the state would say we can't do much outside so we'd spend the 5 weaks in the gym shootin hoops or something.  Fifth period was extremely hot, so we had to go inside again to play Bball, so I'm very relieved that I didn't have to do the stadium bit, but I know it'll come one of these days.  Lunch I had another salad, and a coke. Now I have to pay back my friend Raul for the coke.  Sixth period I finished my final draft of the sentances I had to write. I think I'm pickin up german prety quick.  Back to school night is tonight at 6, I'm not sure if I'll go or not. I still want a notebook computer so I can blog at school and stuff. If your willing to buy me one email me at my gmail account ;)

      Well, its another day at highschool, and I'm tired. Nothin much happend during 1rst period, so I aint gonna mention it. Second period I got the results from the reading test I took a few days before. The test was basicly made to tell you your reading level so if it was 4th to fifth grade level, it would say 4.x-5.x and the teacher wants the students to improve their reading level abit. I scored within 11.5-12.9+ (the test only went to 12.9+) It's no suprise though, I have always loved to read. I read  Gathering Blue  the rest of the period. I'm only in this class because I had a history of fighting in previous schools, and they thought it was due to my bipoler, so they put me on an IEP with all the "Special Students."  3rd period wasn't much either, all basic algebra. 4th period was crap as usual, everybody talking to everybody else, and people thinking its cool if they can laugh the loudest. I realy hate how these kids act so young, it's scary actualy to know that one of these kids might end up to be the president of the United States one day. 5th period, PE coach let us off easy, we were going to walk the perimiter, but being as hot as it was, we went into the gym and played/watched others play volleyball. Lunch I had another salad, with turkey and ranch. 6th period we composed some basic phrases in german, not much realy when you think about it.  My tire was flat again, so I had to walk my bike to the 7/11, and pump it up again. On the way home I had a major chest pain, went from my right chest and down, it hurt alot, so if it continues I think I'll have to go see a doctor.  I downloaded SP2 for XP today, not much of a difference. I realy need to learn linux sometime.  Thats all for now, sorry if I'm at all boring, just blame the surroundings lol.

      Well, Im onto week 2 already, and I have got to say, today was the HOTEST DAY EVER! I have to ride my bike to and from school each day, and never before have I ever been so sweaty when I got home. I was even close to passing out. And ontop of all that someone had stole my water bottle, and my front tire was flat. Now onto class news. I read my book all period long second period. I just got into it. PE today being 4th period and all, in the heat of the day, I could hardly run I was so hot. Tomorrow I either have to walk the perimeter of the field, or run up and down the steps AND around the perimeter of a whole damn football field. Drinkwine won't tell us which one yet. I had yet another salad at lunch today, VERY deliciouse, I'v been needing a reason to slim down. We got our books in 6th period (German 1) today.  I was playing Postal 2 all weekend, I still can't find the multi player addon anywhere. I went out and bought some german software to aid me in 6th period, but the installer was broken on all five CD's, I'm probably gonna have to find something on the internet somewhere.

       Hey all, I'm in search of a template for my blog here, and I can't find anything on the net, so if you are reading this and just happen to know where to get one for me, or can custom make one for me, It would be greatly appreciated.  What I want is basicly deviantArt, but for my blog. If you can do something like that, please email me or leave a comment, or something.

       Well, its been a week, and I survived. I got there this morning and there was a stray dog just roaming around checking out all the student's. It was funney watching how the others reacted to him, they were throwing begal's at him to get him to go away. I finaly wisteled for him to come over to me and led him to the front office to let them deal with him. Not much homework in my math class today, I finished 30 out of 36 in class already. I was able to run the entire track in just 3 minutes today, wich is a great accomplishment for me because I usualy do it in 9. I'v never been a good runner. I had a salad with everything and turkey again today, this time with crackers instead of a role, BIG mistake. I managed to memorize the first stanza of the poem, but I had to repeat it all day long just to remember it.     THE ROAD NOT TAKEN  by Robert Frost  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I too the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.    Well, I only have to put up with her for the one year. I realy want to save up to buy a notebook, just so I can blog on the fly. I got 20 buck the other day from my best friends mom just for reformating her computer, but I dont think I can get much money out of fixing computers seeing as this whole town is so computer illiterate. I truely hate Apple Valley. I truely hate ANY desert.

       Well, I like everyone else downloaded doom 3 on sunday, and I'v been playing it since then. But now its starting to get annoying. There's hardly any gameplay at all. All it is is find a PDA, shoot a zombie/demon, walk through a door, find a PDA, shoot a zombie/demon, and walk through yet another door.  It gets extremely repeditive after awhile. And then I goto hell and fight this big bastard, and all you have to do is destroy that doohicky above him. Then you get a soul cube. Thats all you get for fighting the bastard 100 times before you finaly accidently shoot a few meter's above. And they said the graphics would be almost realistic, but the texture quality is ABSOLUTELY CRAP!! and constantly I get tearing so bad that the vertexes are literely ATTACHED to my xhair, often times exposing the next stage, and completely ruining the supprise of the attack.   I personaly think doom 3 was nothing but the hype.    I posted this on projectw, but now that I got a blog I guess I can post it here too now ;)

       Well, I just got done with my homework for the fourth day of highschool, and I got to say, my Intro. Lit. Comp. teacher is a real  BITCH !! If you ever met her, you'd know what I'm talkin about, you just can't explaing what is so bitchy about her, but you just KNOW. I had to run today in PE, it was the first time I had run since June. I realy need to get out more often, I didn't even know we had a wally world down here till some one mentioned it the other day. We took a tour of the campus in my Study Skills class (why don't they just let all the freshmen roam around like lab rats or something?) and not supprisingly I knew where everything was allready. I guess they assume nobody has friend's who were freshmen last year to show them around like me. (did that make sence lol) My german class is going abit fast, but I get the jist of it all. I have an advantage over everybody else anyway, seeing as I'm of german descent. Again, I still need some help developing my blog, so if you have any idea's, or better a template I can use, please speak up, I have it set so that anybody can comment.

       Hey if there's anybody reading this, I'd like to ask you to please help me out. I am playing with the template thing, you know just gettin rid of the ad's and stuff. I need you to give me some good idea's, and help me implement new things to my side bar. I'd also like to take the other 2 rounder's templates and implement them as alternate styles like for firefox users and stuff. (I think i know how, I just need to steel the CSS and link to it externaly right?) I look forward to your help, and I hope somebody takes an interest in reading about me. I highly doubt it though :(

       Alrighty now, just finished the 3rd day of highschool, and already I hate my english class. The teacher is realy bitchy, and the students are unnessisarily loud, but thats to be expected by most average freshmen, but they'll grow up i hope. I have always hated PE, but I can deal till its over. I got my math book today too.   You don't know how many times I thought the word n00b today, damn I hate how the school computers are so cheap you'll get boged with insufficiant disk space error's just trying to download the ut2k4 demo >:-(   the computers in the middle school were 100x better, atleast with them i can install and play unreal'98 with 32 fps at shit for looks graphics settings. I think maybe somebody can buy them new pc's and put the old ones in a museum. (being serious BTW)
