      yoyo..me back le..sad sad yesterday cannot blog..haix..cause having a guides camp..yipee..tis camp to me is really okie..can say is rather successful..isn't it guides? maybe some other guides may say tis is boring but we as a role of leaders did spend effort..careful planning for the camp..so when tis camp goes well..though there mayb some errors here and there but to me..everyone of the leaders had put in their best...done their roles..etc..so to me..tis camp was a success..really..hahax...me will always rem me tis time guides camp is incharge of FOOD...hahax..first time..always down for gadgets..but tis time is down to do food thingy..to me it was fine..everything..everyone was fine..food can be get ready on time..drinks can be prepared..lyk hot milo though taste a bit weird but we food committee had done our best..hahax..really need to thks the food members for helping us out..it's really much apppreciated, it was really a great job indeed..overall..me do have fun in doing food thingy..very luckily tt the hot water can be cooked..etc..but one thing which i'm rather sad is that i surveyed if the food prepared was nice..but the response wasn;t very the good..sob sob..hahax..let me stop talking abt the food..hmm..i guessed it was indeed a rather tiring camp ba..cox we, exp leaders only slept for abt the most 2 hrs plus and with the long day we have gone thru..i guessed everyone is very tired le ba..but one thing i'm happy is everyone goes really well ba..i noe i repeat again but me really wish to give good comment hahax..mayb out to console ourselves..but i think we really done our best..haix..but..also gt unpleasant incidents which happened la..which i dun really wish to mention coz me look on the bright side ma..yipee..camp has ended but i guessed it was indeed a learning experience for we leaders and a fruitful experience for the campus ba..hahax..so let's give a three cheers for everyone..yea..guideS!!! =D
