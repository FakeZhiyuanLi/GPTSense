      The table was cold.  She hated cold tables.  Seems like she had spent most of her life on them.  Why does everything involve a cold table?  Or is it just her.  Maybe she was cold.   Nothing good ever comes from a cold table, especially ones like this one.  Metal, rectangular, with only a paper sheet over it.  Of course it had those mandantory feet holders at the bottom, they are metal too.  More coldness.   She couldn't tell their was a cushion on top of the table, all she could feel was the cold.  When the door opened, the breeze moved the paper sheet laying over her.   "Well, how are you today Jazz?"  Doc Riley half heartedly asked, " I didn't expect to see you for awhile. Thought for sure it worked this time."   "I know doc, I thought it did to, this is the last time, I can't do this anymore." Jazz said quietly, while Doc helped her get her feet in the stirrups.  " Coop doesn't know I came back, he didn't want to put me thru it all again"   Doc Riley went thru the motions, they had all been here before, She really wanted this time to work. In all her years of practice, she had never rooted for a couple as much as Cooper and Jasmine Brande.  Jasmine was willing to put her body thru anything and everything to have a child.  Just one.  She didn't care what sex it was, or even if it was healthy, she just wanted a child to hold, and to say, this is my blood.  And Cooper was willing to go thru hell and high water to give his love what her hearts desire.   As Jazz sat up, "you know the drill, same as the last 5 times"  Doc Riley told her.  "I'll give you a call tomorrow to check on you.  Tell Coop to fix his famous chicken for you for supper tonight.  you deserve it."  Once home, Jazz lay in her bed thinking.  Had she done the right thing going behind Coop's back against his wishes and having the procedure done one last time?  She knewhe would be fuming inside when she told him, but she also knew he wanted a child as much as she does.  She wasnt' scared, just nervous.  It broke his heart every time only one pink line came up.  He mourned the loss as much as she did.  Sometimes she thought it was stupid to mourn the loss of a child that never existed in the first place.  That was something to come to terms with later.  Now, she would only thing happy thoughts.   "hey baby, where are you"  coop yelled thru the house, it wasnt' like Jazz to not be at the door when he came in from work.  She always beat him home.  She drove like a maniac, no matter where she was, she would always beat him home.   He had a suprise for her today, knowing how crushed she had been the last procedure didn't work, he decided they needed to get away, just for the weekend.  So he booked them a room at this ancient bed and breakfast in Charleston.  Jazz had always wanted to see historic Charleston.  he would indulge her this weekend, and then maybe approach her about adoption.    What's up babe, why are you in bed?"  Coop asked, " rough day at work?  I sure had one, one of my best clients called, mad as hell, seems like Sherr---, "hon, what's wrong"   "I went to doc Riley today, I know you didn't want me to, but this is the last time, I promise.  I will stay just like this for as long as I have to, I won't get out of bed, even to pee, or shower, I won't move.  Just please, Coop, don't be angry"  Jazz pleaded with him, "I had to give it one last try, tell me you understand, please"  "Shit babe, what did you go alone for, you know I would have went with you, even if it does piss me off you did it behind my back, you shouldn't have went alone.   What if something had happened, Huh"  Coop was so tired of this.  So fed up with all the baby talk, everything was about having a baby with Jazz.  everything.  She was obsessed.  But then, that's how she was about everything.   When they met, it was thanks to one of Jazz's obsessions.  She was searching for the ultimate bike.  He was working in a sporting goods store to help pay is way thru Duke university, and this girl came in every day for three weeks.  Looking at all the bikes, trying them out, asking questions of all the sales associates.  They had decided she was a nut case.  Finally Coop was the only one who would approach her, and answer her questions.   They finally decided on a bike, and she asked he could put it in her car for her.  After he did, she offered to buy him a latte to thank him.  He told her he would rather she let him buy her dinner.  That was it.  The crazy "bike babe" as his co-workers called her, was under his skin.  One dinner is all it took.   That was 5 years ago.  They had spent 4.5 of those years as man and wife.  Once they finally admitted thier feelings to one another, they saw no reason to court, be engaged, or all the other stuff society says you have to do.  So, they went to the court house, got a license, and then went downstairs to the magistrate and had him do the ceremony.  Simple.   He knew this baby thing wasn't going to pass.  The docs had told them 2 years ago, that despite the surgeries, treatments, hormones, and countless pills, Jazz just wasn't able to get pregnant.  They really didn't know why.  They couldn't find a medical reason for it.  Everything was intact, all her labs were perfect.  She just couldn't get pregnant.  He had been poked and prodded more than any man would normally allow, and all his labs were fine.  So no problem there.   The fertility gods were against them.   All this was going thru his head while he cooked supper.  Chicken.  Jazz's favorite.  He had learned to cook when he was a teenager.  His mom insisted he know how to cook, she wasn't letting him leave the house, to marry some woman and have her wait on him hand and foot.  His mom did not believe in men coming home from work and parking their butts in a chair while the wife did all the work.  She raised her boys to know as much about housework and cooking as her girls did.     Coop didn't think he could do this again.  Every time was the same.  Every time they would wait the 10 days, and then test.  Each morning after, getting their hopes up for that pink line to show that never did.  For 6 weeks this would go on.  until Doc Riley would finally tell Jazz it was over.  She wasn't pregnant.    One more time, that's it, one more time.  He kept repeating over and over in his head.  Just one more time.    Jazz had stayed in bed literally for two weeks.  She knew Coop was disappointed, and frankly, she was too. That Charleston trip would have been a dream.  To walk the historic streets, tour the plantation houses, she had always wanted to go.  But it would wait.   She had other things to do first.  Instead of watching the clock, she was getting ready for work.  Trying to figure out why exactly having a child of her own was so important.  Why she couldn't even entertain the thought of adoption.  There must be a reason.  She just had to figure it out.  Jasmine was the youngest of her family.  5 kids, she was not only the baby girl, but the baby all together.  Not a bad spot to be in.  Except in her family.  All the older kids were old enough to be her parents.  They grew up together in the same house at a time when their parents were young and had energy to play, and patience to put up with a child.   Not that growing up in her house was bad.  She was very thankful she landed with the family she got.  Her family had adopted her when she was just an infant.  Her life could have been much much worse, and she knew that.  But still, she didn't have a single memory of them playing in the yard with her, no memory of trips to the park, no little league, no girl scouts.  Sleepovers were never allowed, her parents needed the sleep, and they couldn't tolerate the giggling six 12 year olds would put them through.   Jazz always knew she was loved.  By her parents that is.  To her older bothers and sisters, she was a nuiscince.  She was the reason her parents wouldn't babysit, or go on vacations iwth them in the middle of a school year.  She took her parents retirement from them.  She was a whole new family from them, and they didn't car if they ever included her in their clique.   Mainly, she was just ignored by them.   Unless she was doing something bad.  They always saw when she screwed up.  Always, and they made sure she knew about it too.  When she threw a rock across the street and hit a car driving by, they made sure mom knew and punished her for it.   But all in all, her childhood was a good one.  She was the apple of her parents eye.  Her adoptive ones at least.  Her birth mother had chosen to give her up for adoption so she could still live iwth her parents.  Rejection as an infant.  Jazz didn't even know who her biological father was.  Who knows, he could have been her high school gym teacher.  She had no idea.  None.  And never would.  Why put herself thru another rejection.  HE rejected her when he found out she was being born, so why would he want her now?  That's why having a child of her own was so important to Jazz.  She wanted to look into soemones eye's and see herself.  To see a smirk and know it came from her.  She wanted to walk down the street with her child and have strangers comment on how much the child looked like her.  She wanted to be able to know beyond a shadow of a doubt there was a body out there with the same blood as her in it.  She wanted a child to show how much she could love.  She wanted to let her child know how revered it was.  To know what it was like to feel part of something bigger than life.  To know what family felt like.   Coop could never understand that.  He grew up with brothers and sisters that looked like him, parents that loved him from the second he was concieved.  He played little league, there were baby pictures of him, his parents had taken him to the local pool to swim, taught him how to swim in it.  No his life wasn't without heartache, but he had always known his family.  Jazz never would.  Not until she gave birth to her family.   That was it, she would never feel liek she had her own family until she had a child.   "Jazz, JAZZ LOOK AT ME" startled, she realized Coop was shaking her arm, "sorry hon, I was in la-la land again. Deep thought.  What is it?" looking at her watch she hustled by Coop to put her shoes on, she was late for work.  Rushing around, she noticed Coop hadn't moved from his spot in the bathroom, he was just frozen in one spot.  Not moving, not speaking.  Just froze.  "COOPER BRANDE, what is wrong with you, we are going to be late for work, get a move on..."  Jazz screamed at him.  Now who was off in la-la land she thought.   "Screw work"  Coop finally said.  "we're staying home"  He whispered as he walked across the room to Jazz, taking her in his arms, he barely managed to get out the words "mom, you are staying home for good."  In his hand, he held the white stick, Jazz had forgotten about it.  But wouldn't forget it again, ever, for that stick had not just one, but two pink lines.                                                       THE END

      We have ahd a pretty good day today.  I was kind of dreading it, last night, after the good stuff with Tommy, he went to turn on his laptop, and it wouldn't start.  He has had it barely a year.  So, he starts going thru the troubleshooting process, and nothing.  He happens to read the chapter on what to do if dropped, trys that stuf, and it worked.  Evidently, one of the boys has kocked the laptop over and not told us.  BUt, Tommy handled it VERY well.  HE honestly didn't show any anger.  I think he was just thankful it works again.  I started my meds again.  I had ran out of them,a nd kept forgetting to call the refill in.  IT takes 24-48 hours after you call it in to get the refill, so I had been out for almost a week.    Tommy's dr.s office sent us a $10.  check today, may not seem like much, but let me tell you, it bought bread, sugar and tea.  Yes for those of you that have read below, I am out of sugar.  lol.  That 25 lbs didnt' last very long at all.  HE had paid that much over his co-pay last visit, so they refunded it.  Nice.  I about died tonight when the called out Latonya's name as one of the bottom 3 on American Idol.  She is my bet to win the whole thing.  Poor John, he knew he was gonna lose, then when he didn't, he looked like he would cry.  I figured Amy would be out soon, but Can't understand the deal with Camille. She really can't sing.  I think the boys are voting for her.  It will be really bad if she wins because all the teenage boys think she is hot.   Cause she can't sing.  AM I babbling yet?????? I do believe so!

      God does answer prayers.  I have to tell you, I was having a pretty decent day until I talked to the bank.  Which of course just ruined my day.  Called Tommy to talk to him about it, and ruined his day.  I was really dreading him coming home from work, just because I knew what a bad mood he would be in.    He got home from work, came up to me, put his arms around me, and told me to please bear with him.  He was trying to deal with all the stress and it was taking him a bit to do, but he would keep trying.  Then he just held me.    Praise God, do you know how much I needed that?????????

      I have some great friends.  I just had to get that out there.  I want everyone to know that I have some of the greatest friends on earth.  I just read and email from MJ, she is half way accross the country and worried about me. I hope she knows it helps just knowing that somewhere in Minnesota, she is praying for me.  I know GOd is hearing her prayers, and that alone helps me.  she has been thru depression and all kinds of stuff with her family, and it kind of scares me that she is so worried.  I know she had been thru this and watches the signs. I also know she reads and sees what isnt' said.  But reading her email today helped.  Just seeing that ther are people i nthis world who aren't tired of hearing my gripe, or actually may be tired of hearing me gripe, but love me enough to listen and pay attention anyhow.  That is a true friend.  Then you throw in Renee.  Bless her heart.  She is dealing with her own stuff, she meets with the transplant team next week about getting Savannah's liver transplant done, and what does she do?  She calls me today wanting to know just why exactly I am still in bed.  I was cold.  I hadn't had my shower yet, and was cold, so I went back to bed.  It has been a dreary, rainy, chilly morning here in NC.  But she kicked my butt aware enough, I got up and showered, and haven't been back to bed since.  She has had to listen to a lot of stuff lately.  A lot.  She has been in my house, knows the status there, and still doenst' judge my husband.  THank you for that.  I know that this is just  a season that one day will pass.  I don't want to make judgements now that will affect how they see Tommy in the future.  Renee doesn't do that.  She too has been thru "stuff" galore.  She knows what to look for, and isnt' afraid to tell me to call my doctor.  ANother true friend.

      I had to close the last topic out because of the different nature of this one.  I have been a part of a yahoo group of ladies for over 4 years now.  We have all grown to love each other like sisters.    I am thinking of leaving the group.  Lately, with all my troubles, and depression stuff going on, I have been a real downer to the group.  I have noticed that my posts aren't getting replied to, except by two women.  So I think I need to say   goodbye.  I hate too, I really do, they ahve been my life line for a while now.  But, I really feel like they kind of want me to go.    A couple of years ago, we had one woman/man/who knows that was posting and they got rid of "it" because of inconsistencies in "it's " stories.  I totally understand that.  "it" had soem dooseies.  I don't want them to have to make that decision about me.  One in particular has made reference lately to another board.  I am beginning to wonder if they are all on the other board, and were too nice to invite me to join them.    I may be being paranoid, but this is how I feel.

      Normally, I don't suffer from a little thing we women call PMS.  But for some reason, I am PMSING like crazy.  Not a good thing around here.  The only woman in a house full of men, who do not understand what mood swings, chocolate cravings, etc mean.    We had baked ziti for supper tonight.  I have to have chocolate after eating anything with garlic.  Well of course we have no chocolate in the house.  So I tell Tommy, I need chocolate, "no you don't" well, I beg to differ. Women need chocolate as much as or more than men need sex.  I'm sorry that discription may offend a few people, but that is how I feel.  I know that I would feel so much better right now with just one bite, just one, of a Hershey's chocolate bar.  No almonds, just plain ole choclate.    Or I could make do with a pint of Haagen Daaz strawberry cheesecake ice cream.  I don't want chocolate ice cream.  That is for the candy bar, to savor and let the milk chocolate melt in my mouth.  Maybe on my fingers.  MMMMMMM.  Ice Cream is meant for Haagen Daaz, which I am probably speling wrong.  I normally will go for the Ben and Jerry's but our local stores have stopped carrying my favorite flavor Triple Carmel Chunk.  Nothin else is even close.   Everythign but the... is a close second, but stillnot all that carmel.  ANd believe me, nobody makes strawberry cheesecake ice cream like HD does.  I tried Edys Dreamery, no where close.  NOt even on the same map.    So, do I sound like a live, walking talking case of PMS to you??????

      Have you ever notice how relaxing pulling weeds can be.  I didnt' know this until today.  Renee was down here, and we were looking at my much neglected flower garden, and started pulling weeds.  I suddenly found my self not wanting to get up.  I just wanted to sit and pull weeds.    I know nothing about flowers.  Zero, zilch, nada, big fat O, but now I may have to learn.

      Today... has been an emotional roller coaster.  Literally.  I woke up in a good mood, fantastic really.  Then it hit.  Tommy woke up ill.  Need I say more.  THere goes my good mood.  I dealt with it fine until I left for children's choir this evening.  Then, I told Tommy bye, I love you, and got no response.  Just that cold stare.  When I speak to him and he has to reply, I get bitterness dripping from his words.  I can't handle it anymore.    I excused my self from practice, and went outside, just standing inthe shadow of the church, the one place that had always been my sanctuary, my safe place.  But tonight I didnt' feel peaceful there.  I looked up at the clear blue sky, and could see the pines swaying with the breeze.  That is how I see God move, like the pines swaying in the breeze.  I felt nudged to call Tommy, so I did.  I asked him why he didn't repspond when I told him I love him.  We talked for a bit and I told him that I can't handle the bitterness and coldness anymore.  He told me that he can't help it.  The stuff that doesn't boter me, does him.  Mainly he hates the fact that anytime we need food, we have to borrow from my parents.  That even though Jamie needs shoes, we can't buy them.  That he has paid $400 on the light bill, but yet, we got a bill int he mail yesterday saying we still owe $400.    He doesn't think those things bother me.  They do, I just know that God has promised to take care of my needs.  It may be thru my parents buying us food, but, our need it met.  I know that God is the one doing that.    I told him this, but he still can't deal with it.  We hugn up without resolving anything.    I stood there, looking at the sky, the trees, crying out to God for some answer, some sign, something, anything.  Tommy called me back.  He told me he does love me, he just can't deal with the pressure.  I literally broke down in sobs.  Right there, right then.    I couldn't go into service tonight, I was too upset.  I talked to Renee for a while about it.  She kind of knows how I feel.  We talked about how I feel deep inside my heart that it will take Tommy and I splitting up for him to see, for him to know what we have.    I sat in the nursery during service.  Praying.  Crying.  Moaning out to God.  I told him I can't do this anymore.  And I can't.  I need God's interference.  Now.  What did I get, Vacation BIble School.  Huh? Vacation BIble School is my baby, it has been for several years now.  I hadn't given it much thought this year, I have been too preoccupied.  But God reminded me. He let me know that this year, I need Vacation Bible School.  More than any other year.  I need it.    The stress on a good year, a happy year, is enough to kill a person.  somehow, I feel this year, it will be my salvation from all the ills in my life.  It will give me focus, it will make me dig in my bible, to lean on God for all things.  I need this.

      Sitting here, half naked, waiting for the Endless Summer to dry on my legs.  I am having a very vain day today.  Not really, but, more than usual.  I went and FINALLY got my hair done.  after 4 months of trying, I got it cut, colored and come home, conditioned it, and put the stuff on my legs.  For me, that is a vain day.  But the stuff  is old, so I may turn green.   sure hope not, that would be really hard to hide under panty hose tomorrow!  I am doing all of this to feel better about my self.  I walked to Marlena's today to get my hair done.  Which basically, is a 90degree uphill walk.  I was huffin and puffin when I got there, but I feel good.  So that helped a lot.  I am goign to hit the treadmill again starting Monday.  I keep forgetting to use it.  It is right smack in the middle of my living room, and I totally forget about it.  Can you say exercise avoidance?????  The boys new friends have been here all day long.  Seriously, all    day     long. I saw their mom at the grocery, right at that exact time, Casey calls my cell phone and tells me "those boys are here"  She is at the store, her kids are at my house??????? She had no clue.  They had been at my dad's house first.  Oh well.  I guess I have some new kids.  My house is like that, kids love to play here.  I don't mind, cause I am one of those over protective moms that won't let her kids out of her sight unless I know your complete medical, criminal, and spiritual background, followed by yo giving me collateral and a sworn statement that you WILL NOT hurt my child.  THen, I still prefer for them to be at home.  There are very few people I trust with my kids, my parents, Renee, Lori, and Tammy (not if her hubby is around, jsut her) and that is about it.  Casey has one coahc that I trust them wil.  But just the older kids.  It helps that I have a coupel of kids old enough to babysit now.  But for some reason, TJ thinks I should pay him for babysitting his brothers!  That's a joke.

      i jsut go thome after a VERY long day.  I left at 8:30am, and now it is almost 8pm.  Just running errands all day long.  Paying bills, stuff like that.    I get home and Jamie has found two new friends.  Benjamin and Nickolaus.  They live in the mansion behind my parents house.  Believe me, it is a mansion.  Marble floors and counter tops in Kitchen and all 5 bath rooms.  I have no clue how many bedrooms or anything else it has, but I do know it was close to half million at one point on the market.  So it is huge and beautiful.    The boys had met a couple of days ago, and tonight, they came down to our house, and their parents came down also.  The parents went and got a pizza for the boys to eat.  THey seem really nice.  The boys are really polite and nice, unfortunatley they came in my house and wandered around.  NOt a good thing.  My house is literally falling apart at the seams.  No joke.  THis house is over 50 years old and it shows.  Ther eis so much repair work to be done.  But  you know the strange thing, without ever meeting me, they let their kdis come down to my house.  Turns out, I went to school with the dad, but we didn't know each other at all.  I mean never said one word to each other.  He is a professer at the local university now.  Talk about intimidating.    I went to pay the bills, and one of them, where I had bounced checks too, I was going to pick up the fees for two of the  checks.  THe checks had been reprocessed thru, so the amounts were already taken care of.  I just owed the $25 return check fee.  Well I get to customer service, given them the info,and they tell me it will be an exta $13 to send off the payment.  The send it western union.  Please, I told them to forget it,a nd I would send it to the main office myself.  IT is bad enough that I had to pick up the fees, they put the checks back thru a second time without my knowledge, they caused a bunch other checks to bounce, now they want me to pay the western union fee for them to send the payment to their own main office. ARRRGGGHHHHH.  I am trying, hoping, praying to find a way to get to go with Renee when Savannah has her transplant done. I have to be there.  For Renee, Stan, Savannah, EJ, but for me also.  So help me pray about it.  I also am looking for an online bible study, like a book maybe by Beth MOore, Elizabeth George, or someone else.  I would love to have one of those to participate in.    Oh, I found out that my dad did have a stroke a couple of months ago when we thought he did.  He refused to go to the doctor, and when he finally did, they did some blood work,and called him back in to ask him questions about it.  THey told him he had a stroke at some point recently, they just needed to pinpoint when.  Now he is scared he is going to lose his driver's license.  He is almost 84 years old, acts like a 60 year old, still pastor's a church, preaches every sunday, does all the shopping, and cares for my mom, who is basically house bound.  SO he is a very lively man, it will kill him to lose his driving ability.    I need to go watch some basketball.  GOt to check and see who got the pole for the race SUnday, they are at Bristol, which is only and hour away from us.  I love race weekend, just wish I were at the track!

      Im using Tommy's laptop to do this, it is really awkward.  I'm not used to this small keyboard.  He does this foreign exchange stuff,and it mostly moves during the night, so he is up and down all night, watching his charts, and stuff, so right now he is napping so he can stay up tonight.  I am watching the charts move.  I have been playing Tetris so long, my shoulder aches.  I link it off of either Shara's or Dawn's blog.  Whichever I happen to look at first.  I love tetris, that is one video game I can do.  Today has been a pretty good day.  I have stayed in a good mood today, kept my s pirits up, I even wore jeans around the house today, I NEVER wear jeans around the house.  I used to when I was skinnier, but not since having 5 kids in 9 years.  They just don't make jeans that fit a body that has given birth so many times.    The weather was great today, the boys and Savannah played outside a lot today.  I walked around the yard alot today.  Looking at all the new plant life that is sprouting.  I don't have any tulips this year, I didn't really expect to.  The boys tromp all over my tulip bed every time I set them out, so I didn't bother this go around.  But my Zinnias, at least I think that is what they are , are sprouting.  I love those flowers.  At first when we moved into the house and I saw those, I thought they were this really strange looking weed.  Then t hey bloomed.  Oh they are so gorgeous.    The lilacs are showing buds, and the weeping cherry tree is starting to flower out.  When it gets to full flower, I'm going to take the boys pics in front of it.    It is amazing, spring, is such a fresh start.  With all the plant life, and I am going to try to make it a fresh start for me in my spiritual life.  I am fighting the depression as hard as I can, taking my meds, and just fighting.  So I am more determined than usual to get past it right now.  Fresh start, it is time for me to start budding, so God can make me into a beautiful flower.

      Listening to Daniel Beddingfield.  Love this song about love.  The sermon at church tonight, Tommy would have loved.  It was about what a Pharisetic time we live in .  In other words how Christians spend more time judging each other than trying to witness to the lost, and make changes in the world.  It was good. Very good.  Supper is cooking, yes I know it is 9:39pm.  Bad, bad mommy I am. lol.  We always eat supper after church on Wed.  And, of course I had to watch American Idol.  I can't believe they voted Matt Rogers off.  Camille totally butchered Desperado, and has done lousy this whole time.  She should have been gone a long time ago.  Man, don't butcher a Eagles song.  That just ain't right.  I made a mistake in yesterdays blog about the scripture reference, I meant to say verse 13, not 23.  But if you read the entire set of scriptures you probably caught my mistake.    I have been doing pretty good today.  Actually, I read abook today.  The entire book.  "A Quarter for a Kiss" by MIndy Starns Clark, she is an inspirational mystery writer.  This is her latest book in the Million Dollar Mystery Series.  I really like this series.  I can't wait for her next book to come out.    Another author I like is Dee Henderson, I am halfway thru her O'Malley Series, and I love them.    Oh, and Jan Karon, I am very patiently awaiting the next and final book in the Mitford series, I will mis this bunch of characters so much.  I am not the type of person who can read a book more than once,I am the same way with movies, once I have seen it, don't make me sit thru it again.

      Sitting here listening to Norah Jones, that girl can sing.  Her vocals are so mellow, smooth, they just seemlessly float from one note to another.  I don't even pay attention to the lyrics.  Just her voice.    MJ sent this to me on a group board I belong to for large families.  It seemed to fit, just right.  She got the reference from  urlLink gospelcom.net   Here it is Ecclesiastes 7 1   A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. 2   It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. 3   Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. 4   The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. 5   It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. 6   For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. 7   Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. 8   Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. 9   Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 10   Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. 11   Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun. 12   For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. 13   Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? 14   In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. 15   All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. 16   Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ? 17   Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 18   It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. 19   Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. 20   For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. 21   Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: 22   For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. 23   All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. 24   That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? 25   I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness: 26   And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. 27   Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account: 28   Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. 29   Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many   Look at verse 23- who can straighten what God has made crooked?  Hmmmm, something to ponder on.

      Isn't it funny how your mood in general is sooooo related to those around you?  I am in a better mood, better outlook on life today.  Why, Dad took me to Sam's, Tommy is in a better mood, I kept Savannah today, the boys are in pretty good moods, you name it, it just seems better today.   Savannah decide she was a puppy today and ate a couple of pieces of dog food.  Anybody have any idea how much protein is in dog food?   I know initially, it sounds funny, but with Savannah's condition,  it isn't funny.  Tommy suggested that Renee call the manufacturor and get the break down.  She has played puppy all her life, she loves to play puppy, but this is the first time she has ate dog food.    We are having Taco Salad tonight for supper.  I can't wait.  We had hamburgers last night.  Don't I sound pathetic.  I have been praying for my friend MJ, they are pretty much in the same boat as us right now.  God used her to help us when we were really down, and I hope he can used me to help her.  She is such a good friend.  We have never met in person, but some friends, you don't have to.  The freindship is there without a face to face meeting.

      I have to say, I have done nothing of interest today.  Not washed a dish, made a bed, nothing.  That said,  I finished The Teeth of the TIger by TOm Clancy today.  I love Tom, my dear hubby turned me onto him when we were first married.  His first books were, well, lets say, too techinical for me.  But the last few have been more personality oriented, and I have enjoyed them.  This last one, so far is tied with Rainbow Six as my favorite of his.    I do that sometimes, get so into a book, that I have to drop everything else until it is finished.  I remember staying up until 6am when I was in high school, reading.  I used to be such a voracious reader.  Now, I spedn my time reading recipes, food labels, monthly bills, baseball schedules...there is no end to the reading I do, jsut none of it is for my own pleasure.

      Guess what?  my Dad took me to Sam's club again, I am a blessed woman.  I now have, a box of hamburgers, salad dressing, mayonaise, ketchup, butter, bread sticks, nutty buddy bars, kerosene, salad lettuce, whoohoo, we are eating good tonight, oh, and I got nacho cheese sauce too.  We love nachos around here.   I talked to mom about the thing with Shane, she doesn't even remember saying it.  BLess her heart, she is 80 years old, she has black spots in her memory,and when she gets loopy like that, she can't remember a thing.    Tommy came home from work in a better mood.  He even went up to mom and dad's and went in.  Pass out, he went it.  My mom has always been able to get him to talk,a nd they talked for a little while, well, I guesss I should say mom talked and Tommy listened.    All in all, so far, a good night.

      Monday, spring has sprung, and it is blowing snow!  How messed up is that?    Well, we had a tense filled weekend of course.  Tommy was very ill yesterday.  I think because it was TJ's birthday and we couldn't get him anything.  We are so broke, I had to borrow money from Daddy to go get stuff to fix Noah's toe.  He ripped the top few layers of skin off his big toe, about a quarters worth, and we didnt' have a thing to put on it.  No band aids, not antibiotic ointment, NOTHING.  The night before, TJ went outside barfoot,and cut his foot about 3 inches long, and we didnt' have anything for him either.  So I finally bit the bullet and borrowed money to get first aid stuff with.    Mom hurt Shane's feelings yesterday.  Shane is my younger brother, who is gay.  He is in a realtionship right now with Bobby,and it literally has been the best thing for him.  I don't agree with his lifestyle.  He knows it, everyone knows it, but I love my brother.  And I have never seen him so settled and so happy as he is with Bobby.  BOth of them are HIV positive, and are taking really good care of each other.    Yesterday, in front of my kids, my mom made the statement that she had 7 kids, and only 3 boys.  One of her sons thought he was a girl.  Well, my kids thought she was joking,and ran straight to Shane to tell him Nanny's joke.  Oh, it was so bad.  It really hurt his feeligns, and Bobby's.  I felt like crying when I saw their faces.  The thing is, knowing mom , it was just a joke. She is 80 years old and thinks she can say whatever she wants to say and not hurt anyone's feelings.  She would never hurt anyone intentionally, especially Shane and BObby.    Now do you see why I need this online journal?  I have so much stuff to deal with and to talk about.  This is such good therepy, I know you are probably thinking I need REAL therepy, but this will jsut have to do for a while!  I do have to say that both messages at church yesterday were good.  I really enjoyed my self.  It ahs got to where, church is the only place I can truly forget my troubles.  I can just get lost in the Holy Spirit and forget all those stumbling blocks that are trying to keep me off my path.  If only we had church 7 days a week!

      Ok, I just went and read Renee's blog.  I think she is trying to make me cry.  She has a link to a page titled "In memory of my boys"  Oh, it broke my heart.    See, Renee is my niece by marriage.  Bless her heart, she is married to my nephew, I tried to warn her, but she just wouldn't listen (lol) .  6 years ago in May, she gave birth to beautiful twin boys, Zach and Luke.  They were so adorable.  We were so excited.  Then on Mother's day, things changed.  Zach and Luke got sick, very sick.  At that time, the doctor's didnt' really know why.  THey were put on life support, and Stan & Renee were given a chance to bathe them, rock them, sing to them, change their diapers.  Stuff they normally would be doing with healthy babies.  Then the day came to disconnect the tubes.  Zach went to be with Jesus first.  But Luke wasn't quite ready, he wanted a few more hours.    Months later they found out the boys had  urlLink Citrullinemia  which is a  urlLink urea cycle disorder .  Without prenatal, or immediate screening at birth, there was no way to know about this disease.  No way to save those precious babies.    After many many hardships, they decided to try one more time.  After all the chance was only 25% that this child would have the disease too.  That is how we came to have  urlLink Savannah .  The prenatal testing showed that Savannah did have Cit., preparations had to made well in advance for her birth.  We live 4 hours away from the closest hospital that even had heard the name of the disease.  So it would mean a lot of traveling by the young couple.  A lot of it.    The UNC-Chapel Hill, is where Savannah goes to the doctor.  They trained Renee and Stan how to take care of her, mix her medicine, make her formula, what to watch for, etc, extremely well.  I remember well, the first time I got to hold the most beautiful baby ever born, she was 8 weeks old, even though I lived on the same road, and went to the same church as her.  Why?  Because I had a cold when she was born.  It is much to risky to be around her with any type of illness, if contagious.  It can put her in the hospital for weeks.  But, when I held that little bundle, after washing with soap all the way up to my elbows, and then using anti-bacterial gel on my hands, I fell in love with that child.  She was in my heart from that day forward.    I admire her mom so much.  Renee has incredible strength.  Knowing what it was like to have her boys taken from her, and knowing the same disease silently moves in Savannah's body.  But she never lets on.  Never.  Very rarely do you see her break.  Since Savannah's birth, she has been thru numerous surgeries, a life flight to Chapel Hill, many, ,many trips to the hospital for labs, more days spent home waiting for the many doctors to call , not to mention all the specialists it takes to keep her going.  All this, and just the daily grind.  Weighing and measuring every bite, sip, nibble, EVERYTHING that goes into Savannah's mouth, calulating how much protien it has, how much she still needs to meet her daily needs to keep her body growing, without sending her body into a coma.  Watching every little thing, how long she sleeps, how whiney she is, is it too much, is her ammonia going up, is she getting sick?  All are questions Renee deals with not just on a daily basis, but on an hourly basis.    What does she get in return?  The most loving, beautiful child there is.  savannah has every one she has ever come in contact with wrapped around her little finger.  Especially her Aunt Gee (which is me) I can be so down in the dumps, low, and Savannah walks in and flashes me that smile and says HAYYYYYY, and all the world just gets brighter.  All my troubles just seem to disappear.  This child is special.  She is an angel here on earth.  and we are blessed to be love by her.    Renee made "the call" yesterday.  I didn't know it until I read her blog.  She called and made the appointment with the transplant team.  That in itself is a huge step for Renee and Stan.  It is just a fact gathering meeting, but a meeting that will lead to others, and to major decisions.  Decisions that we all have known were coming, but yet, aren't quite prepared to deal with.   I am praying for my friend, I hope anyone who reads this will too.

      I have a crick in my neck.  It is killing me.  Hurts to sit up, to lay down, to do anything in fact.    What have I been up to?  Well, let's see, Lori (tommy's sister) took the kids t fun depot yesterday, it is this new place in town with go karts, lazer tag, mini golf, a climbing wall, batting cages, and tons of video games.  The boys had a blast.  It was expensive, but they all have a blast.  Lori has 3 boys of her own, so between the two of us, there were 8 boys.  She is giving TJ and Jamie a combined birhtday party their.  They are already excited about it.   After paying the bills that had to be paid this week, all we had left was gas money.  No grocery money.  Not a good thing.  We are ok, though, just not eating like we are used to eating.  Like tonight I had a baked potato for supper, most of the boys did too, TJ had a couple of cheese sandwiches, and Tommy ate some leftover biscuits and gravy.  So its not like we are starving.    Tomorrow is TJ's birthday, ie will be 14.  I find it hard to believe I am the mother of a 14 year old.  Doesn't seem possible.  he is so excited.  Mom bought the cake mix and stuff for me to bake his cake, and her and daddy are cooking lunch after church tomorrow.  We are having Roast and fixin's yuuuummmmmm, I can almost smellthe roast cooking now.    Tommy asked me today about the Passion of the Christ.  I told him it was too hard to put into words to describe the movie.

      I got a great suprise today, MJ one of my online friends called me.  I was so thrilled to hear from her.  It was the first time we had talked on the phone, so we probably spent too long!lol.  BUt that is ok.  It really helped talking to her.    When you are going thru life lessons, most of the time, you feel totally alone in the world, like no one out there understands or comprehends what you are living with.  Luckily have a couple of friends that do understand.  That I can talk to and just let it all hang out.  That i dont' have to sugar coat the truth or keep the icky details from.  To those friends, I thank you.  Evidently, from my posts and conversations yesterday, all could tell I was in bad shape.  And truthfully, I was.  I am a bit better today. I am trying.  I got one email yesterday telling me to call my doctor ASAP.  Wow what a radar.    I had to call Tommy at work and give him even more bad news.  He got very quiet on the other end.  TJ asked me yesterday if me and Dad were going to seperate.  I told him I wasn't planning on it.  And I'm not.  I know that me and Tommy can get thru this, we just have to pull together and work together to do so.  Two are stronger than one.

      It's funny, I was just over reading Renee's blog and noticed that we both chose these artsy, kind of beautiful gloomy templates. Is that an oxymoron? Hmmmmm.....  There are a lot of sirens going by on the highway, more than I have ever heard. Something big must be going on. It seems to be coming from about a mile away at this HUGE trailer park. I hope it isn't anything fatal.   I have two teeth that are killing me. I had read in a book from Ellen, (one of tommy's bosses) that pure peppermint oil is good for healing. A couple of weeks ago, Tommy started using it on his bad tooth, it no longer bothers him. So yesterday, I took the plunge and started using it. It is rather shocking that it works. I am not a "essential oil" kind of person. But this stuff works. I'll do anything to stay out of a dentist chair.   I am trying very very hard to get out of this funk. Today has not been a good day. Yes, I did get to see The Passion of the Christ, but other than that, I have been down, deep down, all day. I have had to fight all day to keep from just curling up in a ball in the bed with the lights out and the covers over my head. I actually did go to bed for about 3 hours this morning. But I have fought all day long to stay up. I am trying to last until 11pm. Then I will feel like it is ok to go to bed. I am just emotionally exhausted.   Renee asked me today to think about going to chapel hill with her. I would love to go. Absolutely love it. I feel like I need it too. But I'm not sure how Tommy will react. I'm going to pray about it, before talking to him. He of all people knows that Savannah brings me joy. No matter how down I am, all she has to do is say Haaayyyy when she walks in the door, and my spirits lift. She is just a little angel God has given us to brighten our days. Especially Aunt Gee's day.  I need to go to bed. I don't think I will make it to 11pm. Maybe I can just go lay down and watch TV until 11, and then sleep, would that count?

      I am still trying to gather my thoughts.  It was the most amazing film I have ever seen.  Seriously.   I wound up going with just Tj and Casey, mom got sick and daddy wants to see it with her, so he stayed home.  The boys handled it well, they turned their heads when parts got too rough for them.  And during the whipping scene, I could hear both of them gasping with each strike.  It was definitly eye opening.    I bawled my eyes out the entire time.  From the moment Judas betrayed him, until he bowed his head and gave up the ghost.  It really struck home when they showed Mary when he fell with the cross, remembering in her mind when he was a child and fell, how she comforted him and made it all better, and now seeing him on the ground under the weight of his cross, all she wanted was to make it all better.  That killed me.  I could just see that as one of my sons.    Liek others ahve mentioned, I couldn't move from my seat when it was over.  I had to sit and take all I had seen in.  I was so angry at the pharisees, I wanted to see them physically pay for what they had done, I was furious.  And even though I knew the outcome, and why he did it, I still found myself whispering to the Father, to please let him go, let the torture stop, let him save himself.  For I know that I am not worth it.  I am not worthy of all he has given for me.  My price was to high.    If you haven't seen this movie, go, as soon as possible.  Go.

      We just got thru watching  urlLink Blue Collar Comedy Tour , the DVD, let me tell you I have never laughed so much in my life.  It is hilarious.  And we watched it with all the boys.  I must say I am now a fan of Ron White.  He was so funny.  Of course, being from the south didn't help, and being quite redkneck my self, I could really identify with alot of the stories!lol.    Tommy tells me all the time that you just cant hide my redkneck, no matter how hard I try.  It is really obvious when you hear me speak.  I talked to a friend that I had met online, for the first time about a year ago, and her first words were " oh,,,,, your accent"  I give the words "southern drawl" a new meaning!  When we lived in Las Vegas, the people where I worked would make me  get on the public address system just to hear the customers laugh.  Yes, my drawl is that bad.  Most people don't think North Carolinians should have such accents, but I do.  I have even been told that my writing sounds southern!    I have to say thanks to Shara, of  urlLink Shara's ramblings .  Her site is great, and she has given me a lot of good ideas, and even shared html codes with me.  We have never met, just emailed for a couple of days and she has been extremely helpful.    I am hoping to add Renee's blog to my blog roll soon.  She is thinking of starting one, and I have been showing her  the neat stuff I have found.  So someday soon...  AHHHHH relief will be expanding, I have started a  urlLink homeschooling blog , just haven't done much with it yet.  I will get it up, and finished soon.    WE are going to see The Passion of the Christ tomorrow with Mom and Dad.  I am looking forward to it very much.  I am hoping and praying it will help deepen boht mine and Tommy's relationships with God.  Tj and Casey are going with us too.  WE figure it is probably to graphic for the other boys. Renee is babysitting.  Thanks Renee.

      After changing a few things and re-reading previous post, I realized I haven't said much about the boys.  SHAME ON ME!  I have 5 wonderful boys.  Yes, 5 of them.    Tj is the oldest, he will be 14 this Sunday.  Smart beyond his years, in more ways than one.  I grew up thinking boys were more immature than girls, but TJ isn't.  He is sooooooo mature.  Makes me very nervous.  5'11" tall, 200lbs, shaving, and doing high school work.  Sometimes talking to him is like talking to an adult.  He is very grounded for his age.  He sits in church service and actually pays attention, then wants to discuss the sermon on the way home.  Did I mention he is one great baseball player? A veyr powerful hittter, and really good pitcher.  Throws sidearm most of the time.  WOn MVP for his league the past two seasons.   He is , unfortunately he is missing the baseball season this year, our van is broke, so I can't get him there.  Casey is 12, he is 18months younger than TJ.  They are a world apart.  Casey is more hands on, he would rather be working in the yard than anything.  He has reflexes to die for and it shows on the baseball field.  Every year I have coaches begging me to let Casey be on their team.  Last year, he fell in the first practice of the year and broke his arm in two places.  Knocked him out of the whole season except for 3 games.  Then in all-stars, he fell on the last play of the last game and broke his wrist.  Same arm.  During all of this he started having heart problems.  He has suspected  urlLink Long QT syndrome  so we are having to learn how to help him.  He isn't restricted from activity though.  Which is a blessing for him.    Will is 10, typical middle child.  He is such a special boy.  Has the sweetest personality, innocent to a fault.  Where Tj and Casey are so mature, WIll is so childlike. Yes, I know he is a child, but he is just so innocent and un assuming, it is precious.  He is currently in Occupational Therepy for a learning disability he has.  He has problems getting information from his head to paper.  Ask him anything, he can answer you, tell him to write it down on paper, he freezes and can't do a thing.  He will always be my baby will.  Jamie is the 7 year old.  Where to start with Jamie, let's see people always comment on what a beautiful child he is.  And, he is.  He is also so shy, he has a hard time talking to us sometimes.  But yet, when  it is his turn to take the offering at church, and is asked to bless the offering, he always speaks up,and prays as loud as he can, and truly from the heart.  It brings tears to grown mens eyes when he prays.  Then there is Noah aka shuggie.  Because he has all the shuggies.  As the baby, he rules the roost.  And I mean rules.  He is a very loud, in your face kind of child.  But yet, has these sparkling eyes and smile that let you know he is the sweetest ball of trouble you will ever come across.  At 5 years old, he is small for his age, his 3 year old cousin is the same size as him, but he still calls her baby.  But he makes up for size in personality.  And is also a self proclaimed mama's boy.  Clings to me like glue.  Even asked permission to like a girl one day!  So there you have it, my observations of my boys.

      Oh I wanted to explain why I chose the baground and template I did.  I love the flower to the left.  It just really suits my mood most of the time.  Reminds me of life.  It is beautiful, fragile, and special.  We have to make the most of it with what God trusts us with.  It may not be what we think he should give us, but he knows us better than we ourselves do.  I have to remind my self of that a lot these days.

      I jsut got back from Sam's club with 25 lbs of sugar.  Tell me, how am I going to store 25 lbs of sugar?  I haven't got a clue!  But it won't last long.  WE are going thru 4-5 gallons of sweet tea a day.    I feel like I am talking to myself on here.  But it has been so helpful to just ramble on.  Which is basically what I do most of the time.  lol.  It has really helped me work thru this stuff with Tommy.  I mean it is the kind of stuff that you don't really want to discuss with anyone in person, but so need to get it off your chest.  I think God has really directed me to this blog.  Silly sounding I know, but when I started this thing, I was to the point of exploding with all the emotion and confusion going on in my head.  It has been a true release.

      Rainy day's and Monday's always get me down...The Carpenter's sure knew what they were talking about.  This is a rainy Monday here is NC.  Just one of those cuddle up with a good book by the fire days.  Too bad I dont' ahve a good book or a fire!   I have EJ and Savannah today. She has been soooo happy today.  That is a good sign.  Ej and the other boys got into huge trouble this morning.  THey awere all playing outside and they all went to the bus stop without me knowing.  Here they are up at the highway with Noah, Savannah, and Scrufty.  I let them have it when they got home.  SO I am making them stay inside and clean.  It would help if it wasn't raining now, the impact would be more.  Oh well.  Lori called and Seth is playing on a travel baseball team, just as a fill in player.  She said Casey could play with him if TOmmy would say yes.  I talked to him about it.  Still waiting for an answer.  I know it is killing Tj and Casey both because they are getting to play this year.  Oh I wish we could get the van fixed.  Its already been 6 months without it.    My blood sugar is messed up today, I keep getting the shakes.  I took a nap with Savannah this morning.  It helped for awhile, but now I have the shakes again.  I think I need to have a glucose test done.    TJ cleaned out the refridgerator last night.  He did really good.  Did it all byhimself without anyone asking too!  He used my Mr. Clean Eraser thingy.  Those things are amazing.  I mean they do stuff that a scrub brush and squirt stuff won't budge.  With hardly any effort too!    Mom and dad are taking Me, Tommy and TJ and Casey to see The Passion of The Christ Wednsday.  ALl my friends that have seen it have jsut been so taken with emotion.  I am looking forward to it, and dreading it at the same time.  I know I will cry, just thinking about what Christ did for me, ......

      Can you believe it?  I can't, Dale Jr won Atlanta today.  I am shocked.  I totally didn't expect him to win.  Way to go joonya!  His dad has the record for the most wins there, so I should have know he would be good there one day.  4 races into the season, and he has two wins, kenseth has the other two.  Do i smell a busch series rematch coming?     Duke got the 1 seed , but the nutty committee put Carolina in the same bracket as them.  Not a good thing.  I really don't want to see Duke and Carolina going at it before the final four.    Still in a good mood.  I am on a streak.  aaahhhhhh relief.

      believe it or not, the mood still lasts!  WHooohoooo 2 days in a row.  i am amazed.    Church this morning was fantastic.  The Holy Spirit was all over the place, it just felt so good to be there.  Daddy preached about he 7 Certainties of Christ.  I was just awesome.    When we got home from church, Shane and Bobby are here working on converting the bus to a motor coach.  They are going to start showing dogs, so they need it for their travels.  It is really cool looking, they have almost all of the inside torn out.  You wouldn't think there would be so much room inside a bus, but there is.   The race is boring today, when I left the living room, TOny Stewert was 5 seconds ahead of Kasey Kahne.  Half the field is a lap down, can't stand races that spread out.  They just aren't interesting.  So Tommy is switching between the race and the ACC championship game.  Duke is having a bit of trouble with Maryland.  Not good for my blue devils.  I have to tell you that GOd has blessed me with $40 today.  Now, to let you know how rough it has been, we only had $20 for groceries this week.  That is for 7 people 3 meals a day.  SO I went and got the absolute neccessary stuff.  Then today, I was headed to get 2 loaves of bread, I had $3.  Someone handed me $20 and told me to go get us something for lunch.  Then when I got home, Someone knocked on my door and gave me $20 more.  Isn't God amazing?  He promised he would take care of our needs, and he is doing so.  That was one of the certainties  Daddy preached on this morning.    I think I am going to go nap.  Sunday is always a good nap day.  And I am bored.  Napppppppyyyyy sounds really good.

      I am in a good mood.  Just wanted to throw that in here.  Good Mood, it has been a long time, with no depression, stress or any of the other things that bother me on a daily basis.  Cool.  The kids have been pretty good today with minimal bickering and fighting.  The great weather probably had something to do with it.  They played outside all day.    I am dying for some TGI Friday's onion rings.  I discovered them in the chips isle a couple of weeks ago at the grocery, and am totally addicted.  Them and Brach's Malted MIlk Balls.  unfrotunately, there is only one store in my whole county that carries the candy, and so far, only one that carries the chips.  Leave it to me to get addicted to something so hard to find.  T.  is in there playing the video game, he is trying to beat Tiger Woods golf.  He is at the next to last golfer, and it keeps kicking his butt.  Not good.  I would sit in there and watch, but get too cracked up at him when he gets sooooo mad at the game.  I mean he really takes it personal.  T shoots pool every Thurs.  at his boss' house.  He has only lost 3 times this year.  They are so serious about pool.  You should hear them, they even tried to get us (wives) to let them play on Christmas night.  Please... It is only a game.    N made me pinky promise him today.  Pinky promise, I havent' heard that one since grade school.  It was so cute.  J. has been running from the neighbor girl all day, "she want's to marry me mom, help"  W.  just informedme he is starving.  Too bad.  it is almost midnight.  C has been riding bikes all day, good thing too.  His heart hasnt' bothered him one time today.  TJ has actually been in a good mood today.  A rareity for him these days.  I willb e so glad when puberty subsides.  But then, there  are 4 more boys to go thru after him.  I could actually be dealing with 5 boys in puberty at the same time.  Oh please help me!Lol.

      It is a beautiful day outside, so why am I inside?  Who knows, I need to take a shower, and get some things done around the house.  But I am addicted to this machine I sit at right now.   Yesterday, somehow, Casey busted a can of paint, Noah knocked it over, and deep taupe paint went all over the place.  That isn't the bad part, the dog decided it would be fun to roll aorund in it!  That was funny.  Here he is, running thru the house, like his tail is on fire or something, covered in taupe paint.  On a pure black dog, taupe is not a good color.  He is flying from room to room, rubbing up against whatever he can trying to get the paint off.Pretty funny to watch.  So the boys had to get in the tub with him to get him cleaned off before he managed to  paint the whole house that color.     March madness starts this weekend.  The boys are already wanting me to make brackets for them to make their picks on, I told them they needed to wait until the picks were made! Sheesh, they are so impatient.  It is a yearly tradition around here for me to get the brackets ready and for us all to make our picks.  I never win.  But I love doing it.  My downfall is I am such ahuge Duke fan, I always put them to win the whole shebang.  lol.  Kind of like TJ and the Braves.  They can do no wrong according to him.  I mean they let Greg Maddox and Javy Lopez go, how smart can they be?  Maddox pitched yesterday for the Cubs, and struck out 8 in the first 3 innings.  Please, tell me, why do you get rid of a Cy Young winner that is still good?  Doesn't make good sense to me.  I am hoping to get to see the truck race today.  I love Steve Park.  I got very upset when DEI got rid of him, and then even more upset at RCR for not treating him properly.  I know he is damaged goods, but he can still drive.  He jsut needs them to all lay off him, the media needs to leave him alone, quit bugging him about his job security and let him concentrate on racing.  You can't win if you can't focus.    THe boys are all outside playing, it is sooooo gorgeous.  If the van was running, we would go to the park today.  THer eis this really cool park a couple of minutes drive from the house, at a small lake, and it is great to go sit and watch the kids play.  Especially near the water.  Very peaceful.  It is a bit more nerve wracking when you have a toddler that wants to play with the ducks. But still worth the trip.  TOmmy is doing pretty good.  Still having those dreams.  I wish those would go away.  It was a huge relief to get those bills taken care of yesterday.  I had been worried sick all week.  So to pay them, and look at the reciepts saying they were paid in full.  AHHHHHH relief......

      Well today is better, me and Tommyare talking again,and quite frankly we had sex last night.  It is amazing what a little mattress mambo will do for a relationship.  Put him in a good mood,and T in a good mood always put me in a good mood.  I have been reading other blogs alot lately.  It is really interesting to see who is thinking what, and what experiences they are having in life.  I read almost all of one womans blog last night,  urlLink Belle dejour .  She is a london call girl.  Man, what a life.  You know to her, it is so normal, so everyday.  And she still enjoys herself with her boyfriend.  I ya know what I mean.    Today I am paying bills.  Trying to keep things from being cut off (cable lights) and keep my backside out of jail.  (check fees from the messed up checking account)  So I will be all over the county and then some  today.    So much I canceled Will's OT appointment, due to a family emergency.  (hey, keeping me record clean and unblimished is a family emergency)  Too much driving to do to sit at OT for an hour doing nothing.  Tj is ticked off at his mama.  Oh well, what is new in the life of a 14 year old boy?  I asked him to do his chore for the day, shame on me, I should know that infringes on his rights as a teenager.

      Well, it is morning, and things aren't any better.  This morning Tommy told me everytime he sleeps, he sees me screwing someone else.  OF course his words were more colorful than mine.  But still you get the message.  I have never cheated on him, never, and I never will.  Man he is soooo ticked about the money.  If our marriage survives this, it will be stronger than strong.    A bit of joy though, I am keeping Savannah and EJ today.  She always makes me smile.  Even when she is grouchy, she makes me smile.  She couldn't understand this morning why uncle Tommy takes his medicine by mouth, she thought he should but it in his button.  Too funny.

      Wow, my first blog entry!  Whoohoo, does this mean I am finally with it?    WHy do a blog?  Well let's see, as the mom of 5 kids, a written journal just doesn't fit, I mean come on, the boys would find it, read it, show it to their dad, rip it to shreds, spill juice on it, let the dog eat it...you get the picture, this is much more feasible.   I am trying really hard to straighten out some messed I got myself into.  i have been fighting depression for over 6months now, and my meds aren't working well.  When I am depressed, I spend money.  Then I get depressed all over again because I spent too much money, and can't pay the bills.  This vicious cycle has been going on for a while now.    I finally sat Tommy down Sunday and explained it all to him.  Let's just say he wasnt' pleased.  SO now, I am trying to earn back his trust.  It is going to take a long, long, long long time.  All the bills are behind, I bounced checks, got credit cards behind his back.  What was I thinking?  I have no idea.  I mean honestly, I have no idea what was going thru my head all this time.    So now, I am trying to fight the depression even harder, gave all the money, check book, everything over to Tommy, and he is taking care of bills now.  In a way, it was a relief, but I hate that I couldn't handle it.  It jsut makes me seem like such a failure to him.    I really don't do most of the wife things well anyhow.  Mom things, I am great at, but    wife things, not.  I hate to clean house, hate doing laundry, love to cook though, but I get distracted and burn stuff easily.  So , I am really buckling down on myself to do better.  I have to, my marriage is at stake here.

      Due to the depressing nature of my posts recently, her eis one to lighten the mood.  About a week ago, i decided to shower, shave, and just generally get all cleaned up.  I decided to give my ummm, lower region a trim.  In doing so, I nicked myself.  Evidently it was a decent nic, considering the blood that came from it.    So when I got out of the shower, I asked Tommy to check it out for me, of course my face was pink tinged, and so was his.  We may have been married for 15 years, but still, somethings are just personal.    He is down there, checking me out, looking for where I cut myself, and I notice he is doing a particularly good job at it, looking in this crevase, that nook, getting looking everywhere, not in a sexual way at all.  I make some comment about him really checking me out, his head pops up all of the sudden and he half yells, half whispers "YOU GOT SOMETHING DOWN HERE!!!!!!!!"  I about died laughing.  Told him to describe it, of course, I have a yeast infection due to being on antibiotics for my teeth.  He had no clue what that thick white stuff was, and was pretty freaked out about it.  ALl evening long, I would break out in a chuckle, then he would too.  The kids would look at us like we were crazy, and we would laugh harder.

      Here we go again.  Tommy called me from work today to tell me that Capital One had called him at work.  SO as a result, he is getting his ONE week paid vacation in pay tomorrow, so we can send them $400 tomorrow.  NO, he will have to go an entire year without vacation.  Not that we could go anywhere, but the point of the matter is, he would be off a week, no gettingup early, just lazy days of doing nothing.  Now, we get nothing at all.    I honestly can't stand bill collectors.    SO, He is in the living room right now figuring out our bills, getting more and more tense and quieter and quieter towards me.  Thanks Matt Nelson, collection agent for capital one.  I really appreciate it.  Last night I thought we were going to the ER.  Tommy started having a horendous headache, chest pains, his heart rate was too fast, and he was dizzy, and nauseous.  Now, we have been thru this before, he has high blood pressure, and stopped taking his medicine a couple of weeks ago.  He also stopped taking his arythmia medicine.  We can't afford it.  So, I just knew he was either having a heart attack, or a stroke, one of the two.  His head kept hurting, waking him up at 4 am.  He went on to work, I called his doctor, they wanted him to go to the ER, he wouldn't, so they want to see him in the morning.  I have no idea whether or not he will go.    I have more stuff to rant about, but my heart is beating fast, I am getting upset, so I will stop ranting now.  Maybe later.

      I just checked my referrers list on my counter page, and I am getting hits from people who are googleing "who got kicked off American Idol"  How funny is that.    I find it weird when I google something and get my own blog.  Then, I get a bit nervous, I mean, what if someone who knows me finds my blog and reads it.  I have several family members and in-laws that are on the internet, what if they stumble on my blog.    PANICCCCCCCCC...  so for allyou people wanting to know, John Stevens lost tonight on AI.

      I have to say I agree with Simon on AI.    Which I do most fo the time anyhow, but he was dead on about John last night.  He has taken each and every hit like a man.  That is part of why I liked him.  That and his unusual style.  But as much as I liked him, he wasn't an American Idol.  I'm glad they finally ended the torture for him.  Each night during results, he looked so pained, and poor kid, couldn't dance his way out of a paper bag.  I do look forward to some record company signing him to a contract to sing maybe standars, or Harry Connick Jr type stuff, he would do good at that.    SO who's next, George huff, please, hopefully, no offense to all those Huff fans, I just can't stand to watch him, he has this goofy look on his face all the time.

      I was over reading Renee's blog, and she was talking about my messed up family.  Poor thing, she married into this nuthouse.    My parents are in their 80's.  They had 4 natural children, then in their late 40's the adopted me, then a few years later, they adopted a little boy, then a few years later, they adopted his half brother.  So that gave them 7 children.    Out of the 7, for some unknown reason, wait I take that back, I have an opinion on the reason, that I will get into later.  ANyhow, tha majority of caring for our parents is left up to me.  Every once in a while when something happens to one of them, then the older kids go into panic mode, come in and try to take over, making decisions and such.  But then, after a few days, they go back to their lives and I am stuck with whatever changes they made.    They are too caught up in their own lives to care about the fact that their mother is taking too much medication and has to be physically put into bed, helped from room to room, can't walk with out a walker, and even then falls alot.  COnsidering the fact that she weighs about 250lbs, this is no easy feat.    They are to caught up to realize our father had a stroke a couple of months ago.  And hasn't been doing well since.  HIs blood pressure is high, even though he is on meds for it, his blood sugar is high, and he is suffering from depression.  I tell them all these things, but they still go on with their lives.    I'm not complaining really, I love my parents. They so fit to take me out of a terrible situation,a nd bring me into a loving, caring, family, and show me that you don't have to be blood related to love unconditionally.    But, I can't do it all.  I have 5 kids that I homeschool.  My husband works during the day.  Mom and dad need someone to stay nights with them.  I do about once a week, when Mom is her worst,and dadd needs sleep.  My husband gets phone calls all times of night, to come help get my mom back in bed.  She gets out of bed to go potty, or just wander around, and then can't get back into bed.  Or she falls and can't get up.  My dad can't handle her by himself, so he calls my husband.  Why my husband, because none of his sons will come help without griping. My husband never complains about his interuptted sleep.  He just gets up, goes helps, and comes back home to bed.    My dad is getting worse, soon, he won't be able to drive, probably shouldn't be driving now, but he is holding out for when my oldest gets his driver's permit next year and can drive his papaw around.  TOmmy and I try to make sure he doesn't drive at night, or in the rain, or bad weather.    I'm to the point where I know I have to do something.  Plain and simple.  I can't put them in a nursing home, it would be the last straw for them, they would die.  I have to come up with something a feasible plan that I can do.  Tommy, myself, and our boys will have to do this ourselves.  We cant' count on anything coming from the rest of my brothers and sisters.  It is a true shame.

      I got to sleep in this morning.  It was so nice.  Of course the phone rung 5 million times, but we didn't answer.  It was all from bill collectors.  They are so relentless.  Oh well, thank the good lord for caller ID.

      I'm back, I forgot to post about American Idol.  I know one thing, they won't be good salsa singers!!!lol.  NO seriously, thsi wasn't the night for outstanding performances.  John Stevens has to go this week.  Just has too.  I know all the teeny bopper girls love him for some reason, but still, go on talent people, not on who is the cutest.  I mean think about it, John Stevens as the American Idol.  I just can't picture it.  Not even close.   I'm working on the Dublin Mudslide ice cream again.  See, I nurse my ben and Jerry's, I don't get it very often, so I spread it out over days at a time.  Just a bite or two a night.  Just enough to satisfy my craving for it.    Tommy isn't feeling well today.  He went off his blood pressure meds, and I  think it is catching up to him. We can't afford them right now, in a couple of weeks we can get it filled, but not right now.  I asked the doc for some samples, but he didn't ahve any.    I'm doing ok.  I have been trying to limit my computer time.  Mainly so I don't dwell on things too much.  I can get lost in reading blogs,and before I know it, it has been 2-3 hours since I sat down and started reading.  So I am really forcing myself to limit blog hopping.  I love reading blogs.  They are so addicting.  I had a funny story to tell about what happened last night to me and Tommy, but it is a little bit emarassing, so I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.  Not even blog it.  But it was hilarious at the time. One of those things that you keep chuckling aobut hours after it happens.  Maybe one day down the road...

           Random Thoughts for the Day   BBQ pork ribs always make me sick, so why do I eat them?  My hubby's lab work from the doc came back, too many things were abnormal.  Noah is such a mama's boy  Jamie is too.  I am going to miss talking to Renee everyday while she is on vacation.  I need a vacation.  Bill collectors are heartless.  I could never be a bill collector.  Whoever invented chocolate needs to be enshrined.  I could use a Hershey's plain milk chocolate bar right now.

      Tried out the new razor, not sure it is worth 8 bucks.  Seriously, I don't feel like I got a close enough shave.  I did like the stuff it left on my skin afterwards though.  Felt much better than the usual prickly feeling I get after shaving.  I have accomplished absolutely nothing today, nada, zero, zilch.    It rained last night, all night, we slept with the windows open so we could hear.  It was one of those steady, rains, not to hard, not to soft, just enough to make you sleepy.  I love spring rains like that.  They are so refreshing and renewing.  Especially after dark.  I love rain after sunset.  I wish I had a porch to sit on and just take in all the sounds and smells that come with a spring rain.

      Have you seen those new razors for women, call  urlLink Intuition? In yesterdays paper there was a coupon for a FREE one!  This this is $8.  I got it for free.  It even comes in cucumber/melon scent.  Now if I only needed to shave my legs!lol.  Our weekend went pretty good.  Tommy was in a good mood all weekend.  No signs of depression, or of him getting any worse.  He seemed to be a little better.    The race yesterday ended very badly.  It was one of those that makes me want to write  urlLink NASCAR   a letter.  It ended under caution, which frankly lasted too long.  The fans at the track were very upset, throwing their beer cans and water bottles all over the place.  So it wasnt' just me and my opinion.  I am a urlLink  Dale Jr.   fan, so I was of course upset that he didnt' win.  They have got to do something about the restting the field when the flag waves.  Most of the time, the drivers can't see the flag, so they have to go by the lights, well, when junya passed the lights closest to him, he was in front of Gordan,and the lights weren't on.  But somehow,the officials put him in second.  HMMMMMM, I don't se how the 24 bunch could be happy about that win, yes, I know he gets all the money, but still who wants to win under those circumstances.  I mean restart the race and let them have a one lap shoot out.  I know it can be dangerous, but it was Talledega, just getting in a car at Talledega is dangerous.    Ok, off my NASCAR soapbox now.  If you didn't know, I watch almost all sports with my men.  Being the only female in the house, it is a good thing I like sports.  NASCAR and baseball are my favorites.  The only thing I don't like, is NBA basketball.  I can't stand it.  Honestly, can't stand it.    Before I got married and had so many boys, I used to love those lifetime movies, now, I skip over th elifetime channel!  I lost my sappiness. Probably because I am an easy crier.  Yes, I cry at anything, and everything, those old phone commercials would kill me.  Now, I cry at the end of cartoon movies.  I cried at the end of Cheaper by the Dozen.  I cry every time I watch How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days.  I still cry when soemone mentions Dale Earnhardt Sr.  I was his hugest fan, and will cry if you start talking about him.    SO, I don't watch sappy movies.  I can't,  I have to have some dignity in this house.  So, I watch sports.  I don't usually cry at sports.  Although I did cry when  urlLink Phil Mickelson  won the Masters.  BUt then so did most everyone else.  He deserved it, many years ago.

      I am about to break into my favorite Ben and Jerry's ice cream, Dublin Mudslide.  MMMMMMMMM.  I just watched the headlines of the local news.  The top story was about some people from a church I thinkin Kansas that came to our sity to protest at 5 different churches against homosexuality.    First let me say two things, I do not agree with the gay lifestyle.  I do believe it is sin.    Second, I don't judge anyone living a gay lifestyle.  My brother is gay, living with his partner, for over a year now.  Both of them are HIV positive, and they take very good care of each other.  In fact, Bobby has been the best thing for my brother.  He has really made him grow up and see that the world doesn't owe him anything.  That it is his job to make the world a better place.  Shane knows that I don't agree with his lifestyle choice, but he also knows that I love him very much. He is my younger brother.  No matter what he does, nothing can change the fact that I love him.  NOthing.    That is how I feel God is towards us.  He loves us. period.  NO matter what we do, no matter how we sin, from the tiniest white lie, to adultry, to murder.  They are all the same size in God's eyes.  And it doesn't change one bit of his love for us.  He loves us, not our sin, he hates our sin, but he loves us.    Think of your child, when it is small, say a 3 year old.  You have a 3 year old that knows not to play in your make up, but she does anywhere, and she gets your foundation all over the brand new carpet, paints her finger nails on yournew comforter and ruins it.  DO you hate her for it???? I think not.  You may not like what she has done, but you don't hate her for it, you don't shun her for ever for it.  You lovingly rebuke her, let her know she has done wrong and then, give her a little hug, just to let her know you will always love her no matter what.  That is how God is with ALL of us.  That is the point those people who are standing outside of these 5 churches are missing.  You can yell at someone and tell them how wrong they are, that they are going to hell, and expect to change their minds.  All you are doing is showing them what they don't want.  And by doing this, you drive them further and further away from God.  Away from knowing a true, unconditional love from their Father in Heaven.    I wish those protesters could see this.  I wish they could see the damage they are doing.  I wish they could see how repulsive it is to see a 7 year old yelling at people telling them they are going to hell.  7 years old.    My kids know their uncle Shane likes boys.  That is all they really know.  Except for my oldest who knows more.  But my younger ones, don't grasp the jest of his relationship with Bobby.  They still tease him about getting married and having kids for them to play with.  They are innocent.  Innocent and they love their uncle Shane.  He loves them back.  Just like God.

      We just got thru watching CHeaper by the Dozen.   I want more kids.   I have always wanted either 6 or 8, but we stopped at 5, not really thinking it thru.    I have a friend who is pregnant with number 14, her house seems like such a happy place.  I want one more baby.  I feel like I have a child, that was supposed to be mine, that is just waiting out there somewhere for me.  Boy, girl, it doesnt' matter.    I want     one      more     child.

      This stinks, I had an update on Tommy ready to hit publish, and then I leaned over the keyboard, hit some buttons, and everything went blank!!!!!  Things are better.  He told me he is tired of living life the way it is now, finances are a mess, very stressful.  SO that helped me alot.  I told him how guilty I feel over putting him thrugh this with all my screw ups in the check book, and bouncing all those checks.  I cried.  He hates it when I cry.  But we talked for a few mintues, so that helped.  Will, my 10 yr old, walked into my parents house today, " IQUIT!!!! It is too hot, and I am too tired, I quit my job!"  His job? walking their dog once a day.  I think he will be the child that never leaves home.

      Its Friday, Tommy had his normal 4 month check up this morning.  He came home very upset, and scared me.  I am aworrie about my husband now.  He told me today that he was tired of living life.  That yesterday, he had actually prayed for God to take him on out, because he was fed up and didn't want to live anymore.  This scares me.  I know in my heart that Tommy wouldn't hurt himself, but I also know what a hold depression can have on a person.  I went to Tommy's dr's office, and talked with the nurse, then the doc himself.  He took time out of his busy day to talk to me.  Of course, he wants to see Tommy again and talk to him face to face, so I made him an appointment for Monday morning.  Then, I told Tommy what I did, and he told me to cancel the appointment, that he wasn't going to go talk about his pshycie.  So now what do  I do????????  All I can do is pray and watch him closely.  He needs medication, buy he refuses to go to the doctor, he refuses to talk to anyone about his troubles, so that leaves me with my hands tied.

      1am, what am I doing up at 1 am, I'm not a college student, a teenager, I am a mom.  I have to get up with my hubby, I have kids to take care of, I can not stay up all night.  Tell that to my left ovary.  It isn't listening to me.  It is screaming at me like a baby when you take its bottle away.  Or as my 14 yr old just said, a banchee that just got kicked in the balls.  Huh?  Anyhow, I hurt, can't sleep, so of course, I am on here.  What else is there to do at 1am??????? That is legal and perfectly acceptable for a married woman who loves her hubby that is.  Just sent the 14 yr old back to bed.  He is such a night owl.    I know Tommy had other plans for keeping me up tonight, but my ovary is screaming.  It hasn't screamed like this in several months, not since I started on my meds for  urlLink PCOS.   At that time, I had co many cysts on my ovaries they couldn't even count them.  I would hate to see them now, with as bad as I hurt.    Tommy lost tonight to his boss at pool.  This was the first time in almost 6 weeks they have played each other.  This competition started 3 years ago.  TOmmy goes over to R's house every thursday night, and the play the best of 21 games.  They keep tally all year long, and crown the champion at he end of the year.  Tommy was last year's champ.  Them missing 6 weeks in a row is huge.  They haven't missed more than one week at a time the entire 3 years.  IF they can't make it on thursday, it gets rescheduled for another night.  They take this stuff seriously.  Even at work, you walk in on Friday morning, the first words out of everyone's mouth is "who won last night?"  Unbelievable.

      When I kept telling Tommy, "I want a baby" after each of our children turned a year old, why didn't someone smack me, tell me that those precious little bundles of joy would grow up to be smart mouthed, moody, bigger than their mama teenagers one day????????  Huh, tell me, why didn't I get smacked??????  TJ, my first born, the love of my life, the one who made me want more and more just like him, woke up mad at the world today.  These days, that is normal.  I asked him at some point this morning, to make his bed.  30 seconds later, he is in the office, "why are you so mad at me?" "why do you keep yelling at me????" I am at a total loss for words, which is a pretty amazing feat in itself.  So, basically I jsut told him he needed to go to another room, we were not having thathat conversation.  OF course, by lunch time, he had apologized.  After replaying the morning back in his head, he saw he was WAAAYYYYYY out of line.   Casey is well on the moody trail himself.  He refused to come back from my parents house with TJ today, he was mad at me for making him do his chores.  This is his normal, daily chore, that he knows each and every day he has to do.  But today, me reminding him to do it, jsut was what pushed him right over the edge.  Oh well, he came home about an hour later, all happy and friendly again.  I'm telling you, girls, be glad you have PMS, this stuff the boys go thru, just doesn't stop, it is one huge flight up the elevator of testosterone that doesn't come back down until they are 20!!!!  You know, when TJ first hit puberty, his pedatrician, a female, mom of 4 kids herself, told me that when her son was 14, she told him to his face "Son, if I could sell you, I would."  I now see her point.

        Random thoughts of the day  why does your hair do so much better when it hasn't been washed?  How do you wake up so totally, completely mad at the world?  Maybe I should ask my son, since he does it so often.  Acne does not stop when  you are an adult.  I actually like Blues Clues.  I can't stand Barney.  Listening to my Mellow mix, daniel Beddingfield's "if you're not the one" is playing right now.  The Eagles are THE best group/band EVER.  Matthew McConaughey kills me with that slow Texas drawl.  shivers, tons of shivers.  Selma Hayek does the same thing for dear sweet hubby.  Any woman over the age of 16 does so for my oldest son.    glad the other boys don't react like that, yet.  my bedroom looks so empty without the matress in it.  Makes cleaning it so much easier.  I'm rambling now.

      Tommy is a fx trader in his spare time.  FX trading is lind of like trading with the stock market, but it is with foreign exchange-different currencies instead of stocks.  So he has to watch the charts all the time for the currency he is trading in.    To do this, he has been sleeping on the couch in the living room, where he can set his laptop up and watch the stuff during the night, when it does a lot of trading.   For the past two nights, we have moved our mattress into the living room floor so we could sleep together instead of in different rooms.  I am so glad we have.  It is a hassle as far as making the bed every night, and then having to clean everything up every morning, a King size mattress is not easy to move.  But, I would rather deal with the hassles than sleep in two different rooms.  Especially with the stress we have been under.

      I have been reading  urlLink life at TJ's Place   for a week or so now.  The guy Kevin is a manager at a Gentleman's Club aka strip bar.  He really has a way with words, and makes the mundane seem so extraordinary.  But then I doubt that life at a strip club could be to mundane.  Shame he's a fightin Illini fan.  Oh well, the world would be a dull place to be if we all loved Duke!

      I just have to say I was totally and completely shocked by tonights American Idol.  Why on earth was Jennifer Hudson voted off???????  You could tell the other contestants were shocked as well.  I honestly thought George Huff was going to bawl his eyes out.  I mean it was bad.    And how on earth did Latonya and Fantasia get in the bottom 3 as well?  That was just bad.  If one of those two don't win, I will never watch the show again.  The producers need to do something about the voting system, that is all there is to it.

      Did you know pure peppermint oil is great for headaches?  It is, and really does wonders on toothaches too.  That's why I'm minty today!  I put peppermintoil on my head and neck to help with the pain.  TJ got his ego crushed today.  He was playing basketball with his brothers and cousin went up for a shot, and Casey blocked it.  IT just so happened that the nieghbor girl, Amber was walking by, and she laughed.  TJ has a huge crush on her, she is 16, built and cute.  TO a 14 yr old boy, that is the total package.   I had to stay with mom and dad last night.  Mom took her night time meds and didn't go straight to bed, fell asleep in her chair, and was sliding out of it, we couldn't get her awake.  So me andTommy went up and got her up, dressed and in the bed.  I stayed so if she got up during the night I could help her.  Poor Daddy, he was so worrried about her.  I don't blame him, she didn't wake up until arount 10 am.  She ahs been ok today though.  While I was at their house, NOah asked Tommy if he could still sleep with us until he was as big as Casey!  It was so sweet. Tommy told him he could sleep with us as long as he wants to.  I knwo that sometime in the next year, he will decided he is big and brave enough to venture out into his own bed.  So I will take what I can get now.

      Have you ever noticed how hard it is to have a conversation with a pubecent boy?  Anything you say, can and will be held against you, taken in the wrong context, and in some way, shape or form, turned into something sexual.  Background, I have a 14 yr old and a 12 yr old.  For some reason, watching television and using expressions are off limits.    Example: my husband and I were watching American Idol, my husband smiled when one of the girls hit her notes,  to my sons, they saw "dad thinks she's hot"  I saw " yep, she did good"  Example:  Hubby and I talking while children are in another room, 14 yr old walks in "what? what were you saying about me?????"   Example: hubby hugs me and kisses me for no reason.  "Oh man, stop it, stop it, don't do that" comes from BOTH the 12 yr old and the 14 yr old.  "don't you two have enough entertainment"   I think scientist should one day try to explain the phenomenon.  I would pay good money to know hwo it is you are supposed to act and talk around this children.     On another note, weren't the women fantastic on American Idol tonight?????  They just keep getting better and better.  Even Jasmine did good tonight.  Diana just needs to put feeling in.  Personally, I thought Red John did better tonight than he has in the past few weeks.  He seemed to feel more at home with the Barry Manilow songs.   still don't like George Huff.

The buttons for these are over by the  tag board.    Other than that, I haven't done much at all today, but read blogs.  I love reading other's blogs, getting a peak into their inner most thoughts.  Taking a glimpse into what makes them tick.  It is like voyerism, but with no pics most of the time!  But then, I am guessing that who ever reads my blog is the same way!!!!!

      I am a thief!  Jsut wanted to get that out there, look to the left side of the page, just above the tag board...See the little cartoon hyper chick??????? I stole her from Renee's site.  Yep, I did it, I admit it.  It was me.  There, I confessed, now take me away to the big soft room with all the foam and rubber on the walls.    We jsut watched Something's Got to Give.  It is good.  Even Tommy liked it.   I could have done without seeing Diane Keaton's boobs, but, it was still a good movie.  And I am probably in the minority, but I was really hoping she would end up with Keanu.  I would chose Keanu over Jack any day of the week.  I mean seriously, no contest.    I have been mean mommy today.  We worked hard on testing today in school, and when we do that, it gets me just a touch testy myself.  So when the boys got on my nerves too much, I (gasp) took away the Xbox!!!!!! YOu would have thought I commited the crime of the century.    I went for a ride with Renee' Savannah Noah, and Jamie and Will on the golf cart today.  It was so nice.  We went up this drive way that I hadn't been up, and there was this spot, where all the cattle were lowing, and the two hills met at a valley.  It was so peacefull.  Even sitting there with all those kids.  I could have sat there all day long.  I know that eventually the kids would have broken the trance, but hey, It would be nice while it lasted.    My lilac tree, bush, whatever it is, is blooming.  I love the smell of the lilacs.  I could sit all day by that tree and just inhale all the fragrance from the blooms.  There is just something about this time of year.  It is like getting  a new lease on life.  I jsut makes you...well...happy.

      I have to blog this conversation between my husband, my oldest who is 14, my second oldest who is 12, and myself.  This happened about an hour ago.    #1 son-did you know mercenary is the favorite sex position?  mom-huh? do you mean missionary?  #1-oh, yeah, I just remembered it wrong.  kow what the secodn favorite is?  mom-not sure I want to-----  #1-doggies style  mom(while blushing, stirring supper hoping to avoid this conversation) do you even know what that means?  #1-well, yeah (with that teenage, I know it all look and tone of voice)  #2 (shouting from another room) I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I KNOW...  mom blushing even more now, stammers for words while #2 continues  #2-that's when you go at it from behind.  Mom- go at what?????  #2 making a baby  mom-how do you make a baby?  #2 proceeds to tell me, pretty accurately, so i go talk to hubby, and ask him how he has missed this conversation, he of course was watching the basktball game.  This lead to more conversation between #1 and dad  #1 didn't you think we knew how to make babies?  mom- well the chick on friends who is pregnant didnt' know  #1-yeah, well, I know what she was talking about tooo  Dad-ok, then since you are so smart, what is the thing you never do, and the thing you only do once in a while?  #1 without flinching, blushing or anything, tells us.    Dad- well you know women normally don't like that stuff.    #1- yeah I know, don't worry mom, I don't expect it.  By the way "padlock" was number 3 on the list.      Now, can someone please explain to ME what padlock is??????? How can he know this and I can't?????? By the way , hubby would like to know also!

      I jsut talked to the nicest bill collector.  And I know my bill collectors!lol.  I explained our situation, and he said he would call me back in about 3 weeks to see how we are doing and see if we can make payment arrangements then.  Now tell me, if they can do that, why on earth do they call every day just to hear the same story??????? I thanked him for being nice.  Today has been a good day.  Even though he had reason to be upset today, TOmmy has been in a good mood today.  I slept all afternoon.  Literally, I fell asleep on the couch watching the race, and slept until 4:30.  It was so nice.    Rusty Wallace won the race!  I am so glad.  I used to be a huge Rusty fan until I married Tommy and he converted me to the Earnhardt camp.  And on top of that, Junya, (Dale jr. ) is leading the points race!  WhooHooo, go Junya!!!!!!  Random thoughts from today:  Noah maybe almost 6, but today he discovered Veggie Tales.  He loved them and now wants a back pack and socks.  SOCKS????? lol.  TJ is one big huge ball of hormones.    My husband looks good in royal blue.    Don't eat mcdonalds when taking Glucophage, it messes with the digestive system.  (kind of gross) you can have dry heaves while having diherrea.    Dry heaves of any kind are painful  Drinking 3 tall glasses of sweet tea makes you pee alot.  I'm obsessed with bodily functions right now.lol.

        You are Psalms.   some people think you never get discouraged, but the fact is, you know where to run.    Your prayers are open and honest because you realize that God already knows your heart, He's just waiting to hear you spill it.  And when you do, what starts out as heavy ends up becoming a song of praise.  you may struggle...and you often do...but each time you grow in your understanding of God's faithfulness.  You're just a song waiting to happen.     You are Psalms.    urlLink   Which book of the Bible are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      The boys are watching Rugrat's Gone Wild.  It is part of Jamie's birthday present.   SInce we couldn't buy him an actual present, we let him go rent 1 movie and 1 video game.  He got to pick both of them buy himself.  THen, when we have a bit to spare, we will get him a present.    He has had a good day.  First, the neighbor kids Benjamin and Nickolas came down, then Kenny came down, then EJ and Savannah came down.  IT was a blast having all those kids at the house. I love having all those kids around.    Stan came down for a few minutes bringing Savannah's milk to her.  We talked the boys into exploring the creek and the tunnel that goes under the highway.  When Tommy got home, he as less than pleased, he is afraid one of them will get snake bit.  I remember playing in that creek when ever I was little, same thing for Stan, him and my younger brothers used to STAY in that creek all summer long.  Their is grafitti on the walls of the tunnel to prove it.  Which our sons saw today.  Too funny, they came out, "so Stan, you all were just like us at our age?????"  Then we went up to papaw's house and I baked his cake, and made a pan of Ziti.  Jamie loves Ziti, which is strange, I use to have to bribe him to eat it, not he asked for it for his birthday dinner!  Renee, Savannah, Ej, Kenny all came and ate a bite of supper and cake with ice cream with Jamie.  Renee took some video for us, mainly for Savannah's sake, it was her first brithday party!!!!  All in all. it was a good day.  I cleaned a little today, not much, my teeth and jaw have been giving me a fit.  Today was the first day I HAD to take a pain pill during the day.  I normally save them for bed time so I can sleep.    Which reminds me, sleep, I need that.  I am going to bed.  I have to get all 6 boys up for showers int he morning.  Fun, fun, fun........

      Happy Birthday Jamie!!!!! Today is my son Jamie's 8th birthday.  He is so excited.  Right now he has a couple of friends down to play, and this evening we are oing up to my parents house for supper and cake & ice cream.  It is some what of a tradition.  Every birthday, we eat at papaw's house.    Jamie was by far my easiest birth.  He was the least painful, the simplest pregnancy, he breast fed the easiest.  His was also the shortest labor.    I went into labor around midnight.  After eating Pizza for supper.  I highly recommend eating pizza when you want to go into labor.  We went to the hospital, quickly because I had dreamed 3 times I had him in the car.  NOt normally superstitious, but between me and the doctor, we wanted to be safe.    I called Tammy, and Linda, Linda is a very close friend of the family, she was never able to have kids of her own, so I asked her to come into the delivery room with us.    Around 5am ,we realized we had forgotten the camcorder at home.  So Tammy and Linda went back to get it.  At 7 am, my doctor came in, and told me she was going off call, and another doc was coming in.  The doc coming in and I did not have a good relationship, in fact, I couldn't stand him.  So I told Dr.  Scott that the other doc was not delivering my baby.  Since I was only4 cm, it didnt' seem possible to have the baby before 8am.  At 7:30, Dr. Scott came in to check me one more time before leaving, and guess what????? I was 10 cm, and crowning.  Whoohoo, so, in her street clothes, with no protective stuff, she started delivering my baby, After two pushes, and 10 mnutes later, I was holding Jamies Edward Rogers, weighing in at 8lbs, 0oz, and 20 inches long.    A few minutes after the birth, Dr. Hill came in and remarked that I was sure serious when I said he wasn't delivering the baby.  I told him he got that right.  He laughed, the feeling was mutual.  We had problems the entire pregnancy, he didnt' think I should be having another child, so he made it well known.  He was happy that my baby was healthy and another boy though.   I have to say, Jamie's birth was amazing, it made me want another child right then.  I was ready to get pregnant all over again. This coming from a woman who had just given birth to her 4th child, all of which were boys.  lol.    Jamie is still my easiest child.  He is my shyest, most loving, and just all around a very special little boy.  He lightens my every day with his unending love.  When I need a pick me up, here he comes with one of his juice squeezing hugs.  He picks me flowers, tries to do all he can to help mom.  Tenderhearted to a fault.  So shy he stumbles even when talking to family, but yet, brave enough to pray in front of the entire church, and loud enough for all to hear.    I love you my baby Jamie.

      For some reason, when I link to my blog from another one, my last few posts aren't showing up.  I wonder why.    Ok, I was please with American Idol tonight.  Really glad that JPL went instead of Diana, Should have been red John, I bet he goes next week.  The apprentice, well, I was pulling for Quamie, I really wanted  him to win, but stupid Omarosa did him in.  He should have fired her, he should have done it, and enjoyed it.  She is such a mean spirited woman.  And lie, whoa, that woman can lie to you with sugar dripping off her tongue.    I'm bed bound.  I have to clean Tommy's work in the morning, and Have to get up early, so, it will be a rough day.  They are having a visit from someone with the Polaris company, so it has to be REALLY clean.

      Seema as if our streak of bad luck has now reached the dog.  Poor thing, his face is all swollen up like he got into something he is allergic too.  He can barely see.  I fell so sorry for him.  I bet he wishes he had different owners.lol  American Idol- what can I say, Jennifer, Fantasia, and LaTonya are amazing.  Those women are in a three way tie for first I do believe.  They all know how to feel the songs they are singing, and make you believe it.  I am getting tired of George Huff.  Just the look on his face all the time.  He jsut looks goofy.  And as much as I hate to say it because I love his voice, I think red head John needs to go.  I love his voice, but he isn't the American Idol.    The apprentice comes on tonight.  Whohooooo.    My teeth/jaw are feeling better today.  I have been resting it like they told me to.  And taking my tylenol every 4hours like they said.  Just untl the pain stops.  Casey is doing good with his arm.  Really good, he has full movement now.  So maybe the Orthopod was right? (go figure) lol.    My m.o.m. degree doesnt' cover broken bones and reading xrays.  Just changin diapers and wiping noses.

      I went to the doctor today! YEAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  Turns out, I don't have an abcessed tooth, I have TMJ.  I had kind of suspected I had it for a while now, but today the doctor confirmed it.  Gave me pain pills, antibiotics just incase the tooth is starting to abcess, and told me to get to a dentist.  Ok.  Casey's arm isn't broken.  HUH?????? Well, we went tohte orthopedic doctor yesterday, and he said it isnt' broken.  How it went from two doc's saying it was broken on Sun night, to not being broken on Tuesday, I have no clue.  But he took it out of the splint, and removed all restrictions on him, and he has been doing just fine.  I complains about it getting tired easily, but not hurting.    So I am just full of news today huh.  I was talking to Lori on the phone today, and we wer talking about houses and daddy selling ours, she said "shoot, tell them to give you $150,000 for it and go move into a new one."  I told her teh tax appraisal put this house and the land at $225,000.  She said "there is no way YOUR house is worth more than MINE"   lol.  She jsut couldn't get over it.   Gave Tommy a chuckle anyhow.  She lives in a well known subdivision, we live in a 50 year old house.  BUT, in the past few years all around our little old house these VERY high end subdivisions have been going in.  W are talking one just up the road with $500,000 houses in it.  So of course our land value is going up.  It has to.  lol.  I'm still smiling about that.   Tomorrow I get to keep EJ and Savannah, Vann has been bugging Renee wanting to see her "G" .  She needs her "G" fix.  I think EJ needs his cousin fix too.lol.  That is ok, "G" needs her EJ and Savannah fix too.

      It is raining.  We had a massive thunder storm last night.  And I do mean massive.  It kept waking me up.  It scared the dog so much he slept under the night stand in my room.  If you could see the night stand, and see the dog, you would know this was an amazing feat in itself.  lol.  I was waiting for lightening to hit the big pine trees behind my house.  Luckily it didn't.  I finally got Casey an appointment.  He goes at 2:15.  I am not very happy with these doctors.  I had to call back this morning, and they still didn't have him scheduled.  His elbow has been hurting him pretty bad.  I know it is because it isn't in the right position.    Does anyone know any cure alls for a tooth ache?  I have been putting peppermint oil on it, and it helps for a while.  I think it has abcessed.  Which isnt' a good thing.  It needs to be cut out, but we just can't afford it right now.  So I am trying to tough it out for a little while.  I tried to get in witht he doc myself today to get some antibiotics, but no luck.  I will try again tomorrow.  We rented Duplex last night.  It wasn't worth it.  I didn't laugh once.  Tommy actually got up and left the room.  It just wasn't funny.  I wanted Cheaper by the dozen, but they didn't have any copies available.   My brother, the snobby one, has a washer for me.  Shock of all shock, he OFFERED it to me.  Of course we were sitting in our parents living room at the time.  But he did offer.  It doesn't have any knobs.  But it works.  It also has a matching dryer.  Whoo hoo.  Now I jsut have to get a truck to go pick them up.  This brother is very well off, he could by me a new set and have them delivered if he chose too, but he won't choose to.  He wouldn't even feel it if he did.  I mean he bought his granddaughter a miniature Yorkshire Terrier recently.  Do you have any idea how much those things cost???????? They are very, very expensive.  SO a washer,dryer for his youngest sister wouldn't even phase him.  But at least he is giving me the old set that is sitting in the storage building.  (see I really am an optimist)  I actually had the best, most animated conversation with him yesterday than I have ever had in my life.  It was quite shocking, he was laughing, talking to me, even picking on TJ.  I was in total shock, I'm surprised they didn't have to hospitalize me for my shock!lol. Renee, you know I'm telling the truth.  This brother has honestly, ignored me my entire life.  Not jsut here and there, my ENITRE life.  His missed my wedding by a day, then didn't meet my husband until a year later.  Same thing with my kids.  THen just looked at them and said.  Yep.  and left.  He is one strange man.    I guess every family has their weirdos, mine is just a family of all weirdos!lol.  Except for me of course.  Ask Renee, I am the only relatively sane one there is.  ha,ha.

      I hate doctors.  There that is said.  I have spent most of the day trying to get Casey in with the orthopedic doctor.  His regular one can't see him because his schedule is full. So he referred him to another doc inthe same practice.    I started this process at 9:30am, at 3pm I still hadn't heard anything, I call them, they tell me they are waiting for the doctor to decide WHICH patient he will see WHEN.  What is there to decide.  Just schedule the patients.  So I tell her that Casey isnt' in a firm cast, he can move his arm, and he isnt' supposed to be able to move it.  IT is broke into the growth plate, and it can be danagerous if he moves it the wrong way.  We went thru this last year, then, he was in a cast so tight, so hard that he couldn't move his arm at all.  This time, they put him in a softer cast, thinking he would be getting in to the doctor today.    8pm, still no appointment.  They called around 5pm and had to put Tommy on hold, lost the call, and didn't call back.  So, I get to start this whole process in the morning.  I will not be as nice this time around.  I try to be understanding, but I've had it, this is my son's future here.  If that arm moves the wrong way,  he will have to have surgery to repair it.  We don't need to have surgery.  Not now.   R. is having a rough time right now.  I wish I could help her, relive some of her stress, but I can't.  All I can do is pray for her.  Which I do all the time.    ME and daddy went to sam's today.  He was in such a spunky mood.  I haven't seen him like that in a long long time.  He was so funny.  Me and Casey cracked up the entire time.  HEr eis this 84 year old man, and he was so funny.  I asked him if he took too much medication today.  LOl.

      HOw is my day after Easter???? I have been on the phone or waiting for the phone to ring all morning.  Trying to get Casey in with the Orthopidic doctor.  Evidently there has been a ruch of broken bones and our normal doc is all booked up.    So I am waiting for another doc to call now.  Pateintly, patiently waiting.   (singing now)dummm dee dumm dee dummmmmmm, waiting for the phone to ring, the phone to ring, the phone to ring......  ALl in the house are asleep.  Quiet is good.  Very good.    Tommy is off today for Easter.  I was really glad to here that.  In all the commotion, we didn't get any laundry done yesterday, and at 1am, I realized Tommy had no clothes for work done.  I thanked him so much when he told me he was off.  lol.  Silly I know, but I didn't want to be making a trip to mom and dad's at 6:30am to do laundry.  I wanted to sleep in.    Still haven't done the laundry.  Waiting for the phone to ring.  That is my mantra today, Waiting for the phone to ring.

      Well,  it is 12:08 am, and Casey has a broken right elbow.  IT took us forever to get thru the ER.  THey were packed.  I mean packed.  We were there for over 5 hours.  I am exhausted.  THe  funny (or not) thing is, Just over a year ago, Casey broke his left elbow in the exact same spot.  It is in the growth plate.  Which in growing bones is a tricky break to have.  It has to be treated very carefully.  So, here we go again.  to go on with the Easter story, we all enjoyed ourselves.  I was having a really not so good day.  Tommy's new baby niece was there, she is 5.5 months old.  And it was the first time we had seen her.  I had a major attack of baby blues.  Huge.  Everybody knows how I feel about babies.  THey were all expecting me to latch on to Afton and not let them near her.  She is a beautiful baby.  Red hair, light blue eyes, and full of life.  SO here I am, playing with her, willing the tears back.  Finally, I went into the house alone and just stood in there for a while to compose myself.  I guess it was noticable, Tommy asked me what was wrong, I told him, so he sat on the couch with me for a bit, I laid my head in his lap for a minute.  THen Lori came in, she told me I better perk up, then we talked for a few minutes.  She didn't realize I fought baby blues so bad.  I mean that is the original reason I had to go on anti depressants.  See, almost 4 years ago, my health was lousy, and the doctors advised me not to get pregnant again.  My family was against us having more kids, Tommy was scared he would lose me.  So I had my tubes tied.  The worst mistake I have ever made in my life.  We sat in the pre op room, bawling, both of us because we didn't want to do it.  THey had to sedate me before surgery because I was so distraught.  I did not want to do this.  But, I did.  Now, all this time later, I deal with the yearning for another child regularly.  I finally went tohe doc and got some "happy pills" because I was getting to the point I would look at a baby, in a magazine even, and bawll.   So seeing Afton hit me hard today.  BUt, I perked up, got over it, and enjoyed myself until Casey broke his elbow.    But we did enjoy ourselves.  For once Tommy wasn't obssessing about money.  The boys were having fun.  I was peaceful.  It was a good day.  Oh, and the Easter program at church...was literally amazing.  It was nothing but a skit, but the Holy Spirit was filling the church so much.  You could just feel it surrounding you.  Amazing.

      We have had a good day.  NOtice I said we.  We went over to Tommy's sister's house for a family get together over there, it was a lot of fun.  The boys played basketball against the men.  Which is too funny to watch.  THen we had a easter egg hunt for all the kids.    During the egg hunt, TJ and Casey were racing for a lone egg, and TJ tripped Casey, he landed on his elbow, and we think it jsut might be broken.  He broke the left elbow this time last year.  IT isn't a fun process.  He can't move it right now.  So we are watching it to see what it does.    Well, I am off to the hospital.  With me luck.

      It is very, very quiet around here.  No one is talking.  Tommy went to bed last night without telling any of us good night.  Just walked in the bed room and shut the door.  I am getting worried about him.  It is like yesterday he made some turning point from trying to giving up.    I am going to try to talk to him tonight.  I have thought about writing him a email and sending it to him.  He hates it when I cry, and I know I can't have this talk with him and not have major tears.    I feel like I need to reassure him that I love him, that I am determined to make it thru this rough patch, and that I need his help in getting thru.  If only one of us is working on our marriage, it isn't going to make it.  We both have to dig in and stand firm.    How am I doing? Well, I am worried, but I also have the ultimate comforter with me.  I know God is with me, I can feel him.  Even though the conversation between Tommy and my mom terrified me , I felt calm.  That scared me too.  But I know God was keeping his hand on me, letting me know he is in control.  I just have to be willing to accept whatever his will is.  That is the hard part.    I would never have dreamed in all my married life that I would be in this position today.  You know they say that two in three marriages end in divorce.  I would look couples I know, and say, well out of us three, we are the only ones who will make it.  Why, because we  both had God in our marriage and in our lives.    I know that God can take care of this, Tommy has to let him.  Tommy has to be willing to give himself over to God.  I just worry what it will take to get him to that point.

      What can I say, but, it jsut keeps getting better and better around here.  (that is dripping with sarcasm by the way)  I have had one of those busy run here and there days.  Had to take Mom to the doctor for a test, lasted 3 hours.  At least I only had NOah with me and no t all 5 boys.    We were running to late for me to take her home before picking Tommy up from work, so we went straight to his work after the doc.  Normally that isn't a bad thing.  Mom and TOmmy really like to pick on each other and enjoy each other's company.  Not today.  Tommy asked if I got all my tasks for the day accomplished, I told him no, and explained some stuff liek we got anew turn off notice, so instead of paying one bill, I paid the one that was going to be turned off.    He said something smart to me, mom heard him, so then she started talking to him about being thankful for what he has, he pretty much in these exact words told her "life sucks"  why should I be happy.  That isn't soemthing you say in front of my 80 year old mother.    SO during the 35 minute drive, they went back and forth with each other.  Her trying to get him to pray about it, or at least say he would pray about it, him telling her prayer doesnt' work for him any more, that God has forgotten him.  and so on.  By the tiem we got home, she was upset with him, he was upset with the world in general, mainly me, and my mom, and all I did was sit in the backseat not saying a word.    The bad thing is, out of my whole family, my parents are the only ones that Tommy actually gets along with.  Except for Renee and Stan.  And now, mom is upset, of course she told Dad as soon as we got home.  He was already a bit put off because all the help he has given us over the last few weeks, and Tommy hasn't told him thank you.    My parents don't understand that Tommy is in deep depression.  I mean deep.  He is slowly starting to think about going on meds.  Slowly being the key word.  SO they don't understand that he really doesn't see anything good right now.  All he sees is how bad off financially we are.    Jamie will be 8 on the 17th of this month, we arent' planning on being able to do anything for his birthday.  I will bake him a cake, but that is it.  TJ's birthday was 2 weeks ago, he didnt' get any presents either.  Noahs birthday is the end of May.  He will be 6.  SO I know that is bugging him, not being able to get the boys a birthday present.  Tj wants a $50 video game.  Jamie wants a fish tank with 22 fish in it.  lol.  Noah wants everything he sees!lol.  But there is no way, not for a while.  a long while.  The toilet broke.  NOw we have to turn it off at the cut off from the wall, or it will jst run and run all day and night.  Into the floor, out in the hall, water, water everywhere.  But at least we have a way to turn it off.    I dont' know, I am so tired of being definsive all the time, I am so tired of having to tell the boys no when they want something. I am so tired of wondering what kind of mood Tommy will be in when he gets home from work.  I am so tired of eating hamburger meat everynight for supper.  I am just tired period.

      one note about the Apprentice.  I loved it!!!!! I am so glad that BIll and Quami are going at it for the apprenticeship.  I really wanted Troy to win, but I am sooooo glad that NIck and Amy are out of it.  But I have to say that tonight, Omarosa really proved what a snake she is.  If quami loooses, it will be her fault for lying to him about the phone call.

      I havent' been on the computer much the past few days.  In fact, I have been avoiding it, trying to keep my mind and my body busy.    I had a short heart to heart with Tommy the other night at 4am.  basically, he asked me a question and I told him what I thought.  I had been waiting to tell him he needed to give control of his life and all  its problems to God.  So I finally got to.  I also told him he might see his doctor about some "happy " pills.  I know he his thinking about it.  ON this group board I belong to,  one of my closest friends from there, made a coment that has made half the board upset.  I feel for MJ so much.  I know she didn't mean for it to sound the way it came out.  YOu can't tell feeling in written words, you can't hear emotion.  BLess her heart.  I am praying for her.  I know that this has hurt her just as much as the others involved.    Renee is gone to Chapel Hill with Savannah.  They won't be back until last THursday night.  I miss having Savannah around.  Ej was supposed to stay with us but changed his mind the day before they left.  I wonder why.  I also wonde rif it is because of Tommy.  I really hope not.  I honestly do.    Mom and Dad got a dog today.  His name is Jake, he is a two year old Jack Russell Terrier.  He is adorable.  They lvoe him to death.  The girl who owned him just got divorced, and is working full time plus going to school and just doesnt' have the time to spend with him.  It broke her heart to give him up.

      Saturday night, the usual hectic stuff going on.  baths for the boys, washing clothes for church tomorrow, the usual.    Tommy sat down tonight to go over the bills, now he is sitting in the living room having chest pains.  I think he has stress attacks.  Not quite panic attacks, but along those lines.  HE used to ahve them a few years ago, then we started doing really good, and they stopped.  Now, he is worried over everything, and they are back.  Wishing Duke would win tonight.  I havent' been watching the game, mainly because they are sitting in there with the sound muted.  I can't stand to watach a ballgame with no announcers.  Drives me nuts.   My washer is smoking and smelling funny.  I think it has finally given up .    I really dread telling Tommy, just another thing for him to worry about.  Sheesh, when it rains, it pours.  I mean really, really pours.

      I can't believe I haven't posted about "The Apprentice" yet...Let me start by saying, I am not a fan of Trump, in no way shape or form.  But, I am addicted to this show.  Worse than American Idol.  and this week, with Troy getting fired, I have no one to root for anymore.  I LOVE Troy.  He was so funny and swwet on Leno tonight.  Made me say AWWWWWW when he was talking about his sister.  BLess his heart.  I wanted him to win sooooooo bad.  I think he did get fired because of his lack of a degree.  But he made up for it in savvy.  Now, who to root for? Probably Quami or Bill.  I used to like NIck and Amy both until they got so ga-ga, and I really think Amy is using NIck's attraction to her to keep him tied in knots.  So she can win.    Ok, with that out of my system, it is time for bed.

      It's friday again.  I spent all day long goign all over two counties paying bills.  But, at least I got them all done.    Tommy THINKS that if we keep using every dime he makes minus gas money, and 25 a week groceries, we can have every single bill caught up by the end of May.  While I am looking forward to being completely caught up, I'm not sure if I can keep going on 25 a week.  We ahve been depending heavily off my parents.  But, I do get food stamps this week, so I can stock up on food for a bout 2 weeks.  then it will be back to scrimping again .    I did splurge today and buy us lunch out.  We had been in the car all day long, going here and there, and were starved, so, I pulled thru the drive thru and fed us.  I t was so nice to sink my teeth into a juicy hamburger that someone else made.  lol.  One the way home from work, Tommy told me when this is all over HE is going out to eat.  THen he laughed and said notice I said just ME.  ha, ha.    My house is clean.  That is a huge statement considering the state of my mentality the past few weeks.  I tend to not clean when I am down.  BUt, me and the boys cleaned our you know what's off Thursday, and while I was gone today, the two oldest stayed home and basically just straightened.  It didnt' take much.  I mean even all my dishes are washed.  YOu can ask any one, that is a feat in itself.  I always have a pan or cookie sheet or something soaking, but not today, and not yesterday.   I washed them all, every single last peice.  I was so proud, now to only get my laundry caught up like that...

      We are going to do a benefit singing for Savannah and the expenses that come with a liver transplant.    It is exciting to start planning this.  It makes the transplant so much more real.    I talked to Renee, and it is ok for anyone who wants to link Savannah's page on their blog.  The more traffic we get on this, the better.  I will keep  posting updates, and I know Renee will keep Savannah's site updated as much as possible.  Or, you can always email me at arogers33@charter.net, I will be glad to answer any questions, forward prayers, anythign I can do.    As you can tell, this little girl is a very loved little girl.    I can honestly tell you, the first time Renee placed Savannah in my arms, she was 6 weeks old.  She stole my heart.  That precious little bundle just took a peice of my heart right then and there.  I have never loved a child, that wasn't my own, as much as I love Savannah.  She does that to everyone who meets her.  As Jenn said, she has this infectious smile, and It jsut steals your heart.    I will be so glad when she can eat and drink anything she wants.  And when her life can be normal.

           This is an post  that has been a long time coming for us.        This story is all about  my niece, Savannah.  She was born August 28, 2000, with a disease called Citrullinemia.  At the time she was the first and only living person in NC with this disease.  Now she is the oldest of 3 in this state.  Her parents are Stan and Renee Loftis, Stan is my sister Marlena's youngest son.  On May 6,1998, they had twin boys,  urlLink Zach and Luke , unfortunately  had this same disease, but it was unknown at the time.  Zach passed away on May 13, Luke on May 14.  It was a tough decision for Stan and Renee to have another child.  But with only a 25% chance of the child having the disease, they went ahead.  Prenatal testing told them midway thru pregnancy that Savannah did indeed have Citrullinemia.  But that didn't matter, they loved their unborn child no matter what and were willing to make the life sa! crifices to give her life, and love her for however long God let them.      They have been thru many ups and downs, more hospitalizations than you can count.  Savannah cannot have one bite of food, one sip of drink, without it being weighed and measured to the exact tenth of a gram.  They have a book listing protein counts in a lot of different foods.  If the food isn't listed, she can't have it.        Imagine being a child and not being able to eat an ice cream cone because the protein count is too high for your system.  Or not being able to eat a candy bar.  Going to a baseball game and not being able to taste a hot dog.  Savannah loves pizza, but can't have it.  She loves  urlLink peanut butter , but the special peanut butter her mom orders for her is $8.00 for a 16 oz jar.  Her all-time favorite I think is chocolate.  Did you know  one Hershey's kiss has .4 grams of protein.  When you are only allowed a total of 6 grams a day, you can't really afford to eat one Hershey's kiss.       Right now, Savannah will never be able to go to public school, or have children of her own.  This disease has total control of her life.  She has a portacath in her chest for easy access for lab work and IV meds which are often needed.  She has a stomach tube for the many feedings of special formula, and medication. Her main doctor is in Chapel Hill NC, her mom is on the phone almost on a daily basis either with the nurses, or doctors or nutrition specialist, you name it, they are conversing.  It is all a very stressful life.  Renee has to be "on" 24/7, she has had to educate herself on this disease, so she can educate the doctors around Savannah that don't have a clue what they are dealing with.  Simple things like going on vacation takes days to prepare the medicines, formulas, scales, foods, etc that have to g! o wherever Savannah goes.  They can't just decide to go spend the day at the park.  Every thing has to revolve around medication time tables.  every nuance about Savannah is watched, noted.  If she sleeps longer today than yesterday.  How many times has she stumbled today, has she played with anyone who is sick.  I don't know how many church services they have had to leave because someone there had a cold and that puts Savannah at risk.  A cold usually means a hospital stay.  A stomach virus could mean death.  This is not the life of a normal little girl. But she is still the most precious, lively, rambunctious, loving little girl you can ever meet.     The only cure for this disease is a liver transplant.  Next month, Savannah starts the work up for her liver transplant.  They found out last week that Renee is a match.  Her work up will begin as soon as possible after Savannah is cleared.        I am writing all of this to ask each of you to pray for them.  Stan only has one week of vacation left so Renee and Savannah are going to need a lot of support down in Chapel Hill.  All of us close to them are willing and ready to move there if we have too.  But we need you to pray.  This is a huge decision, and a huge life changing thing.  Please pray that God will see them thru this , and the outcome would be a healthy little girl, and a healthy mom to enjoy watching her daughter grow up.       Here is the link to  urlLink Savannah's page   I know Renee has put a  donation link on there.  It is going to take a lot of money for this to happen.  Her operation itself is covered by insurance, but insurance doesnt' cover motel bills,food,parking, gas for the 5 hour drive on way to the hospital from home,and sure doesn't cover the cost of Stan missing work to be with his wife and child.  I know anything anyone can donate will be much appreciated.  They are a one income family, with two children they are raising.  So Stan has to work no matter what is going on.        But please more than anything, pray, pray hard, and keep praying.

      especially me.  I went to buy groceries tonight, cheerful before I left.  Came home, empty handed and depressed.  What happened, long long long story.  I dont' care to repeat it.  NOW, I am still down.  I cna't seem to get over it.    Tomorrow is Noah's birthday.  He will be 6.  My baby, my youngest, will be 6.    Six is a big age.  They are no longer toddlers, preschoolers, kindergarteners, they are offically big boys.  I don't like it.  Not one bit.    My baby will be 6 when he wakes up tomorrow.  Something is very wrong with this picture.   I am never supposed to have a baby who is no longer a baby.  I had to shop in the younger boys deptartment for him today.  He is small for his age and can just now fit into a 4 regular instead of a 4T.    Too much is changing way too fast.  I know I have had 6 years to adjust to him being my last (actually 4 but who is counting.) But it still just doesn't feel right.

      Don't you just love the place.  They are cheaper on everything you want to buy, so you just have to buy all you need, whether you have the money or not.    Not a good thing.  I went to Wally's World today, to buy laundry stuff, toilitries, and cleaning stuff. I want some gardening stuff.  I want a tin watering can.  I want hanging baskets for my front porch, I want a flower garden.  And I want it now.  DID YOU HEAR ME?????? NOW!    Maybe next spring I can get my ducks in a row and get my stuff planted on time.  I am such a procrastinater.  A local radio station is doing a room makeover contest.  You send them pics of the room you want new furniture for and they pick the winner. I am entering our living room.  We have a couch, and chair.  That is it for seating.  There are 7 of us.  Do the math, it doesnt' fit.  Plus the couch and chair are both falling apart.  Literally, busting at the seams.  THe seams of the fabric are coming apart, you can see the innards of the couch.  (liek the word innards?  It's southern!)  I could have spent $500 in walmart very easily today.  We all need new clothes, shoes, linens, towels, and I am on a cleaning organizing spree.  I want everything to be organized to perfection.  But don't have the stuff I want to organize with.  So frustrating.

      one of those days where you feel totally not connected to your body.  This evening is like that.  I could fall asleep right here, right now.    I think it is because I haven't ate anything but candy today.  Yes, I know that is bad and I am sending a hugely horrible message to my kids.  But some days, you jsut dont' want food.  YOu want junk.  All the junk you can find.  Candy, chips, ice cream, you name it, you want it.  I have ate some dried fruits, trail mix type stuff today.  Not much, just wasn't as appetizing as the chocolate covered raisins were.

      Down to the wire, I was still stumped, didn't know who I wanted to win.  I still don't and Fantasia has already won!  They were both great contestants.  I still say Latoya should have won, and she proved it at the pre show, and during the idol performances tonight.  That girl can sing.  Plain and simple.  I was rooting for both Fantasia and Diana.  I felt Fantasia was the best of the two, BUT that She would get a record deal without the competition.  Diana, I think will do great, she will get a deal also.  So will Latoya and probably Jennifer Hudson.  The others I'm not to sure about.    I cried during most of the show.  I loved seeing Kelly Clarkson, She is my favorite Idol so far.  I can't help it, I love to hear her sing.    THen I turn the TV to CBS, just in time to hear Tim McGraw.  That is one sexy man.  I will leave it at that.    I also heard the "save a horse, ride a cowboy song" for the first time.  I laughed.    My spring cleaning spree is on.  I have thrown away so much stuff today.  I cleaned out my room, TJ's room and Casey's room.  Let me tell you, I threw everything that wasn't tied down away.  And I will be getting rid of lots more tomorrow.  Trust me.

      ALl the kids my boys know that are homeschoolers are going back to public school next year.    I have asked my boys if they want to go back,a nd they keep telling me no.  Even if it means no sports.  TJ said it wasn't worth it to him to go back.  They would put him back int he 9th grade which he did this year.  He wants to graduate early.  Casey said he doesn't like the teachers, the kids, none of it.    Will doesnt' care either way.  I don't know why my kids don't like school.  Or the school setting I should say.  They would rather be home.  They actually enjoy being with their parents and brothers.  Even if they do get on each other's nerve and drive me nuts, they want to be at home.   That is just fine with me.

      Ahhh, the joys of getting a good nights sleep.  Makes you not want to get out of bed!  My kids need the shrek 2 game for xbox.  They rented it this week,and I have got to listen to the 3 youngest laugh, giggle and snicker, while playing together.  I love those noises.  The two oldest hate it of course.  Casue if the youngest are playing it, then they know there is no way in the the world they are getting on the game to play their shoot em up bang bang games.  I like giggles much better than screams.    Tommy and I lay in bed a little while longer than  normal this morning listening to them play.  It was so cute.  The two youngest woke up first, and made a pact, "when Will wakes up, we have to get him in here"  Well, as soon as Will woke up, his two younger brothers were standing in the hall way "will come on, hurry we need you, we get to play the game"  Will jumpst straight out of bed and runs to the video game.  YOu could hear them getting all settled in and stuff, then the giggles came.  I love giggles.  Especially those innocent, first morning, not a care in the world, giggles.    Too bad, they will start puberty one day.  I better count the giggles while they last.

      I have to get this off my chest.    I went to my parents house this evening.  My dad was walking thru his living room, and had to catch the back of a chair to hold to to keep from falling.    He still refuses to go to the doctor.  After I left their house, I stopped at my sister's house, she was on the porch, with Savannah (her granddaughter) reading the local want ads.  I told her how worried I am about our parents and asked her opinion on what we could do.  She kept wondering aloud why the paper didn't run her ad, and kept reading it the whole time we were talking.  Pretty much all the feeback I got was   1-us moving in with them, or them moving in with us just would not work.  2-she would have to rent out her single wide, and her double wide (where she lvies now) and quit qork to be able to take care of our parents.  And she really doesnt' want to lose her home to stay with our parents.    3- our other sister is the one who SHOULD be taking care of our parents as she is the one in the best position too.    This is why I don't talk to my brothers and sisters about our parents.  This what I hear.    They are all so caught up in their own lives that no one wants to take the time to pay attention to the fact that our parents arent' going to be around much longer.  THey are having a raelly hard time, and need help.  They need support.    My sis mentioned getting them a nurse thru medicare, during the day, well, they don't need one during the day.  They need one at night.  Night time is when they need the most help, not day time.  Night time is when mom rambles thru the house, not knowing what she's doing, night is when she talks to people who arent' there, night is when she sees people and tries to chase young uns.  Not daytime.  She sleeps during the day.    None of my brothers and sisters see this, they are asleep in their beds, comfy, cozy, snoring away.  My dad wont' call them when he needs help.  He knows what the reaction will be.  He refuses to call them.    I dont' know what we are going to do, but I know the time is coming very fast that we will have to do soemthing.  It will be a necessity, not a choice.

      My oldest son has acne.  He inherited it from me.  I didn't get it until I had children, go figure.   I was helping him last night, put the cream on his face the doc had prescribed.  He complained, griped and generallly pouted at me the entire time.    After he stomped into the kitchen, I asked my husband, "did I do something wrong?"  "yep, you  helped him."  "14 year old boys don't want help from mommy"    So, it is me. The attitude, the remarks, the ongoing bad mood, is all my fault.  Thanks for clearing that up.  Now I have 4 more sons to look forward to.   I will be doing good if I live thru thier puberty.

      The first two performances of AMerican Idol tonight.  I was doing something I never, ever do.  I went to the grocery store alone.  TOtally and completely alone.  Do you know how often I am  that  alone?  Never.    It was nice.  I did see the final performances, honestly I think both girls had a bad case of nerves.  I don't know who will win.  Part of me thinks fantasia will, the other thinks diana will.  I don't even know who I would vote for.  That is why I didn't vote.    I guess we will see tomorow night.

      recuperating, catching up on sleep, pondering what to do, and just generally my brain is tired!  Casey had an appointment with the sports medicine doc today.  He can only guess he has tendonitis from over use.  Advised Casey to only pitch at 70% to see if it helps.  Thanks.    I kept Savannah this morning, she always brightens my day.  She is such a bundle of joy to be around.  Her and Noah played the "my Gee" game in the doc's office, so more times than not, I had both of them hanging around my neck screaming "my gee, my gee" People were cracking up.  The nurse thought she was mine.  Said her and Casey looked just alike.  HA! They aren't even blood related!    Casey also resembles my younger brother Michael. A lot, he reminds me so much of Michael at his age.  It is spooky. You have to remember I am adopted and am absolutly no relation to my parents none, nada, zip, zero, so when we are told my kids resemble this family member, or that family memeber.  We laugh. We laugh hard, all my life I have been told God must have given me a blood transfusion when my parents adopted me.  Soemtimes I think it is true.

      Last night was a bad night for my parents.  THey are both in their 80's, and in declining health.  My mom, has had health problems all her life, uses a walker now, and basically has to have someone with her at all times.    My dad has always been strong as an ox, but a couple of months ago, he had a stroke, didn't realize he was having one, too stubborn to go to the hospital.  And since then, he has been getting weaker.    Around 1:30am, he calls, he is having dzzy spells, and can't stand on his legs without falling,and mom is having a bad night.  He needs me to come stay with them.    Me and Tj go up, and dad can't lay down without falling.  Literally fallilng while in bed.  I don't understand how, but while already laying down he managed to fall ontop of mom, which considering her size and the fact her side of hte bed is 6 inches higher than his, was no small accomplishment.    Mom, had slept all day, and was wide awake, wondering from room to room, unable ot sleep.  Which in her fragility isn't good.  She weighs over 250 lbs, and is not a easy woman to get up when she falls.  She has no strength in her legs or upper body, and you have to literally pick her up and put her in a chair or in bed.  4:30am, she is still awake, dad is still awake, all sitting in the living room watching TV, mom is wanting someone to go to the drug store, not listening when we tell her it doesn't open for another 6 hours.    6 am, mom is still awake, dad is still awake, they make me go home.  They promise to go to bed and stay.    Tommy suggested tonight we ask my parents to move in with us.  We only life at the bottom of their driveway, in the house that I grew up in, their home for 50 years.  To me, it sounds good, but how to talk them into it.  They are so stubborn and independant.    I dont' really see any other option other than resigning myself to spending my nights sitting up with them.

      You will find, I never leave.    We haven't been on vacation since we married, 15 years ago.    Normally that doesn't bother me.  But sometimes, I yearn for a change of scenery.  To drive down roads I've never been.  To see sights my eyes don't recognize. To hear sounds that are new and unusual.  To find a spot, my spot, to sit, think and just be.    In my mind, that spot is on a beach, in a comfy chair, with my feet curled under me, holding my mug of cappichino, watching the sunset.  The breeze from the ocean is just enough to wisp my hair in my eyes, but I dont' care.  It is cool enough to have a sweater, but the mist hitting my face is a pleasure.    But that is not a vacation, that is serenity.    This is a different place than the place I have in my head by the lake.  This place is my escape for when the kids have been arguing all day, the phone has rung 20 times, with nothing but complaints, the laundry is piled up, the dishes are stinking in the sink, and I jsut don't have the energy to do anything about it.  The lake spot is for that.  For escaping from reality, sitting under a tree with a good book, listening to the nature around me.    The beach spot is my place for refuge, to be closer to God.  To sit and meditate and pray, and to be able to listen for that still small voice speaking to me.    Is this a need for vacation , or is this a need for quiet time with God.  I think the latter.

      Savannah is doing much much better, she will be home sometime today.  Her ammonia level was down to 59 I think Renee said, I am awful at remembering numbers.    Eric, the boys with the surveyors stake in his eye, is doing good.  He should have his second surgery in two weeks.    I am having a good morning.  Kind of.  I was going to go shower, but havne't any clean clothes to put on, so I am having to wait on laundry.   Our washer quit a couple of months ago, so we have to go to my parents house to wash clothes.  Which is fine, they live aobut 250 feet away.  So it isn't hard.  Just the fact that I forgot to do MY laundry this week.  Sheesh.

      I know alot of you who read my blog, also read renee's-Pieces of Me-, well her daughter Savannah is in the hospital today, and tonight.  Her ammonia when they checked it this morning was 605.  Normal is around 20-40 depending on which machine and which doctor you talk to.    Savannah has  urlLink Citrillinimia  It is extremely rare.  In fact Savannah was the first child in the state of NC to have it.  Now there are 3.  She is the oldest. Renee and Stan lost twin boys to this disease 6 years ago.  They were 14 and 15 days old.  If not for their deaths, Savannah wouldn't be here today.    As you know, she is very special little girl to me.  So I ask for you to all pray for her.

      I mentioned in the post below about Son #3 jabbering on about Shrek 2.    Son #3, is a special child.  I know you are thinking "all mom's say that about their kids"  And I do think all my boys are special.  This one is just more special.    All my boys were fast walkers, talkers, they did everything early.  Except #3, he never uttered a sound.  No coo's, goo's dada, nothing. The only noise we ever heard out of him was cry's that he didnt' do that often.  SO at age 22 months, he started speech therapy.  At that age, he uttered his first sound.  Until he was 4 years old, his speech was so un-inteligable (is that a word?) that only I could understand him.  Even Tommy had a hard time deciphering.    ONce he started talking,and people could understand him, and he realized this, it was on.  And has been on for 6 years since.  He tells everyone, "I couldn't talk for so long, I have lots to say, so I talk all the time now."    And he does.  It is near impossible to keep him quiet.  He remembers every detail of every movie, show, cartoon, he has ever watched.  And will be glad to tell you all those details, anytime the urge hits him.  Don't try to stop him, it does no good.  Jsut nod, uhhuh, yeah, right, really, that is so cool, at the appropriate times, and he is fine.  Until the silence.  Silence somes when he has asked your opinion of all he has just said.  Then you ahve to get creative.    I know you are all thinking "she ignores him?????" Bad mommy.  But sometimes it saves my sanity.  I only ignore when he is relating every detail of all 5 Star War movies in order, scene by scene, line by line, and even describing the background and props.  Not during importan conversations like how his day has gone, or what the latest trouble he is having with which ever brother is getting on his nerves.    YOu know, he may talk alot, but I love this quality about him.  It makes him special.

      We went to see Shrek 2 yesterday,a nd it was great.  My kids, all 5 of them, even the 14 year old who thinks he is grown loved it.  The shrek movies are even good movies for adults.  There were parts in it that were especially to make adults laugh, or just reminisce.  I really enjoyed it.    Before we went, my SIL calls and asks me if I am ready to walk out the door.  WEll, considering the fact I wasn't planning on leaving for another 45 minutes, I wasn't. She wanted me to bring the boys to CICI's pizza so she could buy them lunch.  I had just gotten out of the shower, and was putting my self tanning lotion on.  While talking to her, I forgot about the lotion.  I had put it on my legs, but not smoothed it out.  By the time the movie was over, I looked like a brown and white zebra.  except around the ankles, where I look like I haven't had a bath in months.  Did you know this stuff has to wear off?  This isn't a good thing.  TOmmy laughs every time he sees my legs.  I'm jsut glad I didn't wear shorts to the movie.    Ever get so filled with joy, you feel like crying?  I was that way yesterday.  I have no reason why, but I was.  Going to the store last night with son #3, he was jsut jabbering on  about the movie, and I looked at him, and almost cried, because I was so happy.

      Yay, Jasmine finally gotr voted out.  So who will win next week?????  I don't know, but I am pulling for Diana.  Fantasia will get signed by someone, somewhere, for a whole boat load of money.       I loved Tamyra's song Raindrops will fall.  It was so  beautiful.  She was really amazing tonight.   I have so much to catch up on, but need to get some sleep.  I will post a nice blog tomorrow, I promise.

      little by little, I am feeling better.    Thanks to EVERYONE who has sent me well wishes and prayers.  I needed them.    Tommy and the boys have taken very good care of me, they know that for mom to lay around all day in bed, she must be sick.  So they have cooked and everything.    My tonsils no longer feel like glof balls, just maybe those dime gum balls now.   IF it lets you know anything, I didnt' even talk to Renee' all day yesterday!  That is bad.    I watched American Idol tonight,a nd wasn't that impressed untilt he very last song.  Diana kicked butt on that song.  she made the change over and everything.  Brought me chill bumps and tears! And singing in front of CLive Davis..... I would be so nervous I wouldn't even get out a note. Talk about pressure.  I mean it is CLIVE DAVIS.  Do you know who he is???????   My predictions, Fantasia will be voted because the state of Hawaii will jam the phone lines again.  But she will be ok, She WILL get a record contract when it is over, just like LaToya will.  Jasmine needs to win, that is the only way she will get a contract.   My SIL is taking the boys to see Shrek 2 tomorrow, Tommy said if he knew that, he would have went to work today and been off tomorrow so he could see it too!  I am looking forward to it.  Shrek is a good movie.

      For soem reason, Saturday has turned into my work outside day.  I am a stay at home mom, so I could concievably work outside every day of the week.  But for some reason, I am drawn to work in the yard.    Growing up, I was never allowed to work in the yard.  I grew up in a old fashioned family where then man's work was outside and the woman's work was inside.  My dad didn't believe a woman should mow the yard, my mom couldn't tell you how to start a lawn mower much less actually do the yard.  Me, well, I love it.  I don't ever do it, I have five boys, they do the yard work.    But today, I have been weeding my flowers, and trying to decide what I want to do to my side yard, I want to make it a place of refuge, to go of the evening to sit, think, read, or just be.  I want a peaceful place, a place where the kids can play nearby, and I can grill when I want to.    So now, I am trying to figure out what kind of ground cover for the bank,and find some shrubs or flowers that thrive in shade.  I have to have flowers,  the more the better.    I am envious of Renee's flower garden.  When she gets her pond in, I will be jsut flat out covetous.  Then when she puts the fish is, I will call myself "Green"  with envy.  Who knows, maybe next summer, I can get a pond, with a waterfall, fishes, and a little fountain.

      What??????  urlLink LOCUSTS Aren't they just adorable.  Between the song they sing,a nd the crunching under the feet, what a joyous summer this will be.  No barfoot walks in the evening this summer.  Nope, go barefoot and all you will do is feel their shells crunching under your feet.    I saw the first one of the season today, it was on my tulips.  MY TULIPS.   Now if you know me well, then you know that you don't mess with me and tulips, they are my absolute favorite flower.  I have had a hard time with my tulips, this is the second year in a row they have grown up but now bloomed.  And now, they have cicadas.

      I have a friend, T.  that I have been friends with for at least 15 yrs now.  At one point, for many many years, we were inseperable.  we even had babies together.  Her oldest and my youngest were born 6 days apart.  I have actually had people tell me they were jealous because we had such a close bond, such a close friendship.    A couple of years ago, the unthinkable happened, and some stuff pulled us apart.  It has been a very rough couple of years for her, really rough.  I don't know how many times I have fallen asleep praying for her, and hurting for her.    She called me a few minutes ago.  We had a good conversation.  She seems to be getting life straightened out, she is in a good church, and is trying to make her marriage better, and is even going to homeschool her daughter next year.    I am happy for her.  Very happy for her.  I have worried about her for so long, it is such a relief to hear her almost happy.  To hear her making such positive plans for the future.    I think we both have had to do a lot of changing lately.  A lot of growing.  It ahs been hard to do.  Life lessons are never easy, and the ones I have been getting haven't been a walk in the park.  I know the ones she has been getting haven't either.    But, for now, I have my friend back.  We probably won't ever have that bond like we used to, but I know God has something more for us.  A different kind of friendship.  We just have to wait and see what that friendship is.

      I do, I really do.  It is so depressing, and hard to watch.    On our local news this morning, a local high school has approved random drug testing for all students next year.  I am all for getting rid of drugs, but is this legal?  It seems like they would have to get written permission from the parents of the minors first, and then with all the confidentiality stuff,  they wouldn't be able to tell anyone about the results.  So why do it in the first place?  Then the people who are blaming Runsfeld for the stuff that the untrained soldiers did.  I don't agree with what was done to the prisoners,but why blame Rumsfeld, the blame goes to the ones who did it,and their supervising officers.  Do you realize how many levels of rank and red tape you have to go thru to get to Rumsfeld?  He has enough on his mind, don't start prosecuting him for something that is thousands of mile away from him.  Plus there is the fact that the Iraqis are doing much cruler stuff to our men that they have hostage. Between the killings, torture and beheadings, on video no less, these aren't nice people.  I know we are supposed to be "above" that.  But are Americans forgetting why we are doing this to begin with?  Has everyone forgotten 9/11?  Have they forgotten what a man Hussein was, how he tortured his own people? That if he had be left alone, he would have just kept finaincing terrorist groups, and reaking havoc on the good guys?   That is all of my political rant.     I'm not normally political, but you know what? I watched the news this morning.

      The whole AI thing and the thing with Eric,and just life in general has me in one huge ball of walking, talking emotions.    I could scream, cry, and fight all at one time.    I stayed with mom tonight while Tommy took Daddy to the hospital to see Eric and pray for him.  I went out on their front deck,a nd just looked at the sky, the trees gently blowing in the wind, and  started talking to God.  I don't jsut talk to him very often.  Most of the time these days, I pray my nightly prayers and that is it.    But there on that deck, darkness all around me, I jsut felt so much closer to him, like I had his ear, his undivided attention,that no one else on earth was talking to him right then, it was just me and God.  I like that feeling.   THen, Will came creeping around the corner trying to scare me, Casey came from the other corner, and Noah came running out the door towards me all of them screaming AAAAHHHHHH like monsters.    so much for peace.    I did tell my mom that if I had a porch or deck like that, I would get up every morning, go sit on my porch and read my bible, talk to God and just enjoy being there.

      Ok, do all of you people who vote for Jasmine have sotton in your ears or something?  The girl can not sing.  Yes, she has a pleasant enough voice, but how, please tell me how, do you vote for her over Fantasia and Latoya????????  Latoya should have won, hands down, plain and simple, she IS the American Idol.  And you know what, when all this is over, she will be like Clay Aiken and will do much much better that the actual winner.    If Jasmine doesn't get kicked off next week, I am done, I won't watch AI again.  She doesn't deserve to be in the top 3, she shouldn't have been in the top 4, but that was ruined when Jennifer Hudson was voted off.    I can't believe it.

      Eric had surgery last night, to remove the thing from his eye.  It was one of those orange flags that surveyors use to mark with.  He will have to ahve surgery again in 2 weeks, and has lost approximatly 40% of the vision in that eye.  They are watching the eye very closely for infection, or he  could lose the eye.    Post more later, have to run and errand.

      I was completely blown away by Diana tonight.  She was awesome.   I have to change my final two now, to Latoya and Diana.  This week Jasmine is gone.  Her voice is just too weak,and she needs alot more life experience.    But, she did cry during the number thingy, so she may squeeze in on sympathy votes.    I actually voted tonight, twice.  There is a first time for anything.

      I knew it would happen I just expected it to wait a couple of days.  But Son #1 is sick.  Son #3 is complaining, and Son #5 is still running a temp.  Not as high as yesterday, but still 101-102 .    It was funny, when he first opened his eyes this morning, he popped up looks me straight in the eye, and says "Hey, I'm feeling pretty good today"  He literally opened his eyes and does this.  Must have been some good dreamin he was doing!  I am fighting a scratchy throat myself as hard as I can.  I hate being sick, but in the summer, puuulllleeeaaassseee, it jsut is not right to get sick in summer.  It is almost like breaking the laws of nature or something.

      My boys are HUGE HUGE Lord of the Rings fans.  I do mean huge.  I have actually had to break up arguements over who is the biggest hero, Aragorn or Legolas.  Personally I am an Aragorn fan.  Viggo is jsut too cute.  Orlando is too, but I digress...  Right now, my boys are in the kitchen in their best Aragorn voices saying "Syrup we need your thickinesssss"  After the line in the movie "legolas we need your bowwww"  Kids.    THey have even made up new characters for each other, combining Star Wars and LOTR.  Son #5, is an apprenctice that Gandolf is training ins wizardry.  How do you get star wars and LOTR together like that???? I don't know ask my kids.

      Son #5 is sick.  He has been running a temp of 103 F, and hte threw up earlier.  He is feeling better now, but that is just the Motrin talking.    Bless his heart.  It ahs been so long since we have had sickness in the house, I don't have a thermometer, no fever meds, nothing.  My kids are very rarely sick.  So this one has thrown us for a loop.  I had to borrow Motrin from Renee, and her thermometer, and she came down and tried to look down his throat with a flash light.    That is one  HUGE  advantage of homeschooling, the kids aren't exposed to all those germs, bringing them home and sharing the wealth with each other.  It is so nice!   BUT  the bad thing is, he was playing at Renee's all day with Savannah,and I am praying Savannah doesn't get it.  She has to be hospitalized if she gets a stomach bug.   AND  he was helping my brother and his friend this morning, they both have compromised immune systems.  I went out side and warned them when I got sick.  I hope they dont' get it either.  Especially B.  He is just now getting his T cells balanced out.    Upset stomach and the kid wants meatloaf!  He has bugged me all night for meatloaf.  I did cave and give him mashed potatoes at supper time.  They are his favorite food.  He kept them down.  I really think the vomitting spell came from the fever spiking so good.  Then taking in cold gatorade and medicine on an already hot stomach.

      I found out who the jerk was, it was someone I know playing a joke on me.  But it did make me aware of how open I am on this thing.  So, I will me making changes.  The photo album is gone.  I took it down last night.    The whole thing last night really upset me, and frankly, It opend my eyes to alot of things.  I had never given  much thought to putting myself out there so much on this blog.  I haven't really restrained much.  This world is a perverted place, and I know that, I just didn't give any thought to those perverts finding my blog.  I knwo it was jsut a friend playig a game last night, but what is to stop it from happening in the future?    I have seen alot of blogs lately with comments asking people to link to their blogs, then when you check out their blog, it is a some sicko.  I don't want that stuff connected to me.    IF I change blogs, I will ahve to figure out some way to let those of you I have made friends with know where I am .  I have grown to like our little community!lol.   I need to clarify somethings about my niece I was writing about yesterday.  I have prayed and prayed about it, and while I wouldn't turn her away, I don't want her as my child, I want her out of the situation she is in.  No child should live like that.  I know to her, it is normal, but she is really in a messed up place.  I know too much stuff about her parents, grandparents and the tension that is there all the way around.  She needs to be out.  Away from all the dysfunction and in a place where she can be nurtured and grow into a healthy, happy well adjusted person.  Unless some major changes happen, that won't happen where she is.    Well, enough of my emotional rollercoaster.  I am ready to get off, and have a great day.  It is beautiful, and I am thinking of working in the yard today.  I don't do that often.  But today looks like a good day to start.

      I am officially seraching for a new blog host.  The jerk who asked me that really stupid question has ruined it for me.   I can't believe whoever that was asked me that.    I have deleted the comment and banned the person, but still I don't want this person reading about my life, so I am switching blogs.  As soon as I find one I like.   To me, my blog is quite enjoyable.  I love blogging.  I guess the comment before jsut opened my eyes to what perverted idiots there are in this world.  And it also brought the realization that those same perverts are reading my blog.    Tommy was very upset about it.  HE found it first.  He was reading my blog, while I was working on templates, and IM'ed me wanting to know what was going on.  So thanks, whoever you are.  I really appreciate the life lesson.

      I have had a really good day.  I have been in good spirits, actually in a really great mood.  Tommy asked me what in the world I was so happy about!lol.    Until a little bit ago.  I was at my parents house, and my older sister came by with her boyfriends of forever, and her granddaughter.  I will attempt to make this short.    My older sis, S, had two sons, S and M, when S was 18 months old, she let my parents adopt him.  She was too young and irresponsible to keep him  When M was 5 years old, my parents adopted him.  HE had been drug around from place to place, and had literally called dozens of men "daddy" .  Now MIchael is a daddy himself.  He has 4 step kids and one daughter Savannah, she is 3 .  Not the same Savannah as renee, this is a different one.   M's wife is a lousey mother.  Plain and simple.  Her kids, cheat,steal, talk back,are constantly in trouble at school,and are basically brats that you don't want to be around. The oldest one is 10.  If that tells you anything.  I don't know how many times Children's services have investigated them.   Today, S had her Savannah with her,  she is the most adorable looking little girl you have ever seen.  But something is missing, there is a lack of sparkle in her eyes.  She has the sadest eyes.  This child has always evoked emotion in me.  She brings out sadness, pity, but most of all anger.  I want to hurt whoever hurts her.  I only see her maybe twice a year.  At the most, but I want that child.    When she was 3 months old, her parents asked if I would babysit for the weekend.  I did, they didn't send clothes that fit her, diapers or food.  One bottle is all they sent.  I had to borrow some clothes for her from Renee.    THey ahve no problem walking off and leaving her with people.  Even if they just met.  But the thing that horrifies me the most is they are talking about letting S have her.  I have seen the two together, and while S loves her, I don't doubt that, S doens't know how to be a mother.  She doens't know how to discipline with love.  ALl I have seen is forcful, loud discipline.  This child is cowed enough, she doesn't need anymore.    The other thing is S's boyfriend was once accused of child molestation, by M and one of his friends.  That is how my parents got M to begin with.  The charges were dropped or disappeared or something, but still the accusation was there.  M doesnt' remember any of it, but I know that her boyfriend is an evil man.  I know things he has made her do, and he is evil.  I can't stand the thoughts of this child living in that house.  But I have no proof of anything.  Just gut wrenching feelings and those don't stand up in court.    I hurt for this child.  I want to raise this child, show her love and teach her that she doens't have to fight to belong in a family.  I want to teach her that God loves her no matter what .  I want to teach her  that it is ok to cry, laugh, and just be a kid.  I want to fix her hair, paint her toe nails, and just be her mom.  Why, because she looks so lonely, so scared , and so lost.

      You know those days when you feel spent.  Just mentally spent.    I'm having one of those, and I don't really know why.  It is a gorgeous day, I took Tommy to work, then ran some errands and was fine.  Played outside with Savannah and the boys, watched a DVD.  BUt now, I feel the need of change.    How?  I know I'm not happy with my spiritual life.  I know I need to make some changes, like reading and praying more.  But right now, I know I need those things, I'm not sure I have the desire to do them.    I want a cigarette.  I quit 14 years ago when I found out I was pregnant with TJ.  cold turkey, I quit.  I started back after he was born, but then decided I was a moron for starting back and quit when he was 8 months old.  Havent' smoked one since.  Yeah for me.   This is bugging me, so I am gonna have to figure it out.  I just hope it doesn't take forever.

      Sparky is no longer with us.    That sounded so gloomy didn't it.  We set him free.  Back into the wild where he belongs.    Tommy came home from work and saw how small he was and told the boys he probably needed his mom, to put him back where they found him.  So, we don't have a turtle anymore.    Jamie cried.  He wanted a pet.     Have you ever seen Rugrats, the cartoon?  Well, Jamie is my Chuckie.  He is afraid of anyting and everything.  Literally.  You can tell him something, jokingly, and he goes all to peices.  He is very fragile about most things.  For him, a turtle was the perfect pet.  No fast movements, no loud noises, and it was more scared than he was!    Now the quest continues for Jamie a pet.  Tommy won't have hamsters or gerbils or any other rodent related animal, so that rules a lot of small pets out.  I'm thinking fish.  If we can keep the cat away from the tank.  Hmmmm, something to think about.

      The boys jsut came running in with a baby turtle.  It is only about the size of a quarter.  Cute little thing.  So, I looked online to see what kind it is, it is a box turtle.  The boys are begging me to keep it.  I guess it is ok.  They went back out and looked for its parents or other siblings and couldn't find any signs of them, so I guess the poor little thing got lost.    His name is Sparky.  Sheesh, once its named you know it can't leave!

      I laughed.  I cried.  And now I mourn.    Friends is over.  I know I can watch repeats for the next 10 years, but none will be the same as new episodes.    My heart lept with joy when Monica and Chandler found out there were twins.    My heart took a pause when  Rachel got on the plane.    I bawled when she got off.  I bawled even harder when they left their keys.    This show has been a staple for me the past 10 years.  It has been the only show I have watched religiously.  I don't get too attached to shows often.  Mainly because the ones I like usually get dropped.   Whoever those Nielson people are, they don't have the same taste as I do.  I can't stand those crime dramas.  When I watch TV I want to be entertained, to laugh, to forget my own troubles.  Not be reminded just how demented this world we live in is.  Friends was my escape.  I guess I will have to be happy with syndication, and plan on watching Joey in the fall.  ALl I know is he better be having a lot of guest appearances by his former freinds!

      Today is a gorgeous day.  Totally and completely.    Tj and Casey are taking turns with the weedeater, going up the hollar trimming beside the road.  Casey would much rather be mowing.  He loves to mow.  Tj would much rather be inside playing the video game.  Tough.  If he could get away with it, he would be on that game 20 hours a day.  Non stop.  And still would protest when you told him to get off.  "but I just started mom" I wish Xbox put a timing mechanism inside so parents could keep track of how long kids were actually playing those things.  I watched a rerun of Dawson Creek's finale today.  It is funny, I didn't watch the show when it was actually on each week, never.  But now that it is off air and in syndication, I love it.  I am so behind the times.  Tonight is the final Friends.  Oh what will I do on Thursday nights from now on?  All I know is that Ross and Rachel had better be together at the end of this show.    Jenn asked how Tommy  came about reading my blog.  Well, He asked for the address, so I gave it to him. He had helped me with the template in the beginning, so he knew I had one.  At first, I was nervous, just because I do use this thing as a diary and an outlet for my feelings.  But I reminded him of that, and was ok.  He did find it strange that Renee reads my blog.  But then he figured I already talk to her about most of the stuff I blog anyhow.  And he is right.    Renee brought me a T shirt from the beach.  I told her now I could pretend I had went on vacation!  They went to Myrtle Beach in SC.  I have been there once.  I was 18.  me and one of my friends went, we had a blast.  That was the last vacation I went on.  long, long time ago.    Well, Son #1 will drive me nuts.  He jsut came in here wanting me to take him to the mall.  He earned $20 for mowing this week,and wants me to take him to the game store.  First, I don't have a car, so he wants me to borrow one to take him to the mall.    second I told him he needs to save $5 of it.  That is jsut 1/4 of it.  PLus he needs to pay his tithes, which would be $2.  That leaves him with $13, right, well, he doesn't want to do that.  He wants to make his own mistakes.  I told him sure, go ahead, do what youwant.  Then, when he has no money and his brother does, he will be bellyaching .    This kid thinks he is going to be making $150 a week when he turns 15 and gets his first real job.  I laughed.  Real Hard.

      I just sat with TOmmy while he read my blog.  It went really well.  He can't believe I posted about my shaving incident.    He also read the parts about how happy we all are about the happy pills.    Took that well too.    He mentioned a few details I could have put in the get together story.  Then cracked up because one thing he remembered, I definitly don't remember.    Let's jsut say it doesn't leave the best impression of me.  He loved it then, and still does.  I guess that is why he remembers it so well.

      I know this isn't a very popular opinion, but I am so glad Georger Huff got voted off tonight on American Idol.  Phew, there for a while I thought he might just make it all the way.    Now it is all ladies.  Hmmmm, Jasmine should be next, then either Diana or Fantasia.  Latoya will win.  Those are my predictions.  Don't make any bets becuase of them!

      Renee's home, Renee's home!  I just got off the phone with her, they had a great time, Savannah missed me and wanted to go to Gee's house one day while they were gone.  She also wanted "bean" to come play with her in the sand.  Bean is her name for son #4.    Just had to share the excitement.  I missed my friend.

      Tommy is watching Jerry Springer.  He is the last person on earth that still enjoys watching that show.  I hate it.  Have hated it from the first time I saw it.    I may be naive, but there is no way that show isn't scripted.  There can't be THAT many perverted people in America.    But he still gets a kick out of watching all the fights.

      I must say the dog is perfectly fine.  This morning I was squatted down looking thru a box of books, and all of the sudden I felt a cold nose go up my shorts.  I haven't jumped or screamed like that in ages!!!!  The boys have decided I can never let dad run out of happy pills.  He is like a totally different man now.  I am so glad.    Random thoughts   No matter how hard they try, or how good their aim is, boys always miss the toilet.  Never sit on my toilet before wiping it down with a wipe.  I am a lucky woman.  A Jamocha shake from Arby's would be wonderful right now.  Bicycles, pavement and barefeet don't mix.  Niether does skateboards, pavement and barefeet.  to a 5 yr old, mayo, ketchup and mustard is a good sandwich.  to a 35 yr old it is a recipe for disaster.

      Tommy took the two oldest to EB to buy a new game for the Xbox.  My mom had given them some money for doing a bunch of chores for her, so it was new video game time.  They haven't had one since (gasp) CHRISTMAS..... for shame, for shame.  What awful parents we are for making them play the same old games for all that time.  They bought Gladdeous, whatever that is.    I watched American Idol.  I know some think I am crazy, but I enjoy Big Band night.  I liek the songs, they are straightforward songs.  They are a singers type of songs.  You can get into them, have fun with them, and just enjoy performing with them.    Latoya was great.  Diana did good, Fantasia did good on her second song, but not the first.  Tommy thought she stunk on both of them!lol.  My youngest is a cross between a yankee and a redneck.  Can there be such a mix?  In case you didn't know, I have a huge southern accent.  As redneck, hillbilly as they come.  Noah, somehow, got a bit of a northern accent going on, with a splash of hillbilly thrown in every once in a while.  He is my "yes, ma'am, No ma'am" child.  he says "yes" full sounds instead of yea, like my other boys.    Then again, he is his mom's son, someone told him he was a true redneck, and he replied, as horrified as he could "I ain't not a redneck!"

      I am exhausted.  Good exhausted, but still.  I went to super Walmart today.  It is only the 3rd time I have ever been in one.    Our city council decided several years ago to block a superWal, so we don't have one, yet.  I drove a hour to get to it.  It was great.  I love going in there.    When we lived in Vegas I used to love going to the grocery store, becuase they had everything.  For a small town girl like me to be able to grocery shop at 3am and be able to buy clothes, and furniture at the same store, well, that was jsut amazing.    I would have loved living in Vegas now, then I was too young and naive to enjoy it.  I thought everyone was going to murder me and leave my body in the desert.  I also thought I would turn into some evil person if I gambled.  Now, I would love it.  I would go out more, take advantage of the food bars, and visit all around Vegas.  I pretty much stuck to our apartment when we lived there.  There and work, all I ever did.  Unless Tommy was with me.  I rarely went out alone.  I was too scared to walk out to my car by myself.  So young.

      Scrufty made it thru the night.  So did the rest of us.    I don't know how many times I woke up to check and see if he was still breathing.  You would have thought I had given him birth or something!  Jamie is doing better now.  He kept asking me all evening, "is Scrufty going to die".  I felt so sorry for him.  He just moped around the house all night.  He wouldn't touch scrufty at all.  Poor kid.  He thought he killed the family pet.  That is enough to send a kid to therapy for years.    But he will be ok once he gets to go outside and play with scrufty.  The boys have sworn off baseball now.  You know, Noah got beaned in the head twice (mild concussion both times) once with the bat, once with a foul ball, and it didn't amke them want to stop playing baseball inthe yard, but they hit the dog, and they quit.  Go figure.

      Update on the dog, he is doing much better.    He took a lonnnnnnggggg nap.  Got up went straight to pee, came in, ate, then did the other business, and is now napping again.    So all of his bodily functions seem to be working, I bet he has one heck of a headache though.  Phew, that is a relief.   Scrufty is 5 months old, and Labrador Retriever mix of some sort.  We had another lab, Jesse for 13 years, she died two years ago of  cancer.  So we waited a long time before getting another dog.  We had a Jack Russell Terrier for a very short time, then someone kidnapped him.  So for Son #3's birthday he asked for a dog, we went to a dog rescue place and instantly fell in love.    He was the first puppy I made eye contact with, but I didn't tell my boys.  I let Will pick.  And he picked scrufty.  He is huge now and getting more huge every day.  One day I think he will be taller than me.    Our catastrophe for the day is over, or at least sliding downhill fast, and that is a good thing.

      I went to the store for my mom, I come home and Tommy is crouched down in the yard, petting the dog.  Now if you knew the history between the dog and my hubby,  you would know how significant this is.    While I was gone, my boys were playing baseball in the yard, and son #4 was at bat, he swung and accidentally hit the dog in the head.  full swing, major hit.  Scrufty, the dog, immediately fell tothe ground, jerking, then suddenly hops up runing incircles, not being able to see.  Tommy ran to him, and got him settled down.  He can see now, and has been running and walking outside with the boys. He has thrown up twice though.  I called the vet, of course they want to see him, but it is after hours, and will cost more than we paid for our last car.  Literally.  SO, we are having to watch him closely at home.    Son #4 is my quiet one, the sensitive one, the shy one, and it is killing him that he hurt the dog.  We are praying the dog doesnt' die because it will greatly disturb son #4.     Scrufty is sleeping now.  a quiet sleep.  I just hope he wakes up "normal".

      I may or may not have some good news.  My oldest sister, who is in the process of seperating with her husband, may move in with our parents.  That would be a huge help, to mom and dad, but might cause tension as well.    My sis and my mom get on each other's nerves and are both very set in their ways.  That is putting it mildly.  I hope it owrks, I know it would relieve dad a lot, and I wouldn't have to worry about them so much at night.  We'll see.

        Do as I say, not as I do!    This is one of those things that as a 20 something, you don't think will have a relevance in your life at all, other than being a good story to tell one day.  As a parent, it takes on a whole new meaning.  I was 20 years old, riding around with a couple of male friends.  We had all run in a group for a couple of years and were the best of buds.  We stop to talk to another branch of our group, and I am introduced to the brother of the guy I am riding with.  The brother's name is Tommy.    Thru the course of the night, Tommy keeps asking me out, I keep turning him down, until this little tramp walks up to him and says "let's go parrrtyyy!" in a very drunk, very slurred voice.  "I only wanna party with you Tommy"  well, that did it.  You do not walk up to a guy I am talking to and practically rip his clothes off.  I am waiting, I am watching, Tommy turns her down.  Good boy.  Smart move.  Next time he asks me out, like 60 seconds later, I say yes.  With the threat that I know where he lives if he stands me up.  Next night, we go on our first date, to see Die Hard, the first one.  Had a great time.  Hemakes his move, I turn himdown.  He asks for another date.  Good girl, smart move.  Never give the goods first date.    We date for exactly 10 days, 10 short, but yet long days.    He has to go back to the base he is stationed at, in Las Vegas.  He was home on leave.  As he leaped off the porch of my house at 1 am, he yells "I love you" over his shoulder.  I cry for days.  Missing my love.   two weeks after he left, we agreed to get married.  Set a date.  (neither of us can remember who proposed, just that we agreed we should get married)  One month after he left, he mailed my engagement ring to me.     1 day short of 4 months after we met, we got married.  That was 15 years ago.    It was a true whirlwind.  When he came home for our wedding, I took his sister and brother in law to the airport with me to pick him up.  I had never seen him in daylight.  Only after dark.    We have had a very happy marriage, and now even though we are working thru such hard times, we are still happy.    If my sons do something like this, I will kill them.

      Now that I have had time to think, and process all my  son has told me, here we go...  He is 14, and THINKS he is ready to face life full force.  HE knows to say no to drugs, smoking, alcohol,and even says he plans on being a virgin when he marries, because he is scared of STD's.  Those things are all good.  But he thinks he is ready to be in situations where he will be  forced to make spur of the moment decisions regarding these things.    I disagree.    This is a boy, in a 5'11" 250lb body, who is scared to walk to his grandparents house (less than a football field away) after dark.  Same boy still brings his blankets and pillows after we go to sleep and makes a pallet outside our bedroom door to sleep.   Sure, he is ready to be confronted with sex, drugs and all those   other things that can mess you up if you do them too young.  Sure.    I know he has saw these things, up close, but in a restricted, "safe" place like school.  (before we started homeschooling)  Not on a one on one basis, with friends, at a party, or at the mall, or wherever.    Yes , we have equipped him with the knowledge to make good decisions. I'm just not sure he has the wisdom to use the knowledge.  it is our job to make sure he has both, wisdom and knowledge.    What he doesn't realize is that his dad and I have the same morals.  We agree o his restrictions.  I just come out being the bad guy, because, I am mom.  my oldest has reached that age, the age when to him, mom has no clues what it is like to be him.  No, I don't know what it is like to be a teenage boy, but I do know what it is like to be a teenage girl.

      My oldest son just told me I am too uptight.    He likes his dad's morals better than mine.  I don't get his needs he says.    Why does he say this?  Because I don't agree with him listening to Richard Pryor, I don't agree with him watching soft porn on cable after midnight.  I don't like to hear 14 year old cuss like sailors.  I don't like watching TV and hearing my son talk about women on TV liek they are objects, and not humans.    I am trying my best to NOT raise a male chauvenist pig.  TRYING.    This same son told me the other day, that his wife was going to be a virgin, he wasn't having and used meat.  His words, not mine.    But he plans on getting all the honey's he can.  I told him he was flat wrong.  That personally, yes, I wish he would wait until he was sure he loved the one he chose to be with.  But there were more things to worry about these days than just getting a girl pregnant.  He says yeah, but that won't happen to me.    He is 14, and I just lost him.  I don't mean for good, I AM his mom, but he has seen the greener pasture and has crawled over the fence.

      Today is my dad's 84th birthday.  Wow.    I am making him and my mom supper, and baking his cake, and all that general stuff.  We are having Chicken Fried steak with gravy, biscuits, mashed potatoes, green beanas and whatever else I decide to fix.  Just for the record, I am one of those cook from scratch people.  Especially when it comes to the menu tonight.    I have had one of those strange kinds of days.  I clean hubby's work twice amonth.   Today, they hit a new low for nastiness is the potty.  Seriously, how some of you male readers, please tell me, how do you get poop on the bottom of the urinal, and on the wall beside the urinal, and not on the wall beside the toilet???????????  I jsut don't understand.  I told Tommy it was a new low, that for the first time in my life, I gagged.    Now I used to work in a restaurant downtown that various vagrants would use our facilities to clean up of a morning.  They were much cleaner than what I cleaned up today.  Much, much cleaner.    I just don't understand.

      Ok, I have been reading blogs today.  Over at  urlLink Tj's Place  Kev wrote about grown, adult men having a conversation naming their bodily excrements.  Fastforward 40 years and there sit my sons in Larry, Curly and Mitch's places at TJ's strip joint, naming those same excrements.  How do I know? They already name burps and farts (I hate that word, but couldn't think of a decent replacement).    I mean you know it is bad, when you are sitting in a ER cubicle, waiting for the nurse to come and set your son's arm, the door is closed, and all fo the sudden the most horrendous, excruciating loud sound comes from your oldest sons body.  So loud, that people come out of their cubicles to ask "what the *&$% was that?  So loud that the man pushing his wife, who is noticibly in pain exclaims "was that a bear".  ALl the while, sons 1 and 2 andthier favorite cousin are laughing their heads off, and mom has her bright crimson red head safely tucked as far behind the hospital bed as it will possibly go.  That burp by the way is the Barq's burp.  It was a result of drinking Barq's root beer.    (side note) that was over a year ago, when taking same son to ER again for a broken finger, same nurse, says "you look familiar" I mention burping "oh, yeah I know the HUGE burper, haven't heard one like that in my life"    Then I read my comments and surf on over to  urlLink Randy's blog , who, I have been reading for a couple of weeks now, and feel guilty.  Why, because I have made him feel guilty.  Oh what a tangled web we weave.    Who knew, when I first started blogging that this simple outlet for my emotions would evoke so many new ones!    I don't watch Soap Operas, my soaps are blogs.  Real life, real funnies, real problems.

      You can tel lyesterday was Friday, it is this running theme for the past month or so that everything can and will happen on Friday.    Luckily most of it was happening to people  I know, not to us.    The neighbor's daughter decided to run away.  She is 16, and really cute, my boys have a crush on her.  She didn't come home from school yesterday, so her parents called the cops.  Later that night, they found her at a friends house.  I think she is jsut a mixed up kid.  I haven't seen any signs of drugs or alcohol abuse, and her parents really seem to be good parents.  I have seen her boyfriend running out the back door, up the hill pulling his clothes on when her parents come home from work.  Funny, but sad at the same time.  Renee had to deal with doctors all day yesterday.  Had to take Savannah to be checked by the pediatrician, and to the hospital for labs, so most of her day was spent with worry, stress and just basic headachy stuff.  I know she will be so glad to get to the beach tomorrow.    Oh, the one thing that did relate directly to us, Tommy had to go to the doctor, they wanted to check and see if he had a heart attack, they told him it was stress.  Put him on anit-depressants.  Yipeeeeeeee.  I am so glad he finally agreed to take them.  phew, I can breathe a little easier now and pray the side effects aren't bad, and he doesn't stop taking them.    HE came in with samples, so I asked them what they were, he says "crazy pills, ok, you have finally driven me to crazy pills."  I told him no, he isn't crazy, just depressed, there is a difference.  ANd that almost everyone we know is on them.    I am going to have to find a cheap lilac candle, the blooms on my lilac tree are wilting now, and I love going to sleep smelling the lilacs.  It makes for good dreaming.

      I'm trying to be ok here, but it is very hard.  maybe I am PMS'ing.  Hey Nay, I need ice cream.  BAD.  Or poker, or maybe a big tall screwdriver, just something to make me stop worrying, stop thinking,and stop wanting to escape.    I'll be better tomorrow, I promise.

      Yep, that is my name.    Several months ago, I came to my husband and confessed that I had a few credit cards he didn't know about.  I had been thru a huge problem with my depression and all the bills were behind, we were financially in horrible shape.    It was a rough few months for us.    I screwed up again.  I didn't remember one of the cards. This morning the collections agency calls, and talks to Tommy.  He asked me about it, I still didn't remember.    After Tommy went to work, I called the number on the phone and talked to them, they reminded me of the card.  Not a good thing.  I guess I had just blacked it out or something.  I don't know what happened.  THey had been trying to call, but I won't answer the phone if I don't know who the company listed on the caller ID is.  I don't have to hang up on telemarketers that way.  So, all this time, they have been calling ,and I assumed they were just a telemarketing company.  Sheesh, I'm an idiot.  Now, I am scared.  When we went thru this a few months ago, he told me "never again" he wouldn't do this again,and I know he was on the verge of leaving me.  I am praying he doesn't leave me.  I can't handle that.    I do love him, I have been doing soooooo good the past few months.  I have been sticking to the budget he gave me, like glue.  I have been making do with what grocery money we have, and not been complaining at all.  I have even been bringing him the recipts of what I pay and spend.    I have felt so much better about myself, and everything.  And now this.  I have screwed up bigtime,and I know it.  I don't have a clue what to do.  I don't know what to say to him.    He isn't speaking to me.  At all, not a word.  Pretty much ignoring me.  I asked him if he wanted to talk about it, and he told me "you don't want to talk to me right now".  I know I have pissed him off beyond belief.    I even got most of the house clean before he got home from work this morning.  (he only had to work about an hour)  Which for me, is good.

      TOmmy read my blog tonight. I had him reading another blog, to see what a friend of ours had written.  He read my post from the other day about wanting to have parts of my previous life back.  He was questioning some of the things I had written.  SO, I had to have a talk with him to explain some of the feelings I have been having.     When we first got together, we decided not to talk about our past.  It was past, so we decided to leave it there.  As a result, we don't know alot about each others old boyfriends/girlfriends, or previous relationships.  He knows a few of mine, and I know a few of his.  That's it. The only ones we have discussed are the ones that  made a impact on who we are today.  The insignificant ones were laid to rest a long time ago to never be exhumed again.  I guess the "motorcycle" post and the "not a virgin" part, bothered him.  I told him, I don't want those times back, just the person I was then, the girl who wasn't afraid to act on the spur of the moment.  The girl who loved taking risks within reason.  ( is there such a thing???)  The girl he fell in love with to be honest.    I told him I didn't like the person I had changed into.  HE seemed ok, once we discussed it.  Until the chest pains got worse, and he started having a tough time breathing.  Seems my post drove him to a panic attack.  Wow, the power I have.    Just call me ZENA THE WARRIOR PRINCESS!!!!!!  Seriously, I wouldnt be joking if he was in awful shape.  He even admitted that he needs to go back on his medicine.  The panic attacks are the main reason the doc prescribed them.  While on the meds, no panic attacks.  While off the meds, panic attacks.  Let's see, what would you do?  I would start taking my meds!

      Well, I did it, and you know what?  I didn't feel guilty about it.    I somehow managed to sit down, and drink a glass of wine last night.  BEFORE dinner.  whoohoo, what a slot am I?????  Seriously, I was able to enjoy my glass of wine without those voices in my head saying "what would daddy think?"  Which is a huge improvement.  I did have to listen to the boys whispering behind my back "mom's drinking wine" their daddy can do it, but mom can't.  There is such a double standard in my house.  lol.

      Seems as if my post yesterday gave my big sis enough fodder for blackmail.  lol.  She called me this morning telling me she's got me now.  (and she does) BUT, if I will drive home, she'll buy me a margarita!  Seems she can't hold her liquor.  Hmmmmm, an arrangement could be made here.  I'm not a margarita girl myself, but a Tom COllins or screw driver would be nice.  Gotta love my vodka.  This could be bad, this could be very, very bad.  Two sisters out, drinking, not a good thing in this family.  Dad would die.  Especially if sis #3 came along.  (shivers) Can't drink with her, she gets violent wants to kick butt, unfortunatly for everyone she takes on, she can back up her words.  I've been on the recieving end of her drunk.  Not a place I ever want to be again.     At least with Big sis, one drink is all it would take.  Then, bring out the cam corder, gotta have a blackmail tape to use against her black mail blog.  This could get very interesting ! lol.

      I have to clean every inch of my bathroom.  Savannah came down to play with Noah.  If you ahve read anything about her, you know she is a mud freak.  So, I let the boys make a mud hole for them to all play in.  What a cool mom am I?  I have some good pics of Will, Jamie, Noah and Savannah getting themselves covered in mud.  Icky, thicky sticky, brown mud.  At least it isn't red clay, I guess.  Savannah was even nice enough to give me brown muddy handprints all over my legs.  I let Jamie come in and shower first, then Noah and Savannah decided at the exact same time they needed a bath right then.  Since they had both gotten pretty much naked in the mud, I let them bathe together with their drawers on.  You chould see my tub.  The floor inthe bathroom is all mud, the tub is all mud, the clothes they took off, will have to be hosed down before going in the wash, then it will probably still take two washings to get them even to play clothes status.    But is was worth it.  Wait until you see the pics.    Those smiles are priceless.

      I think...  I am having a bit of a midlife crisis, not a true mid life crisis, just a little one.   I used to be a fun girl.  Before I got married, had babies, and got all serious and ultra strict, and super conservative.    Now, I am not a strict, not as conservative, in fact boardering moderate.  But have major conflicts going on in my head about stuff.    The bad thing is, I don't know what I want.  Like with the drinking.  I find I have a great urge to have a glass of wine with my dinner.  To the me now it is ok. But to the woman I was a few years ago, it is a huge, huge no-no.  You never ever drink alcohol of any kind.  None at all.  Zip, nada zilch.  Going straight to hell if you do.    I used to be so judgemental.  I was raised that way actually.  I was raised to love every one no matter what, but that if you cussed, drank, had premarital sex, any of that stuff, you were going to hell in a handbasket.  Of course I rebelled.  My parents still think I was a virgin when I got married.  HAH!  My mom used to make me swear on a bible, when I came in after a night out, that I was indeed still pure.  Little did she know what she was making me do.  When I was 17, I could out drink all the 23 yr olds I hung out with, and was proud of it.  My parents still don't know any of this.  They know a few things, and I'm sure they suspected lots of things.  But I never confirmed anything.  The thing is, right now, I don't want to be a wild woman. I just want to enjoy life.  It literally took me years to understand and "get" that sex is fun, and I wasn't a whore if I enjoyed it.  I mean, and Tommy will kill me for this, but we have a great sex life.  I love our sex life.  I love sex.  I don't feel guilty about it now...but I used to.  It took years for me to feel comfortable with this.  Sheesh, maybe I need a therapist.  I was looking at my SIL saturday, she really does enjoy life.  She is a fun person with a fun personality.  I used to be that person.  That is part of what Tommy was attracted to.  I was this outgoing, fun loving girl.  Then, I had kids and got so stuck on being the best mom ever. I thought I had to be this "leave it to beaver" mom that never participated in the activites, just sat on the sidelines and watched.  Saturday, I didn't sit on the sidelines.  A few years ago, there would have been no way I would have got on that 4 wheeler with Tommy.  None.  Saturday, I did, and it was so freeing.  Before I would have sat on the porch, talking with the other moms, cooking food, helping clean up, watching the baby, which I did all of that stuff, but I did get on the 4x4 and ride it.  None of the other women would.  They just sat there.  I remember the days when I loved slinging mud in my friends jeep, Hitting my head on the row bar every time we took a jump.  Nearly busting out my front tooth once! I loved sitting behind my boyfriend, flying down the road in the night air on his crotch rocket, not caring about a thing in the world.  I loved hiking up into the mountains trying to get to the hidden waterfalls that are around here.  Or racing go karts with my brothers on our dirt road. I would play in pick-up football games even though I am a true non athelete and looked really bad while doing it.   I got scared when I had my babies.  I saw all the dangers of the world.  I could then see thing thru a mother's eyes and see how dangerous it is to ride a motorcycle without leathers on,or at least a pair of jeans. I saw that racing go karts on a public road in the middle of the day with cars coming at you is stupid.  I decided that being the only girl in a group of 10-12 guys going mud slinging in their 4x4 trucks doesn't exactly do a good thing for the old reputation.  Even if you weren't sleeping with any of them.   I guess these were all good things to learn, but I do miss the excitement. I miss the fun of playing games.  I need to find the fine line between good and bad.  Anybody know where that is?  Where does a former fun girl turned stiff mom go to to find the middle ground?

      Tommy is no longer on his happy pills?    Thanks to the dr.s office, the health insurance company, and the drug store.    The doc forgot to get prior authorization before calling the script in, the drugstore filled it without the authorization, to the amount of !$150.  THen the chick in charge of authorizations at the docs office went on vacation with no one checking her voicemail, so this went of for over a week, all the time Tommy is without his meds, so when it all got straightened out, he said *&$# it, I don't want them anymore.  Yay.

      In fact, she just left my house with mud all over her feet.lol.  She is 100% better today than she was the other night.  She was running, playing, talking, just our normal little Savannah.   When Noah saw her, he was out of the bus with my brother (brother and his partner are converting a tour bus into a motor coach beside my house) and he came running in the house screaming "vanna's home, vanna's home, come see, vanna's home"  He was so excited to see her.    I didn't realize how worried him and all this brothers had been.  But she is home and playing in the mud.  Happy days are here again.

      We had a stress free day yesterday.    It has been so long since we had one of those.    TOmmy's family had a get together, his oldest sister was in from Boca, so we all got together to have a cookout.    We road 4 wheelers, the boys played football, found money with a metal detector, lit a bonfire fter dark, and just basically enjoyed being around each other.  It was so nice.  No phone to answer, no body on earth knew how to get in touch with us.  SO we jsut hung out and enjoyed life.    Lana, my sil, has a house on top of a mountain, down this long dirt road, so we were in the boonies.  I like the boonies.  ha,ha.  The kids could play without worrying if they were too loud, we could tear dirt up with the 4 wheeler and not worry about someone compaining.  Tommy made me scream.  I road with him, and some man who was riding his wife on their 4 wheeler, said he wanted to see Tommy jump a hill with me on the back.  He took off, I ducked my head behind his back and screamed like a sissy girl.  Thanks to the brake system Polaris has on the 4 wheelers, you can go fast as you can,a nd then let off the gas, and the brake automaticaly slows you down, well, he waited until aobut 2 feet from the hil and let off the gas.  I just knew we were going airborne.  Which would have been fun if all my inlaws weren't watching.  Knowing my luck I would have bounced off the backend of the thing and landed on my tuckus.  Too bad the boys missed hearing mom scream.  They were all too busy tackling their uncle to notice mom was getting the crap scared out of her.    Now, I want a 4 wheeler and a house in the boonies.

      LIterally, totally, I am aaaahahhhhhhhh.   My oldest is 14. He is very hormonal, almost 6 feet tall, and wieghs 240.  Big boy.  My neighbor girl is 16, long blonde hair to her waist, and well, let's just say she is blessed.  All of my boys have a crush on her.  Which is fine.  Until now.  Right now, she is sitting on my porch, watching my two oldest pass football.  She has been down here all day, and most of the week.  This morning is a bit different.  She is dressed up more than usual.  Nice tight shirt, nice jeans, hair fixed all pretty, with her best smile on.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH.  The boys cleaned their rooms, and asked if Nieghbor girl and her brother could come inside and play video games.  Being the cool mom that I am, I said sure.  She came in on my oldest's heels, and every where he went, she went.  Even going so far as to semi recline on the bed.  did I say AAAAAAHHHHHHHH??????????  Oldest decided he had enough video games, went outside, she was on his tail like a fly on fresh crap.  Laughing at his jokes, telling him how good he is at throwing football and playing basketball.  I know the signs, I was a 16 yr old girl once.    TJ keeps coming in and pumping his fist inthe air when she isn't looking.  He knows the signs too.  This would be his first girlfriend. ALthoughwe all know this will jsut be summer fling for her.    Im not against young love.  But I do know she is experienced, andhe isn't.  I think if you are going to play, you better be ready to pay.  AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH.

      They made it to the hospital with Savannah.    Her ammonia is up and she is kind of dazed, I'm not sure if it is from being in a coma for 40 hours or fromthe ammonia being so high.  Me and Tommy met them at the hospital and stayed for a little while.  It killed me to see her that way.  I have seen her with high ammonia before, I have seen her sick before .  But never like this.  She is having a hard time talking, like she wants to say something, but can't get it out.  Then all of the sudden, she will blurt out a whole sentance.  She is a very sick little girl.    I did see her eyes lite up when I told her how much rain we had and all the mud that was in the yard.  she loves playing in the mud.  Beter than anything on earth, she loves to roll in it, I mean get every inch of her body covered in mud.  "I wuv da mud" she says.  When she gets out of the hospital, I don't care how dry it is, I am making her a mud hole to roll in.

      Savannah was on her way home, 2 hours away from home, and her ammonia is going up again.    THey are in between hospitals, and nothing they can do.  Theya re pretty much hopeless until they get back to the hospital here.    Hospitals don't normally keep the medications that Savannah needs on hand, so they can't stop at jsut any hospital.  Pray for them.  Please.

      I jsut talked to Savannah on the phone.  She is very weak, and has a hard time talking, but still she managed to get a weak " I wuv Gee" and make my entire day.    She talked to EJ, and Noah as well.  So I am much more relived now.    It brought tears to my eyes to hear her voice, after being so terrifed she would die for the past two days.    Thanks to everyone for lifting her up in your prayers.  I know most of you ahve never met her, and probably never will, but she is such a precious child.  YOu can tell that from her pictures.    Keep praying for her to get stronger and recover completly.

      I took my two youngest and EJ (savannah's brother) to run errands with me today.  YOu know, bank, store gas station, those kinds of things.    While driving down main street, it struck me, small time life just slapped me right up side the forehead.    Accross the street from the bank, in the Methodist church's parking lot, there was a tailgate farmer's market.  There couldn't have been 10 cars, trucks or booths set up.  SO we decided to stop and look at the wares people had set out.    One booth was pure, unadultrated honey.  Fresh out of the hive honey.  ANother booth had homemade yarn.  Hand dyed, home spun, the works.  Beside that lady was organic veggies.  Not some you go to the store and buy, not knowing where they were harvested from, these were harvested right in this lady's back yard, by her hands.  Some women were selling hand picked flower bunches, whie others were selling fresh preserves, strawberry, blackberry, even cranberry.  But the strangest one, was a mom and her daughter, the were selling doGnuts.  The girl about 9 years of age mixes, bakes and packages doggie doughnuts.  Three flavors, chicken, bacon and cheese.  I couldn't resist, 6 dognuts for $1, so I brought some home.    Back on main street kids out of school for the summer were riding bikes to the grocery store to get a cold drink, mom's with toddlers in strollers were trying to walk off that baby fat.  Two kids were standing on the sidewalk with a huge sign, "FREE KITTENS"  When we drove by, one of them held out an adorable grey and black striped kitten, put on their best pouty face, and yelled "PWWWWEEEESSSSEEEEEE".  I didn't cave.    We stopped at the local roadside produce stand, bought tomatos for 99/lb, and a homegrown cantelope.  I love good cold cantelope, one the front porch as the sun goes down.    When we got home, I was thankful for small town life.

      Savannah screamed, kicked and had a BM earlier.  But she still hasn't regained conciousness.  She will rouse when they wet her mouth or wash her face with a wash cloth now.  So she is slowly improving.  I guess once you get in such a deep sleep, it takes awhile to come to.

      Last night I dreamed we were at the beach.  All of us,me, Tommy, the boys, Renee, Stan and Savannah and EJ, my sis, and I don't know how many others were there.  All of us women were  sitting in our beach chairs, enjoying the sun and mist off the water, and the kids were all playing in the sand, building sand castles and pretending they were the kings and queens of beach Rogers. Then men were skeet shooting over the water.   All of the sudden, Savannah starts talking just as plain as a 3.5 year old can.  Talking about a chocolate fudge ice cream sundae.  She wanted one, and was going to eat it all gone.    I woke up with a smile on my face.    Right now, Savannah is very speech delayed, she talks and is getting better, but is still very hard to understand.  She also can't eat a chocolate fudge ice cream sundae.  Her liver transplant would make my dream possible.  Now I know what food I want to be the first to give her.  A chocolate fudge ice cream sundae.  Maybe we will make it a weekly tradition, just me and her, off to the ice cream shop for our girls time.    She just needs to wake up first.

      basically no changes overnight other than Savannah will open her eyes and flail around like she is hurting.  Her ammonia is staying the same.  The doc said it is up to her.  Also, the longer she stays like this, the worse it is.  High ammonia levels cause brain damage.  Renee and Stan got to sleep last night, they both needed it very bad.     More updates later.

      I talked to Renee, and the docs confirmed that  urlLink Savannah  is in an ammonia induced coma.  Now they just have to figure out what is causing her ammonia to go up so high.  Infection, virus, bacteria, who knows.    They also heard a heart murmur.  This is a first.  NO one has ever heard one before in Savannah.    She has also finally been moved to the PICU.  Glad she is finally in a room of her own and not in a cubicle on a cot.  I will keep posting updates.

      I just heard from Renee's mom, and evidently, Savannah is in a coma.  She has been admitted to the hospital, but is still in the ER because they don't have a room for her yet.    Renee tried to call me about an hour ago, but I was at the VA with my dad, getting his CAT scan done.  I'm trying to get ahold of her now.  I will post more when I know it.

      As you all know, she is in Chapel Hill right now, supposed to be doing her workup for the transplant.    She is sick.  Eveidently, she caught a bug before she left, and started running a temp yesterday after they got down there.  They wound up in the ER last night getting her ammonia checked, it was 176, normal is somewhere around 20.  She woke up vomiting this morning, so Renee isn't sure if the docs will still start the work up or not.  Please pray for her either way.  She has to be sedated for two fo the tests, and sedation is hard on her little body.  There are many side effects and potential problem with her disease coming from being sedated, so she really needs to be as healthy as possible.    I will keep updating when I hear from Renee.  I know the Grandmother's are ready to go down asap, if needed.  I have EJ, but will go down if I am needed more there.    Pray for Renee and Stan, this is so stressful for them.  They are by themselves down there, and don't have any support buy each other, and when you are both as stressed as they are, you aren't much support for others.    till later...

      We just watched 50 First Dates.  I bawled my eyes out.  I knwo, I know, nothing unusual there, but I actually liked the ending.    How sweet of him to make sure every day she falls in love with him all over again.  The divorce rate wouldn't be 2% if couples did that every day.  Both of them, man and woman, tried their dead level best to make their true love fall for them all over again.  Start each day anew, with a clean slate, and a fresh start.    Iliked the part when she told him she likes lilies.  But the part I liked the best was at the end, when she woke up, watched the tape, and saw her life with him.  Then walked outside to meet her daughter for the first time.  That, would be hard.  To meet your child for the first time every day.  But then again, it would be kind of nice to forget all those arguements, and troubles that kids create sometimes.    So, if you had to make someone fall in love with you all over again on a daily basis, how would you do it?

      Renee, Stan and  urlLink Savannah  left this morning for Chapel Hill. They start all the  urlLink tests  on Savannah in the morning, and finish up Thursday.  It is going to be a fast paced, rough couple of days for them.    In about 3-4 weeks, they should have the test results back, and she will be put on the UNOS list, (to get a cadaver liver) up until they do the living donor transplant from her mom.  Whichever happens first will be which liver she gets.    Savannah has to be sedated for two of the tests, so keep her in your thoughts and prayers.

      Before I discovered blogger, I spent an unusual amount of time on Ebay.  I love Ebay, especially when I can manage a good deal on things.    SO today, I set up a new seller's account.  I have tons of books to sell, I had thought of donating them to GOodwill, but I need $$$$to buy homeschool books for this next year.  I am WAAAYYYYY behind of getting books bought, but we have been so broke, I haven't been able to do anything about it.  SO now, I am selling  books to buy books!  Let's just hope I make a killing at it!

      It has been a relatively quiet day around here.   We went to church both services today, Tommy stayed home.  Watched the race, and US Open, took a nap, that's about it.  Oh, and I patched Tommy's jeans.  That was the highlight of my day, patching hubby's jeans.  TJ  has a bad habit of wearing his dad's pants.  Normally not a problem.  But, somehow, he rips them, every single time he wears them.  THey come home in more than one piece.  Tommy is down to only one pair now.  So, I got out the trusty sewing machine and patched another pair.  BUT, I forgot to change the settings and the needle so it honestly is the worst looking peice of crap I have ever done.  Even worse than the first thing I ever sewed in HOme Ec class back in high school .  That is bad.  We watched  urlLink Motorcycle Mania  tonight on discovery channel.  I can't decide if  urlLink Jesse James  is a cool dude, or one messed up man.  He definitly has a lot of rage.  Quiet rage, the not so good rage that builds and builds until it explodes.  Someone always gets hurt when those quiet ones explode.  And he is dating Sandra Bullock.  She must like the bad boys.  Real bad boys.

      Saturdays, don't ya just love them????  Sleeping in, rambling thru the day, doing whatever you want, no set time to be anywhere, just getting this and that accomplished, or not.    I have been reading alot of blogs lately.  Lots of blogs.  And I can't really catagorize mine, compared to others.    Some relate daily activites, some tell about past experiences, and some are political blogs.  Oh, and we can't forget those, ahem, "adult" blogs.    Where do I fit?  I'm not sure, but i sure do enjoy reading all the different types of blogs.      urlLink Jack , asked a question that has me thinking, What dream do you have?  The only dream I can every recall having was to grow up, get married and have lots of kids.  While most people qualify 5 as lots, I don't, I want more, at least 6-8, I would love an even dozen.    I can't help but feel like I have more children out there, waiting for me to find them.  I know that sounds strange, but I just don't feel finished being mom.  YOu know how when you are out with your kids, and one of them goes down the wrong aisle, and you are looking for them?  That is how I feel, day and night, in a crowd, or alone, I always feel like I am looking for my lost child.    I am one of the lucky ones, I have never miscarried, never lost a child in any way. So 4 years ago, on June 23, I had my tubes tied.  Many things were going on in my life, and I made an emotional decision, not a very well thought out decision.    TOmmy was concerned about my health, and the thought of us losing a child, or miscarrying one, killed him, he knew he couldn't deal with it, and I probably wouldn't be able to deal with it either.  So, he took me to the outpatient surgery to have the tubal done.  We sat in the prep room, bawling our eyes out because neither one of us was ready to close this chapter of our lives.  They took me back to the pre-op room, and I was alone bawling my eyes out, the nurses had to sedate me before they could even prep me for surgery, I was that upset.    Part of me has cried ever since.  I can't look at a baby without tearing up.  The jealousy of women who are pregnant has went way down, I used to get so angry at anyone who was having a baby.    I know this all sounds so selfish, I know I should feel blessed (and I do) because I have 5 healthy children.  I know I am lucky to have never experienced the heart break of losing a child.  I know all these things.  But I also know the hole that is in my heart, the one that is set aside for the child or children I haven't had.    The doctors who did my surgery never mentioned the feelings I would feel after.  They never mentioned I would suffer such a deep depression that I wouldn't be able to shake with out medications.  They didn't tell me the physical effects I would  have to deal with. No one did.  I do much better now, for the first 2-3 years, it was bad.  I was bad.  I couldn't talk to friends that were having babies. I would run away in tears.  I have left the grocery store many times because there were to many babies inside.  Now, I can deal much better.  Most of the time, I can actually feel joy when a friend tells me she is expecting.  I can hold a baby now and not soak its face with my tears.    I am making progress, hopefully by the time I am a grandmother, I will be all better, and can send my grandbabies home with their daddy's and sit down and think "phew, I'm so glad they went home" .

      OVer on  urlLink Tj's blog , they are having a debate in his comments section about age differences.  Seems as if a 18 yr old boys is chasing a 14 yr old girl.    Who knows if it is right or wrong?  Now one does.  Depending on what country you are riased in, it can be perfectly normal for this age to be dating, even married.    But I have to say, when I was 14, there was no way on earth I was ready for the type of relationship that came with having a 18 yr old boyfriend.  I had the body, thougth I had the brains, but I didn't.    In fact, I wouldn't have know how to make my own decisions, how to say no to sex because I wasn't ready, I wouldn't have known how to stand up for myself, instead of being the guy's "woman".    Yea, I thought I was mature enough.  When I was 18, I was dating a 34 yr old.  I had NO CLUE what I was getting myself into. Only by having parents that prayed for me constantly, did I get out of that relationship with no physical scars, just a few emotional ones, and a deeper understanding of how NOT ready I was for an adult relationship.    That was at 18, I can't see a 14 yr old beign ready for an 18 yr old.

      Rachel  She's everybody's sweetheart, despite some (mostly) endearing quirks. And it looks like you too, have a little Rachel Green inside you. (If you're lucky, you might share her good looks too). Some may see you as a little spoiled, or at times naive. But overall you're a total doll. Like the real Rachel, you make your way in the world, figuring it out as you go.   Sometimes your story-book ideals of how things should turn out keep you from taking life as it comes, but that lovable vulnerability just makes people feel closer to you. You have true compassion, an idiosyncratic side your friends delight in—and, of course, great taste. Reminder, o charming one: People love it when you call them "hun."

      Hi,  I just took the "Who's Your Inner Rock Star?" test at Tickle.com!  Take it yourself to see how our results compare and join my network of friends.  Britney Spears  Feel it, sweetheart; the rock star in you is all Britney—the envy of cheerleaders everywhere. One part girl next door, one part naughty sex kitten, you're definitely not as innocent as you look. And that is why nobody can get enough of you. You are the ultimate American girl with some serious staying power. Unlike other success stories, you and Britney are more than just a pretty face: you've got talent, confidence, and the brains to back it up.

      Every Friday, (used to be saturday) Tommy and myself play poker with Stan and Renee and sometimes Renee's sister Tiffany.    Last week was a disaster.  Tommy was in a pertubed mood, and hurt my feelings early on in the night.  So then I showed my Butt and pouted all night.  Then he got mad at me because I was a butt to him.  see how things just keep going on and on in circles?  Tonight I am looking forward to it.  We are starting some new rules, mainly to see if we can actually finish a game with out a time limit, or having to go all in on the last hand before the time limit.    TOmmy won the first 3 weeks, last week he lost by timelimit.  We need to kick his tail, and I need to quit going all in so early because I am tired and want to go home to bed.  I jsut wind up being permenant dealer, for the next 2.5hours while the 3 of them play.    Not much fun being perm. dealer.

      I have a question, for females only, please, guys feel free to comment, but I really don't want to know what a man's favorite body part is, we all know that answer already!  What is your favorite male body part? Seriously, you know the part that you could just look at, linger your fingertips on softly, absentmindedly stroking while sitting in the movies, at dinner, or just on the couch watching the game?  Mine?  Arms.  Yep, toned, well shaped biceps do it for me everytime.  I love running my hands gently across the firm curve of my man's bicep.    Just like I love that one specific blood vessel that always bulges when he is working on something, and has to flex his arms.  Not the intentional flex, the one you catch off guard, when he's lifting the trash can to dump it, or when he catches the youngest child in his arms on the way in the door from work and raises the child above his head.  Or when those arms are holding his weight above me, with my arms pinned, as he leans in closer an closer...then ruins it by tickling me to the point I am snorting and sqeaking like a mouse.    Those arms, are the ones I love.

      my neighbor is currently screaming at her 16 yr old step daughter.  the girl is crying.  How do I know? Their goat got loose and one of the boys went up to tell them.   THe girl ran away about a month ago.  I worry she will do it again, and stay gone for good this time.  She is really a beautiful girl.  My boys think she is the hottest thing they've ever seen.  Misguided , yes, but still beautiful.

      Savannah goes next week for her work up for the transplant.  Renee and Stan I think are leaving tuesday? and will be back, I think late htursday.  You wouldn't believe how packed in all the appointments are, and Savannah has to be sedated for two of them, which is never good for her.  They have to watch her ammonia, and amino acids very closely when she is sedated.    So pray for them.

      Tonight was the night for runaways.    I live at bottom of the hill, to the left on top of the hill, my parents live, go on up over the hill, Renee lives there, and my sis lives in between renee and my parents. We all live on a private dead end road, with only 11 families on it.  Me at the beginning of the road, renee and stan are the next to last house. Confused?????  I was leaving my parents house this evening aroudn dusk, and came by my sis's, around the curve, and there, in the middle of the road stood Savannah.  She was chasing a kitty she said.  halfway to my house.  I picked her up, and called her dad, todl them I woudl bring her home in a few.  Get home, and my oldest tells me that while I was gone, he chased Noah down 3 times, he was going to Renee's.    Somehow, at the same time, our two kids were both heading to each others house, without parental knowledge.  They must have ESP, or soem other type of connection, about 200 more feet and they would have met inthe middle.

      I haven't been on much, haven't really ahd time.    Yesterday, our water pump quit working.  My dad owns a small trailer park, and it is on the same well and pump that we are, so when the water quits working, it affects 5 families.  Not a good thing.  We spent most of the day, into the evening getting it fixed, while that was going on, I was trying to fix my computer.  It had suddenly started downloading programs I had never seen before, and all kinds of stuff, so I had to do lots and lots of scans and fixes to get it to working right.    AND, while trying to figure out what was wrong with the water, the electrician realizes that our circuit breakers keep tripping.  So he is worried that our house is going to burn down.  When we find out later the Air Conditioner is too strong for the outlets in our house, the house is old, so it wasn't wired to support the load of a air conditioner.  So now, we have to keep everything on that side of the house off, when the air is on.  Needless to say, I was stressed.    Many times I found myself in the living room, sitting in a chair, with my head in my hands praying.    Its all better now, thank God.

      Last night I was talking to Tommy about something and mentioned my blog, that I had written about the subject in here.  I asked him if he had read it, he said no.    Then he told me the nicest, sweetest, kindest thing.    He said he doesn't make it a point to read my blog, because he sees my blog as my personal, private thoughts, like a diary, and while its ok for people who don't know me, see me every day, etc, to read it, him and others who know me well reading it is a different story.    I was so shocked, amazed, glad, happy, you name it, blessed, that he feels that way.  Why, because it shows me that he "gets" it.  He knows my blog is my release.  Instead of keeping it all in, and stewing on stuff, I come here to release all those emotions that are going on inside my head.  My honey knows I need this.   Ain't it sweet.

Savannah will mis saying "hey" to her Dale when she comes down.  Renee will miss losing herself in his sea blue eyes.  Oh my Dale, my sweet, sweet, cardboard Dale, what will life be like without you?

      Ever meet one of those women,you know the ones, they are attractive, have a great personality, good job, brains, not a fat cell on their bodies, but are with losers for men?  Why does that happen?  Why do those women who could have any man on earth chose to be with the low lifes that treat them badly, cheat on them, do drugs, won't work, and generally just lay on their fat lazy butts all day?  It is a phenomenon I will never understand.   I have a sister that we will call S.  She is one of those women.  Or at least she was in her younger days, and still thinks she is now.  Now, she looks like a used up worn peice of leather.    She has been married 8 times.  Yes 8.  Two times, she married the same man twice.  Only once that I can remember has she been with a man that didn't beat her, starve her, sell her, or make her do sick stuff.    She left that husband, said she wasn't worthy of him.  I don't understand.

      The honest to goodness, real life, with animals and everything  urlLink circus  is in town.    Not the big one, but the  urlLink hometown version .  But hey, a circus is a circus right?  My SIL called, and she had an extra ticket.  A mutual friend of ours gave them free tickets, and she had extra.    How do you decide which one of 5 children gets to go to the circus while the others stay home?  It was actually pretty easy.  Noah was the lucky recipient of the free ticket.    The older boys had all been, and could remember going.  Noah had been, but was only 1yr old, so he hadn't a clue of going.  My SIL picked him up, and off they went.  My baby, my little one, off by himself to the circus.  He was nervous, I was nervous.    When he got home, he was telling all about the elephants, the dog that stole the clowns hot dogs, the people who swung up high and fell onto the net, all the horse riders, yeah, we made the right  choice.   the friend is hoping to get more free tickets for later this week.  I hope he does.  My other boys would love it.

      Did you know a lack of B12 can really mess your body up?  Seems as if that is one of my dad's problems, his B12 level is only 52, when it is supposed to be at least 211.    He started B12 shots today.  Its a good thing too, he has had a very bad day today.  Can't seem to get out of bed.  So, hopefully, we are on the way to finding out what all is wrong with him..  He told me today he dreads having the CT scan and the MRI.  HE is afraid of what they will find.  I laughingly told him he was scared of finding out what was going to kill him before it did.  He said yep.  I am.

      I did something that is very rare among mom's today.  I went shopping, without the kids, and didn't buy them anything!  Gasp, horror, I know,  HOW COULD I DO THAT??????  I will probably be kicked out of Moms club of America now, but hey, it was fun.  I loved it.  I was pure blissfullness, walking around  urlLink Walmart , with no kids fussing, I didn't have to get down on all fours, looking under clothes to see where my precious ones are hiding.  When I got to the checkout, I didn't have to rummage thru the buggy to see what "extras" I had picked up without knowing.    TO my amazement, those screaming and moans I am used to hearing upon entering the  urlLink lingerie department , aren't provided by Walmart, those were actually coming from my boys.  Seems as if boys don't like it when "mom" shops for lingerie.  Hmmmmm, I wonder why.  I got to slowly, feel all the shirts, which ones were soft, which ones were pure starch, and which ones were just plain ol itchy.  I wandered thru housewares, and imagined my bathroom in all the different ensembles.  Did I want a pink, girly bathroom, or did I want  a gender neutral one?    I longed wistfully at the 2 piece bathing suits that will never, ever, appear on my body.  Wondering if there is a mom only beach somewhere that the pre-requisite is that you still have on at least 50 lbs of baby fat before you can enter.    Oh, and lets not forget the  urlLink Sterilite  dept.  All those storage totes, bins, racks, do-dad holders, you name it, it has a place.  Ohhhhh, if only I were rich, and could buy all those matching totes, in white no less, and not worry about them collecting dust and soon turning first murky gray, and they ashy black.    Yes, me and my imagination, enjoyed ourselves today.  The only thing that would have made it better would be if I had a buddy with me, another mom, who was on holiday from her kids too.  And ice cream.  urlLink Ice cream  makes the world a much better place.

      Between  urlLink Renee,  and  urlLink Shara , they have me doing quizzes.  This one at tickle was intense for me.  I don't know why, maybe I am intimidated by  urlLink ink blot  tests!    Angie, your subconscious mind is driven most by Curiosity   You are full of questions about life, people, and your own potential. You spend more time than others imagining the possibilities for your life — and you're open to things others are too afraid to consider.  You have an almost physical need to know and do more. It's only through new experiences that you feel a greater understanding of yourself and the world. You also have a rebellious streak that shows up when you feel unable to truly influence the world or circumstances around you. Your appetite for novel experiences also shows an openness others don't have, but wish they did.   Your psyche is very rich; the more you learn about it, the more you will understand who you really are.

      This morning, my sis took my dad to the doc, at the local VA hospital.  They just got home, it is 2:30pm, his appointment was at 7:30am.  Long day.  THey ruled out prostrate cancer, and bladder cancer, he has arthritis in his neck along with bone spurs, and arthur is in his knee too.  HE has to go for an MRI in September, but they want to do a CT scan before then to see if they can find anything before then.   His white blood count is too low as is is red blood count, so they thinkhe is bleeding somwhere, they just aren't sure where.  We should knwo more later today when the rest of his blood work is in.    ALl in all, he is a pretty healthy 84 year old.  Thank God.

      YOu may have noticed, or not that I haven't posted about the NBA finals.  Most sports finals, I post about, I watch them, and I get into them.  NOT NBA.  If I were to pull for a team, it would be Detroit.  I can't stand the lakers.  Kobe, and Shaq are not my favorite people in the world.    I can't stand pro basketball.  Just can't.  I like college ball, I go completly nuts at March Madness. Especially watching my Duke Blue Devils.  I even enjoy Carolina now that Roy Williams is there.  I like Roy, he is from my hometown!  Tommy is watching the game right now, so I am getting to play on the computer, without feeling guilty over not spending that time with my family.    Dale JR did good today.  I was soooo afraid he was gonna lose his points lead, but miracle upon miracle happened for him today, and he didn't.  I was truly amazed.  He finished 3rd.  WOW. AND increased his points lead to 98 points!  GOOOOO JUNYA!!!!!

      Renee and Stan came down tonight.  Just for a little while, but it was nice to have company over.  If you can consider them company.  The boys were wanting to target practice with Stan's 9mm and Tommys 357 magnum.  Guess what they were wanting to use for target practice ?   My Dale.  They thought it would be a fantastic idea to use my lifesize man as their target.  I told them no way, no how, that was MY man.  Now I fear that one day, I will come home from the store to find my Dale outside with holes in him.  They already use their nerf guns on him.  Boys.

      I made a boo boo.  You all know my dad is sick and won't go to the doc.  Well, he had told my sis about something a couple of weeks ago, and Thursday, she finally told me about it.    Seems as if he woke up one  morning with blood down his leg from his private parts.  He told her, and she told me this past week.  The day she told me, Dad was outside in the beating sun, with a tiller, tiling up the ground on a bank that is about 80 degree angle.  He can't hardly stand up on flat ground and here he is using machinery on a hill he cant stand on without falling.    So, I  fussed at him.  Big.  I have come to the decision that if he wants to kill himself working, fine.  But he had my two oldest sons working with him, trying to get them to use the chain saw.  When they wouldn't he got out the chain saw and was using it on a tree above their heads.  Needless to say, I was a bit upset.  This morning, I call my sis about a non family matter, and she mentions dad's new symptom.  And asks if he ever talked to me aobut it.  I told her yes, after I brought it up.  Now she is mad at me, because I mentioned it to dad.    Sheesh, yesterday it was government politics, today it is family politics.  I jsut can't win.

      Thanks to  urlLink Jenn , I remembered that Tommy's tag on his car was expired, as well as the inspection sticker.  So today was my day to get those thing taken care of.    First stop, the tag office, where I wait in line for over 30 minutes, without any type of paper,or anything for identification.  Luckily, Tommy's driver's license number is on our checks, so  I gave them that.  Then the nice lady behind the desk asks me for my tax bill reciept.  They need to know positively that I have paid the property taxes on the car.  I ask how do I get on of those.  She sends me to the county court house.  I go down town where you have to pay for everywhere you park, searching for a parking spot that won't make me walk a mile to the courthouse.  I find one right smack in front of the court house.  What luck.  Walk to the front door, only to read a sign telling me I have to enter at the side entrance.  Sheesh.  I go there, empty my pockets on the little tray, send my purse thru the xray thingy and sendmy poor little boys thru their first metal detector.  I think Noah was terrified.  Finally find the tax collector's office, wait in line again, only to be told we never paid the taxes on Tommy's car.    Get those paid, go back to the DMV, stand in line again, get the tag, then go to the auto shop to have the car inspected and the oil changed.  It is burning hot outside, so I decided to walk down the road with the 3 boys I have with me, and sit in Burger King with a nice cold coke, and work on my menu for the month while they work on the car.  It was so nice to sit and relax in air conditioning.  Tommy's car doens't have air conditioning.  Neither does my van, but hey, it doesnt' run anyhow, so who cares.  Go back to the shop, all nice and relaxed, and see they didn't inspect the car.  By now, I am starting to get a bit miffed.  So I go in, all ready to yell, stomp and snort, and ask just exactly why they didn't inspect is like I had asked.  IT DIDN'T PASS INSPECTION.  AAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH.    Something about the muffler was wrong, so they wouldn't pass it.  Now this same shop, passed my van.  Let me tell you a bit about my van:  1-no rearview mirror 2-no side mirrors 3-front glass is busted 5-no turn signals 6-no brake lights  and it passed inspection.  The muffler either has a hole in it, or is hooked up wrong, and they won't inspect it.  My van is barely holding it together, and it passes.    Calgon, take me away....

      Savannah can't decide if she likes Dale or not.  At first, he scared her.  Then she was shy around him, now, today, she finally touched him.  She kept saying, "who's that"  all day, so finally I told her to go touch him, he wouldn't bite.    She walks very slowly, with her head bent down peeping her eyes up from under her bangs, edging around the bookshelf, and then creeps her hand inch by inch out to touch him.  Finally, she touches his leg.  "what's that" she says, his pants I tell her.  oh.  the we do the what's that game with every peice of clothing he has on.  Now, she walks in and the first thing she says is "hey dale"    I will make a NASCAR fan out of her yet.

      I must confess, I have a new man in my life.  His name is Dale, he is 29 years old, with reddish blonde hair, and is gorgeous.  I see him every day, night, all the time, every chance I get, there he is.    He came into my life a few days ago.  Tommy knows about him, in fact, Tommy is the one who set us up.  Yes, he set us up.  Dale is a lifesize cardboard cut out of Dale Earnhardt Jr.  He is standing in my living room as I type this.  Everyone who comes into the house, says hey to him, and bye when they leave.    Dale JR. is my favorite NASCAR driver.  He is a spokesperson for Polaris 4 wheelers, and Tommy works at a Polaris dealership.  When their recent ad campaign was over, Tommy's boss was kind enough to let Tommy bring my Dale home to me.    Good thing Tommy isn't a jealous man.

      DO you know what the Taj Mahal is?  that was one of the questions on the test for the boys.  THey showed a pic of it, and asked what it was.    Colby: Taj Mahal (age 10)  Seth: soem palace in India (age 12)   Casey: (not seeing the pic just hearing the name from the before mentioned boys )  A Casino in Atlantic City.  (age 12)    Oh my, maybe we need to study palaces in India next year.

      Not completely, but some.    Overall it was a good day, the boys had a great time inbetween tests, and played with the other kids.    Heath decided his mom needed to go and leave him with Angie.  He told her to go, and make sure she weft him wiff angie.  I was touched.    I dont see Seth, Colby and Heath as often as I would like, so for my 3 year old nephew to like me, and want mom to leave him with me.  I am special.  I am one of a very short list.  How proud that makes me.  Noah stayed home with Tommy, since it was his day off, but soon got bored without any brothers to play with, so he went to Savannah's.  When he got home, I was laying in bed, resting my aching head, and he came and surprised me.  (at least he thought he was) and said "guess where I was ALL DAY LONG" streaching out the words as long as he could.  He was so excited he had stayed with Nay and Savannah all day without any brothers.  Such a big acheivement for him.

      I am right now.    Today the boys did their state mandated testing for homeschool.  We had to be there at 8am, and I got to come home at 4pm.    I don't know if it is the stress from all 4 boys testing, or having extra kids at our church for testing, or playing hostess to all teh people I don't know, or what, but I am bushed.    The boys did ok.  TJ and Casey didn't do as well as they could have.  Will made a definate improvement over last year.  ANd Jamie did great.  I was so proud of him.    Casey had a huge case of nerves, and just shut down.  The testor knew it too.  She said she could tell he wasn't thinking clearly, some of the stuff he missed, there is no way on earth he should have missed it if his brain was functioning right.    TJ, well, he just didnt' try as hard as he shoud have.  Especially on the speed drills and stuff.  I think he froze, or got over confident.    Oh well, it is over for another year.  yay.

      Today I kept my nephews, Seth, Colby, and Heath.  And I kept Savannah. I all went really well, they are all good kids.  Honest.    Heath and Savannah are only about 5 weeks apart in age, so it was fun to watch them together.  Both would complain about the other one taking their turn, Heath tried to eat Savannah's food (big no-no) and got upset when I didn't ahve a sippy of milk for him.  He wanted Savannah's.  He probably would have puked right there in the kitchen floor if he had tasted hers.  (it has one of her meds in it.)  But they did good.  The best part was when they were riding skateboards with Noah.  Now mind you, Noah is 3 years older than them, but basically the same size as them.  Taller, but not much.    Noah is on the front of the board, then Heath, then Savannah.  ALl in sitting positions.  When they say  "one,dwo,fwee, goooooo" they all ift their feet up, and Noah grabs the skateboard, Heath grabs Noah's shoulders, Savannah grabs Heath's shoulders, and down the hill they go.  (small incline)  then at the bottom of the hill, when they stop, they all fall off, to the ground acting like they crashed.  I tried to video it, but as usual, my camcorder battery was dead.  No wonder I don't have any pics of my kids.  My battery is always dead.

      the internet community amazes me.  Literally, totally, completely, utter amazement.    I have recieved so much response about Savannah.  I get tears in my eyes, reading posts others have made on THEIR blogs about her.    I just want to say thank you.  All of the posts have been so well written, and all for a little girl you haven't been blessed to meet.    Please, keep it up!  The more people who know her story, the better.  The more prayers and thoughts, and donations, the better.    Add her links to your pages, tell others about her, I know that as soon as they see her face, smiling at them, she will steal their hearts too.  That smile is what does it.    She wanted to ride in "gee's car'y" tonight, so I brought her home with me for a few minutes.  She walks in the door, and announces "PRIIIIIIZZZZZEEEEE" to my boys, and Tommy.  It tickled her to death to walk in my house and scream at them!  She loves surprising people.  When her mom comes to pick her up on Thursdays, she always runs and hides, normally with her head buried in my couch cushions, and then "prizes" Renee when she comes in the door.  That is if you can ignore the giggles coming up from the couch.  She is like an Ostrich, with her head buried, and her rear high in the air.  Giggling like a tickle-me-elmo, trying to cover it up.     Thank you again for all the support.  I know when Renee gets on the computer, she will be as amazed as I was.  I love my little community.

      Remember growing up how saturday was THE best day of the week.  You would get up early, on your own, with no parental encouragement.  Drag your blankey, pillow to the living room, right in front of the TV.  Only getting up to grab the box of Crunch Berries, and a glass of coke.  Maybe you would get up and pee once.    Then you would lay there all day, until all the Saturday cartoons go off.  Never moving, not playing outside, nothing.  That was before cartoon network, toon disney, and nickelodeon came along.  Now kids have access to cartoons 24/7, anytime you want a cartoon, you can find one.   Not so when I was growing up.  the only time we got cartoons was on Saturday mornings.  Scooby Doo, bugs bunny, speed racer, were weekly staples.  We were also a skinny bunch.  No obese kids then.  Why?  Because we didn't lay on our butts all day long watching TV and playing video games.  We read books.  We played outside.  We used our imaginations.   I can remember making a mud island in our yard.  I took tree branches and made them the trees on my mountain.  Used my brothers lincoln logs to build the houses.  His hot wheels were the vehicles.  Barbie was the queen to Ken's king.  I even put a moat around the castle.  Would my kdis do that today?  No.  And I have all boys!   Now if their isn't electricity involved, kids won't play it.  They don't have imaginations, lincoln logs are "boring", hot wheels are for collectors, and they wouldn't dare play in mud.   They will play baseball, basketball, football, and such.  But nothing that doesnt' already come with the rules laid out.   I wish my kids had the saturdays I had, to my kids, saturday is just another day of the week.

      No poker tonight.  We have to make sure none of us are going to come down with Jamie's virus before we are around Savannah.  So that means no poker this week.   I have been trying to get stores to donate frozen hamburgers, paper products, etc for Savannah's benefit dinner next week.  One store has donated a box of 20 hamburgers.  One Store.  That is pathetic.  We need at least 100.   We moved my computer from the office to the living room so I can sit in the LR with Tommy of the evening instead of being in opposite ends of the house.  I like it in here.  I can watch TV, sit by my hubby, and surf all at the same time.  Nice.  Jamie wants to go to public school next year.  He is the first one of my kids to never go to public school.  He just wants to experience it.   EJ told my neighbors that Jamie has Malaria.  They sent their daughter down to check and see what was going on.  I laughed when she said Malaria.   I found a pic yesterday of me right after me and Tommy got married.  he snuck into the bedroom while I was getting ready for work.  It is his favorite pic ever of me.  It's in the gun safe now, where the kids can't see it.   Tommy jsut embarassed me BAD.  HE told the boys, "mom gets jiggy with it sometimes boys."  Now the boys are letting us know we aren't always as quiet as we think we are.  My face is red. Face it, we have 5 kids, we have a good sex life!  Sheesh.  I feel sorry for the Amish kids on the new show, Amish in the city.  The city kids on this show are brats.  Random sight:  while walking thru downtown in the city, Tommy and I walk by a pub, with a women's group sitting outside, one woman was sitting in a chair shearing a long haired rabbit.  Literally, sitting on the side of a city street, trimming a long haired rabbit.  Another woman was taking the fur, and weaving it somehow into yarn.   What the...

      While having our quiet time the other night, I mentioned to Tommy that I had heard from the local high school that day.  This confused my husband, I have forgotten to tell him I had called to ask about Driver's ed classed for our oldest.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had also failed to realize we would have a freshman in high school in 2 weeks if he were in public school.&nbsp;   Freshman.  Me, Tommy, parents of a high schooler.&nbsp; I for one know I am NOT old enough to have a high school kid.&nbsp; I know this hit Tommy pretty hard.&nbsp; Why, because he kept repeating, "high schooler" over and over.&nbsp;   All other things aside, you know mid life crisis, keeping a marriage alive, dealing with aging parents.&nbsp; Nothing quite hits you in the gut like those words, "oh, our oldest starts high school this year"&nbsp; BAM!&nbsp; Right in the gut, all of the sudden the joints don't work like they used to.&nbsp; Staying up past midnight takes days to recover from.&nbsp; Playing football in the yard with the boys seems to inflict more injuries than normal, and not on the kids.&nbsp; Conversations seem to turn more towards adult topics, then you realize "wait, this is my SON saying this stuff".&nbsp; Where did the kids with the smile that went all over his face go to?&nbsp; And why did this kid with a perma-scowl replace him?  We are lucky, the public school system does have to let him enroll in driver's ed with them.&nbsp; Thank God.&nbsp; He will start sometime in the fall, or early winter.&nbsp; I am not ready for this.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      There is nothing worse in life than having a sick child.&nbsp;   It evokes all the feelings of&nbsp; helplessness, inadaquacy, and just plain old fear.   Jamie is sick.&nbsp; While on date night, the phone rings, and Renee tells me that I have a sick boy.&nbsp; He is running a temp, and has thrown up.&nbsp; We head home right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renee sent Jamie to our house with TJ, since we would be home so soon.&nbsp; Savannah can't be exposed to illness.&nbsp; Any kind of virus will put her in the hospital.&nbsp; I pray she doesn't get this.   When we get home, I love on Jamie, and get him settled in bed.&nbsp; I lay beside him, listening to his breathing.&nbsp; It was so heavy and so fast.&nbsp; I could feel this heart beating thru the covers, his body heat was making me sweat.&nbsp; This was after giving him Motrin to bring it down.&nbsp; Every few seconds, low moans would escape, while the muscles in his legs were twitching from the heat.&nbsp;   He slept all evening, peacefully.&nbsp;   Then the chills hit.&nbsp; His skin was burning to the touch, his face was blood red, his eyes were blood shot, and still sunk in his head.&nbsp; We couldn't get him warm enough to stop the chills.&nbsp; It is 1am, and his is getting worse.&nbsp; His head is hurting so severely he can't move, talk, or really answer us.&nbsp;   By 2am, we are in the ER.&nbsp; They finally are able to get the temp down, and once it goes down, Jamie slowly returned to his normal self.&nbsp; He is cracking jokes with the doctor, sitting in bed making fun of his brother, talking about his favorite video game, and talking about the Atlanta Braves.&nbsp; My baby is back.   We have slept most of the day, he is still very sick.&nbsp; We are waiting on his blood culture to come back, sometime tomorrow, but he will be ok.&nbsp; Fevers are scary, especially for parents.&nbsp;

      Something strange happened tonight.&nbsp;   It came from left field, and took me totally by surprise.&nbsp;   Tommy told me he likes my writing.&nbsp;   I don't really know why this shocked me so much, but it almost left me breathless.&nbsp; Knocked me for a loop actually.&nbsp;   It wasn't expected, or even wanted.&nbsp; But I like it.&nbsp;   For a long time, I have been a mom.&nbsp; Just a mom, completely a mom.&nbsp; Blogging has opened up parts of me I didn't know existed.&nbsp; Feelings I didn't know I had, thoughts I would&nbsp; never have dreamed of having, much less putting them down in black and white for others to read.&nbsp;   When a person, especially a woman, has children, they lose their identity.&nbsp; Whether by choice, or circumstance, you are no longer "Angi, college grad who loves to sing, read and go 4 wheelin', and once aspired to be a lawyer", you are "Tj's mom", "the mom with all the boys&nbsp;".&nbsp; I don't know how many times I have been introduced as that.&nbsp; That is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a role, I take on with humility, because I am blessed enough to be someone's mom.&nbsp; I am a mother.&nbsp; It is what I was born to do.&nbsp; Honestly, it is.&nbsp; I am one of those natural, instinctive mothers.&nbsp; I can hear another woman's child cry, and tell you what is wrong with it.&nbsp; It is in my genes, to be a mother.&nbsp;   But sometimes, it is nice to be recognized as something else.&nbsp; Something not at all related to being a mom.&nbsp; Like my husband telling me he enjoys my writing.&nbsp;   Thanks honey.&nbsp; I needed that.&nbsp;

Some days, it's hard to pin point exactly what drives me to homeschool my boys.&nbsp; There are so many reasons for us.&nbsp; Ranging from , just wanting to spend more time with my kids, to not liking the ideas that public school was putting in their heads, to safety.&nbsp; Ask me today, I will give you one reason, ask me tomorrow, I will give another.&nbsp; And some days, I will just flat out tell you "I MUST BE CRAZY"   With all the "stuff" going on in today's world.&nbsp; I feel safer with my kids at home.&nbsp; All the way around.&nbsp; In my kids elementary school, there wasn't much violence, but there was tons of sex.&nbsp; Yes, I said sex.&nbsp; I know a kid who in Kindergarten, saw&nbsp; one boy servicing another boy in the bathroom, they were all 5-6 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Tj was in 4th grade, he couldn't sleep at night, I finally drug it out of him one night, that kids were spreading rumors about him sleeping with a 2nd grader.&nbsp; Two kids in his class got busted in the girls bedroom by her parents after school.&nbsp; One kid, got up in the middle of class, pulled his pants and underwear down and showed the family jewels to the entire class.&nbsp; When the teacher called his dad, the boy got a "atta boy".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What 10 year old needs to deal with that on a daily basis.&nbsp;   There many other things that led up to us taking our kids out of public school.&nbsp; Little things kept piling on one another, until this huge pile of junk was in front of us.&nbsp; Then, Casey, who had just finished second grade, came to me one day and asked, "please mom, homeschool me, I don't think I can go back there."&nbsp; He was miserable.&nbsp;   When a child is that miserable, you have to act.&nbsp; Our only choice was homeschool.&nbsp; Private school is way too expensive, so was moving to another district.&nbsp;   What did I get in return?   My boys back.&nbsp;   When a child goes to school, they slowly change, little by little, parents are moved out of their lives, and friends move in.&nbsp; They take on each others personality traits, they talk like each other, they act like each other, the think alike.&nbsp;   The older a kid gets, the less time he has for his parents.&nbsp; Only natural.&nbsp; But at least with homeschooling, I can slow the process down a bit.&nbsp; So far, they don't think they are missing out on anything, I don't have to hear the "but his parents let him do it" or "you don't want me to have a life."&nbsp; YET.&nbsp; I know the day will come and those words will leave my child's lips and reach my ears at lightening fast speed, and pierce my heart.&nbsp; But I have delayed it.&nbsp;   My sons have time to mature at their own rate, to figure out who they are, what their likes are, what their dislikes are, on their own speed.&nbsp; They aren't as influenced by peers to dress a certain way, or act a certain way.&nbsp; They are free to make those decisions on their own,&nbsp; and not be ridiculed if it doesn't fit into what society deems as normal.   They don't have to deal with the pressure to be the cool kid, or the smart kid, or the jock, or a geek.&nbsp; They don't have to succomb to labels.&nbsp; They make their own labels.&nbsp;   My 14 year old isn't afraid to kiss my and hug me in front of his friends, to him, its only natural.&nbsp; He loves his parents.&nbsp;   All of our boys come to us with questions about life.&nbsp; we talk openly about sex, drugs and drinking.&nbsp; We talk openly about homosexuality,&nbsp; the war on terror, and other news topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I like being able to talk to my kids about this stuff.&nbsp; I like to hear their opinions, and what they have to say about stuff.&nbsp; I like being able to tell them my opinions.&nbsp; But most of all, I like making sure they are informed enough to make their own conclusions.&nbsp; Not just go along with the crowd.   My oldest wants to go to Duke.&nbsp; He has already skipped one grade, and is trying this year to get two years work done in one.&nbsp; He wants to graduate in 2006.&nbsp; Go to a local school until he turns 17, then apply to Duke.&nbsp;   HE made the decision to concentrate on school, instead of girls.&nbsp; He has set his goals in life.&nbsp; In public school, he was one of the "cool" kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is smart, atheletic, and a good looking kid.&nbsp; HE has a very outgoing personality, and isnt' afraid to share his opinion.&nbsp; Just ask his sunday school teacher.&nbsp; She taught something he didn't agree with, he told her he disagreed.&nbsp; And then, he told her why, and was able to back it up.&nbsp;   My two oldest made the decision last year, and again this year to keep homeschooling.&nbsp; By doing so, they give up the ability to play school sports.&nbsp; School sports is something very close to both of their hearts.&nbsp; They have always planned on playing school sports, then college, and pro.&nbsp; Now, they will ahve to find another venue to get their talent spotted.&nbsp; But they don't care.&nbsp; They want to stay home.&nbsp;   I'm more than willing to teach them at home.&nbsp; I want my boys to be a help to this world one day, to actively participate in life,&nbsp; to be productive, instead of just muddling through day to day.&nbsp; Isnt' that what parents are for?

      I was going to write apost today about why I homeschool my kids.&nbsp; In fact, I did write the post, but decided not to publish it.&nbsp; I'm not sure why.  Instead this one is for Tommy.  Those of you that have been reading my blog for awhile know that we have had a rough several months.&nbsp; Very rough.&nbsp; It has been harder the past 6months, than our entire 16 years together.&nbsp; That's bad.&nbsp;   But I have to say, we have handled it pretty well.&nbsp; The thing that has helped us the most is dating again.&nbsp;  Dating again, has let us prove to each other how committed we are to this marriage.&nbsp; Every Tuesday night, we get Renee and Stan to babysit the boys, and we go out.&nbsp; It doesnt' matter where, or how long, as long as we are together, without the kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we became parents, we lost the couple, and became totally and completely involved with our children.&nbsp; Every second of every day was devoted to them.&nbsp; At least for me it was.&nbsp; I tended to neglect my husband, for taking care of my babies.&nbsp;   A few weeks ago, Tommy asked me if I thought Renee and Stan would trade one day a week with us, so both couples could have alone time.&nbsp; It was the best thing any of us could have done.&nbsp;   I've notice, we smile at each other more, I call him at work more to see how his day is going.&nbsp; We sit on the couch together watching TV, instead of being off in seperate rooms.&nbsp; Almost every night, we cuddle, talk about various things from the day, until we are both to tired to speak, and then just fall asleep.&nbsp; It is definitly the little things.&nbsp; The looks between the two of us, when the kids aren't watching us.&nbsp; The every so slight pat on the butt when we pass in the hallway.&nbsp; Coming back for one more kiss goodbye before leaving for work.&nbsp; Telling me I am beautiful, 16 years, 5 kids and many, many extra pounds after that first initial "hot" streak came alive.&nbsp;   I feel more in love with my husband than I was on the day I married him.&nbsp; I feel closer to him than I have ever felt.&nbsp; I miss him during the day while he is at work.&nbsp; I smell his shirts before laundering them, just to get a whiff of him.&nbsp;   That's what dating your husband does.&nbsp; It changes everything.

      I must tell you that  urlLink Lance Armstrong  is incredible.&nbsp;   Most Americans aren't fans of  urlLink bicycling .&nbsp; It is most definitely a European sport.&nbsp; But I&nbsp; love it.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because of Lance.&nbsp;   He is an incredible athlete.&nbsp; With the determination, courage and strength that most people dream about, he lives his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Before ever winning his first  urlLink Tour de France , he won the most difficult battle of all, the battle for his life.&nbsp; He fought cancer.&nbsp; Prostrate cancer.&nbsp; I know, you're thinking, prostrate cancer, big deal, men fight that all the time.&nbsp; Armostrong's cancer was an agressive type, and it made it way thru his body and landed in his brain.&nbsp; Brain cancer IS a big deal.&nbsp; But Armstrong beat it.&nbsp; He beat it then came back to win 5 Tour de France's and tommorrow he will do the unthinkable, he will take &nbsp;home the&nbsp; trophy for the 6th time.&nbsp; NO ONE, I say, NO ONE has every won 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when you ask him how he does it, he never fails to mention his teammates,"the blueberries" as the  urlLink USPS teammembers  are nicknamed.&nbsp; He wil tell you, that without "ace" and Floyd, he couldn't have made it on thsoe mountain stages.&nbsp; That George was his right hand made on the flat stages.&nbsp; He is more than willing to share the glory.&nbsp; Even trying to get Floyd to take a win on stage 17.&nbsp;   This year he has not only proven he is the man to beat, he has slammed the door on his critics, he has rubbed it in their faces by winning in such a way that it can never be desputed that he is the best.&nbsp; Last year, his rival, Jan Ullrich was 61 seconds behind him.&nbsp; This year, the closest to him is 6 minutes, 36 seconds behind him.&nbsp; Lance has had to ride thru fans that were against him, calling him names, spitting on him, and had to deal with reporters trying to rummage his room while he was racing.&nbsp; Even his mentor, Greg Lamond has been throwing accusations at him.&nbsp; But still, he pedals on.&nbsp;   But beyond all the accomplishments on the course, his accomplishments off course are even better.&nbsp; He will always tell you, he is a cancer survivor first, Tour de France winner second.&nbsp; He started his own  urlLink foundation  to help with cancer research.&nbsp; He has&nbsp;created a  urlLink huge support group  for cancer survivors and those living with cancer to connect with each other.&nbsp; Tirelessly working to raise funds, and more importantly to raise awareness, he goes at top speed all the time.&nbsp;   One more plus, he is dating  urlLink Sheryl Crow , who happens to be my favorite.&nbsp; She has given up her rockstar life to follow him on the road.&nbsp; She is making sure his laundry is done, the house is clean, and that is life is just a little bit simpler while on his quest for a 6th Tour title.&nbsp; She is standing by her man.&nbsp; Yeah, she will return to the road, return to playing concerts for all of us adoring fans, but for now, she is content to blend into the wallpaper and watch as her man does what he does best.&nbsp; Win.  &nbsp;   urlLink  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       First off, the good news,  SAVANNAH IS A GO!!!!!!!!!!!   She should be on the list for a new liver within 2 weeks.&nbsp; She did great with all of her tests, they didn't have to sedate her like they thought they would have to, and all her results were good.&nbsp; So she is a go for the transplant.&nbsp; After she is on the registry, then the donor can start her testing.&nbsp; It is getting closer and closer.&nbsp; WHooooooooHooooooooo!!!!     &nbsp;  Last night, Noah ws absolutly adorable.&nbsp; He is six years old, but small for his age, so sometimes it is hard to remember he is as old as 6, he looks more like a four year old.&nbsp; But last night, he ws going around, asking me and his dad, "can we go to bed now"&nbsp; all night long.&nbsp; The boy was ready for bed the second that tooth came out of his head.&nbsp;   He was eating supper, and told me the tooth was stuck.&nbsp; Sure enough it was laying down flat.&nbsp; Tommy told him to pull it, of course, not ever losing a tooth before, he was scared.&nbsp; So Noah got dad some tissue, goes to dad with these huge, huge tears in&nbsp; his eyes, his bottom lip quivering, scared to death.&nbsp; Tommy grabs the tooth and gently pulls, of course it was about to fall out on its own, so it didn't hurt.&nbsp; Tommy shows the tooth to Noah and suddenly in the biggest voice that has ever come out of that little body  "welllllll, that didn't hurt?".&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Finally, Noah talks all of us into bed.&nbsp; Bedtime is noisy around here, there are 7 of us, so it takes awhile to get all the "night, I love you's" in, we are midway thru and Noah pops up,   "would ya'll hush and go to sleep, we all have to be asleep, she won't come, HUSH"&nbsp;   Of course we all ablige the little brat.&nbsp;    He snuggles up to mom, and whispers in my ear "  if we leave the window open will somebody break in?  "&nbsp; Then it dawns on me, he is worried about the tooth fairy getting in.&nbsp; "  Tj locked the door, how will she get in? " &nbsp; Awwwwww, moms heart breaks.&nbsp; "  The tooth fairy is like Santa, she has magic fairy dust that lets her get into people's houses  "&nbsp; I tell him, like a good mommy, lying to her baby.&nbsp;   "huh, Santa has fairy dust?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Yes, I have corrupted my son, lied like a dog, and ruined him forever.&nbsp; What are mommies for?   It is a mom's job to teach these lies to her kids.&nbsp; I know alot of people who think it is wrong, corupt even to teach kids about Santa, the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny.&nbsp; These things are all part of growing up.&nbsp; Kids have to deal with too much reality too soon these days, so I say let them have all the fantasy they can get while they are young.&nbsp;   Tonight is Poker Night, and I am needing it.&nbsp; Last night was one of those, don't mess with mom nights, I even broke my "no computer when Tommy is home" rule.&nbsp; I had too.&nbsp; I had one of those  feel the rage boiling up inside  nights.&nbsp; Not that I was angry, just didn't need to be messd with.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need chocolate, lots and lots of chocolate, mini M & M's to be exact, a bag of them,&nbsp; and a bag of Brach's Malted Milk Balls, Hershey's kisses would be good too.&nbsp; I feel a grocery run coming on.&nbsp; It is calling me, I can hear it.&nbsp;   Later, I'm gonna post about the Tour De France.&nbsp; I had one all written up, with links and everything last night, and it disappeared into la-la land.&nbsp;

      I don't talk about it much.&nbsp; Hardly ever in fact.&nbsp;   I'm adopted.&nbsp; No, there is no shame in that.&nbsp; In fact, I am grateful to God for giving me to the parents he did.&nbsp; I grew up feeling like&nbsp; princess, I have always known I am loved.&nbsp; Never for one minute have I doubted it.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp;   My birth mother was 18 when she got pregnant with me.&nbsp; This was a time when girls were shunned for getting knocked up.&nbsp; More than one girl found herself married to a guy she hardly knew, because she had caved in to his charm.&nbsp; This wasn't the case with my bio mom, who I will refer to as BM.&nbsp;   In high school, she was one of THOSE girls, the girl guys knew would give in.&nbsp; She made fun of the goody-goody girls.&nbsp; Picked on them unmercilessly.&nbsp; One of those girls would become my older sister one day.&nbsp; Ironic huh.&nbsp;   BM worked at a Shoney's restaurant, as a waitress.&nbsp; Her boss was my sperm donor.&nbsp; She was 18, he was in his late 20's married, with 3 kids.&nbsp; Not a good combination.&nbsp; Of course, he wasn't interested in the fact he had knocked her up.&nbsp; He could care less.&nbsp; All of the boys who hung out at the restaurant were just glad she hadn't put the blame on them.&nbsp; One of them was my future brother.&nbsp; More irony.  When I was 4 months old, I had a baby sitter, who would one day be my older sister also.&nbsp; Yet more irony.&nbsp;   BM called the parents of the baby sitter, goody-goody girl, and punk from the restaurant, and asked these nice folks if they wanted her baby.&nbsp; They needed to talk about it, I mean the wife was 45, and the husband was 48.&nbsp; Their kids were all grown up, the youngest was 15 (the babysitter).&nbsp; DId they really want to do this again.&nbsp; Tie themsleves down to someones elses child?&nbsp;   Mom, wanted to see this baby.&nbsp; When she showed up to visit, I was 4 months old, living in a room with a dog and her 10 puppies.&nbsp; My diaper hadn't been changed in days.&nbsp; There was a crust of milk caked to my scalp 1/4 inch thick.&nbsp; I was sick.&nbsp; Very, very sick.&nbsp; Mymom went straight home and told my dad to "go get that baby"&nbsp;.&nbsp; He decided to check things out, took a friend of his with him, and once he saw me, he loved me, just like mom had.&nbsp; They brought me home, right then and there.&nbsp;   Fast forward 23 years later, and BM calls my parents.&nbsp; She wants to meet me.&nbsp; If I am willing.&nbsp;   Considering the fact that I know absolutly nothing about myself, I agree.&nbsp; I wanted to know who my sperm donor was, I wanted to know my medical history, I wanted to see someone that maybe, just maybe I looked like.&nbsp; Or that looked like me.&nbsp;   When we met, BM brought my grnadmother with her.&nbsp; I had never met a grandparent, that I remembered.&nbsp; My adoptive grandparents were gone before I was born, or soon after.&nbsp; I actually had a grandmother.&nbsp; I liked my grandmother.&nbsp; She was nice.&nbsp; Her daughter wasn't.   BM walked into my parents house, and thanked them for raising "her" daughter.&nbsp; She called my husband "her" son in law, referred to herself as "mamaw" to my son, telling my parents what an adorable "grandson" she had.&nbsp; She even had the nerve to scold my son.&nbsp; NOt a smart move.&nbsp; I tolerated the visit.&nbsp; I wanted to know about me.&nbsp; She showed me a pic of what was suppsedly my sperm donor, all I could really make out was his legs.&nbsp; She told me his name, all I remember was his last name was Baker.&nbsp; Then she told me he was dead.&nbsp; He had a bad heart.&nbsp; Passed away in his early 40's with a heart condition.&nbsp; He had a pacemaker at the age of 28.&nbsp; Thanks, I needed that.&nbsp;   over the next 5 years, I tolerated more visits.&nbsp; About 2 a year.&nbsp; Each one getting worse than the one before.&nbsp; Bm walked into my sick mother's bedroom and told her "you need to pray for OUR daughter, she has an attitude problem"&nbsp; I did have an attitude problem, it was her.&nbsp; I couldn't stand her.&nbsp; I cringed at the mention of her name.&nbsp; I would get nervous and jittery days before a visit from her.&nbsp; When my boys were born during that time, I made Tommy and others swear not to tell her I had another child.&nbsp; I banned her from the hospital, I avoided her phone calls.&nbsp;   The last visit came after Jamie was born.&nbsp; He was 4 months old and she came to visit.&nbsp; On that visit, she referred to Will by his full name, he was 2 years old, and didn't know his full name.&nbsp; When he didn't respond to her, she yelled at him.&nbsp; That was the last straw.&nbsp;   I took her outside to my parents back porch, and more emotions than I have ever experienced came out.&nbsp; I let her know exactly how I felt.&nbsp; Let her know how many lines she had crossed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her that she had no right to walk in my life and expect to be my mother, she gave that right up when she chose her mother over me.&nbsp;   I let her know how it felt to know that I was a reject, rejected by my own mother, the woman who carried me for almsot 9 months, gave me to total strangers.&nbsp; I let her know how i felt the day she told me "don't you let me go to a nursing home when I get old"&nbsp; WHAT?????????&nbsp;   Then I knew why she contacted me.&nbsp; She had just found out her own mom had Lupus, and she was scared.&nbsp; Scared of being alone.&nbsp; BM had never married, never had any more kids, it was just her and her mom.&nbsp; It was her choice.&nbsp; She had to live with it.&nbsp;   But now, she wanted me back.&nbsp; You know what, I didnt' care.&nbsp;   I still don't.&nbsp;   I may sound bitter, I'm not bitter.&nbsp; I'm indifferent.&nbsp;   I haven't spoke to her in 8 years.&nbsp; My grandmother used to sneak while BM was at work and call me every couple of months.&nbsp; The calls stopped 3 years ago.&nbsp; I think my grandmother may have passed away.&nbsp; I hate the fact that she and I couldn't have a relationship.&nbsp; I wanted a relationship with my grandmother.&nbsp; She couldn't help the&nbsp; choices her daughter made.&nbsp;   I am very thankful I didn't grow up with BM.&nbsp; I would have been a bitter, cold person today.&nbsp; I'm not that person because she made one good decision in her life.&nbsp; She let me go.  &nbsp;

      There comes a time in each child's life when he is no longer a baby, and is a child.&nbsp; My baby passed that threshold today.&nbsp;   He lost his first tooth.   Mom is old now.

      Bedtime is my favorite time of day.&nbsp; Most parents hate bedtime.&nbsp; All the drinks of water, trips to the potty, monsters in the closet, you name it, every excuse known to man comes to mind at bedtime.&nbsp; Not at our house.  When Noah was born, we lived in a 2 bedroom trailer.&nbsp; If you have never lived in a trailer, they are ovens inthe summer time, and freezers in the winter.&nbsp; We had a window air conditioner in our living room, so in the summer months, we would bring our kingsized matress into the living room and sleep there in front of the air conditioner.&nbsp; They boys would all pile on the couch, or in bed with us.&nbsp; Picture it, all 7 of us sleeping in the living room every night.&nbsp;   &nbsp;We co-slept with all of our kids, when they were babies.&nbsp; breastfeeding has its advantages!&nbsp; Each one, would one day decided he didn't want to sleep with mom and dad anymore, usually around the time another brother was born.&nbsp; I guess it just got too crowded.&nbsp;   When we moved into our house, Noah was 2 weeks old.&nbsp; Tj and Jamie shared a room, Casey and Will shared a room, and Noah was with us.&nbsp; That lasted maybe a week.&nbsp;   The boys had gotten used to sleeping in the same room as us.&nbsp; At first, they would go to sleep in their beds, then at some point during the night, move to the&nbsp; floor by our bed.&nbsp; Then, they would ask to sleep in the floor in our room, so we would let them fall asleep there, and move them when we went to bed.&nbsp; But they would just wind up in our floor again.  Finally, we broke down and bought each boy a portable cot, camping cot, whatever you want to call it.&nbsp; So now,&nbsp; when it is bedtime, they fix their spots beside our bed, they rotate who sleeps at the foot, and on each side.&nbsp;   Why is this my favorite time of day?&nbsp; Because who ever is sleeping beside me, will always slip his had up beside me, and search for my hand.&nbsp; That is how&nbsp;I fall asleep each night holding hands with one of my babies.&nbsp;

      Tuesday is date night for me and Tommy.&nbsp; Tonight, no date night.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Renee and Savannah are on their way to Chapel Hill to get the rest of Savannah's tests for her transplant done.&nbsp;&nbsp; Renee is my babysitter.&nbsp; I am her's.&nbsp; We like it that way. &nbsp; Not many people will volunteer to babysit for 5 boys.&nbsp; They don't have the gonads to do it.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Not that is is a difficult job, you just need nerves of steel, or be the most laid back, go with the flow person on earth.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So far this morning, I have dealt with two arguements over the video game, one fight between the dog and son #4, thrown several 4 ft metal sticks away that were being used for swords (they even had pointy ends) confiscated firecrackers, and held&nbsp;three &nbsp;summit meetings on the importance of  1-not hurting your brothers feelings by calling him scardy cat, and &nbsp; &nbsp;2- actually helping your brother when he is stuck in a tree and is falling out 10 feet above ground,  &nbsp; 3-&nbsp; helping your younger brother get away from the dog that has chased him down tackled him and is playing and unwilling game of wrestlemainia with your brother, while your brother is crying for help, and you are standing there laughing your head off watching the dog rip yor brother's shirt.&nbsp; A new shirt by the way, he just got over the weekend. &nbsp; In the movies, brotherly love is so simple, they would fight to the end for each other.&nbsp; NOt so in real life.&nbsp; Brothers are the enemy.&nbsp; Brothers will take even a girl's side against another brother if it will embarass him, mildly hurt him, or there is the slightest chance brother will pee his pants in front of people.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It's just now 1pm.&nbsp; Bed time is a loooooooooong way off.

      SO, I come in from church yesterday, and Tommy says, "so you want to sit?"&nbsp;  &nbsp; Those aren't the first words you want to hear when you come in the front door.&nbsp; They normally mean something bad has happened.&nbsp; I mean , if you have to "sit" to hear something, then it is big, it's so big, the person doing the telling is afraid it will literally knock you off your feet, so they ask you to sit.&nbsp;  &nbsp; By now, my heart is slowly thumping harder, and harder, I have this stupid grin on my face that I always get when I am nervous.&nbsp;  I hate that grin.  &nbsp; I walk around the couch, ask T.&nbsp; what its about, with a million things running thru my head at once.&nbsp;   "where's the dog, did he get hit by a car, oh no, mom, where is mom, is she ok,&nbsp; are Tommy's parents ok, is he dying, that's it, he's dying, no he isn't, he got fired!&nbsp; Yep, that has to be it, they are so broke, they are closing down the business, no job, what will be do, I need the want ads, wher edid I put the&nbsp; newspaper, no, that can't be it, I know, money, its got to be money, no, savannah, she got sick on the way home"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   All this ran thru my head in .5 seconds.&nbsp; So now stupid grin is saying "what's wrong honey, tell me"&nbsp;   &nbsp; " I have bad news, you know that Le Mans race?"&nbsp;  Lemans? that's cars, nooooo, don't say what your gonna say next, you better not mention Dale Jr,&nbsp;   Well, jr, was supposed to race in it today   supposed, did he just say supposed, lalalalalalalala, I can't hear you.   And, he wrecked, there was a fire, his car was engulfed.   stupid grin fades, I look at he jr, stand up in the corner of the living room, that face, that sweet, face, oh, it can't be messed up,   He has 2nd degree burns on his legs and face.&nbsp;   lalalallalalalal, not hearing you again   here, look at the article.&nbsp;   &nbsp; So I go to his laptop and look at the article.&nbsp; ok, he is fine, just burnt bad.&nbsp; If that can be considered ok.&nbsp; NO broke bones, no brain damage, he is alert and talking.&nbsp; Phew, I can breathe again. &nbsp; See, I was a huge, huge huge fan of Dale Earnhardt Sr.&nbsp; His biggest fan.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; When he passed away,he took a huge part of my love for NASCAR&nbsp; with him.&nbsp; I used to be one of those maniac fans.&nbsp; I read every article, saw every show, every time it was on, I didn't miss a race for anything.&nbsp; Then is turn 4, at Daytona, It all stopped.&nbsp; I knew it was bad, when they showed Ken Schrader going up to Mikey in Victory Lane, no, I knew it was bad when Dale Sr never grabbed Mikey from behind and got him in a big ol' bear hug, telling him how proud of him he was, and telling the critics "see, I know what I'm doing, I wasn't crazy for putting Mikey in my car"&nbsp; That never happened.&nbsp; I knew it was bad.&nbsp; Searching and searching the TV for answers that didnt' come, I resorted to the internet.&nbsp; Tommy was working on a project in the basement and told me to yell if I heard anything, before closing the basement door, he says "you know he's dead don't you"&nbsp; I wouldn't hear it.&nbsp; Refused to even let my mind go there.  &nbsp; I read it first on the USA TODAY website.&nbsp; I was in shock.&nbsp; I cried, I cried for days.&nbsp; I taped every minute of every memorial, newsreport, and his funeral.&nbsp; I have 5 video tapes devoted to his death.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I was a huge fan.  &nbsp; Last night when I saw the pics of the wreck, I was very thankful I hadn't seen it live.&nbsp; I wouldn't have ever watched another race again.&nbsp;  &nbsp; If Junya doesn't know God on a personal level, I hope he gets to know him because of this.&nbsp; After feeling those flames nipping at him, I hope it wakes him up to a few things.&nbsp;

      I haven't played with all the new stuff Blogger has to play with, maybe I should explore a little! &nbsp;  I could get really, annoying with the color thingy, I love color!&nbsp; Especially in my blog!&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Ok, no more changes I promise.    &nbsp;  As you can tell, yesterday was a really special day for us.&nbsp; This is the first time two of my kids have gotten baptized at the same time.&nbsp; I was so&nbsp; emotional.&nbsp; Renee took the pics for me, I always forget my camera, or, in this case, the memory card was full on the digital, and the tape was full on the video camera.&nbsp; I am so on top of things.    &nbsp;  In a couple of weeks, we are having the benefit singing and dinner for Savannah.&nbsp; I have so many things I need to do to help Renee.&nbsp; I wish I could just read her mind and know automatically what she needs instead of her having to voice her needs so much.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I'm not one of those intuitive people who just know or just see what is needed.&nbsp; I have to be knocked up side the head with a hammer to know what to do.&nbsp; I love helping, and am perfectly honest when I tell you, "let&nbsp; me know if I can do anything".&nbsp; CALL ME, tell me, scream it at me, just let me know!    &nbsp; &nbsp;

      While playing xbox, Tiger Woods Golf 2003 last night, I was having a hard time putting.&nbsp; I had made my shots at the stupid little hole at least 6 times, missing each time.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Will, my middle son, says "mom why don't you just constipate the hole"&nbsp;  &nbsp; He meant to say "mom, why don't you concede the hole."&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Noah, the baby, talks with a worse southern slang than his momma, poor kid.&nbsp; When his oldest brother called him a "redneck"&nbsp; He replied with "I ain't not a redneck" &nbsp; Casey, next to oldest son, trying to tell me about a conversation he heard on Jay Leno, tells me that the guy liked MILK.&nbsp;" Moms I Like to #*&amp;%"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think He meant to say MILF. &nbsp; Same son's first word?&nbsp; "Duh"&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously, I have it on video.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Noah asked me last night if babies really eat "mom juice", and where do they sell it.&nbsp; When I told him, EEEEEWWWWWWWWWW. was his reply. &nbsp; Jamie, walking in on mom and dad snuggled up in bed, trying to go to sleep, in our own bed, "why don't you two get a room"&nbsp; our reply "we did." &nbsp; TJ, after hearing a friend of mine belch out loud, in public, taco bell I think.&nbsp; "that's just not right, she's not a girl.&nbsp; Girls can't do that.&nbsp; "&nbsp; Friend's reply????? She belched again.&nbsp; Only louder.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Children, they keep you young. &nbsp;

      I have always lived in a small town.  I love living in a small town.    Tuesday night was date night.  Tommy and I decided to go into the city and walk around checking out all the eclectic ships and people.  Walking around, it made me wonder what it would be like to live downtown. To live on the 5th floor  of a building, with your neighbors just on the otherside of a wall.  To be able to sit in your living room, and watch the parades out the window.  What is it like to have to buzz people in to your home.    We walked around  urlLink this place  admiring the changes the owners made, in this former Federal building.  We window shopped at all the specialty shops.  What would it be like to have a shop for coffee, one for produce, one for cheese, meat, and one for candles?  I'm used to the all inclusive chain grocery store.    We walked down the cobblestone Wall Street.  With all its different cafe's.  One for sushi, one for Thai, authentic Italian, a Vegan cafe, a all organic cafe.  Each store front with a different motif.  Different old time look to it.  But so different on the inside.    The store dedicated to things from Ireland looked intriguing.  Tommy liked the store "A Far Away Place"  with all the home decor and clothing from India and the Middle East.   urlLink Dolce Vita  was my favorite.    Part of me would like living in the city.  But then I would yearn for space, wide, open, free to move about, scream, sing at the top of my lungs, space.

      Yep, I am cool mom again.  I'm babysitting Savannah today, and they are currently painting, finger painting, and brush painting, on my coffee table, without and newspaper laid out, or anything.  I haven't paniced and screamed when they walk in with paint all over their clothes, I didn't lose it when they showed me the pain they spilled on Jamie's blanket.                  I have smiled and gushed over every masterpeice they have brought to me, held behind their back, saying "close your eyes"  and then yelling "priiiiizzzzzzzze" while handing this , dripping wet, used to be paper, to me.    I won't fuss over the fact there is paint all over my wood floors, today, it just isn't worth it.    The looks on their faces is too priceless to crush.

      AFter I wrote my post last night about wanting a tat, I sent to bed.  Didn't do my normal blog hopping until this morning.    Well, seems as if everyone is having a crisis of some sort,  urlLink Ren , wants a tat,  urlLink Jenn  wants one, and while talking to a friend today, she mentions she wants one too, exact same place as me, even the same motif.    What is with us?  Now to lose that weight to bet my belly ring.

      I must be right smack dab in the middle of a mid-life crisis.  Why??? Do you ask?  I want a tattoo.  You heard it here first folks, Angi wants a tattoo.  At least I think I do.  I want one for right now, but really can't see myself as a 75 yr old with a tattoo.  That is just sick.    Tommy won't let me get one.  Not a permanent one.  I think the right one, not a full body coverage is sexy.  I don't want it where all the world can gawk at it.  It is something personal.  I want it where I can enjoy it, and Tommy can enjoy it.    I've been looking at pics.  Sent him a few.  In fact, he got me started on it.  Sent me the site, but says he will draw it on for me.  I'll take that.    Oh, and for future reference, when I get thru losing the weight I need to lose, you just might catch me with my little piggy pierced!  GASP!!!!!

      I was MS. Insomniac last night.  at 5am, I was still wide awake.  Sheesh.  The night's sleep did nothing but change the tone of voice for oldest son.  He has bugged me to death to take him to the game store.  I'm sorry, but I'm not taking him.  I have better things to do than to drive 20 minutes, walk thru a very boring mall, (yes, we have a boring mall here) and then wait for over an hour while he reads every single game in the store, only to decide they don't have the exact year, or version of the game he wants.      ON ANOTHER NOTE    I am a huge admirer of Lance Armstrong.  urlLink  He has overcome huge physical problesm  to go on to win 5  urlLink Tour De France's /  then the fact he is dating my  urlLink absolute favorite female singer , well, that throws another good vibe from me his way.  Needless to say, I bore my kids senseless every day, watching the Tour live.  They hate bicycling.  But love Lance.  He used to train in our area.  Literally.  In fact, I almost ran over him going to church one morning.  Yes, I almost ran over Lance Armstrong.  Do you know how bad I woud have punished myself for that?  Do you know how bad most of america and europe's cycling world would have punished me for that.  I can see my face on the Enquirer now.  YOu know the one, where I am running, hair flopping in the wind, and a photographer steps in my way, my eyes go wide, my hair is shocked by the sudden stop and doesn't know which way to go, my jaw drops to my chest with a "what the....." look on my face.  Very flattering.    I was going to church, late as usual, and go flying around acurve, when all of the sudden, there wer these cyclists in the road.  Not actually inteh road, but on the side of the road just enough that my car wouldn't go by.  So, I look and they are wearing USPS uniforms.  I think nothing of it, go on to church.  After getting home, the boys are telling dad of the excitement, and he says, "you could have hit Lance"  He's here, it was just on the news.  Welllllllll, stupid me, if I had know that before, I would have pulled along side, stuck a papaer and pen out the window and politely asked for an autograph, all while groveling for his forgiveness for scaring the poopie out of him.  I doubt I would have got my autograph.

      This morning, a lady called and asked if my two oldest could come do a little yard work for her.    They have worked for her before and she pays well, very well, so they jumped at the chance.    This time, she asked me to stay with them.  Ok, that was fine with me.  I had the two youngest with me, so we decided to pitch in and help.  Pulling weeds, spreading pine needles, just general yard grooming.  They also had to mow the lawn.  Not a big lawn, took about an hour with a self propelled push mower.  No biggie.  Nice lady, pays US, (me, and 4 sons ) $100.  So I decide that Tow oldest would get #5 a piece, with me and two youngest getting 10 each.  I included myself, mainly because I had to put gas in to get them there, stopped at McDonalds, to feed them on the way, AND bought them quart size gatorades to drink while working in the hot sun.  If you ask me, I got gyppped.  ANYHOW,,,,,,,,,  Tj tells me if he doesnt' get at least 45, he doesn't want any at all.  Well, guess what.  He didn't get 45, so he gave me the money back.  Said he didn't want it.    Now tell me, how smart was that????????   THEN, I have to go into town, he sends his money with me, with a list of video games he wants.  I meet Tommy in town, give him the money and list, and he takes Casey to the game store.  The games TJ wanted wre all at least $50, USED.  So, hubby didn't get TJ any game at all.  Hubby calls TJ from car and tells him, TJ PITCHED A FIT OVER THE PHONE.  This child is supposedly 14 yrs old.  He is pitching a red hot fit whining and crying because he didn't get a new video game.    Tell me again, he will grow out of it, He will mature and become a responsible adult, and I will enjoy being around him again..  As of bedtime, he was still pouting.  Must be nice.

      My boys, the 3 youngest at least, have to have swords.    Thanks  Lord of the Rings .  Used too, their swords were branches they would break off the many trees in our yard.  When those were banned by the totally un-cool mom, they evolved on to bigger and better things.    Now, they are metal sticks, about a yard in length that one of them, has been kind enough to sharpen the ends of.  They even took duct tape and taped a handle across the bottom.  They actually looked pretty good.  Notice the past tense of looked.  As in "look good no longer".  They are gone.  Never to return again.  The un-cool mom has struck again.    I will gladly give up my cool status over these metal killing sticks.    In our time of having kids, all of my children have had at least one set of stitches (minus one very lucky child who has had none)  Last year alone we had 4 broken bones (all on the same child, 3 on the same arm.  )  and We have had at least 4 concussions.  2 of which were on the youngest son.  He just can't seem to stay away from a baseball bat while it is being swung by his oldest brother.    So see, we don't need metal sticks in the equation.  My boys hurt themselves plenty without any form of weapon.    One son got stiches from sleeping.  Yes, sleeping.  During the night, he moved to the foot of our bed, rolled over, hit the dresser and a rock weighing in at roughly 5 lbs, fell of the dresser and hit him in the temple.  He was bleeding profusly, and didn't even know it.  My oldest son walks in the room and starts screaming "Will's dying, Will's dying" Those words will make you move a little faster than normal.    The rock, had been painted gold in Vacation Bible School and said "Jesus is my Rock", now lives at Tommy's work, holding open the shop door.    Even sleeping is dangerous at my house.

      I have to say last night was the best date night we have ever had.    We went to Applebee's to eat (I had never been) and of course it was wonderful.  And, a touch romantic.  LEsson for you readers from the male persuasion:  Tommy sat on the same side of the booth as me, (aaawwwwww) we sat and did the touchy feely thing, my arm around him, at one point he got my hand and kissed it. It was sooooo nice.   When we left, outside the restaurant, he kissd me!  WHAT a PDA from my HUSBAND???????  NO, those things don't happen after you have been married for almost 16 years.  But Yes, my husband kissed me in a public place!  I was shocked, amazed and thrilled.  We had to make a payment for my mom , so we went to walmart, where, he held my hand.  count em ladies, that is 2, two, dose, PDA's in one night!  WhooHooo.  Walked around for a bit.  Which in itself is a miracle, Tommy hates shopping of any sort, really hates it.    Drove around for a while, then went home early to get the boys, I dropped him off at he house before going to Renee's to get them, and he got me by the hand, took me over to a quiet place in the driveway, and we made out like teenagers!  Oh to be young again.    It was a good night, a very good night.

        The following is an excerpt from a 1950s high school home economics textbook:     Have dinner ready. Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal -- on time. This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about his needs. Most men are hungry when they come home, and the prospect of a good meal is part of the warm welcome needed.  Prepare yourself. Take 15 minutes to rest so that you'll be refreshed when he arrives. Touch up your makeup, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His boring day may need a lift.  Clear away the clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up the school books, toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your husband will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give you a lift too.  Prepare the children: Take a few minutes to wash the children's hands and faces (if they are small), comb their hair, and if necessary, change their clothes. They are little treasures, and he would like to see them playing the part.  Minimize all noise: At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of the washer, dryer, dishwasher or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to be quiet. Be happy to see him. Greet him with a warm smile and be glad to see him.  Some Don'ts! Don't greet him with problems or complaints. Don't complain if he's late for dinner. Count this as minor compared with what he might have gone through that day. Make him comfortable. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest he lie down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in a low, soft, soothing and pleasant voice. Allow him to relax and unwind.  Listen to him! You may have a dozen things to tell him, the moment of his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first.  Make the evening his. Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner or to other places of entertainment. Instead, try to understand his world of strain and pressure, his need to be home and relax.  THE GOAL: Try to make your home a place of peace and order where your husband can renew himself in body and spirit.

      WhooHoooooooo, do you know how few and far between date nights are around here?  I can't even remember the last date night.    Tonight Tommy told me to see if I can get a sitter for tomorrow night,and we will go out.  Either to eat or to a movie. With no kids.  Just the two of us.  No kids. (too poor for both)  I am sooooooooo excited.    NO kids, what will we do with NO KIDS around????????  What will we talk about, how will we act without a 6 yr old prying his skinny little body between us. In fact, no kids at all.  How on earth will we get thru the night without having to split up a fight, or referee an arguement between boys?????????????  This calls for a celebration. (no kids)  I feel the works coming on, hair, makeup, get all dressed up, re-do my nails, the fancy unmentionables, splash on a little victoria's secret smelly stuff, put on my new shoes, oooohhhhh, I need new earrings, got to have sexy earrings.  Did I mention NO KIDS??????????  Do you men see what you put us thru???? Just for a date????????   ONce more, did I mention   N-O K-I-D-S???????????????????

      Tommy may kill me for this, BUT...  Last night I did something I have never done before.    I gave him a shave, facial, no where else.    It was really nice.  He enjoyed it too.  I had always wanted to try giving him a shave.  But was too nervous.  I mean I didn't want to cut him and make him have to walk around with tissue stuck to his face.  So, I had never done it.  Or even mentioned it.  SO last night, he off-handedly says "why dont' you give me a shave, it's been a week, I need one bad."  So, I did it.  I have to say, there is something so intimate and personal to shaving a man.  It gives you a total sense of trust.  That is their face you are dealing with, you screw up and the whole world knows about it.  It is also very sensuous to it.    The boys thought it was plain ol' nauseating.  They kept coming in and running out, "that is just sick mom, just sick. "  We finally locked the door, they were ruining the mood.    We had a good night.  It brought us closer.

      The town's fireworks were really good.  Except for the fact that we parked too close to the trees and the tops got in the way a bit.  Got home just in tiem to watch the race.  Maybe I should have stayed away.  When we walk in the door, Dale JR. is in second and goes for the lead.  WHoo HOOOOOOO.  I'm thinking her we go, another Daytona win to the list.  Yesssir, He is the KInd of restrictor plates.     When I am wrong, I am wrong.    It wouldn't have been so bad, if Gordon hadn't won.  I just really didn't want the 2-4 to win.  I'm sorry, I just dont' like him.  I like him more now than I used to.  I used to be one of those Gordon haters.  Bad.  But now, I can tolerate him.  He is much easier to tolerate since he is rid of Brooke, and is no longer her little puppet.  A lot more human now.   But, at least he didn't lose any ground in the points race.  If you want to call it a points race.    Oh...I got to taste Ameretto last night.  It is actually pretty good.  Not at all what I expected.  Its funny, but I realized that was the first time I ever drank a shot.  I guess you learn sometihng new every day.

      WhooHOOOOOOOOO, its poker night.  I have been needing poker night for a week now!  I know I will be the first one out, but hey, it is a honor just to get to play!    What does ameretto taste like?  I have never tried it.       My oldest found out yesterday that the neighbor girl is on birth control pills.  Boy was he excited.    Her brother told him that since her parents know she is sexually active, they took her to get the pill.  Which is a good thing.  But I wonder if she protects against diseases?  TJ was thrilled, he still thinks he has some chance with this girl.  She hasn't been down here for a few days, so I am wondering if she was just enjoying being a tease last week.  Probably.    Heavy night last night, saw my husband jealous for the first time in our entire marriage.  In fact I have always said that he didn't have  jealous bone in his body.  I guess he does now!   I am such a sap, yep that's me.  It never fails, when me and Tommy are in a deep conversation, I cry.  I can't help it, I jsut do.  In fact, I cry at stupid stuff.  My eyes have drilled a line to the "crying" part of the brain, and control it.  I can't stop the tears, they just come.  I am one of those chicks that cries at commercials.  The other day, I cried at the end of a shoot em up bang bang movie.  YOu don't cry at those movies.  I would probably cry at a horror film if I ever watched them.     boring post this morning I know, I used all my brain cells last night, can't think of anything funny or interesting to say, I'll do better later, I promise...

      The drama that is my life.    While at work today, Tommy read my blog and saw a comment that was made, and he took it to be a proposition.  The first tiem I read it, I thought it was jsut and innocent statement.  After re-reading it I saw that is crossed the line.    Tommy and I have talked about it.  And many other things, and we are ok now.  It's been an emotional night.  But we cleared the air about alot of things.  Including what caused me to get so messed up with the finances and stuff.  It has been a very productive night.    We both re-iterated the fact that we  love each other so much, that in almsot 16 years of marriage all of them have been good until the past 6 months. Depression is a serious thing.  It can make normal well grounded people make dumb decisions.  That is what I fell prey to.  Making dumb decisions.  Especially where money was concerned.  Or rather a lack of money.    But I have to say, it has been a good night.  We both know where the other stands and where the each other has been coming from for a long time.   It made us think, talk and open up.   My husband loves me just as I am, and I love him, just as he is.  Whew, that's a relief.

      Ok, I need to clear this up, soemone left a comment a couple of posts down, that I took as completely innocent. Renee took it as completely innocent.    Tommy read it and did not take it so innocent.  He took it as someone offering to service me.  To put things nicely.    So I am deleting the comment.  I don't know what was meant, innocent or not, but Sorry, not interested.  Not even in flirting in any way shape or form.  Life is crazy enough around here without having that to worry about.

      I have no idea why that song is in my head.  I need some make my thoughts go away music.  Hummmmm, maybe some old guns n roses?  Nah, not in the mood for Axle.  Skynard?  nope, this is bad, I don't even know what kind of tunes I want to listen to.  Called Tommy at work, he can't give me the silent treatment over the phone.  He's still angry.  He's not going to shoot pool tonight.  Thursday is pool night for him.  Friday is poker night.  I can't wait til poker night.  I am in withdrawals bad.  I need my poker fix.    Anyhow, someone asked if I am still worrying.  Yes, I am.  I don't want to lose almost 16 years together over this.  Yes, I am an idiot, yes, I screwed up, this last one was totally unintentional.  But I don't want to lose my husband or my life over it.    I love my husband, and I have known it from our second date.  Yep, on our second date, I knew he was the one.  He says he knew it when I uttered one simple phrase that I will not print here.  (remember honey?)  He of course is joking, or at least I hope that phrase isn't why he married me!  lol.    I can't imagine life without him in it.  No, our marriage hasnt' been perfect, but no marriage is.  But we have a good marriage.  Those are hard to come by these days.

      I told you I would be better today.  I am keeping Savannah and EJ today.    Savannah is the punkiest I have seen her in a long time.  We have already had a tea party, played outside, watch Wiggles, Barney, part of Dora and part of Blues clues.  She is played with Noah and drove him nuts.  ALready managed to make TJ mad.  And its not even noon yet.  She is a wild child on a roll.  I love it when she is like this.  Drives the boys crazy, I just sit back and laugh.

      I have written about one layer of me.  I honestly wasn't sure when, or what the next layer would be.  Until I started thinking about Sharon.   Sharon is my older sister.  Not the oldest, she is between me and the oldest, but she is my parents youngest biological child.  Got that?  She was 15 years old when our parents adopted me.  And from what I have been told, she was a handful from the day she was born.   With a very outspoken personality, she isn't afraid to speak her feelings, no matter what is going on at the time.   By the time she was in high school, she had totally rebelled against the things she had been taught by our parents, deciding she would rather experience life instead of avoiding it.  You name it, she has done it.  Tell her not to do something, she will do it.  Tell her something is impossible, she will find a way to do it.  Stubborn doesn't start to describe her.   All of MY life, I was constantly told "don't do to us what Sharon did"  "please learn form Sharon, you see how miserable she is, use her as an example"  "it will kill me if you turn out like her"  those phrases and more like them were daily conversations at my house.  When Sharon introduces me, she tells people "this is Angi, she's the daughter I should have been."  That hurts everytime I hear it.   Sharon has had a very rough life.  Most of it brought on herself.  At last count, she had been married 8 times.  Her first husband beat her anytime he had a bad day at work.  When I was 7, my mom and I flew to Kansas to visit her, and snooping little brat that I was, I found a knife, not a little pocket knife, this sucker was huge.  The blade alone was at least 8 inches long.  And it was sharp.  When tattle-tale me went running to mom and told her my treasure, Sharon broke down and told us Steve used the knife to get Sharon to do what he wanted her to do.  He had been starving her.  She was confined to the apartment, in a city where she didn't know a soul.  Soon after, she came home.  He followed, and moved into her apartment with her.  They had a child, CS, they split up.  Sharon moved in with Phil, he burned her with cigarettes, and did the same to her infant child.   She gave CS up for adoption, to a family member and many months later, she kidnapped CS and brought him to our parents.  She wanted them to raise her son.  So I got a little brother.   Her second husband was a trucker, they set out on the road together.  he was the love of her life.  But he was messed up as well.  Soon, he started beating her.  Once while she was pregnant, he held her down on the floor, and kicked her in the stomach until she miscarried.  Why?  He thought the baby wasn't his.  She still stayed with him.  She loved him.  They had a child, MJ, and things seemed to go well for a while.  Until they moved to SC, and the trouble started all over again.  At least once a week, my parents would get me out of school early, we would drive to whatever low rent appartment complex she was living in at the time, buy MJ diapers and formula, feed Sharon a meal, but by then, her stomach was shrunk to the point half a mcdonald's cheeseburger would fill her up.  But she stayed.  Eventually, my parents talked her into letting them have custody of MJ for a year so she could get her life straightened out.   He became my baby.  He slept with me, often on my chest.  I got up during the night to change his diapers and feed him his bottle.  When he was sick, I stayed up taking care of him.  I was 12 years old.  One of his first words was "mommie", that is what he called me.  Sharon divorced that husband and met another.  Married him,and wanted her baby back.  It killed me to lost my baby.  I hated her for it.   Of course, this man was just as bad as the first two.  The weekly beating started as soon as she got MJ.  They moved from place to place, but the cops always knew where they were.  Neighbors called all the time.  The fighting was loud.  and it was hard.  She suffered many broken bones, and bruises.   Then she started an affair with her boss.  The boss kicked his wife out, and moved Sharon in.   This one fed her, clothed her and kept a roof over her head.  But his abuse was in worse ways.  He rented her to his friends, got her messed up on drugs.  By this time MJ was 5 years old.  Their was an investigation of child abuse, and soon we had MJ permanently.  Now I had another little brother.   When she left this man, she went on to many more men.  One of which doused her in kerosene and set her on fire.  She threw a unicorn at him, the horn pierced his arm and broke it in two.  She had learned to fight back a long time ago.   All of these years, she was in and out of our house, stealing form our parents each time.  Dad would always make sure she had a car to drive, only for her to sell it to the first buyer so she could keep her drug habit going.  She stole mom's jewelry, pawning it to feed her habit.  She hooked, stole, conned, you name it she has done it.  Just like in the movies.   In the mean time, I was trying to have a normal life, as were our parents.  My younger brothers grew up knowing she was their birth mother.  It really messed with their heads.  Bad.  I grew up knowing I would never in a million years break my parents hearts like that.   See this layer, isn't really my layer, but it is so much a part of who I am.  I can't stand to hurt a soul.  I watched Sharon hurt every person who ever loved her, and deep in my mind, I vowed to never hurt the ones I love like that.   As a teen, everytime I would drink, i would hear the voice in my head saying "your jsut like her", when I started smoking, it was there echoing, bouncing off the walls of my skull, the first time I had sex, I knew I was doomed to be her twin.  I tried to be a rebel, but couldn't do it.  So she saved me from myself.   I have to thank her for saving me.  I was engaged once to the WRONG man.  Only at the time, I was ignoring the voice that was telling me he was wrong.  Until one night, I had just finished doing his laundry, and took it to his apartment.  I folded it,and was getting ready to put it up for him.  He grabbed a pair of jeans off the top of the stack, and started screaming at me.  "these aren't done, what are you and idiot, any imbecile can feel these and tell they aren't dry"  He threw the jeans down, grabbed me and threw me into the wall, reached for the thing nearest to him, which happened to be the phone, and wrapped the cord around my neck.  I kicked him in the balls, he fell to the floor.  I calmly told him to get his shit out of the apartment by the end of the weekend, and I left.  I never spoke to him again.  Sharon is why I was able to fight.  When he slammed me into the wall the voice was screaming "I told you, see, see, why don't you listen to me, he is BAD"  I listened to the voice.  I understood my sister for a millisecond.  Then once I left the apartment, I couldn't understand why she hadn't left.  Why she still lives with men that treat her like that.  I won't ever understand, because leaving was so easy for me.  I guess I had a good role model after all.

      Ever sit and watch a child sleep? They are like little angels laying there. Not a care in the world. Just dreaming of baseball, puppies and candy bars. Until they grow up and hit puberty that is.  Right now, I have 4 of 5 kids asleep. I can hear soft snores coming from all directions. That has to be the most comforting sound on earth. The soft, snort, of a tired little boy, who has nothing on his mind but resting for another go at the bike trail tomorrow. Or the little boy that just wants to wake up in time to watch his favorite cartoon before starting his day. Or the big boy who wants to sleep and dream of Heidi Klum, or Jessica Simpson, Brittny Murphy, or whatever hot chick TJ has seen on TV that night. They all have different reasons.  Every once in a while, that peacefulness will be interupted by a grunt, or moan, or angry "ugh". My kids tend to relive their days in their dreams. I can tell who had the worst day by listening to the sounds of sleep. Occasionally, you can hear them fuss at each other in sleepiness. Or, praying for each other in sleep. Yes, I have heard my boys, totally and completely dead to the world asleep, praying. I have even heard Will preach in his sleep. He has told us many times that when he grows up, he wants to be a preacher like his papaw. Jamie will fight in his sleep. I have been on the receiving end of many kicks and punches. Even head butts from him. They tend to act out their dreams. Not a good thing if they have fought with their brothers all day. Casey will try to re inact his day. I guess he thinks he deserves a do-over sometimes. Or maybe the fact he didn't get a project finished pesters his sleep. Or, like his dad, he thinks while sleeping, working out the details to a problem that is bothering him.  I like catching them in that in-between-dream sequence sleep. Where they are not quite asleep, but not awake. Noah especially, will cuddle, hug, kiss, and just basically fill you up with all the loving you can take when he is in this state. That state where the eyes don't open, but the corners of the mouth are always turned into a sweet, innocent smile. Where he will nuzzle his head into the crook of my arm, and sigh pleasantly. Then his little hand will reach up and grab a touch of my hair, and start twisting it. Then slowly the little hand stops twisting the hair, and the hand falls slowly to the bed, the smile recedes, and he is asleep. Then mom can fall asleep, with her mouth turned up in an innocent smile.  All is right in the world, when you watch a child sleep. Even when you know he is dreaming R-rated dreams!

      We wound up taking mom to the ER, I finally got in touch with her doc, and he wanted her to be seen immediatly.  Phew.  What a relief.  As usual, by the time we got there, mom was a clear as she could be.  It always happens that way.  We take her in, she gets clear, we keep her home, she stays loopy.  Its a no win situation.   They did so many tests on her, its pathetic.  Of course everything was normal.  It always is.   So, I snuck out to the ER desk, and talked to the nurse who was caring for mom.  I told  her everything.  All about her taking to many meds, forgetting she has already taken them, and then taking them again.  Taking a sleeping pill, then 20 minutes later, taking another, and so on until  she finally falls asleep.  Not knowing that it makes her loopy, and she talks to invisible people all night.    The nurse was very sympathetic.  She deals with a mother in law that lives with her doing the same thing.   The nurse, then talked to the doctor about it, and he called mom's regular doctor.  They decided that either they could keep her in the hospital for a few days, and get her meds straight and on a regular basis, OR she could let one of us, (me or Marlena) take her meds over, and only give them to her dose by dose.  Sounded good at the time.   Not now.   I just left their house, I have the meds, and am giving them out morning meds, and evening meds.  Worked fine last night.  I gave mom her meds before I left her house.  Then this morning, before wake up time, my dad is on the doorstep, ringing the doorbell, wanting mom's meds.  Normally, she wakes up around noon.  Not this morning.  7am.  On Tommy's day off.  The ONE DAY A WEEK I CAN SLEEP IN!!!!!!!!!  We make it thru that.  Phew.  Time for night meds.  I send them up,and immediately get a phone call, "I'm supposed to take this one pill 3 times a day"  No, the label says IF NEEDED TAKE UP TO 3 TIMES DAILY.  "well, I need it 3 times a day"  How do you know you need it 3 times a day?    Ok, that settled.   10 minutes later, phone again.  "where is this pill?, and what is this pink pill?"   You don't have a pink pill mom, "well, this one right here is pink, come up here and bring all my pills so I can go thru them my self. "  Ok, I am cooking supper, it will be after supper.  "well, hurry"     10 minutes after that, phone again, this time it was my son who was at my parents house "nanny says to get up here right now."  Well, fine, I will rush right on up.  So I decide to leave my plate, and go up before eating, so I can enjoy my meal.  WRONG.  My sis is there when I get there, basically, it boils down to the "pink" pill was a white one when it was showed to me, but a yellow pill when it was shown to my sis.  Of course, she thinks I am withholding pills from her, and I get fussed at because I am rushing to get back to my meal.  "how many meals do you think I missed because of you?"  about a million probably.  I walked out the door, with "I love you mom" going over my shoulder.   And I thought I was the child.

      I have spent the majority of the past three days with my parents. For some reason, my mom is not doing too well right now. I can't pinpoint the problem, dad hasn't got a clue, neither does Marlena.  Since Saturday, mom has been difficult to have a conversation with. Mainly, you can talk to her, and all you get in return is a "huh?", and it is delayed like she had to really think about it before she said it.  Normally when she gets like this, she has taken one too many of her sleeping pills, or onee too many of her Neurotin. Neither of those is the case this time. She hasnt' had any meds of any kind since Saturday. Totally out of character for her. She never misses her meds. Never.  She also isn't eating. Two meals in three days. Both of those forced on her. She keeps saying "I just don't think I am hungry right now." Even if she hasn't had a single bite to eat in 24 hours.  Mom has me worried. This isn't normal at all for her. I called her doctor today, and the nurse called back while I was gone to buy groceries for my parents. They talked to mom, and she was really confused. Especially since she had no idea why they were calling her. I just blew it off. I will call them first thing in the morning and see what they say. I just hope I can get her into the office to be seen while she is still like this. He has never seen her like this, so he can't really make a diagnosis based on just what we tell him. Then of course, you have mom sitting there telling him we are blowing it all way out of proportion.  I don't know, this is just bugging me. Marlena talked today about moving in with them. I hate for her to have to do that. But their care is between me and her. That's it. Out of 7 kids, we are the only two that care enough to even check up on them. Then you add in the stress of Savannah's illness, Marlena is Savannah's grandmother, so she really feels it.  I know that the Bible says God won't put on us more than we can stand. I just wish God didn't have so much faith in what I can stand.  I'm not naive, I know my parents will one day pass away. That is fine. I know they will both be a lot happier on the other side. But I know that I will be miserable. I have never lost anyone so close to me. Never. I was a baby when the last of my grandparents died, all my brothers and sisters are alive, and all of my aunts and uncles that I have ever been close to are still living. I haven't ever had to really grieve.  Tommy swears I will have to be sedated when my parents die. He is probably right. Who knows, I may not be in the real world for a long time afterwards, but right now, I am trying to focus on the fact they will be happy. They won't have to deal with all the crap they have to deal with on earth now. They won't have to worry about their kids, and why they arent' calling, they won't have to worry about paying the bills, daddy won't have that stupid trailer park to worry about. Mom won't be getting up in the middle of the night and falling. They will have nothing but happiness.  But I will be without my lifeline. yep, my parents are my lifeline. When I need prayer, the first person I call is Daddy. When I have royally screwed up, I call mom. When we are low on groceries, i send the boys to their house to eat. When I need cheering up, I call mom. When yet another water line busts, I call daddy. When my car breaks down, I call daddy. When one of the boys needs new shoes, I call mom. Or jsut when I am lonely, I call and talk to which ever one answers. Daddy is my spiritual leader, he is my Pastor, my teacher. Mom is my guidance counselor, my go between, my buffer zone. I will miss all of these things when they are gone.  I miss some of them now. Mom isn't lucid right now, not enough to help me know what to do to help her. I wish I could talk to her about it. She would know what to do.

      We all have met those people that never learn their lesson. No matter what consequences they face, they just don't learn.  My brother is one of those people.  Let me start by telling you he is 60 years old, with a bad heart, bad neck, bad back, emphysema, a bullet in his liver, and various other things. Not a real picture of health. But stubborn as a mule, and refuses to admit he is not a young man anymore.  Last week, he decided to mow our 84 year old father's yard. This is a lawn, that my 12 year old won't tackle with a push mower, he will only weed eat it.  Smart boy.  It is a straight up and down bank of a lawn. No flat, just incline. Steep incline. Got that pictured in your head?  Now add to the picture a riding lawn mower, with a 60 year old on it. Not a skinny little old man, a big bellied old man, riding his mower, up this incline, doing his good deed for the week, mowing his dad's lawn.  Nice son.  Now change the picture to the mower suddenly giving in to gravity and tunring upside down. Upside down, with my brother underneath. Yep, he flipped the mower. Landed right on top of his back. Remember I mentioned he already had a bad back. Well, it is worse. Try a few busted vertebrae in his lower back, near the tailbone. The doc says all he can do is take it easy and let it heal. It will probably give him trouble the rest of his life. Stinks huh.  Want to know what is really bad? He has done this before. At least twice before. On different banks mind you, but still, at 2 different times in his life, he has been on the wrong side of a riding lawn mower, and wound up with a broken back.  Personally, I would park the mower and pay a kid to do the mowing for me.  Like I said, some people never learn.

      Yay.  Football season is here.  MNF, every single monday night until the season is over.  All day Sunday, and even on Thursday nights.  Enough is enough.  Everyone knows I am a sports fan.  Huge sports fan.  But it honestly takes me awhile to warm up to football every year.  August is too early.   To me, Football is winter sports.  I mean would we have a snow bowl without the snow?    I think not.  I froze to death watching my first high school football game.  It was so cold, even wrapped up in my stadium blanket, I could still see my breath, even breathing thru the fabric of the blanket.   You would think our house would all be Atlanta Falcon, or Carolina Panthers fans.  Nope.  One son is a Tennessee Titans fan, Hubby is a die hard Steelers fan, I am a Colts fan, another son is a Bucs fan.  This year, we are all pulling for the Redskins.  Just because of Joe Gibbs.  He is a sweet man, who knows his stuff.  He owns a couple of NASCAR teams you know.  Not only has he won a couple of super bowls, but he also has a couple of NASCAR championships too.  Smart man.   He is just good.   I don't look forward to football season just because we all pull for different teams.  It doens't make for a good game day.  Not only do we have every TV in the house set to football, but the kids are all running from room to room, taunting each other.  Especially my oldest son.  To him, Steve McNair can do no wrong.   To me, Peyton Manning can do no wrong.  I mean to me, he is the true heir of "best quarterback" after Joe Montana.  Joe is THE best QB  EVER, and Peyton may someday replace him in my eyes.  My son thinks McNair should hold that place.  My son has never seen Montana play.  Only heard the stories his mom has told him.  I will forever hate the 49ers because of their treatment of Montana.  I hope they never win another ring.  Plain and simple.    My son, well, he refused to watch the playoffs last year after Tennessee got put out.  Silly boy.    Then of course, we have the one son, who can't stand anything related to sports in any way shapre or form.  Poor kid.  All he ever asks in life is to watch cartoons.  Cartoons are few and far between during football season.  I think that is why he despises all sports.  It is on, 24/7 around here.   Especially during football season.

      I feel liek I haven't posted in forever, and its only been 2 days!  The benefit for Savannah went great!  There weren't a lot of people, but they really gave their hearts out.  She was of course charming.  She sang "if you're happy and you know it" 3 times.  So cute.  And she reactd well to so many strangers wanting to hug her and talk to her.   So now, to wiat until the 23rd when she is listed on the UNOS list.     I have had a headache for 3 days now.  Just on one side of my head, the right one in case you are wondering.  But it is driving me nuts.  Its stress, I know it is.   Mom is having a horrible day.  Actually couple of days.  She seems liek she is just in a daze, and higher than a kite.  BUt she hasn't had her meds, so she can't have OD'd on them.  Casey is spending the night with them tonight, so he can call me if they need me.  I'm hoping she will go to bed and sleep. But I'm not counting on it.    I will try to write something of more substance tomorrow, I am really tired tonight, and just want to cuddle up to Tommy and get some rest.

      What does that tell you?  Savannah's ammonia is down and she is doing good, so the doc may let her come home this afternoon.   Thanks for all the prayers.  We have lots to do today for the benefit for Savannah tomorrow, cleaning, setting up, chopping, you name it, we get to do it today.  I am praying we will have a fantastic turn out.  Renee and stan really need the money to help with all the bills and stuff.   Its wierd, when something like this comes up, the stress makes the mind blow things out of proportion, makes you hear things that people don't really say, and keeps you really on edge.  I have been praying every day for God to keep me steady for Renee.  I know that right now she needs support, not to deal with other people's problems.  So I am trying to be as supportive as possible.  I have no clue if I am doing a good job or not, all I know is I am trying to be the best friend I can be for her.   She is under unimaginable stress.  I mean her daughter is getting ready to have a liver transplant.  She is trying her best to raise money so they can actually live and pay their bills while having to stay away from home, eating take out for all meals, stan missing so many days unpaid at work, I know she is bound to be all tied up in side.   Not to mention trying to keep Savannah away from al the nasty germs to keep her as healthy as possible for the transplant.  And now, she is in the hospital because her MMR shot reacted on her.   I mean things like this, you can't plan for, you can only roll with the flow, and still try to stay sane.  Try to keep composed, and do what is best for your family.   Then you bring up the fact that it is time for school to start, reenrolling EJ in public school, adn having to get him settled, in the right classes, and helping him readjust to life in public school.  How much can a mom take?  I wish I could take some of the pressure off her, but I can't.  She has got to be the strongest person I know.

      I added a couple of new things to the blog. First is the countdown to election day.  Its on here to remind every one to vote. Yeah, I would really like it if we all voted for Bush, but I would like it even more if every one jsut exercise their right to vote. Too many of our soldiers have given their lives for us to have the freedoms we have in this country. They are sacrificing times with their own families to protect our shores. The least we can do is get off our butts and go vote.  The second thing I added is a Bush/Cheney news blog box. Yes, it is biased, but click on a few links, you may learn something you didn't know before.  There are also new links on my blogroll, AND I started a photoblog over at buzznet.You can leave comments on each pic, so take a look, and let me know what you think!    Can you tell I was bored last night??????

      Ever have one of those days where you are just tired.   I went shopping today, grocery shopping, and beach shopping.   All 7 of us need beach clothes.  I lucked out and got my suit at Target uesterday, clearance rack, $7.  Whoohoo.  Tommy's was only $4.  Even better.  So today I had to search for the boys.  I went to Walmart.  I know some people hate wally world, but not me.   I love them.  Especially when I can get shirts for the boys at $2 a piece.  I actually bought myself two suits , Tommy hates the color of one (my favorite of course) and I hate the style  of the other one!  (to mamawish)   So which one to keep?   Then after shopping in Wally world for 2 hours, during peak school shopping season, I hit the grocery store wide open.   Went in for frozen pizza, came out with 2 buggy fulls of food.  I shop for a month at a time.  So it was monthly shopping time.  The only problem with that, is then you have to come home and put the food up.    Then you figure in the fact the water has been messed up for 2 days, finally got to shower at my parents house today.  Thankfully, I must say, the humidity and heat do not make a good mixture with no way to shower.  Especially with 4 boys who often forget to use deodorant.   We also made a trip to the dump today.  Not my favorite place to go.  80 degree heat and the county landfill, sheeeeewwwwww.  Casey must have wallowed in the trash, when he got in the truck, I had to make him strip down to his shorts.  TJ went the rest of the way home with his head hung out the window.  I didn't have that luxury.   I rode home with my shirt pulled over my nose.  Yes, it was that bad.   Now, Tommy is in bed, I am sitting here with my wild berry wine cooler, relaxing.  The boys are either playing the XBox, or doing something constructive, and leaving me alone.  Thank you God for small miracles.

       urlLink Ren inspired this post .  Thanks  urlLink Ren .  16 years ago, I put a plain, simple, no frills solid gold band on Tommys left ring finger.  When I bought the ring, I didn't think that much about the design, or anything else.  I jjust knew I wanted one thick enough to keep the vultures away from him.  You know women have a thing about men in uniform, and at that time, he was in the air force.  That gold band had to outshine any pin, patch, or anything else on those fatigues.   This past Christmas, I put a different gold band on that same finger.  This one looked exactly like the first one, it just gleamed more, and is slightly bigger.   I noticed late last fall that Tommy was having to take his ring off alot.  During the night, his fingers swell, and he would have to take the ring off to keep it from turning blue.  So I decided to get him a new ring.  I surprised him for the first time, at Christmas.   The old ring, well, it is on my finger.  The ring finger of my left hand in fact.   I wear it now, instead of my original ring.  Which I moved to the pinky finger of my left hand.  Why?   Simple, wearing Tommy's ring makes me feel closer to him.  It has slowly over the years molded to his shape.  The knicks were put there by him.  Every scratch was put there while he was working, playing, building our son's high chair, fixing the flat on my car, or the many times he has had to get under the house to fix busted water pipes.  I know he doesn't have a clue how each scratch got there, neither do I, but I can look at that ring and see him working hard to make life better for us.   That ring is part of him.  Part of us.  Part of our history.  I wear it to honor him.  It doesnt' have his smell, but it has his shape.  I never take it off.  My rings, go off my fingers as soon as I walk in the door.  But not Tommy's, it stays put no matter what I am doing.  I plan on keeping it that way.

      I have written 3 posts so far today.  Deleted all of them.  I'm not sure why my mind is so cluttered today.  I have so many topics I want to write about.   I will start one, write for a little bit, then get off track.  DELETE.  There it goes.  Then I will start a new topic.  and here we go again, I can't decide where to go with the topic and DELETE.  Away with you!   I've never had this much trouble with posting before.  Normally, I sit down, and jsut start typing.  Not today.  Maybe it is because life is in turmoil right now.  Mayb its because Tommy didn't wake me up this morning, and left without saying goodbye.  Maybe its because the boys have been sick for a week now, and the stress and worry of being mom to sick boys is getting to me.  Maybe the well is dry.  I don't know what it is, but I wish it would leave me alone.

      In less than one month, Savannah will be on the UNOS list for her liver.  Hopefully, within 2 months she will have a new liver, and her life will be as close to normal as she will ever get.  Which is a heck of a lot closer to normal than it is now.   If you read my blog, or have read it for any length of time, then you know what a simple cold can do to her.  You know that less than 2 months ago, she was in a coma because she caught a virus from some unknown source.  The liver transplant will help her have a normal life.   Tell me, can you turn that face down?  On the left side of my page, under links, you will see a link to her page, click it, and see how you can help.   Please.

      I got a huge surprise tonight.   My SIL is taking Tommy, Me, and the boys to the beach.   We haven't had a vacation since we got married.  16 years no vacation.  I haven't minded, but this totally has me stoked.  I have been to the beach once in my life.  The summer I turned 18, my best friend and I declared "road trip" and took off.  A solid week, me, her, beach, it was amazing.   I loved it.   I would move to the beach if I could.  To fall asleep each night with the sound of waves slowly rocking me to sleep.  Waking each morning to  the smell of the mist coming from the water.  I would love it.  SO, now, in Sept.  The weekend of my birthday to be exact, we are taking off for Myrtle beach.   When I told th kids, it shocked them so bad, they didn't know how to react.  Now, they are all bugging me to death.  Especially Noah, he wants to know how many fingers until we leave.  Bless his heart.   Now, I get to hit the summer clearance sales, with practically no money, and try to get us set for the trip.  Tommy needs trunks, shorts, and shoes.  We won't even go to what all the boys need.  And mom, ahhhh,  I can't even start to think of that.   I'm still excited though.  Very.

      Well, Will has joined the ranks of sick and pukey.   He hasn't actually thrown up, which is a blessing.  But he is running a high temp and has one of those "make you cry" headaches.   Noah is doing much better.  His temp is actually staying below 102, and he hasn't had any more hallucinations.  I am waiting for his regular peditrician to call.  I am thinking he may have had a seizure, instead of a hallucination.  He doesn't remember a thing about it.  In fact, he looked at me like I was a totally idiot when I mentioned it to him.  Now I am just waiting for all the others to come down with it.  Tommy  thinks he is getting it.  That just leaves me, TJ and Casey.  The biggest babies of the bunch.  TJ and Casey that is, not me.   It is well know that the older babies are, the more baby like they get.  Will is by far, the whiny-est of the sick so far.  He is the one that wants mommy to pet him and make it all better with hugs and kisses.  Jamie just lay there all day long, watching cartoons, only calling me every once in awhile.   I guess they are just preparing to turn into good, old fashioned men that think they are dying when they catch a cold.

      Noah has the bug.  It is one nasty bug too.   His temp is staying high even though I am alternating Motrin and Tylenol.  And he is having hallucinations.  Not a good thing.  We have to take him to the ER if he has another hallucination.  So we are really hoping he gets closer to normal.  Sheesh.   If this bug hits a new person in my house every 4 days, it will take us a good 3-4 weeks to get over this bug.  its not looking good!  Not good at all.
