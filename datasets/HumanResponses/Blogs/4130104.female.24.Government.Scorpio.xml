         " you will find as u look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of LOVE."   it's past 10pm...raining.. & yet u'l hear angels voices singing...laughing...chanting ..it's my little angels voices.   dey are the most precious gift that God has given me. dey are so young...innocent...fragile.    way back 1995, a psychic from d neighborhood came by to read my palm and told my feature wd a pack of playing cards...she had told me probably ur mother would not be glad to hear...she said i'll be saying gudbye 2 singlehood when i reach the age of 16. reaction? sighhhhh... and forgot about those things afterwards...    january 4, 1996. i felt so excited coz it was my first working day as a jollibee crew ( i fought for dis job coz ny parents wanted me to just concentrate on my studies). my sked started at 5:30am but showing punctuality on my first day (just on my first day hehehehe..) i arrived at 4:50am. while i was preparing for work, having my face done by putting a little make-up...a guy entered d crew room..he's wearing a jeans and striped tees..to my astonishment from nowhere...i started hearing drumssss...dugdugdugdug...love at first sight??? duh! dunno...maybe..i guess so...thaumaturgy? ummmm...yes. dat was really magic. we ended up 2geder after 14 days. sure it is magic. what da yah think? D END.    ooopss...not yet...of course not...it was just a start of a long journey called lyf. i got pregnant after 11 mos. yes it's byebye to singlehood. coincidence or predictions come true? dunno.. but at my very young age, i used it as an excuse by consoling myself &amp; convincing my parents as well dat what happened was destiny.    september 1, 1997. 2 more months and 8 days b4 i celebrated my debut... i gave birth to my cute cherubin..tears of joy...overwhelming...unexplained happiness...how can i forget d first kiss...d very first touch...d luv and warmth of my flesh and blood...d first venetghirl creature...my first angel in disguise...my first gem...MARK STEPHEN. i held him close...felt his soft lil hands. we had been sitting der 4 'bout an hour... i was luking seriously at his cute lil face...swearing dat i'l do my best to ensure dat he'l live a decent lyf... a lyf dat's ful of luv &amp; care...dat i will always be accessible to him...after a deep silence... i found d courage to voice out wat i really felt and uttered d words wd tears..........i love u son...i will love you unconditionally...i will love u wd ol my heart......

      my father's a native of albay.... der u'l find one of the world's most perfect volcanoes. to visit der is one of my dreams come true. i love nature. virgin forest... healthy falls...clear aquamarine waters...green mountains...untouchable creations of God. it is almost 12 midnight...my butt's aching. i'm sitting for 'bout 6 hours now...6 more hours of waiting and sacrifices... woohhh...der's just a small open space where u can see d scenery outside. what's d sense of luking outside when all it offers is darkness? it was a tiring journey...all i want to do now is sink into bed & submerge my brain in dreamless oblivion. wat's d purpose of having a vacation in d first place? to de-stress. i hate long trips...dat's a stressful thing to do. if not for my dream of atleast seeing the place where my father came from...for sentimental purposes... and d idea of nature tripping...hoooh... i won't tolerate dis uncomfortable situation. hell! sorry for being impatient, i just really hate long trips. finally, the long wait is over...it's almost 6 am, perfect timing for sunrise... ( it's a blithe thing to do because it signifies hope and opportunities) i love mornings, nice surroundings...nice place... i love d idea of visiting d bicolandia. 1st destination: mount bulusan it is an active volcano covered by a dense &amp; humid rainforest... geared up...having my back pack loaded of food, extra shirts and undies, we headed climbing the mountain...walking through the thick plants we are plagued wd small leeches...d place is nice...d  walking is nice....butterflies flutter around....after a long walk we reached the crater. it is an experience u wouldn't probably forget. 2nd destination: coral island also known as kurangon island i admire d lovely view of blue sea..and blue skies...emmolient...relaxing... golden sands...shells from everywhere....nice place to live...fresh air....fresh food... ooohhh.....did i say food? damn! i almost forget the 'bilin'...baby sharks, squids, shrimps, crabs.... 3rd destination: mt. mayon for an unexperienced like me, climbing the stony mountain like mt. mayon is like putting ur 1 foot below d ground. this is ridiculous. it's like wandering the streets of a strange city or stuck in a dank basement... it's a nightmare. smaller rocks continued to fall on us.. u should be cautious that huge rocks are about to fall. while i was balancing myself for a next step... i lost control, slipped away.... " huy huy huy!!! uy ate, ano ba? huy...umuungol ka ah...tanghali na. d ka ba papasok? tingnan mo pasalubong ko sau..bangon ka na." thank God. hooh...bad dream...but nice trip huu..  ps: sis ko came from bicol wd a friend. we're txting b4 i put myself to sleep after reading "STOPOVER.the travel, lifestyle &amp; success magazine" they featured 'BICOLANDIA'

      " give them d best of you & not what's left of you when you come home from work."   sometimes childish things like licking lollipops, enjoying cotton candies &amp; eating ice drops can be refreshing. refreshing???? oh oh. yes . kinda. it is an unusual thing to do but yes i enjoy eating lollipops especially the one wd d popping candy dips. as a mother i am used to eating what my children eat and do what my children do. one of the best rules in obtaining a good relationship wd ur children is by letting urself live in their world. do not let the "millenium gap" destroy the good communication between you. lower urself & enjoy d innocent surrounding of ur lil ones but do not divest them in introducing ur ironic world. learn their language &amp; affirm their value at the same tym. last night, b4 i put them to sleep we had dis lil sharing 'bout the weeks experiences... my son's makings kwento 'bout the popular network game 'ragnarok' while my lil girl asked me if i can buy her a new barney vcd on payday. dat's their way of exploring compared to what my childhood looked like...media & technology attract children wd their fast-paced formats. i remember my childhood days....tv? not much except for batibot. after skul we'd play the traditional bahay bahayan. lot of tyms siato or patintero. &amp; how can i forget the popular kasal kasalan, luksong tinik, luksong baka, taguang singsing, taguang pong. street games like holen,tex and goma. funny but i treasure all d mem'ries of my childhood years. let me just share to you few of my mother's panakot to us. " ubusin mo pagkain mo kundi kakatukin ka ng kaldero mamayang gabi." when wounded she'd say "naku may lalabas na tren jan o kaya pari" don't u dare try using these lines wd ur kidsnow or u'l end up being d laughing stuck. play, be it simple to extravagant, one thing is certain...those shining moments will be remembered by children until dey grow up...don't miss out on opportunities to laugh,cry,talk &amp; other means of bonding wd dem.

      "  pray as if everything depended upon God & work as if everything depended upon man."      dear God, i have this Acquaintance of mine, an Agile type of person. i Admire his positive Attitude. he possesses the Ability to Amaze people. he Actually does Amaze me. i Associate his being industrious with Ants. his Assiduity in  work brings him success in life. Actually, i felt Antipathy towards him before. but knowing him deeply, my Anger was Appeased. i sensed that he's an Affectionate kind of guy. An Amorous one. Allow him to fall in love.... Apparently i guess he prefers to be Alone. Always guide him oh Lord. Also, pls. help him in All his needs.... Above All, give him the strength to face all the Adversities in life. Amen.

After 2 days of taking cough syrup and antibiotics, her cough persisted. i headed her to a hospital on dat same day. steph was diagnosed wd bronchopneumonia. we were asked if we want to remain in d hospital but i refused. my hubby was having his 10 days vacation in their ancestral house in IS. i cant decide alone (fool!) we were given new set of meds & were advised to give her more fluids. at 10pm..after having her milk...i found her grasping for air. horrified, i carried her, opened d gate &amp; ran(barefooted) to d clinic for 1st aid. unfortunately, dat damn lady in white refused to entertain us...instead, she yelled and say " dalhin nyo na sa ospital yan. di na yan pwede dito" i cried....i wished i was just under a deep dream...a nightmare. but, i wasn't. i looked at her... shivered wd wat i've seen. my baby girl....she's turning gray...she looked dead. wat am i supposed to do? i'm blocked. i stood in d streetside &amp; paused for seconds as if d world stopped revolving. i almost gived up....( not dis tym pls...) i had to do sumthing to saved my dear stephanie anne. my love for her surmount all d weaknesses. i managed to extract all d courage dats left widin me. finally, i'm back to d real world...stopped d tricycle ..."sa ospiatal kami mama, bilis" i prayed wd tears..." lord, alam ko po na sobrang dami na ng nagawa kong pagkukulang...i'm begging you...wag po sya ang hingin nyong kabayaran...nagmamakaawa po ako...iligtas nyo po ang baby ko..." paulit ulit.....puro iyak at dasal... until we reached d hospital. dat was d sincerest prayer i've evere uttered.... after 4 days... back to normal hapi lyf... my li'l princess....she's fine. i know dat in some way, she's been an instrument to restore my faithto god and i thank her for dat. having her doesn't mean less opportunites.....doesn't mean less freedom. she's one of d best reason i have to pursue my dreams in lyf..... of becoming a good mother... good things fall. i'm fortunate enough to have her as my daughter. very blessed to have my li'l angel.    urlLink A N G E L  Originally uploaded by  urlLink gurlie girl .     she's d li'l angel i was talkin 2...
