      There is only one TV in my apartment that has cable and last night it was tuned to the Democratic National Convention. That's right the DNC. I'm pretty sure I have never watched a National Convention before and last night it became clear as to why that was the case. First, I should remind everyone how much distaste I have for politics. I have often said that I hate politics, but this is a stretch of the truth and only an easy way to say what I really mean. I don't like political nonsense! This comes mostly in the form of political propaganda, which is what the Repulican/Democratic National Convention is all about.    On a lighter note I do have a couple of good things to say about the DNC. One good thing about democratic ticket is John Edwards. This guy seems to be a very genuine guy. When he talks it at least sounds like he believes all the propaganda BS coming out of his mouth and I can respect that. Choosing him as VP is probably John Kerry's brightest move in the campaign yet. Now we turn the tables and look at Kerry. I don't really see anything genuine coming out of this character. The question that I most recently posed was..."Is Kerry THE RIGHT candidate or is he just NOT THE WRONG candidate?" Feel free to look at this however you choose because that is what it is all about...choice. But it seems to me that everyone I talk to about politics isn't arguing for Kerry so much as they are arguing against Bush.

      Just to get back to basics I'm going to have to say this....it is MY blog. That means I have the freedom to say whatever I want and write about whatever I want. It also means if I get to busy to post anything for a week or so that is just too bad. I'm glad some people are checking up on things from time to time, but that doesn't mean I have to keep it up to date does it? And on that note...if you are going to post under anonymous because you forgot your name and password, you might as well go ahead and sign your name at the bottom because there is no rule against that. Anyway, thanks for your interest to everyone who has been checking back and I will try to get something new up ASAP.

       In the race for NL Central Supremacy the Cardinals are flexing their muscles with a 10 game lead over the second place Cubs. Whoever, finishes second could have a legitimate shot at the Wild Card, but not if the West keeps up the press they have had for first place. However, let's not forget that Atlanta and Philadelphia are no slouches in the East. Whether they make the cut or not, one thing is sure for the Cubs in the second half of the season; now that the Cubs DL is almost empty they still have an enormous uphill battle for second place and a Mt. Everest climb for a sure shot at a playoff birth. Which brings me to my true point...Kenny's $20 bet is as good as toast.

      In society today we are judged by things like the way we dress and the music that we listen to. Pop culture determines whether we are part of the in crowd. I think it is dumb and stupid, but I'm am just as much at fault as anyone else. Of course the only thing worse than Pop Culture is Counter Culture.

      This post is less fun and more soap box, but it's my blog so back off. I was having a conversation the other day about the vegetarian diet. If this is how you have chosen to "take care of yourself" I'm fine with that. However, I do believe that we have canine teeth (incisors) for a reason and&nbsp;I don' t think it is to bite through fruits and vegetables. Nonetheless, there are really only certain types of vegetarians with which I have a problem and they will be referred to as the "militant vegetarians." I think anyone who isn't a vegetarian will understand what I mean by this. Basically, a "militant vegetarian" is one who causes problems when it comes time to chose a restaurant. The normal people in the group are forced to eat at some "vege-friendly" place to accomadate the minority. It's not even close to the same, but it feels like affirmative action. You may notice that I described the non-vegetarians the normal people. If you think this is some sort of discrimination then I believe you need not look any further than a general census percentage to see that people who eat meat are, in fact, in the norm. I'm not going to say who is and who isn't a militant vegetarian, but if you read this and didn't think you fit the category you are probably safe. If you felt like I was talking directly to you then you have just indicted yourself. If you have any comments on the subject...I would love to hear them.

      So just for fun comment on these questions if you are feeling saucy.  1) Would you rather live in N.Y. or L.A. and why? 2) How many years will you wait to have children after marriage? 3) What is the air-speed velocity of a laden swallow?

      Every once in a while we find ourselves roaming the internet looking for something new. Trying to find something that will entertain us for a couple of hours while we avoid whatever it is that we were supposed to be doing instead. The answer for today is blogs. And if all goes well I may have to try it again tommorow.

      Whatever happened to those days when a major championship in golf meant at least 2:1 odds on Tiger Woods to win. You could ask anybody in a straight up bet, "Do you want to take Tiger or the field?" More than half of the time people would have taken Tiger. That trend has disappeared in the last couple of years. People say Tiger's game is off due to his "coaching" change. Tiger swears that isn't the problem and says he is just ironing out a few rough spots in his new swing. New swing? What the hell was wrong with the old swing? It seemed to be working just fine.  Maybe he has a flare for the dramatic and just wants to make a great comeback. Who knows? All I can say is that I miss watching the last day of the majors and seeing Tiger chase the trophy (or jacket, cup, plate, etc.) The funny part about it is that most of the time I was routing for the other guys on the last day. As long as it wasn't Vijay I usually wanted somebody else to have success. However, at the end of the day, if Tiger won the tournament I was just fine with that too. So let's just say that come tommorow I hope that Tiger can get off to a good start and not be playing from behind like he has in all the majors so far this year. Agree or agree to disagree?

      So now that I have finished watching the documentary "Bowling for Columbine" by Michael Moore it is time to give my personal opinion. Why? Because I am entitled. First, I'd like to say that overall I like the movie and I think Moore had some very good points and showed many interesting things that I had never contemplated. Second, I would like to point out that I don't really agree with many of his methods for getting people to say what he wants them to say. If you don't believe that you can force the public to say what you what then I have plenty of arguments of opposition. Nonetheless, one thing that upset me was the end when he was borderline badgering Charleton Heston after he was nice enough to give him time for an interview. Getting back to the point of the movie brings me to my final opinion. In the movie Moore is searching for a reason why the US has so many gun related murders between its citizens (yes this is one of the things he was bugging Heston about.) I have an answer to this question and while it may not be the sole reason, I think it certainly has an affect. What is the answer...The American Ego. I think we live in a country that is very built up in its own pride. We believe that our country is far superior to other counties, our states are superior to other states, etc. The American ego can easily be seen in the "good ole boy" who believes strongly in spreading the democracy of America. The best example I can give of this is our good friend Greg (no offense buddy, you know I love ya man.) Greg loves our military and knows that we are superior to other countries. This is one place the egocomes into effect and it consumes us all. Yes, I said all and that includes me. I am no different from Greg in this way, but I just don't voice it as boisterously. I think that people are so caught up in their own pride that we don't stop to think about the consequences of the things that we are doing. We forget to think about others and who might get hurt. I'm cutting myself off now but feel free to comment. Right, wrong, or indifferent?

      Roger Clemens has been labeled as a head hunter on more than one occasion and some would say he has made a career out of it. He is more than willing to throw high and tight to the best in the league to get the psychological edge. I understand that this is part of the game for some pitchers so I let this slide. After all he is a great pitcher. Then comes the Mike Piazza fiasco. Piazza breaks his bat on an inside pitch and Clemens chooses to pick the bat up and throw it at him. I thought this was in poor taste, but most of the media stands up for him and tells us that he is a "fiery pitcher who was caught up in the heat of the game." Somewhat disappointed I accept this excuse and move on. But it doesn't seem to stop there with more bean balls to the helmet. Now he has officially made it to my ugly celebrity list. On July 31st, while watching his son play in a little league tournament in Colorado, Roger Clemens was ejected to the parking lot by an umpire. Wait it gets worse. On July 31st, the Astros were in Cinncinati playing the Reds and needless to say Roger wasn't there. Now I'm not very impressed with that part of it because he's not doing a very good job of displaying team unity, but at least he was cutting class to go be with his family. Now on the subject of the ejection. WHAT THE F$#@? Not only is this a 10-year old little league game, but he has no business arguing with the umpires. You can be sure that every kid on that team looks up to him and I don't think arguing about calls makes a very good impression kids of any age. Apparently he wasn't thrown out for arguing, but instead for spitting a sunflower seed on the umpires pants. While this alone is no reason to be tossed, it certainly is not behavior becoming of a professional baseball player. You can make comments to defend him if you want, but I don't think it is going to change my mind.

      Things are starting to look bleak for John Kerry in the presidential race. According to polls taken by the USA Today (which I assume are pretty reliable) Kerry lost 1% and Bush gained 2% following the Democratic National Convention. This hasn't happened since the 70's and you can bet that Bush isn't going to make the same mistake at the Republican Convention and it seems to me that his lead will only grow. I think there are plenty of supporters that still haven't come out of the wood works. As usual comments are welcome.
