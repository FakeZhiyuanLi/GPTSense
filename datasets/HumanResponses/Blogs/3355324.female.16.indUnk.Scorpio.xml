      Notice me  Take my hand  Why are we  In strangers land?  Our love was strong  Why carry on without me?   CHORUS  Everytime I try to fly I fall  Without my wings I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face; it's haunting me  I guess I need you, baby.   I'll make believe  That you are here  It's the only way  I see clear  What have I done?  You seem to move on easy   chorus  I may have made it rain  Please forgive me  My weakness caused you pain  And this song is my sorry  At night I pray  That soon your face will fade away   chorus
