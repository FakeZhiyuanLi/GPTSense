      Ingatan buat Nda Su  Tika kepala dibelenggu Tekanan salur darah  Yang mengembang Aku kebuntuan Lantas minda pantas menerawang Melewati sungai-sungai Menjelajahi gunung-ganang Untuk tiba di daerahmu.  Tika jiwa tiba di teratak kecilmu Rasa tenang menyelinap Menguasai segenap Aliran darah Entah kerana angin yang mesra menyapaku Atau dek halus susun atap nipahmu Aku tidak pasti  Sawah menghijau melambai-lambai Sabar kunanti dikau berganti warna Kuning emas kan bersinar Kelak tiba musim menuai Membilang hari  Masihkah sempat aku di sini  Namun, senyumanmu jua Nda Su Yang aku rindukan Tutur kata lemah lembutmu Kaya dengan pedoman nasihat Tiada Nda mengira Tautan usia perkenalan Yang baru sesaat Lautan kasihmu Serasa dari lahirku bersamamu  Nda, ingin aku kembali Ke sana, ke sisi Namun entah bila  Dapat lagi aku bertandang Ke daerahmu Kerna celik mataku Masih aku lesu terbaring di cadar putih ini.  *buat Nda Su, terima kasih atas segala kasihmu..akan selalu di hati kubawa mati..  27 feb 2004

      seperti bayi  seperti bayi ingin aku menjadi seperti bayi suci bersih dengan haruman kasturi wangian dari syurga milik-Mu  seperti bayi akan aku tenang dari segala kekusutan dunia yang kian mencengkam mindaku yang tenat tepu tanpa rehat kelam kabut ku menghambat waktu seperti bayi aku ingin punya  senyuman penawar gundah senantiasa  seperti bayi  ingin aku menjadi  sepertimu si comel  yang tidur pulas  di buaian!  Dedikasi buat bayi yang bersih dari dosa dan noda 27/02/2004

      the spider who lost its leg…  this morning I saw a spider Crawling slowly In agony Up and down the tap  When I looked closely One of its leg was missing I tried to help it But I was too scared  Its big eyes caught mine So sad I was feeling so sorry  For I couldn’t make things  Better for it  Tonight I wonder  O the lost spider Could you shed tears  Like me?

      04/02/2004  it’s all about…because we’re friends!  If everything that you’ve told me all these years Were all lies I can accept that Though it may break my heart into pieces Because we’re friends.  Once, if that’s true you’re sick (apart from usual pain you’ve always complaint) anger strikes me on the first place why should you’ve to hide it keep it as secret I’m feeling sad Because we’re friends.   Later on, I realized that Not even a single soul in this world Would want to end this life If thousand years given to us We would demand more.  So friend, I just keep hoping You’re not giving up any hope easily Like I used to be before Be strong like you’ve always told me I may not be by your side to encourage you Nor I be in front of you to protect you But, I’ll always be behind you You can’t see me, but you should know I’ll always be near and care for you Because we’re friends!  ·	through sickness we’ll survive…

      God, family and friends  I wrote  this poem with great anger and anguish to God, family and friends.  I never wanna live this life Full of sadness, hatred and sorrow I never wish my eyes to  Bring the tears I never pray my fate  Would be so bad Then why should I  To be born?  God There’s not much I expect From this life I just wanna have a piece of mind, A smart brain and a heart of gold.  Family O my sweet loved ones I just wanna all of you To care and love me Even a little would be great  For me Notice me, accept me As my existence is real.  Friends I wanna spend more  time  With y’all I wanna be a good friend  But why the harder I try the  worse I become?  God Is there any hope for me To have all  these Before I close my eyes Tightly And unable to reopen  Grant me, please God.  Please God, with tears I beg for you!  29 dEc 2003

      Sedih  Aku kini  Sedih selalu Hidup serasa tiada bermakna Sekadar menghela detik ke hari.  Terkadang  Dalam kesedihan  Aku bangkit meraih mimpi Namun bukan sedikit jua Aku kecundang sebelum Bermimpi.  Terfikir Separuh usiaku Dihambat kesedihan Doaku pada Yang Maha Pengasih Agar ada sedikit sisa nyawaku Yang terisi kebahagiaan.  29 Dec 2003

      Sahabat…di mana?  Sahabat…di mana? Yang dulu  Pernah bersama Bergelak ketawa Sama-sama merealisasikan kenakalan Di hujung rotan.  Sahabat…di mana? Yang dulu Selalu bersaing Meraih gelaran terbaik Sama-sama menghidupkan fantasi kanak-kanak Di pentas itu.  Sahabat… di mana? Mungkin dulu jarang  Kita dirundung malang Lantas tiada kita Pernah bersedih Apatah lagi memahami kedukaan.  Sahabat…di mana? Saat ini Kita semua berduka Memencilkan diri tanpa berita Bersendirian  Kita membawa haluan.  Sahabat…di mana? Sebuah mimpi Aku sandarkan pada kalian Agar dapat kita kembali bersatu Menjadikan kedukaan satu inspirasi Untuk kita kembali Bersua!  Buat Sahabat…di mana?-Juanita,Nozu,Mas,Azie n dan Zura..  *notes of d day-fer mas n azie tq fer visiting me..

      24/12/2003  Sesekali… Adakala  Sesekali melintasi pagar sekolah itu pantas teringat kenangan baju kurung putih biru kegirangan riang dan bebas  seperti burung.  	Adakala  ketika kita bagai burung dijerat tersungkur di sangkar ibarat tawanan terfikir di jiwa alangkah indah hidup sebagai dewasa.  Sesekali Kita terkeliru Ketika amarah menguasai Segenap jasad Beralah dalam erti kata Menghormati Namun Rasa dalam jiwa membusuk Mendewasakan kita Sebagai manusia Bertopengkan syaitan.  	Adakala 	Ketika dewasa ini 	Ingin aku kembali 	Menyusuri zaman itu 	Sekali lagi 	Agar dapat aku  	Pulang mencari diri 	Meleraikan kekusutan 	Yang sekian waktu membelenggu!

      Walking slowly the path I saw an old apek Lying on the cold and wet floor Wearing shorts and T-shirt  He looked at me and smiled friendly All I could see in his eyes Is the sorrow and sadness I feel the pain in me  I’m too scared to go nearer Afraid to see him So pale and sick But, why when I looked at him There’s something drumming In my head and heart And this beat is so real The pain, the sadness and the sickness  Walking quickly passing him Avoiding his sad eyes Afraid thatI might lost control His thin figure fade away  As I headed home I thought I would forget him soon  Days and nights Still his eyes Disturbing my dreams In the middle of the night I cried alone for the old apek Whom is a stranger to me  Staring all those pictures Of dad,mum,brothers and sisters I understand now Why god destined me To meet the old apek  His simple message What a wonderful world to have  Everyone in a family!  Dearest love to Ba’ and Ma’. i just wanna be a good daughter but there are times when I lost myself. Heartiest sorry!   16 dec 2003

      5 years  I give myself 5 years time to forget you to be another selfish creature in this world  I’ll see Whether when tears Are about to fall Will I be able  To hold my feet here Without turning my face To you  But  Sometimes Deep inside me Telling that When the time is over I’ll visit you again Lying on you Sharing the unshared stories  5 years I’m sure I’ll come back again to you To the place where I belong The place  that used to be my playground  Now, all I have to say Is Gudbye my green green grass on the ground!	16 dec 2003

      Nan… Smiling Reading the poem Dedicated to a girl Which name almost As same as hers.  Nan… Still enjoying Kemaman air The breezing of village breath When upsets conquered the world Still this kampung soothe her well Just look up the sky And see the eagle soars freely Hoping it’ll take her soul away Too.  Nan… She might or mightn’t be able to love  anyone dearly let her live alone with her fault for the decision she’ve made I bet She may not leave the shore Cause she’s scared to death with ocean.  Nan… I pray for you May in future You’ll be more decisive No more green alien in the drawer!  Dedication to  Nan Fadhilah..

      LOST IN TAN’AEM  Standing on the stairs I stared at the dome Hoping I could see any trace of my parents there I should be crazy But I’m lost in this mosque  The sky so clear and blue Not even a cloud to shed my skin From the burning sun My heart’s singing Frightening beat No familiar faces around  An Iranian woman clad in black Approached me and said something in Persian I didn’t understand and praying She would left me alone  How come I’d lost in this small area I’ve no idea That’s me a flat nose Malay Who lost in Tan’aem!  *to abg ma who will be back this evening-semoga pulang dengan keberkatan,to abg wan n family who will celebrate Eid there..selamat pergi dan kembali!luv ya all..

      My greedy dog  O my greedy dog Stop running and crying I know people cursed your greed For centuries But it’s gonna be okay I wont do that to you I won’t judge you by your mistakes Lesson’s learnt, isn’t it worth? We learn from mistakes.  O my greedy dog Don’t you feel worry I’ll always be in front of you Shielding you from people From harsh words So that you’ll never see and hear anything Or anyone who despise you for your hunger I know you are hungry And it’s not a sin for me.  O my greedy dog Don’t you look back in that water As what you could see is just your tears Neither I want to see the tears Running down straight from your suffering eyes To your slouchy cheek You’re old enough to endure this I’ll take care of you to make you feel safer.  O my greedy dog You’ll always have my trust I won’t tell you how our fate are much alike We did mistakes And we lost everything I said everything Not even a bit is left for us But you’ll always have me to rely on And so do I  In return Will always have you to turn to When each words are just a lie Even though from our trusted ones.  O my greedy dog in me You’re much wiser than sense of  humanity in me So please be alive for me Cause I’ll follow you But don’t tell me to jump into that water again Cause we’ve learned from mistakes,rite?  And for the time being I don’t mind about others anymore All I care about is you O my greedy doggie in me!

      QURAN BURUK  Hari minggu yang lalu Mengemas almari usang Di surau lama Di desa tercinta  Terpaku aku melihat Betapa banyak naskhah Quran Yang telah bertukar warna kekuningan Bertahun tidak disentuh  Helaian terlerai satu persatu Cuba aku menyusun kembali  Namun aku mula keliru Di mana bermula dan di mana berakhir Surah ini Tiada siapa lagi sudi membelek Helaian kusam yang suci ini Hendak dibuang tiada terbuang  Terfikir aku Akan beginikah nasibku Di penghujung nyawa nanti Meratap hiba seperti Quran buruk Yang tiada siapa sudi mendengar..  10.40am Surau An-Nadwah

      My favourite martian is no from Darwin  My favourite martian Is no from Darwin He’s from nowhere Lost in this world full with dead souls..  It’s a grandmother’s story  To tell how was I met him It was by coincidence Or by fate  I don’t really care..  I was lying in that white room With guys in white coat Who treats me like a yummy speciment I hate those eyes belong to them..  Half concious I felt Something cool rub my eyebrow Open my eyes and saw a pair of Eyes hanging from an odd creature’s head Standing right beside me All green, smiling to me, the sweetest I’ve ever had in my life Greenish skin,greenish flesh and greenish tears..  I wanna scream but my voices sank down into  My throat Suddenly I enjoyed the greenish world I was happy to see him He wanna donate blood to me But how could it be I’m O positive He? I wish I was able to have his blood Then I too could become an alien..  There he becomes a good friend of mine Taught me things that I’d never thought before Out of my real world I was drowning into alienic Forget about parents, brothers and sisters It’s all about alien..  Time passed by He was gone for his own sake I let him go  He left me a special gift An alien’s heart in my soul It’s no good than human but The heart he gave to me really taught me The meaning of being a human And to appreciate the feeling of humanity..  I wanna told you  Alien’s heart is out of humanity That greenish dude told me that alien tend to be more selfish Once they know they’d influenced one’s life They used  and manipulated people And that’s the reason why He had to leave me  Before he started using me  That’s what he told me..  One fine day sitting lazily on the bed With books and mags spread over me Phone rang He called me Saying that he’d transformed to human Now casting in US of A I congratulated him and wish him all the best..  Months passed  I’m recovering now Tuesday night glued to tv on channel 2 At 9pm There, my fave martian casting in  ‘Roswell”..  Seasons ended My fave martian is gone As I told you my fave martian is no from Darwin He’s from other land Whenever I miss him I tuned to Starmovie channel  Thursday night at 8pm Though I’ve watched him thousands times I’ll never get bored..  Now,reality bites At last the time to bade farewell come The last season ended with the passing October I’m so sad But to whom should I tell this I wanna watch the alien series Day and night I don’t mind ‘Taken’ can’t take ‘Roswell’ They’re different..  Thanks to god As I still have my martian He’s in Michelle Branch’s video clip ‘My pretty babe’ Watch it just to see my alien Though I don’t favour the song..  There went the story My favourite martian is no from Darwin Landed from nowhere He’s cited in Roswell Now on the way moving to Hollywood Nobody can’t take his place in my heart I mean human mixed with alien’s heart In me..  My favourite martian is no from Darwin He’s from nowhere Belongs to nobody Taught me to appreciate humans Who broke their  words  As much as they used to promise me Who need me when they’re alone Who dump me like hell when they’re happy Who treat me badly Who despise me Who hate me And of course who love me..  My fave martian is no from Darwin He’s just a simple alien-cum-human He’s the one and only alien I love in Roswell He’s my fave martian- Michael Guerin..  Now  My favourite martian is gone I’m all alone back Tuesday and Thursday night made me sick to death It’s okay as long as My favourite martian is no from Darwin..

      Catatan Seorang Alang buat Walid dan Ummi…  Assalamualaikum, salam sejahtera buat Walid dan Ummi yang dikasihi,  Catatan ringkas ini Alang nukilkan di sini sekadar satu escapism dari segala rasa yang Alang simpan buat sekian waktu.  Malam-malam begini, selalu saja mata Alang tiada mahu terkatup. Alang merenung cicak, Walid! Betapa indah hidupnya berada di atas. Melihat dunia dari sudut yang berbeza dari Alang. Alang juga ingin berada di atas, melihat keadaan keluarga kita dari sudut yang berlainan. Alang mengharapkan dapat melihat kepincangan ini sebagai satu kebiasaan. Satu kelaziman bagi setiap insan yang punya keluarga.  Walid dan Ummi,  Bukan tujuan catatan ini untuk menghukum kalian. Alang Cuma tak punya sesiapa untuk mendengar dan berbicara dengan Alang. Along, Angah, Acik, Abang dan Adik telah lama tiada di sini. Bebas mereka merantau jauh, mencari pengalaman hidup. Tinggal Alang di sini, menemami Walid dan Ummi. Namun, kadangkala Alang di rumah bagaikan tunggul. Hmm, mungkin bukan tunggul kerana Alang masih mampu bermain dengan mesin basuh dan pelbagai detergen, berbual dengan ayam, bertelagah dengan kucing, bergurau dengan lalang yang meninggi di halaman. Atau hanya sekadar merenung kenderaan di jalanan. Mungkin Cuma Alang sahaja yang terasa terlalu sunyi di rumah ini.  Walid dan Ummi,  Seringkali, bila Alang tersedar, Alang bersendirian. Rumah terlalu kosong. Kosong dengan debu-debu yang melata di merata-rata. Puas Alang membersihkannya, tetap degil ia bertandang. Samalah jua seperti kesunyian yang Alang rasa. Tetap datang walau Alang cuba penuhkan waktu dengan pelbagai aktiviti. Di meja makan, ketika kita berkumpul menjamu selera, Alang selalu rasa terasing. Alang memahami Walid dan Ummi sangat prihatin dengan anak-anak terbiar, yang hidup dalam kesempitan. Segala waktu dan tenaga yang ada, Walid dan Ummi curahkan pada mereka yang memerlukan. Tiada Alang persoalkan semua itu. Walid dan Ummi selalu punya waktu dan ruang untuk mereka. Alang cemburu dengan kanak-kanak itu. Alang juga ingin merasa sedikit kasih sayang dan keprihatinan itu. Atau mungkin Alang sudah terlalu dewasa untuk menikmati semua itu?  Walid dan Ummi,  Dulu, ketika kecil mungkin sudah terlalu banyak kasih sayang yang kalian curahkan pada Alang. Lantaran itu, bila dewasa begini, Alang perlu belajar menerima hakikat, kasih sayang tulus hanyalah khusus semasa kita masih lagi hingusan. Alang masih ingat bagaimana suatu waktu dulu, setiap petang ketika Alang usai bermain dengan Adik, Walid akan membersihkan tangan dan kaki Alang dan Adik. Bersih-bersih supaya tiada kuman melekat, kata Walid. Betapa bertuah kami punya Walid. Masih juga Alang teringat, setiap malam tenang suara Ummi melagukan ayat-ayat suci Al-Quran. Alang takkan lupa rasa malas yang melanda setiap kali disuruh mengaji. Ummi selalu berkata Alang cepat leka. Ummi tegar mengingatkan Alang tentang pengisian rohani. Tanpa keyakinan pada Tuhan dan kekuatan jiwa, Alang akan hanyut. Itu kata Ummi. Alang ingat semuanya. Dulu, mungkin endah tak endah Alang mendengar nasihat Ummi. Kini Alang sedar dan akur pada kata-kata Ummi.  Walid dan Ummi,  Dulu, Alang tidak merasa keterasingan sebegini, mungkin kerana ketika itu Alang punya teman-teman yang ramai. Ditambah dengan buku-buku yang menimbun di meja, di lantai, di rak dan di katil. Alang selalu ingin menjadi yang terbaik. Alang ingin jadi seperti Along, Angah dan Acik. Serta Abang. Selalu mendapat pujian dari Walid dan Ummi. Cerdas dan pintar, kata Walid. Tetapi kuasa Tuhan siapa dapat menelah, apatah lagi menghalang. Hidup Alang berubah sekelip mata. Kegagalan buah pinggang Alang berfungsi secara normal, menjerat Alang di sini. menghukum Alang dengan ubat-ubatan dan prosedur perubatan yang merumitkan dan adakala menyakitkan. Didalam tahanan rumah yang begitu sepi, Alang terlalu sakit. Alang lebih terluka lagi kerana tiada lagi teman yang sudi bergurau-senda dan menjenguk Alang. Di sini, bermula episod keterasingan, kesepian dan keseorangan dalam diri Alang.   Walid dan Ummi,  Alang tidak menyesal ditimpa nasib begini, kerana dengan sakit ini Alang kembali sujud menyembah Allah. Sekian lama Alang biarkan telekung solat hadiah pemberian Ummi tergantung tanpa disentuh. Alang lalai dan leka dengan kurniaan nikmat Allah. Bukan salah atau kurang ajaran dari Walid dan Ummi, Cuma Alang hanyut dibawa arus kealpaan. Kononnya, ingin meraih gelaran pelajar terbaik, hingga Alang tak punya kesempatan untuk menunaikan kewajipan Alang pada Allah. Mungkin Alang tersilap memilih teman. Alang sedar kini, teman yang baik membawa kita ke arah kebaikan, begitu jua sebaliknya. Kini, Alang tak punya siapa-siapa lagi. Sendirian tanpa teman. Khuatir kesilapan akan berulang lagi. Alang Cuma ingin berada di rumah bersama Walid dan Ummi. Namun, kesempitan masa Walid dan Ummi menghalang.  Walid dan Ummi,  Di waktu ini, kesihatan Alang beransur pulih, mungkin berkat doa kalian, Alang Cuma mengagak. Alang Cuma ingin Walid dan Ummi tahu bahawa Alang tidak pernah lupa mendoakan kesejahteraan dan kebahagiaan Walid dan Ummi serta kita sekeluarga. Bila Alang jauh dari rumah, walau sehari Alang tetap rindu untuk pulang. Biar sesunyi mana pun rumah ini, Alang tetap ingin pulang. Alang berasa bahagia dan selamat di rumah tapi Alang juga rasa keseorangan. Apa yang tidak kena dengan anak Walid dan Ummi ini? Alang cuba melenyapkan ingatan Alang dari rumah ini, namun sudahnya Alang akan terpacak jua di hadapan rumah ini. Pulang dengan rindu dan harapan agar Walid dan Ummi akan berada di sini, menyambut kepulangan Alang.  Walid dan Ummi,  Alang mengharapkan kedatangan tahun baru menjanjikan kehidupan yang lebih baik dan penuh rahmat di rumah ini. Alang berdoa suatu hari nanti, Walid dan Ummi serta semua akan menyedari kewujudan Alang di rumah ini. Biarpun nanti setelah ketiadaan Alang, Alang akan tetap berasa bahagia!   Sayang buat Walid dan Ummi!  01 jAn 2004  Ingatan	: Buat semua ibu bapa. Terima kasih kerana kasihmu! 04 jAn 2004

      Bintang Bertuah…milik siapa?   Malam semakin larut. Mata ini tidak jua mahu terpejam. Aku merenung siling putih bersih. Segala-galanya putih dan hening di sini. Berpusing ke kiri, kulihat Auntie Rani lena diulit mimpi. Kedengaran bunyi alat bantuan pernafasan untuk pesakit asthma, berdengung sayup-sayup di hujung telinga. Cukup untuk membuat mataku ini terbuka luas. Kucapai telefon genggam di sisi bantal. Lima belas minit ke pukul dua pagi.  Aku bingkas menyingkap gebar. Bosan terbaring dalam kelam. Perlahan-lahan kuatur langkah ke bilik menonton. Tetiba, hatiku tergerak melangkau pintu keluar, didorong hasutan nakal dalam diri untuk menjengah ke luar. Kufikir sekadar menghirup udara segar pada awal pagi, siapa tahu mungkin dapat membantuku untuk tidur lena.  Kakiku pantas bergerak ke pintu lif. Masuk dan menekan punat ke tingkat bawah. Mudah saja kulintasi meja pengawal kerana pakcik tua itu sudah pun hanyut dibawa mimpi entah ke mana. Pantas aku mencari sasaran yang sesuai untuk mencuci mataku dengan kegemaranku yang satu, yang kuwarisi daripada arwah Atok -melihat bintang.  Aku bersila di tengah-tengah kawasan parkir kereta berturap tar yang lengang, memanggung kepala mencari bintang bertuah kesayanganku. Masih terngiang-ngiang di telinga suara garau Atok berkata, “Jika kita melihat bintang di langit, di kalangan beribu bintang itu akan ada satu bintang yang paling bercahaya. Bintang itulah yang paling bertuah.” Dan aku sering berangan-angan menjadi bintang itu. Bintang bertuah di kalangan bintang-bintang yang pudar dan kelam.  “Bintang yang paling terang itu, Ayien yang punya,” satu suara halus mengganggu telingaku. Terjerit kecil aku melihat seorang budak lelaki lingkungan usia lapan tahun di hadapanku. Entah bila dia berada di sebelahku tidak pula kusedari. Kepalanya yang hanya tinggal beberapa helaian rambut memberitahuku dia pastinya salah seorang lagi mangsa kerakusan sel darah putih yang lupa diri.  Ish, budak kecil ini! Macam mana boleh terlepas hingga ke sini? getus hati kecilku. Kemudian, aku tersenyum sendiri. Dia ini pasti satu spesies denganku. Licik dan pintar mencari jalan meloloskan diri dari kebosanan. Dia masih tersenyum nakal ke arahku. Mata sepetnya itu kutatap, hmm ada tarikan yang ajaib. Menikam ke kalbu.  “Saya Ayien. Nazrin.” Petah dia memperkenalkan diri. Ayien adalah seorang pesakit leukimia. Hampir setahun menanggung kesakitan, ditambah lagi dengan kesan rawatan chemotheraphy yang terpaksa dilalui. Melihat tanda-tanda lebam di badannya kesan dari tusukan jarum, aku dapat merasai kesakitannya. Ayien galak berbicara, bercerita tentang penderitaannya tanpa ada air mata mengalir di pipi. Dia seorang anak kecil yang tabah dan kuat.  Tempoh perkenalan yang singkat tidak menghalang kemesraan antara aku dan Ayien. Ayien anak yatim piatu yang dibesarkan di rumah kebajikan. Segala kos perubatannya ditanggung oleh sumbangan ikhlas para dermawan yang bersimpati dengan nasib malangnya.  “Ayien tiada siapa yang peduli, tiada ayah tiada ibu untuk menemani tidur Ayien di sini,” ujarnya sayu. Arghh Ayien, aku jugak tak punya siapa menemaniku, namun mungkin aku sedikit beruntung darimu kerana kumasih punyai orang tua yang tidak putus-putus menyayangiku. Ayien bercerita tentang keinginannya menggapai bintang yang paling bercahaya itu.Sekejap sahaja kesedihannya berlalu, ketawa girangnya nyaring berlagu di telingaku bila kukhabarkan padanya, aku bukan sahaja ingin menggapai bintang itu malah ingin menjadi bintang itu sendiri.  Di sebalik tubuhnya yang melidi, Ayien punya cita-cita yang melangit.  “Ayien ingin jadi seorang doktor,” ujarnya dengan penuh semangat.  “Alasannya?” aku memprovokasi Ayien untuk berbicara tentang impiannya. Bukankah zaman kanak-kanak adalah zaman penuh impian. Pastinya Ayien salah seorang daripada kanak-kanak itu.  “Ayien ‘ndak tolong kanak-kanak yang sakit macam Ayien. Ayien nak semua kanak-kanak hidup sihat. Boleh bermain, belajar dan makan tanpa kesakitan. Kalau orang susah, Ayien akan tolong percuma saja, Ayien akan rasa seronok kalau dapat tolong orang lain,” bersahaja kanak-kanak itu menjawab.  Terdetik rasa kagum dalam diriku pada anak sekecil ini yang sudah punya keinginan untuk membantu, sedang aku apatah lagi membantu, rasa ingin menolong jauh sekali dari diriku. Ayien juga punya matlamat dan cita-cita yang jelas. Aku? Terumbang-ambing tanpa cita-cita. Begitu jauh jarak beza usia antara kami begitulah jauhnya jarak ketajaman fikiran dan rasa kemanusiaan dalam diri aku dan Ayien.  “Akak, apa cita-cita akak?” Ayien bertanya dengan mata sepetnya membulat ke arahku. Aku mengerutkan kening, tanda berfikir. Sukarnya memberi jawapan yang sesuai untuk Ayien. Perlukah aku ceritakan betapa aku pernah disingkirkan dari kolej kerana beberapa kali kecundang dalam peperiksaan semester? Bagaimana hendak aku nyatakan aku pernah dibuang keluarga kerana kedegilan dan sikap keras kepalaku? Atau bercerita sahaja bahawa aku juga suatu waktu dulu pernah punya cita-cita melambung tinggi, ingin membantu arwah Atok yang tinggal di pedalaman meningkatkan taraf hidup masyarakat desa yang mundur? Arghh, memandang mata Ayien sahaja sudah menyebabkan aku sebak, apatah lagi memikirkan tentang janji-janjiku pada Atok yang tidak pernah aku sempurnakan.  Malam itu, pertama kali aku bercerita tentang kisahku kepada seorang kawan semuda usia lapan tahun. Aku tidak peduli jika dia tidak memahami apa yang aku ceritakan padanya. Segalanya. Perbalahanku dengan keluarga yang menentang kursus pilihanku. Desakan mereka untuk melihatku menjadi seorang doktor. Dan betapa aku pernah sungguh-sungguh membenci karier semulia itu. Aku ceritakan jua, dalam kedegilan aku meneruskan pengajianku tanpa restu.  Kemudian, bala mula menimpa satu persatu ke atas diriku. Bermula dengan pengesahan aku menghidap SLE yang entahkan sampai bila dapat kubertahan, kegagalan dalam pengajianku, seterusnya pemergian abadi Atok tanpa ada kemungkinan lagi untuk kembali bergurau-senda denganku. Segala-galanya datang bertimpa tanpa ada sedikit ruang simpati untuk aku. Sudahnya, aku bukan lagi diriku yang dahulu. Hidup tanpa semangat.   Dan, betapa bertuahnya aku kerana dipungut kembali oleh keluarga. Dilimpahkan kasih sayang dan rawatan yang memungkinkan aku bertahan sehingga kini. Ayien khusyuk mendengar, berbaring di sebelahku. Setia. Selesai bercerita, aku menoleh kepadanya. Ayien diam tanpa kata. Dia merenung bintang bertuah itu. Aku tersenyum pahit.  Lembayung kemerah-kemerahan di kejauhan langit menyedarkan aku kembali. Fajar subuh mula menyingsing dan bintang bertuah itu telah pun lama hilang. Angin yang berpuput sayu dari Sungai Pahang menyapa lembut, saat aku menapak perlahan ke wad meninggalkan tar hitam itu bersama Ayien.   Di pintu lif, sebelum berpisah, Ayien memegang tanganku seraya berkata, “ kitalah bintang bertuah itu, kerana terpilih untuk hidup sehingga hari ini, punya masa untuk mengejar impian kita.”  Azamku pulang nanti akan aku laksanakan janjiku yang masih terbengkalai. Semoga Tuhan merestui aku dan Ayien-Nazrin si kawan kecilku!  Ingatan: HTAA 1997  27 Dec 2003.

      To Whom It May Concern…   Dad used to say:  Fall for a guy for what he is and he in return  Would fall for you for what you are,  no matter how naughty you are,  he’s willing to guide you,  to show you the better path of life,  and the best is both of you are happy.   Mum used to say:  Be careful with guys  They might hurted you,  Leaving you-broken-hearted.   Brother’s words :  Find a guy at least ten years older than you,  Maturity helps much in life.   Friend’s words :  Don’t go for a guy more than ten years  Older than you.   My words :  To whom I might fall is beyond my control  Forgive me  If one day I disobey all these words  I’m no angelic  I’m just the greenish alien  Lost in this wide world!   *with everyone setting up the rules, regulation and standard, to whom may I rely on now?

And you Don’t you see the sign The sign that answers everything You wanted Please stop playing games with me  I’m too tired to think To live Even for breathing this life Seeing one by one Those broken hearts among my loved  Feel the pain stabbing inside me It’s sickening my heart  I’m no hypocrite I wanna tell you something Come deep within me Sometimes you’ve got to lose In order to be a winner  Though u know the only truth For I love you very much Understand me Please!

Give me a sign…that I can survive all this I wanna out of this darkness and horror Just lead me a way…a road…a tunnel…a light.. Let me know that I’m not all alone in this lonesome journey Help me to be a better…stronger…healthier…wiser…smarter  person Grant me a heart to love and share this moment of life… Please help me through… Bless me forever!

      13/10/2003   The Frogs Who Wanted a King  ---------------------------   The frogs were living happy as could be  In a wet marsh to which they all were suited;  From every sort of trouble they were free,  And all night long they croaked, and honked, and hooted.  But one fine day a bull-frog said, “The thing  We never had and must have is a king!”   So all the frogs immediately prayed;  “Great Jove,” they chorused from their swampy border,  “Send us a king and he will be obeyed,  A king to bring a rule of Law and Order.”  Jove heard and chuckled. That night in the bog  There fell a long and most impressive Log.   The swamp was silent; nothing breathed. At first  The badly frightened frogs did never once stir;  But gradually some neared and even durst  To touch, aye, even dance upon, the monster.  Whereat they croaked again, “Great Jove, oh hear!  Send us a living king, a king to fear!”   Once more Jove smiled, and sent them down a Stork.  “Long live—!” they croaked. But ere they framed the sentence,  The Stork bent down and, scorning knife or fork,  Swallowed them all, with no time for repentance!   THE MORAL’S this: No matter what your lot,  It might be worse. Be glad with what you’ve got.

      Chapter 1            : Offspring In Me…  1985  There are many things I remember about being a child. I spent my time mostly with my cute sister, Aini. She’s a year older than me. She is a good friend of mine. Sometimes, we quarreled too but normally it would not last long. Maybe because we’re peers so we don’t have much trouble to suit each other, until today. She’s an outgoing person while I’m a homely. She has many friends while I’m not. Too many difference between us but still we are great as sister and friend. I  started remember things as a child is at around age of four. I also have a younger sister, Hasanah. She was born when I was three years old. So I couldn’t visualized her well during the day she was born and her growth, as we grew together. All I remember is, she was the real obstacle for me and Aini to play and sing loudly. No whistle and no shouting while she was sleeping.  In 1985, we moved to Felda Neram Satu situated in a green place full with palm oil tree. Bak was transferred to this Felda years before that, but he kept staying in Kemaman. I don’t know why because as a child I never think to ask why. But at last, my dad decided to stay in Felda and brought us along though the home provided for us was not fully finished yet. Conversely, we move into a terrace home. There were too many big mosquitoes sucking my blood and the worst was we also had to deal with water supplying problem. I still remember two to three days a week, there were no water running from taps. This kind of matter never happened to us before, so we were having difficulties at the beginning. I and my sisters had a bad fever due to those crazy mosquitoes.  I also still remember the sour smell of palm oil came from the processing factory nearby every morning. I cannot enjoyed my breakfast well.  The smell really nauseated my appetite. At that moment I missed Kemaman very much. My home, my kampong, my kedai Pak Kasseem, my bicycle and everything. Before I forgot to mention, I also have another older sister. We called her Kak Cik. She was around ten at that time. Every morning, she went to the school with Bak. She missed her former school in Kemaman terribly. But, there was no way out at that time.  The experience of living at the terrace home was really a nightmare for us. And it was a great relief when the house for us is finally finished. It’s located on a hill. I could see the school just by standing in front of the front door. They looked so small. Like boxes that were arranged horizontally and vertically.  I also remember, every evening Bak brought Aini and I to school. Bak was a headmaster there. We walked around the blocks. While Bak inspected classes full with pupils, we followed him behind. I didn’t like those stares upon us because it made me feel like a prisoner, the captured one. When Bak was talking with teachers I looked and searched for everything. Playing, running and chasing with my sister. We really had a good time together. It was free to be far from Hasanah. She was so small at that time and sometimes we have to look for her while Mak was cooking. She was a cute and nice girl but maybe because I was also a kid so I couldn’t appreciated her well.  1986  We lived there for about a year or so. Then Bak and Mak went to Mecca. We stayed in Kuantan with Kak Dah, my eldest sister. Back from Mecca, Bak decided to resign. He became a pensioner. And we were so happy as we headed back to our home in Kemaman. Home sweet home. Kak Cik went back for schooling to her former school.  At the time I was five years old, my mum sent me to a Mak Aji who taught us to read Al-Quran. Along with Aini. Every morning, we crossed the road in front of our house to go to Mak Aji’s house. That’s scared me much because there were too many cars speeding and roaming like tiger on the road. Till today I got nerves crossing the roads. We also had a friend, our neighbour called Hajariah. Hajar has a sister, we called Baby. Baby was a year younger than me while Hajar was Aini’s age. We went to Mak Aji’s together. Playing together. Fighting together. Sometimes we quarreled too, but it lasted for only couples of day as we don’t have any other friend  except Hajar and Baby.  Bak and Mak never let us played far away from home. It was whether at our house or Hajar’s. They were only friends we had at the time. As a child, I think my parents were acting weird. We were not to play out of our compound. I thought it was cool for a kampung girl to be tough and brave and knows everything about what kampong provides us. But, I must admit that we grew too with our two affectionately friends. Hajar and Baby also had parents like mine. So, we understood each other well. What to play and what not to play. Where to go and where shouldn’t. Our home was used to be my playground. It reminds me of Madonna’s – This Used To Be My Playground.    1987     : sole heart  A year passed by like lightning. I became 6 years old. Aini went to school. Routines changed. I have no one to play around. I went to Mak Aji’s home alone. Every morning, Bak or Mak accompanied me crossing the scary road. While Aini attended the evening session. Without Ani, I survived myself very well.  I made friends. But the closest was a girl called Kak Tijah. She’s five years older than me. She was very nice and kind. I remember Mak Aji told me to teach her, just because she had problems in reading Al-Quran. It was my pleasure to help her as she was a very polite and humble for a friend. She never treated me badly even though I was only a kid for her at that moment. We went to Mamak’s together, bought candies, sweeties and ice creams. And sometimes she helped me crossing the road. She was my first friend, even though she was much older than me. It’s really cool to have someone older as a friend because I feel  safer and protected.   Chapter 2            : New world treasured  1988 - 1993  1988  I’m seven years old. Bak registered me to Sekolah Rendah Sultan Ismail. I was in Standard One Teratai. I still remember the day. Too many girls and boys. Those frightened faces, some were crying and others clinging to their parents. I saw everything. But I just kept cool and feeling very happy to be at school. Too many things were waiting to be explored. Bak left me in the class. I still remember my class teacher, Cikgu Zaharah. She was a nice teacher though quite strict. I made friend with a girl called Hidayah. I did not remember much about her, but she was an orphan. Her father’s dead in an accident. During recess, we went to the canteen together. And that day was the first day I bought food myself. Nice experience though nobody accompanied us. We saw parents were everywhere. Suddenly, I saw Bak. He was looking at me from far. Well, I’m a survivor! Anywhere you sent me.  Six months later, I’d been transferred to another school. Here I came to Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Kemaman.The main reason to be here was because Aini and her whole class had been transferred to this school earlier. Then Bak decided to register me there too. Besides, my Cikgu Zaharah had called my father, informed him to bring me along to this new school where she would be teaching at that moment.  I did not know why me, had been chosen by her. Only me. It was quite weird to be in the new class on the first day. Maybe I hate attention so those stares and wide-eyed friends didn’t help me much that day. I sat and kept silent the whole day. I didn’t know what I felt. Neither missed my former nor liked this school. Day by day, I learned to adapt to this new environment.  I got two friends, they are Zuraain and Shamsuriati. Zura lived in Kampung Gong Limau, while Sham came from Kedah and stayed in Kampung Besut. They were really good friends. But, at that time I just enjoyed being alone. I went to canteen myself, spent time reading and drawing. And nobody dared to bother me.  1989  Year passed. I was in Standard Two. My class teacher is Cikgu Hajah Hindun. She is a gentle and nice lady. I like her but sometimes when she showed her special attention to me in front of class I felt ashamed and uncomfortable. I always found ways to avoid her. I’ve never met her years after she’s retired, but one day last year; on Nisfu night, I went to surau with Bak and Mak. And to my surprise an old lady said she knew me. I just smiled and thought she was one of Mak’s friend as I’m a forgetful one. Forgive me Mak for you’ve been granted with this daughter! She said she taught me in my early ages. Well, she was my Cikgu Hajah Hindun. What a shame for me not to recognized her at the first place.  Back to childhood time, still in that year, I’d no close friend. But, at the end of that year I befriended with Zuraain. Again. We actually had some similarity but never noticed it. We were naughty and hot-tempered but we were alone so the crazy skills were hidden beneath the loneliness. Reversibly, we wanted to be the smart girls. Our end year examination result were excellent, so we headed to Standard Three Delima together. No more alone for myself. I’d a friend and wanna be good to her.  1990  Standard Three Delima. This is where I started to all out myself. All I think was about myself, my study and my time. I did anything I wished. I developed to be a bad one. I didn’t know why but I just couldn’t help myself to express my anger and frustration when someone irritated me. Or when just something happened and I couldn’t stand it, I became angry easily. Fortunately, I never expressed my anger with hurting anyone. When I lost, I slammed the door, books and shouted what I felt. Zura was worse than me. She attacked physically. I did not do that because in my family, it was prohibited to hit, punch or kick anyone else. but, when someone attacked, in order to defend ourselves, all those action permitted. Honestly, I won’t hurt anyone just to satisfy my anger. I didn’t want to get hurt or hurting anyone either. But, after all we had different background. Isn’t nice that we were not all made alike?  Teachers knew us. We were smart but quite stubborn. We did our best in exams and snatched the first and second place. So, there were no reasons for teacher to punish us. The worst punishment we ever had that year was just our ears being pulled. That was nice, I think.  That year too Bak and Mak went to Mecca for Umrah and we; Aini, I and Hasanah transferred to Kuantan. We schooled there for two weeks or so. I could not remember much about school there, but I remember a cute friend called Hasbanu. She was the class monitor and she was a nice girl and so kind to me. She had helped me much in coping with my new school. Surely, it just for a short time but I also had a great time there, with her.  1991  Back to Kemaman, I and Zura went to Standard Four Delima together; again. In Standard Four, I’d reduced my level. I’d to be a good girl, a bit nicer because of my class teacher, Cikgu Abdul Rahim. He was a teacher at Felda Neram Satu before. So, Bak knew him well. But, once I did punished by him too, because some misunderstood made by friends. I did not really care about anything like that, as long as he kept that as top secret. What frightening me most at that time was what if he called Bak and let the story prevailed. I’m sure I was history then. That would be a nightmare for me. Bak understood me for being a bad-tempered, but still I behaved like an angel at home. No argument, no slamming the doors and no talking  too much while eating. Isn’t it nice for a girl like me?  First reason for not being a rebel at home was I have older sisters, so I’d to respect them. Though sometimes they bullied me too. I always remember how Bak didn’t like us to talk much while eating. I agreed with him. I think that while eating we don’t have to talk much, because if we do, we enjoy our food less. Otherwise, we have more time to think how grateful we are to have something to eat. I learned to appreciate food as I grow. Born in a big family made me see a lot of characters. What a different we are made, but I still love her very much. I think I am very much like Bak. I’m reserved, like to see everything in proper and managed, and that hot-tempered of course, just like him. Well, that’s what we say like father like daughter or vice versa?  Well, back to school. I and Zura became closer. We were always together. Zura was really damn good in Malay Essay, I learned a lot from her. She also had a  nice handwriting. I remember one day, Cikgu Rahim insisted us to take part in Essay writing competition among classes. The competition was held in the library, Zura wrote non-stopped. While I craved my mind to start the essay. At the time I finished, I gave a glance to her, and still she didn’t stop writing yet. It was a very long story I guess, not an essay. I told her the essay shouldn’t be written using more than 120 words. She said with that amount, she couldn’t wrote and elaborated her ideas well. Back in the class, cikgu asked her why she wrote a long story. I couldn’t help to laugh at her. Cikgu say it was a ‘cerpen’. She laughed too. Luckily, I got the second prize. Sometimes, she was so stubborn while I convinced her to be good. There were times, she convinced me. She is really my dear friend. She was absolutely unique and weird; both. And I love her much for that.  Since we knew each other, there were too many times we quarreled. We didn’t talked for days. As we were really close, when we had our bad time, everyone knew. What a nuisance! I still remember the day when I’d to stand up during Agama Islam lesson, just because I didn’t talk to Zura for days. It was only me. And of course it hurt me very much. I didn’t know who told Ustazah about us. It was a humiliation for me when Ustazah asked me whether my dad taught me or not, that in Islam if we quarelled for more than three days we were out of God’s blessing. What Bak got to do with my problem here? I’d a fight with Zura, sure it was. But, I did not even think to share it with Bak. Should a father to interrupt into a daughter’s problem as small as that? Damn sure if I knew who the hell it was at that time, he would know who I am. And I bet he would hate me for the rest of his life.  Even though I’d warned by ustazah to seek apology from Zura, I didn’t do that. I didn’t know whose fault it was. Neither I nor her to be blamed. I believed in every friendship, mistakes happened. Sometimes, we thought our friend hates us, and our friend thought it instead. That’s what makes friendship so wonderful. Weeks by, I befriended Zura. Again. Without forgiveness, we were friends back. Believe me, don’t depend much on apology and forgiveness. Friends are something that happens so spontaneously. You don’t force yourself to fall for a friend, just let it be naturally. You will enjoy your friendship.  1992  As usual, we left that year with flying colours. We walked together to Standard Five Mutiara. We sat side by side. We were appointed to be school prefects, based on our academic qualification of course. Not because we had a very ‘nice’ attitude. It was difficult at the beginning to be apart during the duty, later we adjusted to it. Though, sometimes I  skipped duty too, especially in the morning. It was so boring to guard in front of the gate, and asked and wrote the pupils’ name who came late to school. It was so cold in the morning and I hate mosquitoes. Those tiny creatures made my skin itchy and swollen. I’m allergic to them. Hence, I’d rather stayed in class. Sleepy and lazy.  In class, we always had things to do, things to chat. Our desk was straight opposite our teacher’s. Then, we were shifted to sit in back rows. Great places for us, I thought. We ate, played recorder, chatted and played cards in class. Once, we’d to stand up in front of class because we ate. It was a sweet memory for me,  since we were the only prefect being punished with that special fault. Others were making noises, while we were eating. We were warned, as that was the first time we were caught. Finally, we were separated by cikgu. Zura’s was in front of the class, while I was at the back. Thanks to cikgu for doing that, as I learned to be a great one.  Sitting beside me was Mahizan. I still remember that cute boy. He liked drawing very much. But, he teased me everyday. Sometimes, I couldn’t help myself to yell at him. Surely, it was not so nice for a girl but as usual I lost my temper easily. And he would kept quiet for a while. Then, he did it again. What a stubborn boy he was at that time. I never had brothers staying with me in my home, so I guess it just a boy’s craziness. Plus, my brothers wouldn’t did those thing to me while they were home. That’s the weakness left in me, till now. I will never been able to control myself, to keep calm in any challenging moment.  End of year, the exam result shocked me. I was breathless. 24th is not a great number. All I thought is what had I’d answered in my papers. I’d done my best. This wasn’t funny at all. I kept quite for the half of the day, until I inspected the result paper. There were mistakes for my marks. So, cikgu had to recorrect it and I got the third place. Not good but at least it was better that 24. Fuh, what a relief! Imagine what would Bak thought about that ‘great’ result. Fortunately, I’d saved by the day. I couldn’t remember whether Zura’s was better or worse than me that year.  1993  We moved to Standard Six. Last year in primary. That year we had our important examination. UPSR. We competed each other in order to achieve the best result for our school. I and Zura sat aside our skills and paid attention to our study. Still we were prefects.  One day, I and Zura with other friend named, Zafirah; the head girl, skipped off duty during recess. So we spent our time on the third floor. There’s no class at that level, just a library. We didn’t noticed there was our most fierce Sir in it. Mr. Wong was our English teacher. He frightened us just by his face. He was a nice looking one but I did not know why did a smart guy scared me much. Maybe because he was my teacher.  Suddenly, while we were chatting and laughing outside the library, the door opened. We stared at the door; wide-eyed and to our horror, there was our sir. Gosh! Zafirah ran to the stairs and jumped down. While I and Zura could not moved. Stood like a statue. I felt my blood drained. Zura was white as chalks and I thought so did I. He just asked us to get some exercise books from his desk in the staff room which was located on the first floor. We still shocked, just nodded and headed to the stairs quickly.  Then, he yelled and said, “Nine(he used to call Zura with that nick) and Nan, did you know which book is it?” And he laughed at us. Surely, we didn’t even remember to ask which books he meant. He laughed outrageously. I think he knew we were so afraid of him. Really afraid. Our face proved that. This sir was making fun of us, and I think that was not a good joke. We ‘respected’ him so much. I and Zura just gave him a very nice smile but only God knew what was inside us. Anyway, that day was surely his day.  We passed UPSR with 4A’s. At last, time to bade farewell to our school and friends. Sweet memories remain unchanged till today. At that school I learned a lot of things. Meaning of life, friendship, emotions and pride. The saddest part is of course to be separated with Zura. She went to other school in Kuala Terengganu. While I registered at Kemaman. I’d been offered to some schools in Kuala Terengganu but Mak insisted that she preferred me staying at home. And as  a ‘good’ daughter, I obeyed. But, one thing is I never found a best friend like Zura anymore.   Chapter 3            : Changes  1994-1995  1994  End of 1994. I stepped to SMAAF. The one and only ‘religious’ school in Kemaman. I guessed this school was no different from other school. Maybe just because we’d to learn Arabic so it sounds Islamic.  The first day I came here, I knew that everything would be difficult for me. I did not know why, but the gut inside me told that.  I studied in Form 1B. All were girls. There were around 25 pupils in that class. I made friends with some girls from my former school. They were Juanita, Masriyati and Ismaliza. They were nice friends. Juanita is from Kuala Lumpur, Mas Ipoh-originated from KL too, and Ismaliza from Melaka. Together we learned to suit each other. Among us, I was the weakest in Arabic. I only can understand simple things. Writing essay would be a real challenge for me. I did not blame mak for insisting me to learn Arabic. It was just me, myself who could not understand those lesson. I failed the subject in monthly tests. Fortunately, I did well in other subjects. Months passed, Ismaliza shifted to school in KT, leaving just the three of us.  1995  We did our best in our exam and headed to Form 2B together again. There was no improvement in my Arabic. It was even worse, and my parents knew it well. I was thankful to Bak for understanding my weakness. And he promised me that after PMR, I was freed to choose my school. After all, I still maintained my place in my class.  Chapter 4            : Dark year…  1996  End year examination of Form Two, I did my best to impress my parents. I think this is a way to prove them that I really meant to be out of this school with pride. But, things were not so easy when you planned it earlier. Juanita and Masriyati dropped down to Form 3C due to their result. And I, alone shifted to Form 3A. Frankly, I’m not a friendly person. I only had the two of them as friend. Others were just acquaintances. I was so sad at that moment and told Bak that I was planning to talk to my class teacher. In hope, she would dropped me to Form 3C too. Bak was against that idea and I kept it aside from my mind.  I remember the days, everyday during recess I went to Form 3C to meet my friends. We just separated by a class so I did not have any trouble to spend time there. The 3C teachers knew me well. By time, I befriended NoorZu a former Form 2B. I seldom spoke to her before. But when we transferred to 3A and sat side by side, we became friend. One thing I remember about her before was, she always absent from school. She was sick and suffered a bad headache.  What a pity when she got headache. I helped her putted some ointment and sometimes when things got out of control I brought her to emergency room. She also had allergic to some medicine which could brought numbness to her body. I helped her with my best and always think whether there will be a person to help me when I’m in pain? All of my life, she was my first sick friend I had, and I grew to be more caring, sensitive and responsible.  But, one day in early 1996, a day that changed my life totally came. During my school time, I suffered a bad headache. I guess it was just migraine, a Sunday routine. As we had assembly in the morning and went back home at 3.00 pm every Sunday. I went home and the pain became worse. Blurred vision and all I saw is just zig zag lines. I blamed the sun for heating me up. I vomited and to my horror I felt nothing. I was numb.  And all I could think at that time was; am I paralyzed? I did not have the tears to cry because everything seems like a dream. And I told myself repeatedly that I was dreaming and everything would be better when I opened my eyes. But, still when I opened my eyes the pain was everywhere. I could not remember how many hours I spent lying; numbness. All I could remember was, I woke up the next morning feeling too tired and exhausted.   Later that day, I went to clinic. The doctor informed me that all the symptoms were related to exhaustion. I could not agreed with the doctor as that day I did my daily routine as usual. No other physical activities added.  But, I did took the medicines.  I rest at home for one week. I was feeling really tired and cold. My mind was really in a miserable state. Plus, I started feeling dizzy when I read. The words were running up and down beyond my eyes. At that time I only think that I could not bear this feeling anymore. Why this had happened to me? For all the time, I only heard and saw how Noorzu kept complaining the pain she suffered. And now what was I going to do when I was the sufferer myself?  The pain throbbed my head severely and all I could do was lying and praying that there would be another better day for me. Noorzu called me almost everyday, she told me everything about school, our class. She was so glad when she informed me that I had appointed as prefect. Gosh! I even did not have any feeling towards that news. I was sad but I couldn’t expressed my sorrow well. This is because I had never been so sad before. These pain was really killing me softly.  In just one week, I changed into a weak, pale and faint-hearted girl. I felt I knew nothing. I spent sleepless nights, staring through darkness with fear and feeling I had nobody to protect me. I wanted to share what I felt inside me with others. About everything; the pain, the sorrow, the horror, the ghost that kept haunting me day and night. But, I trusted nobody.  I went back for schooling. But I felt some strange sense inside me. Meeting friends was not as fun as before. Studying in class was really sickening me. I could not bear with the headache. I cannot concentrated and being well-focused like before. But nobody noticed it. I turned into another person. Moody, reserved and anxious. I was pressured enough to cope with my sickness and study. My grade and health dropped gradually; both. I guess that was the right word to describe it.  The pain destroyed myself; physically and mentally. I was no longer a brave and confident. And one of the weirdest thing was I became an enemy to height. Once I used to laugh at Juanita because she would screamed hysterically when we forced her to looked down over only third level. I thought why should she become so hysteric? It was fun actually to see things so small and it is like you can grab everything only by using your hand. And now, I was one of the people who would scared to death only with height.  Day by day, the pain worsened my balance system. I used to avoid crowded places and open spaces. At that time I guess I was phobic. I couldn’t stayed calm when I felt fainted during lesson. I could not kept smiling when the pain was aching all over my head. I could not understand my body any longer. Numbers of doctor had diagnosed me with migraine, tension headache. What tensed me? What was the cause? What was the exact problem? Terminal disease? One of the doctor recommended an x-ray to check my skull condition. And none of the result solved my pain. But, still my life went on.  I sat for PMR that year. Struggling to finish the exam. Sometimes, I thought of dying. I didn’t wanna die young. But, the sense kept wandering my mind. I just live for my parents’ sake. Without their blessings, I’m sure I could not survived well. Result announced and I got straight A’s. I was not so happy with the result. Why God had punished me with this way? How could I to further my study in boarding school while I wasn’t physically fit to stay far away from my hometown and doctor? I was depressed but I would never let anyone knew my regret. Noorzu got 7A, Juanita 5A and Mas 3A.  Chapter 4            : Troubles  1997  We went to Form 4A together. Four of us. Later, Noorzu went to MRSM Kuantan while Juanita to Sekolah Menengah Teknik Kuantan. They left me with Mas. At the time, I suffered balance disorder. But still I attended school. The days at school really tensed me. The lessons became more difficult for me. I’d to sat for two Arabic paper. Communication and literature. I understood nothing about it.  Along with my sickness, I become interested with medical stuff. I’d subscribed health magazines, bought books and also lots of supplement. I preferred non-drug medicines as they have less side effect for me. Plus, drugs made me drowsy and sleepy. So, less time to study as I spent days with sleeping. I still remember I’d to swallow everything. From Lingzhi capsules, Noni Juice, Ginkgo Biloba and many more. And surely, those stuff were sucks!  One day, I’d fallen sick at class. I could not remember things well. Mas brought me to sickroom and called Bak to fetch me home. And that day was the last day I went to school that year. I’d suffered a really bad vertigo. Brief definition of Vertigo; is a disturbance of the sense of balance with difficulty in maintaining equilibrium. True vertigo is the sensation of either moving around in space or having objects move around the individual.  I also developed panic or anxiety disorder related to my fear of losing control. I suffered dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea. This lead me to an extreme anxiety and avoidance. I became a housebound, unable to leave a very small safe zone. I spent my time in my room, lying and thinking. For sure, negative thoughts conquered the situation. I did not answered when my friends called. Bak turned to be my operator at that time. I was really alone at that time. I think of nothing. I did not want to know about future. All I think was what would happened to me next.  Actually, months before my health dropped, we planned to Mecca for Umrah. At the time I fell sick, there was only one month’s time left for preparation. I, myself did not think I could bear a long distance journey in this condition. But, mak assured me to fight those fear and sickness. And there we set off to Mecca.  We spent two weeks in Mecca. In the last week there, Bak was food-poisoned. He vomited vigorously and was really weak at that time. He was sent to the hospital by Ustaz and dripped with only one pint of water. He was overly dehydrated but I  didn’t understand why the doctor just prescript with that amount of water. I also didn’t quite understand with the medical procedure there. We’d to pay first before we permitted to see the doctor. While, the consultation and medicine fee were paid apart. Compared here, I think the service is much more friendly and convenient.  During our journey back home, Bak was still a bit weak. Fortunately, I’d Kak Cik and Ani to manage our luggage. At that time, I was quite better. While my lovely sister, Hasanah suffered with air sickness during our flight back from Jordan to Kuala Lumpur. And, finally we arrived home safely. It was good to be here back in our hometown. I was grateful for had been given chance to be here again. I still suffered the dizziness but I was no longer spent my time in my room. I learned to accept the reality that everything was destined upon me, positively. It was surely not an easy task for me. But, at least I’d tried and it’s worth. I guess.  Chapter 5            : Medicated  1998  Time flied. Now, came 1998. That year I was scheduled to sat for SPM. But still I couldn’t attend the class. I really didn’t have any idea what to do at the moment. Days before the school started, I went to see Dr. Razin in Kuala Terengganu.  The first day at school, my friends kept greeting me, not forgetting the teachers. I found it was hard to cope with the school environment for the first time after four months, prisoner at home. Actually, the right words to describe is I was scared. Totally scared. Scared of being weird and the feeling I might lost my control conquered me. At the end of the day, I was feeling really tired and exhausted.  Through that night, I spent time lying, awaken. The ache throbbing my head, my skull. I never wish this to be happened to me. I just wanted to live like others. Like Masriyati and Aziera. Happy being at school. But, that night I realized that everything was scheduled differently for me, right from the beginning. It’s fated to me, not anyone else. I was chosen and I’ve got no choice than to endure this with piety. Swallow the pain though it sucks. Then, I absent for the rest of the year. Again. I just went to take oral test and trial exam. The result; 15 aggregate.  In the meantime, I was still under Dr Razin’s treatment. Once a month I went to KT. Besides, the medicines I took I also seek Pak Abu, a very nice guy, an alternative treatment practitioner. He came to our house once a month or we went to his home otherwise. He used herbs and massage to cure me. He told me I’d problem with my blood. For sure, I never admitted that seriously because I’d been through several blood test before. And there were no signs of any terminal diseases. But, I still obeyed his instruction.  I remember those days, I’d to drink ginger juice added with yolk everyday before breakfast, for a week. Plus, to swallow yolk every morning. When I think about it today, gosh how could I did that. It is surely not an easy task for me to do it today, unless I’m under pressured. Fortunately, my health seems to getting better. I wasn’t look pale anymore. The dizziness decreased. Yet, I still had to take my Ginkgo Biloba’s capsules. Thrice a day.  As I absent from school for the whole year, it seems quite difficult for me to sat for SPM in that year. Hence, I decided to postpone my SPM to the next year. And there were too many procedures to be considered. I’d to obtain a health certification letter from the government’s doctor, not the private one. It was rather difficult for me because I’d seek advice from the private doctor. So, my medical history recorded there.  But, fortunately I went to the hospital once, done a head x-ray. There, I went to Hospital Kemaman, but the doctor recommended me to Kuantan General Hospital. I went to Kuantan General Hospital. I was hospitalized in Kuantan for three days. I couldn’t slept well at night, because the medical tools or what they called  I didn’t know, kept reciting the noise. Unstoppable sounds.  One thing, I remember mostly during the hospitalization is, there was an old Indian lady. Her bed was beside mine. She was a friendly and always smile. When I read ‘Yassin’, she would looked and listened. At last, the day for discharged came. She also released on that day. Before, she went back home, she gave me a brooch. It was a peacock. It was a very nice gift and I still remember her face until today. I really hope she’s doing well now, as at that time she had a bad asthma.  So, that year SPM passed by without me. Of course, I was so sad at that time, watching girls in uniforms went to school for examination. I told myself to be patient. Don’t cry, because tears could drowned my strength. I didn’t want to stuck with all those negative feelings. After all, reality bites! Isn’t it?  Chapter 6            : Trying times  1999  Another new day has came. 1999. I hoped the best for this year. I went to school like last year, for only on the first day. I sat for oral test. And I was fortunate to have a junior called Murni. She was a nice girl. She was friendly and always help me in everything. Accompanied me everywhere I went. A great companion. Now, I don’t know where she’s, but the last information I had about her is she’s studying at UM. I sent her cards to her home’s address but to no reply. Maybe, she had moved to other place.  Time flied by, as I still stayed at home. I couldn’t study, and read much as it would hurt my head terribly. So, I spent time reading simple stuff like magazines. I absent started from August 1997 till I sat for SPM examination. It was nearly three years I didn’t attend class. I studied at home using notes, revisions and by post lesson. I was so grateful and lucky for I’d got full support from my parents.  Actually, it was quite difficult for me to concentrate to my study. I couldn’t manage my time very well. As when the ache started I’d to leave my books. The effect was, I’d drowned with dizziness and lightheadedness. And it would last for hours and sometimes for days. As time gone by, I studied on my bed. There was no much time for me. The SPM was just around the corner, and much had not been revised yet. I still remember, I would study as early as 6 in the morning. Since, the cold weather comforts me well. And I’d to stop before the sun rising high. I also spent only one and half hour at night to study.  This year, I sat for examination with my juniors. With those unknown faces in a big hall, really made me feeling so nervous. I was so sad too, because I’d no longer had friends here, whom have been with me since the first day I’d registered to Form 1 here. I struggled to finish this exam. During the examination, there were times when I couldn’t stand with my sickness. Fortunately, I had enclosed my doc’s letter as reference to the teacher. Sitting for exam in that condition was really a struggling, a real one for me.  It was a miracle for me to had passed the days. And of course with Bak and Mak and brothers and sisters. And of course Murni too, who always helped me at school during the exam. She is very kind and honest. I never knew her before, but she always willing to help me when I was sick. I was so thankful to be granted with her. Someone I knew in just one day, and then became a very nice friend is rarely happened to me. Before, I never believe that a friendship can be built in just one day. Before, I always agree that it’s easier to hate one in just seconds, but she really changed my perception over friendship.  I kept praying that at least my result isn’t going to be a very bad one. I should be ashamed if I failed. At last, I finished my SPM. Last day of the examination was really a great day for me. What a relief. I felt like a burden being vanished from my back. I felt free and released. And it was Ramadan.  2000  2000. Another year treasured. Another live waiting for me. I spent my time home. I was so afraid even to step out of my house. I attached to the net. Online- chatting or just surfing the websites. I’d no other works to do. In March, I went to Hospital Kuala Terengganu for ENT specialist, recommended by Dr Aiani. I’d to do audio test and other medical check up. That wasn’t the solution yet. I thought I just wasting my time there, going through all those check-ups.  On the next day, SPM result was announced. I waited until 2 pm before rushed to school to get my result. I was nervous and frightened to know it. So that’s why I choose to go to school in the evening. There were none of the teachers and friends. Only the clerks at the school office. And there went my result- 7A1, 1A2, 1C4 and 1C5. Great 6 aggregate. And to my surprise I was the best student that year. Pew, that’s amazing! I’ve defeated my prime rival, Amir. Though it was one year later. I was satisfied. I was so grateful. Thanks God! I couldn’t describe my feelings well. It’s the mixture between happiness and sorrow. Everyone was shocked. Frankly, I was too actually.  June. I registered at UiTM Dungun for Diploma In Accountancy. The orientation week really tortured me. I’d to take pain killer thrice a day. I was really exhausted and totally weak. I admitted I couldn’t stand it. Unfortunately, I never cried. I knew once I shed my tears, things would went the other way. I would cried all the time. Actually I wanted to be an independent girl. So, no tears for that week.  After one week, we’d been orientated by seniors, we were permitted to rest at home for a week. My mum couldn’t recognized me the day she came to fetch me. I’d lost weight and a bit tanner too. I’d suffered too much through the week.  I’d been there for only a month or so. And every week, my dad would fetched me home. I brought bags of my dirty clothes. I was too tired to do so due to my sickness. Plus, the bathroom was a bit dirty. I knew it sounds lousy, but it was the truth.  July. I quitted. After a quite difficult procedures. The vice chancellor gave me a week to think about my decision. But I’d made it clear. No one could change my decision. And I went home without any regret. Happily I guess the right word to describe my feeling.  Besides, my health wasn’t good enough too. I did fell sometimes. So, we went to Kuantan Medical Centre. I’d done a CT Scan to trace any abnormality in my brain. Fortunately, everything was in its position. But, still I’d to swallow the medicines.  Actually, days before I went to UiTM, I’ve chatted with a medical student in Ireland nicknamed Ira. She told me about panic disorder, agoraphobia and also about anxiety disorder. And so, I’d surfed the net. And it was quite shockening for me to know that all the symptoms of the disorder did occurred to me.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time to discuss it with the doctor. I ignored it. Instead, I went to the university. The decision that worsened my health problem. But, still deep inside me, I wanted to share with someone. It was just I didn’t know to whom could I turned to. Someone that I can trust and understand me in return.  After all, I went to KMC fortnightly. Months. Plus, Dr. Ooi the GP also recommended me to Dr Rama an ENT specialist. There, I went through the same procedures-medical check-up and audio test to check the rate of my equilibrium. Just the same as what I’d done at HKT before. So, every time I went to KMC, there were two clinics and two guys I’d to see.   I was bored with the routines and I stopped the visits to the doctor. My sickness affected me physically and mentally. But I think the real effect was, I suffered low self-esteem. I didn’t went out alone. There must be someone to accompany me. Crowded areas and open spaces were nightmare. I was so reserved at that time.  Sometimes, I go out too but with those butterflies in my stomach, I couldn’t enjoy any moment peacefully. I was so afraid of falling, fainted and losing control in front of crowded. Places which is difficult to escape like huge buildings were avoidance for me. Believe  me, the feelings are real. Look around you, maybe your loved ones suffered these disorders too. Help them to cope and support them to live a normal live.  I’m lucky to have my family through my ups and downs. Though, I never discuss about my disorder to them seriously. They support me morally and materially. I pray for everyone to have caring and loving family. There are no perfect family in this world, but just with love, we’ll survive anything, no matter what.
