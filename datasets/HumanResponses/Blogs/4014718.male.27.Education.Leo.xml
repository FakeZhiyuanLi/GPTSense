      i would like to be a chef someday.  not that i think i am now or anything, i just really like cooking.  i am cooking for family group tonight:  raspberry chipotle chicken breasts, potato salad, and skillet poblano chile cornbreads.    "i haven't tasted it yet... but it smells like the bomb."  i guess i sometimes forget that i quote dave chapelle alot.  i have never seen his show on comedy central but i quote him from movies all the time.  it's funny because i complained to my students all the time last year about not quoting him.  maybe i just miss my students a little right about now.  of course when young so-and-so slaps his classmate across the face as hard as he can and yells "i'm rick james, bitch!!!"  dave chapelle will probably be not so funny to me once again.

      i just want to say, for the record, that cap'n crunch's peanut butter crunch cereal is the greatest cereal ever made.  everything about it is awesome including it's crunchiness, taste, overall ability to float, and of course the cap'n.    to me cap'n crunch is a distinguished admiral from the british fleet circa 1820.  at some point along the line he realized that sailing for king and country just to promote imperialistic tyranny was something he could no longer do, so he gave the charge of the ship to his first lieutenant george smallueson and dove off the stern somewhere in the atlantic approximately 27 miles off the coast of georgia.  with regret in his heart the cap'n only thought at first of the long plunge to davey lones' locker, but the waters awoke him and with wide eyes and a growing fear he watched his ship sail east into the night.  now, the cap'n was a strong-willed man, and a man of unrivaled precision.  by the light and direction of the night stars he swam due west to what is now st. simons island georgia.  the cap'n had no money, no shelter, no companions, no vessel, and most of all, after swimming nearly thirty miles through the night, sitting on a beach thousands of miles from his home, the cap'n was without breakfast.  i would like to tell you the the good cap'n discovered or even made his famous cereal that very morning.  i would even settle to tell you he eventually opened a general store where he made his delicious treat available to the public for the first time.  the truth is, however, that none of those things ever really happened.  cap'n crunch was hung as a traitor later that spring when he realized he was a fish out of water and went to a british outpost in canada to seek the king's mercy.    it was in passing through pennsylvania that the cap'ns story was forged into legend.  there he met, and enjoyed for a night the good graces of a quaker family.  he was passing through to canada, a weary traveler with nothing but the delicious peanut brittle snacks he had been carrying since georgia.  it was in sharing a snack and a tale of remorse to which he was seeking redemption with a small quaker child that the cap'n unwittingly formed the first cartoon cereal character for what would eventually become the quaker oat company.

      have you ever read, or heard a thought expressed about, or possibly even thought a certain way on an issue that you were certain that you knew what was what when it came down to it.  i have lots of times.  in fact, i probably am pretty stubborn about certain things.  have you ever rehashed an issue a year later and thought... hmmm now i think the exact opposite.  i have at least once today.    that should paint you a pretty good picture of vague.

      ncaa football 2005 is a dangerous game to have lying around the house.  seriously.  this is the greatest football game i have ever played and one of the greatest overall games i have ever played.  hopefully i don't keep over doing it like today.

      man, i had the most rad lunchbox as a kid.  it was blue and adorned by the masters of the universe.  on one side there was heman and the crew on the flip side was skeletor and his minions.  that takes me back.  i also remember getting an awesome transformers lunchbox right when it stopped being cool to bring a lunchbox to school.  it probably would have bested the masters pail on the dopeness scale but i never got attached to it.  marketing is a powerful thing.  i almost signed up for that new diskcover card the one that folds open like a pocket-knife.  they sent me one in the mail that i could call and activate.  i played with it for a day before i threw it away.  i realize that i misspelled diskcover.  i just would rather have the advertisement at the top of this page be for either masters of the universe or transformers not some evil corporation.  marketing is powerful but not as powerful as nostalgia.

      do you ever wake up with a random song in your head.  i do all the time.  it is weird because i scarcely ever remember if i have had a dream.  but all the time i wake up with a song in my head and it makes me wonder.  for example this morning i woke up with a de la soul song playing in my mind.  now i haven't listened to de la soul on purpose since i was in the tenth grade.  it is just a curious thing to me.

      i rewatched matrix reloaded last night with matt.  i don't remember laughing that hard at it the first time around.  seriously now, everyone who ever had a conversation with me about the sequels before they were released and disagreed with me (ie if you thought they were going to be good movies with a positive message) owes me an apology.  i'm not an arrogant man.  a simple "sorry"  will suffice.  trust me i'll know what you are talking about.  hey "the brothers" we want our monies back.

      i went to see the bourne supremecy yesterday.  this is one of those rare instances of a sequel being a better movie than the original.  it was entertaining, fast-paced, and the plot was not completely brain dead.  how refreshing.  my only complaint is that the "intense" (you say intense i say shaking the camera around while filming)  cinematograpghy made me motion sick.  i would still fully recommend watching this movie but if the video game doom made you sick in the 80's pop a dramamine before you go.

      i prefer things which are judged objectively.  for example in swimming whoever touches the wall first wins the race (of course athletes can cheat or in the case of electronic photo finishes, machines can malfunction.)  in contrast to this is subjectively judged events.  an example would be gymnastics where many judges score the athletes doing different routines which have different values of scores all at different levels of proficiency (all of which are seemingly astronomically difficult.)  assuming no cheating or malfunctions: events which can be judged objectively have less room for error than events which are judged subjectively. these events are superior.  i also like objectivity in my life.  it is there, i just have to look for it sometimes.

      the only thing that is really, really annoying about the olympic coverage on nbc is the fact that they give you no clear indication that their coverage is ending at 4:00.  it's like beach volleyball is on, then a commericial, then gold medal finals of being an unfunny lesbian:  that's right the ellen degeneres show.  1.  there should not, nor ever be an ellen degeneres show on network television. 2.  nbc should warn us that olympic coverage is ending. 3.  i am going to set an alarm on my phone to go off at 3:55 pm everyday to warn me and those closest to me.

      my parents were down this weekend to celebrate my belated birthday.  it was alot of fun and my dad told me these two stories:  when i was three i used to eat half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and tuck the other half in my pocket or sometimes hide them in places to enjoy after i woke up from my nap.  when i was still an infant my dad broke his ankle and i would stay up late and watch western movies with him at midnight.  both of these things i still do more than twenty years later.  more mysteries are solved.  you learn something new every day.

      man.  just when i thought i could care less...  i am totally sucked into the olympic games.  too bad the good ole u s of a is looking kinda sorry so far.  i watched the men's baketball team take on team puerto rico.  dream team they are not.  good team they are not.  i'm not even convinced they are a team after that game.  my apologies to michelle, andy, their child, and carmello anthony for yelling curses at the television set.  i think i need to gain some perspective.  seriously.

      we went swimming today at alum creek.  it was cold but a good time was had by all.  i feel like if i lived by a large body of water that i could swim in regularly i would be in awesome shape.  or maybe i would just be a slacker still, it's a tough call.

      yesterday was a really fun day for me.  thanks everyone.  i saw the movie collateral last night and enjoyed it very much.  it was not exactly what i was expecting, in a good way.  then we went to ted's for bison burgers and old west sass.  too bad the white man killed the buffalo as they make a tasty burger.  mom and dad campbell bought me a book called:  1001 movies you must see before you die and now i have a new challenge in life.  kate gifted me with twin tree frog finger puppets.  they are fun to play with but i think young micah dug them the most.  finally we went to the browns and played the game apples to apples.  i came in last place but it was alot of fun.    i can't wait to turn 28!!!

      I thought I was smart I thought I was right I thought it better not to fight I thought there was a virtue, in always being cool So it came time to fight I thought "I'll just step aside" And that the time would prove you wrong And that you would be the fool I don't know where the sunbeams end And the starlight begins It's all a mystery Oh. To fight is to defend If it's not now then tell me when Would be the time That you would stand up and be a man For to lose I could accept But to surrender I just wept And regretted this moment oh that  I was the fool I don't know where the sunbeams end And the starlight begins It's all a mystery And I don't know how a man decides What's right for his own life It's all a mystery 'Cause I'm a man, not a boy And there are things you can't avoid You have to face them When you're not prepared to face them

      here's a thought from our friend aristotle: every action we take is either reinforcing a habit good or bad, or forming a new habit good or bad.  here's another thought from our friend chuck d: Cause I'm Black and I'm proud I'm ready and hyped plus I'm amped Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps Sample a look back you look and find Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check Don't worry be happy Was a number one jam Damn if I say it you can slap me right here (Get it) lets get this party started right Right on, c'mon What we got to say Power to the people no delay To make everybody see In order to fight the powers that be (Fight the Power)  i don't know how the two correlate.  i guess they don't really.

      you might as well know i am a bit of a baseball fan.  i really love the rich history of the game.  i love that there are records standing which might never be broken.  i was driving through chicago on sunday and i almost pulled off to try to buy scalped tickets to the cubs game.  greg maddux was pitching and he has 299 career wins as a pitcher.  the 300 win plateau is rare indeed in this modern age of hitting dominance and pitchers who begin to whine after five or six innings about throwing too much.  300 wins rare indeed, consider there is only one active pitcher, roger clemens, with over 300 wins right now.  the rocket is at 310.  the great nolan ryan pitched in 807 games over 27 seasons to reach 324.  so 300 is a big deal right?  consider this: cy young lost more games than maddux or clemens have won.  wait, wait, wait, you might say, i thought cy young was the guy who that the best pitcher in the leagues wins an award named after him.  true enough.  cy young won no less than 511 games.  young pitched for 22 years and he threw in an astonishing 906 games.  you think that is impressive,  he threw 749 complete games.  that is to say he started the game and threw every pitch for his team through nine innings 749 times.  the highest complete game count among active pitchers is 117 games held by clemens ( an impressive 331st best all time in mlb history!)  the difference?  i think it is toughness.  maybe the mound is lower.  maybe the hitters are bigger and stronger and faster.  maybe pitchers are just whiners these days.  maybe old school pitchers were just helluva tough.  who knows.  it is interesting though to look at the question:  is 300 wins a big deal?   no one will ever win 511 games and cy young's record will never be significantly challenged.  but 300 wins might never happen again in my lifetime either.  consider the next active pitcher on the list behind maddux is his former teammate tom glavine  with 251 wins.  glavine has been pitching for 17 big league seasons.  he isn't likely to reach 300.  after glavine there is:  randy johnson 230; david wells 200;  and mike mussina with 199.  all of these guys are in their late thirties and have been pitching a long, long time.  so what about the young guys:  pedro martinez?  andy pettitte?  freddie garcia?  c.c. sabbathia?  none of them are locks and most of them aren't on pace for 300.  so, this saturday watch the cubbies play the giants on fox and cheer for greg maddux as he goes for number 300 and a experience a bit of baseball history.

      i saw the day after tommorrow yesterday.  boy oh boy was this movie bad.  i love a good doomsday movie and this one really delivers.  all i can really say is you should see it and be ready to laugh at some of the silliest subplot cliches you will ever witness.  during college one of my roomates used to tend bar at this hole in the wall saloon that had a sign above the bar which read:  free drinks tommorrow.  of course when you went back the next day the sign still advertised the free drinks... tommorrow.    i hung out with daniel fox as well (he saw the film with me.)  the evening began with a landing place (his church) gathering at dan's apartment.  it was really cool.  it was good to be able to experience brothers and sisters who were following after Jesus and being his body here on earth.  oh yeah daniel and amy are getting wedded in like a month.  congratulations!!!

      thursday afternoon i hit the road with the first stop being copley, oh.  oh yeah, copley is a small town just north of akron, the rubber capital of the world.  i hung out with kevin and maryellen and their new puppy haley.  we had a good time and it was cool to get to see their house most of the way moved-into.  kev bought this crazy little inflatable rowboat and i almost sunk it in his pond.  i headed out early the next morning to:  holland, michigan to visit my brother.  holland is in southwestern michigan right on the lake.  it is one of the most beautiful cities i have ever been in.  flowers adorn everything and there ae parks and little gardens everywhere.  the beaches on the eastern shores of lake michigan are breathtaking.  the main street/ downtown area is awesome.  tons of little shops and interesting things to walk and see.  the suburbs, where we ventured to redeem my applebee's gift certificate (thanks, k.& m.e.!)  were bizarre at best.  the best i could describe it is anytown usa circa 1988.  it was a little bit of a twilight zone experience.  after dinner we strolled to the new holland brewing company's brew pub to sample their wares.  the ipa and american ale were downright good.  the stout was acceptable.  the single-malt was mediocre.  we woke up early the next morning and got breakfast at a local breakfast bistro downtown.  let me introduce to you... the hash brown omelet.  first let me say that this was hands down the geatest omelet i had ever encountered.  it spun the traditional sausage, green pepper, onion, and cheese omlet with hashbrowns on the side all around to form it's greatness.  get this... the eggs and other ingredients were fried inside of a delicious hashbrown casing.  mmmm hashbrowns....  served with two giant slices of homemade whole wheat toast this breakfast demanded all my effort to finish.  after breakfast i hit the road once again en route for:  milwaukee, wi to visit bj and amber.  milwaukee is kind of a weird city.  it reminds me of a lot of different places including:  columbus, pittsburgh, youngstown, and sharon pa.  the only problem is it's parts don't fit together quite right.  bj and amber gave me the official tour and it was fun.  a clear highlight was leon's frozen custard.  mind you, i am always extremely sceptical whenever anything is the self proclaimed "greatest_______ in the world."  leon's however is truly the greatest frozen custard in the world.  i would drive there just to get some more...  well, maybe not but if i ever visit the mauser's or milwaukee again it is definately on the agenda.  we chilled out and bj made us chicken kung-pow and we watched a knights tale.  it was a very fun trip.  today i drove home, laughed, cried, screamed, accidentally urinated on myself, listened to two baseball games and finally blogged before i am about to crash...
