      Welcome to the Everyday Cardigan Knit-a-Long Blog! It's simple and plain, but classic--just like this great project. A big THANK YOU to all of you who have signed up. I've got a few more knitters to add to the list, so if you don't see your name there right now don't worry--it's coming.   I'll be sending an email to each of the CardiGals, inviting you to post to this blog. If you accept the invite & sign up, you'll be able to create posts and upload pictures. This invitation email will be sent sometime after tomorrow afternoon, as I've got a big pre-calculus exam tomorrow. So....have a good one, and go knit something for crying out loud!

       I'm swatching for the Everyday Cardigan using Peace Fleece in  urlLink Ancient Fern  (worsted weight). Both swatches were made using 5 stitches of garter on the edges and 20 of stockinette in the center. Here's the scoop:  Before washing:    Size 8 needles: 4 stitches (exactly!), and 6 rows to the inch.   Size 6 needles: 4 stitches (ditto w/above), and 8 rows to the inch     After washing:    Size 8 needles: 4 stitches in 1 1/8th inches. Still 6 rows in 1 inch.  Size 6 needles: remained the same as before washing.   The gauge for the pattern is 4 stitches per inch in stockinette on size 8 needles. My question to The Experts among us is this....does the 1/8th inch extra on the size 8's matter? Is that something I can take care of with proper blocking? Or should I go with size 6 needles? If so, do I then use still smaller needles for the ribbing? Should I have the steak, or the lobster? Red or white wine? Should I kiss on the first date? Do these pants make my butt look big? Decisions, decisions...

      I have finished the back and have posted it on my blog. The Georgia Rose isn't quite as bright as the camera shows, but it is very nice. I have chosen the Peace Fleece pattern called Everyday Cardigan. I love seeing what everyone else is doing. I will have to check out some of the patterns and test some more Peace Fleece. :)

      I must be dense as I have done short row shaping before using Fiber Trends patterns to knit some of their animals... But I sure had a devil of a time applying it to the Sassy Cardigan!  After much ripping and re-doing (and, um, some swearing :/), I got it!! I have finished the back and am ready to start the front!  I chose to make the ribbing only 2" rather than 3", which I thought too much.  I would upload a file, but that would require my hauling out the camera (and are the batteries there.... with two teenagers, perhaps not!)  Maybe next time!  I am so enjoying hearing everyone's stories, colors, and patterns they chose!  I also want to thank Kim for organizing this great project! Thanks, Kim!  (BTW: I have been working on my own blog....) maybe next month?!  Everyonee is *so* clever with theirs, that it is somewhat intimidating!  Have a great weekend and HAPPY SPRING!!!! 'Til next time!

         Hello cardi knitters! Here's my cardi so far. I've decided (in the name of stash reduction) to use some funky  ardilla  yarn I picked up in Bolivia two years ago to make this  Aran Cardigan  from  urlLink  Two Sticks and a String  . As you may be able to see from the photo, I've started on the collar. This cardi is worked from the top down in pieces, modular-style. I've never done a sweater like this before, but it seems fun from the instructions. And the yarn is consistent/predictable ol' acrylic (it says "dralon" on the label)--I bought it in a crowded market in Cochabamba, Bolivia without getting it out of the clear plastic bag, silly me. So I brought it all the way back to the good 'ol USA before realizing it wasn't made of natural fibers, my knittingstuff of choice. Ah well, I knit up a swatch about a year ago with the  ardilla  and noticed that it softened some in the wash. So I think even my snobbish self will be happy with the result.  I am impressed with everyone else's progress--nice work! This is so much fun. Thanks again to the Gibster! xoxo

      The latest photo of my Peace Fleece jacket is now being served  urlLink At My Knits End .  The color is more subdued in person.  Or maybe my contact lenses are just getting old.  For newcomers, I'm using the Neckdown Jacket pattern by Knitting Pure and Simple.  Links to the pattern are up on my blog.  Gib, whatchya servin' for munchies today???

      I probably have another week before my yarn arrives. [sigh]. Of course, that won't stop me from running up the stairs everyday when I get home from work to see if a package is waiting.  In the mean time, I love seeing all the different colors of Peace Fleece.

       Hey everyone!  The back to my everyday cardi is done as is the right front (or is it the left??) and almost all of the left!  What a fun, relaxing knit!  Peace Fleece rocks, as you already know!  Trying to get the color right in a picture is very hard.  This color is called Zarya Fog.  Fog never looked so good!  Sandy

      The yarn for my cardi-along arrived today.  This sporty gal went with the sport or DK weight of Peace Fleece in Kamchatka Seamoss.  The yarn is green!  It didn't look so turquoisey or Jade on the website.  I am hoping I love it when I start knitting it-there are some blue flecks in it....  And I decided to use the Retro-Prep Cardigan in the Fall 2002 issue of Interweave Knits.  Since I am having a bit of trouble (read: it didn't work the first time and I am too danged tired to figure it out) uploading an image, you can check it out on  urlLink my blog  (when I get that posted).  I'll be swatching soon!

      WAAAAAAA...It's going to be at least a week till I get my kit :(  sniff, sniff.  Thoughts of runnin' to the nearest town with yarn  (45 mins away) ran through my head.  Should I pick up yarn for the pattern I originally was going to use?  But with gas prices the way they are.......and the fact that even nearest town doesn't have a great selection.......sigh.  I must look on the bright side.  Everyone will have worked out any problems and by the time I start I should be able to glean all the wonderful information everyone will post!!

           Here's the back of Sassy!  I think it is probably quicker to knit than Everyday because it is shorter and more fitted - less stitches.  There is short row shaping in the shoulders which was quick and fun to do.  I have a close-up of the fabric at  urlLink My Knitting Life .

        It's a woman's prerogative, damnit!  Okay, okay, I'm opening the doors again. After hearing more than a few complaints, ya'll can still join up. Please know that it's nothing personal---it's just that the administering was getting a bit too time consuming, and my knitting was suffering tremendously. I'm hearing how you all are knitting & swatching along, and I've still not finished one swatch! SO...if you'd still like to join, please feel free to do so, honest. :)  Just please  be patient  with me when asking for help, as it might take me a few days to get back to you.  Thanks for your understanding--now lets see some pictures! If you got'em! Show 'em!

      Hello hello all my new KAL friends.  I returned home from a weeklong trip to find my PF Everyday kit awaiting me!  I've already pulled the lovely blue yarn out (Patience blue) and petted it, but I've yet to start to gauging.  Very excited to get started on this, my 5th, sweater! - - Renee

      Let's talk gauge!  I'm making "Sassy" (the other PF cardigan) and it calls for 4 stitches/inch on 7's, which I got on my first swatch.  The Everyday also calls for 4 stitches/inch, but on 8's, so I'd be re-swatching if I started there too!  I got gauge with the 7's, both before and after washing.  My little washed swatch puffed up a little, but not enough to change the gauge.  It is silky soft though -I really prefer my PF washed!  Also, I am adding an inch in length - I'm sassy, but not that sassy!

      I'm waiting for the pattern to arrive, but am ready to start.  I'm using Manos.  I just finished the Rogue Hoodie using Peace Fleece....Ripped out a sweater I made from the Manos that didn't look right, but the yarn was too beautiful to not use.  I've spent my time ripping, re-skeining, wetting out the kinks, and waiting for the wool to dry........Waiting for the mailman to bring me the pattern.

      Ifn' that kit doesn't come today y'all gonna hear a loud scream!  Must say that my jealous buttons are ALL getting pushed to hear how you guys are swatching and gauging and winding and seeing and feeling...  I am going back to Woolflowers site to read some of her comments before I get started cause I already know I'm going to have to add to the pattern in length (both arms and body).  Looking forward to seeing some pics of people's progress and the colors they've chosen.  Happy knitting to all.

      I'm doing two swatches---one with size 8 (US) and one with size 6 (US) needles. As per  urlLink Kerstin's  advice I'll be washing both. (She'll be watching me wash & measure them.) I want to see the difference in the fabric so I know what to expect. While I've been knitting for years I've never finished a sweater. Never. Since  urlLink Sandy  can admit to her addiction, I figure I can come clean about my fear of finishing. Is this a big ol' support group? You know it, baby.

      I just found out about this Everyday Cardigan  Knit-a-Long today from one of my knitlist buds. I was so excited I went right to the site to  sign up. Thanks for letting me join.  I  received my Peace Fleece on Friday and started knitting on Saturday. I am love in with this yarn. It knits up beautiful and is difficult to put down. The color I chose  is Georgia Rose. You can check out the color and my process on my blog.  Thanks, Kim for making the knit-a-long possible and all your work.

      Hi all you CardiGals! I'm Michelle, and I too am a peace fleece-aholic. I have been working on my cardi here and there for about 2 weeks. It's about 16 inches long and I really love the way it's looking. The color I chose is Mir-Atlantis Periwinkle...great purplish-blue. Noone should worry that I have a headstart, as I don't get much opportunity to knit. At any rate, I read Leigh from Woolflowers adjustments she would make, and found it was already too late for the ribbing. Y'all might want to check out her notes. Also I plan to shorten mine an inch or so, cause I am a little bit of a shorty. No other news, just excited about the group!! Many thanks to Kim. M

      Hi Everyone,  I am so excited to get started and to hear how everyone else is doing too. I started swatching away last night and will post at my blog with pictures. I have decided to write my own cardigan pattern and use up the yarn in my stash, mostly Lamb's Pride, worsted weight, which I have used many times before, so I am comfortable in my gauge. Thanks so much for suggesting this idea, Kim! I am not sure how my post will appear, but I am the "other" Kim (Kimberley)! I will see if I can change to my full name!

      HI All! This is going to be so much fun.  I can't wait to read about how everyone is doing.  I'm a little behind the curve already!  (Which is the norm for me, lol) As I couldn't decided if I wanted to do the Everyday Cardigan pattern or use one I already had....I kept going back and forth, but I've finally ordered the kit in Violet Vyehchyeerom from  urlLink Camilla Valley Farms .  I can't wait to see pics of the cardi in all the different colors!  Anywhooo, I can't swatch yet, but will do so as soon as it arrives!

      Hi everyone. Thanks also to Kim for doing all this work. It is much appreciated.  I swatched for the cardigan and washed it. It is now so much softer and snuggly. I am also using the Volgassippi Blue and the more I work with it, the more I love it.  I am finding this is a great sweater to knit while I am reading the blogs. Wow! I am actually accomplishing two things at once!  I will put a picture of my swatch and progress up on my blog in a day or so.

      Hi everyone!  I am sooo excited about this knit-along (my first!)  I tried explaining it to my b.f and he thought it a curious justification for (yet) another knitting project...  I was so excited about this and received my yarn a week or so ago, so I started and it's turning out great.  I chose Volgasippi Blue with the cherrywood buttons.  I have been knitting this while I am stuck in traffic going and coming home from work.  Since it's pretty straightforward knitting right now, I can do it without concentrating.  I will post a photo later this week.  I can't wait to see everyone's color choices, etc. and follow their progress!!  BTW: this is also my first cardigan.

      Add my name to the list of folks who want to *THANK* the Gibster for creating this little community-within-a-community! To be quite honest, I wasn't really thinking about knitting a cardi until I got wind of this--now I've picked out my pattern! It's the Top Down Aran from the book "Two Sticks and a String." I have never knitted a sweater from the top down and have wanted to knit this cardi ever since I found the book! Am swatching now with Wool-Ease but will probably switch to another yarn since I have a feeling I may not get gauge. Thanks again Gib for inspiring me to actually knit a sweater! xoxo

      Well the timing could not be more perfect for me, because last night I finished my Must Have, with the small exception being that I only have 6 buttons instead of 7.  I purchased them at JoAnn - they were perfect but they only had 6 so I am going to hope I can locate one more somewhere.  My blog is down, but will post pictures there soon.  ANYWAY - as for Everyday, I am thinking veering off the path a little and trying SASSY - the other Peace Fleece cardigan.  Has anyone ever made this?  Oh, and thanks for the swatch advice, because you know I was going to cut that corner right out of the gate!

      Hi and thank you Kim for setting this up, and for the warm welcome! I am waiting for my cardigan kit - it should be in transit now and I expect to receive it this week. I ordered the teal color and I think it's going to be very pretty!  I am glad there are so many nice people in this, including the expert knitters who can give me the benefit of their knowledge since this is my first cardigan.  :)

       Start your engines!  I know--it's not a race. But it *is* the official start date of the knit-a-long. I've been swatching with size 8 US needles and Ancient Fern Peace Fleece, and the swatch is gorgeous. However, I received some advice from  urlLink Kerstin :    Knit the swatch  Measure the gauge  Wash the swatch (I'll handwash mine with lavender Eucalan)  Re-measure the gauge   It seems that Peace Fleece relaxes significantly after a bath. Don't we all. No wonder I love this stuff. :)   ~*~  Invitation emails have gone out to everyone who has signed up for the Everyday Cardilong. If you haven't received yours, or your name isn't on the participant list at the left, please let me know. Please know that you  don't have to post  to this blog to knit a-long, but I thought it might be fun for us to have a central place to peek in on everyone's progress.  It would be great for everyone who wishes to post about what pattern/yarn/color they're using, so if anyone else is using something similar, they know whose posts to watch for. You can either host your pictures on your site, and link to them in the post (the preferred way), or, if you don't have a site, you can upload pictures to this blog.  urlLink Email me  and I'll be happy to give you directions.  Most importantly....HAVE FUN!

      Here I am. Oh, and I also was recognized for the old chrisknits blog I used to have on blogger. Started here and then switched! I guess I could cheat and say I am so quick I am halfway done before the starting date. Actually I am using my in-progress-cardigan which is a Nordic style and I am using steeks on. Will I get this done? Who knows.

      Started the Neck Down Jacket from Knitting Pure and Simple last night. It's working up quickly and is so relaxing and enjoyable to knit.  The yarn is so sticky that only Addi Turbo's are worth using.  Does anyone know if you can get Addi double points?  Are they shinny or coated?  I wouldn't want to use the coated type as they'd work as well as velcro!

      I finally had the time to figure out how to post a button. Being a Mac user, I never really picked up on right-clicking. Anyway, I'm happy to announce that the button is on my blog! Hey, I don't get out much.  I am done with the back, and working feverishly on the right front. I love working with this yarn--even if mine doesn't have the barnyard smell.

      After what seemed like an intolerably cruel wait, my Peace Fleece has arrived and it's really gorgeous.  It smells wonderfully sheepy.  I was thinking that anyone allergic to lanolin ought to steer clear.    I thought that I would share a photo of my yarn, because it's just so beautiful.  It's the Sea Moss colour.  (and I misplaced the instructions for uploading photos, so I'm actually using my own bandwidth)                 Now, I'm going to start winding and hopefully, I'll have something to show soon.  Has anyone doing the Everyday Cardigan, considered resizing it?  I'm thinking that I would like a bit more ease than on the first size, and concerned about the tent effect on the 2nd?   I am definitely taking  urlLink Leigh's  advice with regards to the symmetry of the ribbing.  That would drive me batty, so if I lose a few stitches and knit as I normally do, I ought to get something between the 1st and 2nd size.  My running commentary will be on my site urlLink  All Tangled Up  , but I'll also post here too.  Thanks Kim, for organising this!

      This PF is very sticky yarn! I bought #9 dp for the sleeves and to do my gauge but could hardly get the yarn to move along the needles. Bamboo was worse so it's back to the LYS to buy Addi's!  The gauge turned out perfect and made a lovely fabric. I'll cast on and get going this weekend.  Did buy Addi's for my circulars.  Love the yarn! P.S. Rogue is done!

      Now comes the long waiting period I have read so much about...  It took me a long time to decide on which color to get, and since I've been sick w/the flu (I hope its not contagious via the internet..) I have debated on every color it seems...I finally decided on Lena's Meadow...I was gonna go for something more practical, but this will fit in just perfectly w/all the other WIPs I have going on....  When I feel a little better, I think I create a blog so you guys can see my progress...I just have to search the net for an easy blog I could create!

      I have tried several different needles and the only one that gives me gauge with the Peace Fleece is a size 4. Can I really knit so loosely that I have to use a needle four sizes smaller than the recommended size? Or is it because I am doing something wrong?  :(  So far I've only done baby blankets, hats, and bags, and so I've never worried with gauge since it didn't have to be exactly right. (And none of my stuff looked really "off" using the recommended needle size.)

       I absolutely love this yarn. The rusticity, the large ply, the subtle flecks of color. In reading the previous posts, I'm surprised that some of you are finding the smell distasteful--personally, I don't notice a smell at all! I really enjoy working with it in it's natural pre-washed form---that's one of the things that drew me to this particular sweater--the simple, natural, uncomplicated design and yarn.  Once the sweater is finished, it promises to be a classic that I'll wear for years.  Thanks to those of you who commented on the size 6 versus size 8 fabric. I've decided to use size 5's for the ribbing, and 6 for the body. The firmness of the size 6 fabric really appeals to me, and Teresa makes a great point about the slow growth of the fabric if you don't meet gauge. Taking a look at  urlLink Mary's gorgeous Everyday Cardigan  sealed the deal. I'm using the smaller needles.

      How many are washing their PF before knitting?  I find the DK weight a bit course, but was thinking I would wait until after knitting to get the softness.  Or-if you are only washing for the "barn smell",  I think I can live with that.  Am finishing Rogue before I even swatch!  Well, that's what I say today.......

      Hi everyone: I finally got my kit today, thought it was never going to get here. I am going to do the swatch and wash it tomorrow so I can get started on the cardigan itself. The yarn is beautiful I got  Baikal-Superior Green. Hope everyone is having fun with this. This is my first knit a long so it should be fun.

      I thought the Peace Fleece people might be wondering about the dramatic increase in sales of late, so I sent them an email to let them know what we're up to out here.  Here's what I got back....  Dear Mary Beth,         Thanks for writing. It is very satisfying to read the comments. Thank you for letting us know they were there. We had no idea. Best,  Peter  Not to date myself or anything, but isn't it amazing how different our lives are with the internet?

      PF just arrived via UPS.  It is beautiful!  Latvian Lavender is so sweet. It has flecks of a darker lavender, blue and natural.  It does smell slightly of a farm but should be too bothersome.  Pictures tomorrow! Can't wait to get started but must finish Rogue first...half a sleeve to go.

      I tried my bamboo size 8s: 12.5 stitches in 4 inches. So I went down to size 7: 13.5 stitches in 4 inches. Sheesh! Washing didn't change the gauge. I thought I knitted pretty tightly...so I don't get it. I guess I'll try 6s tonight. I think I may want to get some metal needles...the bamboo seem to grip the PF and I think metal might be faster. Both my local yarn stores are closed until Wednesday though, so I guess I'll try the bamboo 6s first.  The color is growing on me more.

       Hank vs Skein  This is how I am using these terms: a hank or reeled hank is how PF comes.  It is a figure eight looking twist of yarn that when you untwist it you have a circle or "0" or ring of yarn that has ties around it to keep the wool together until it is wound into a ball.  A skein or "pull" skein is wound at the factory into a ball looking or sausage-shaped looking hunk of wool that you can use right away without further winding...Just pull the starter strand from the center of the skein.    If you are going to wash your hanks, leave the ties on and add a couple more.  It keeps the ring of wool neat and easier to wind into balls after it dries.  Things can get VERY tangled if you don't pay attention and take your time, but the task is quite easy.  If you have anxiety about this just wash one skein to try it out and you will be rewarded with soft, nice smelling fiber which will make the knitting even dreamier.

      There was a slip from my mail carrier waiting for me when I got home today.  My yarn was delivered four days sooner than I expected.  However, I'll have to go to the post office to pick it up and I won't be able to make it there until Saturday.   Boo!

      I love having this blog to see what everyone's doing!  Thanks again Kim!!  I'm still waiting for my kit to arrive.  My question is what needles work best with Peace Fleece?  Bamboo??  I have Crystal Palace straights in 6 and 8, but they're only 12 inches.  Will those work, or should I order different ones?  What sizes does the pattern call for?  Any help appreciated!!!

       Wash BEFORE Knitting  Response to "barnyard smelling" Peace Fleece: The Peace Fleece comes in reeled hanks as opposed to "pull" skeins. I DON'T use a washing machine, I un-twist the hanks and put them in a sink of warm water with maybe 2-4 drops of mild dish liquid and gently squeeze the soapy water through the yarn.  Then I drain the sink and fill with clear (no soap) water and squeeze it through the yarn, do this as many times as it takes to  get the soap out.  On the last rinse I do the cream rinse thing(about teaspoon), rinse once more.  I then place the hanks in a pillow case and let my washing machine  SPIN ONLY  all the excess water out. Then I drape the hanks over a line to dry.  Since I live in upstate NY where it is still quite cold, I used the line in the basement. Outside in good weather would be faster. Should dry in about 24 hours.   This worked beautifully for my Rogue Hoodie, which I also over-dyed because the Moscow Magic Pink was too flesh toned for me.  So if you don't like your color, dye it!

      I finally cast on my Georgia Rose PF last night.  (ok- you caught me - I didnt swatch...) It's much more orange than I expected- and I LIKE that!  The one thing I didn't expect and DONT love- the smell!!! I have never had yarn that smelled like it just came off the farm before.  Did anyone/everyone wash theirs first?  My dog is a bit perplexed that there is perhaps livestock in the closet.

      My Peace Fleece cardigan kit is finally here! I was so excited when the postman put it on my doorstep! I ran into the kitchen and ripped open the box. And...well...sadly, I don't really love the Peace Fleece color (Soyuz-Apollo Teal). It's nice, but I thought "teal" would be more of a blue-green. It's very, very green. Almost greenish yellow, in my opinion. Bright, bright, bright green. Looking at the color card, I was thinking it would be more of a Kamchatka Sea Moss, just a little darker and more blueish. It looked a lot different on the monitor, to be sure!  I like green, generally, but I am just afraid that I will look like a huge leprechaun.  Hopefully it will grow on me. Or else I will have to dye my hair red and jauntily carry some Lucky Charms and a pot of gold around with me when I wear it.  I'm going to start swatching tonight. But...I am giving serious thought to using another yarn, and making something else with this yarn another time. My LYS has a wonderful color selection of Brown Sheep Lamb's Pride, and they also carry a great local yarn called Cestari (I think) which is naturally machine washable. Hmmm. What to do, what to do.

      Ordered the Peace Fleece on the 12th.  Contacted them on Wednesday the 17th and they said it was shipped Tuesday the 16th so it should be here tomorrow (I HOPE!).  They just confirmed the order when it was placed by no other communication.  Patience (it's very hard...toes tapping).

      Trying to remain calm, and calling on you all to help.  I ordered the Peace Fleece online last week.  Since then, NOTHING.  No charge to the credit card, no estimated ship date, no 'sorry we're out of stock cuz our yarn is so delicious,' nothing.  Is this normal?  I've never had a company sort of ignore me like this before when I try to throw money at them.  I'm confused and, well, hurt.  Okay, I'm not really hurt but I'm hurtin' for my yarn!

      Hello everyone. I just ordered my Everyday Cardigan kit yesterday, along with the worsted in Grass Roots. How long does it take to ship? I'm not a patient person, although this will give me time to work on a couple of things I've already started. But it's hard to keep interested in your current WIPs when you're sitting on your hands, waiting for yarn to arrive!

      Will I ever get to start the Everyday Cardigan?  Perhaps.  The Spongly blue PF is calling to me, begging me to swatch and knit, but I have so much to do!    I completely forgot about my Grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary.  Yes.  I'm horrible.  I forgot.  Luckily, my grandmother's shawl is over half completed, but I've not even found a pattern for the vest I want to do for my grandfather!!  Ack!  I have 3 weeks to get this stuff done, which hopefully I won't need all of to complete them.  THEN, I get to start my Everyday, right?  Right?

      HELP!  I made a mistake and I'm not afraid to admit it!  Sassy calls for selvage stitches up the front opening and up the sides to the armhole (to make a neat edge and for easier seaming).  I shaped the armholes and there is a straight section to the shoulders that I did the selvage on, not thinking!  Don't think you are supposed to have selvage stiches here.  I did it on the back, and on the one front that I finished.  My choices are to rip and redo (half the work I've done so far) or leave it.  If I leave it, should I selvage the sleeve caps to match, or not?  Oh, knitting goddesses, what would you do?  Please reply!

       I cast on the fronts and back together and have knitted one skein.  The yarn looks different under different light.  Sometimes it looks dark grey, and sometimes it seems more greenish-grey.  Always it looks beautiful and rustic.  It's fun to come to different colored flecks along the way (not to mention bits of sticks and straw here and there).  Since this pattern is so plain and straightforward, it's amusing to at least have to work out the details of changing the pattern a bit for knitting the fronts and backs together. If you want to try, I can talk you through it!  urlLink Visit me .

I really enjoyed working with the yarn and love the color choices available. I really enjoy  seeing what others have chosen. The yarn is so much more beautiful made up than on the color cards.

      well, i haven't checked in since the start of this party...so i am here to report i have finished the back and started on one of the front panels. it's been so long since i have actually knitted a big project i am already starting to fear finishing. i am not positive i even remember how to sew a sweater together much less block something that actually matters...in the past i have done it with a spray bottle, iron and tea towel...is this still an acceptable method or must i wash it all the way?? will try and post a pic later this week. also, i have to say i am bummed i had alot completed before i read about modifications. i am not one that would have noticed the uneven cast-on, but now that i know it totally bugs me. just not enough to fix it. hmmm. not yet anyway.   anybody get totally suckered on some april foolin? i did...

      Using my trusty nostepinde I wound all my hanks into lovely yarn balls.  My swatch ended up 15st/4 in--close enough for me on 8's, especially since my PF was prewashed.

      So can I join the club now..lol..a picture is on  urlLink my blog .  I chose Lena's Meadow. It's more green than I thought, but its still fabulous. It's not pre-washed, and I'm actually glad it's not. I like the scratchy-soft texture, and I'll be surprised once it's washed. It smells dusty, not very "farmy", but I have three cats, you can only imagine the smells my girls can give off sometimes.  I'm working on a Summer Tweed hoodie at the moment, but I plan to swatch this weekend. I think I'm going to use Addi Turbos for this project. I think I'm a slower knitter than everyone here--maybe the Addi's will move me along.

      I cannot seem to convince the BF that the PF is more than a fling!  He keeps expecting me to dump it or leave it home alone - where could he have gotten this notion?!  I finished the back (adding 2" also on the XL) and washed it - ahhh- beautiful .  I pre-washed the rest of the yarn and have begun working on the sleeves. I hope this doesnt mess me up tension-wise having the back knit and then washed and the rest washed then knit. This is moving pretty quickly (for me).  I enjoy seeing people's progress and appreciate the changes brought up.  I added 8 stitches to the ribbing on the sleeves to counterbalance the bat-top.  Let's just say I've got enough up top without accentuating it with tiny wrist pieces....   Beth

      I knit up about 10 inches of my back panel last night, and I've posted a picture  urlLink here . I also go into some detail about changes that I'm making in length, cuff-width, and ribbing. Take a look.  I'm so in love with Grass Roots. Sometimes when I look at it, it's brown. Sometimes it's green. Sometimes it's grey. I love it and I can't wait to wear it.

       Spring Break & the Everyday Cardigan ~  After taking a look at other's comments and talking a bit with  urlLink Leigh , I've decided to extend the length of the Everyday Cardigan by 2 inches. This will cause the shoulder and neck bind-off to occur 24" from the beginning of the back, instead of the 22" called for (size: XL). For the sleeves, I've cast on 48 stitches on size 6 needles to help reduce the "bat wing" effect.  I'll let you know how it goes. Here's a picture of my progress on the back of the cardigan:       I love working with this yarn---every now & again I pick a piece of debris from the wool. It's like working with a very evenly plied home-sheared-washed-carded-spun. Someday I'll be able to spin something similar, I hope!

      I've noticed that some PF has a second label on it that it has been pre-washed.  So I inquired to the PF folks why this would be.  They kindly responded as follows: Dear Mary Beth,         Once not to long ago our mill that spins our wool, Harrisville Designs, spun some yarn with a broken steamer. The result was a yarn  that was overspun and had an overtwist. So Harrisville volunteered to wash  all the skeins, approximately 3600 skeins. The result was a good example of  how our wool looks after wasking with a nice loft. I wish we could afford  to wash all of our yard before selling but the result is the same after it  is knit up and then the garment washed. Best, Peter  Interesting, huh?  So this might explain why some folks aren't noticing the smell - perhaps theirs has been washed already.  Also, it was reassuring to hear him mention knitting up and then washing the garment, which is what I did with Sassy (who is still a little damp, three days later).  Happy knitting.

      This lovely yarn has me feeling all happy and poetic.  My Zarya Fog finally made an appearance today.  I ordered it March 16 waited fourteen long, long days.  But it's so lovely I forget the long wait and look forward to the long acquaintance!  Plus, my PF was pre-washed.  Wha??? Is that what took so long?  Check it out on my  urlLink blog .  Swatching tomorrow, casting on soon!  I'm planning to cast on the back and both fronts all together.  Anyone else do that?

      I posted a problem I am having with my cardi on my  urlLink blog , complete with a terrible picture. I believe my question is along the same line as what Polly posted about earlier.   If anyone has completed the everyday cardi, could you take a look at my pic and let me know if what I have done so far looks correct or not. I am about finished with the second half of the front and will start on the second sleeve. I don't want to start before I figure out if I am (a) knitting this incorrectly, or (b) sleep deprived and hallucinating. Any and all thoughts would be appreciated. :)

      I posted pics of my progress in my  urlLink blog . I think this sweater may take me a while!  Two questions - maybe someone can help me....  Will that ugly line toward the bottom of my cardigan (I guess where I knitted too loosely or purled too tightly) go away with washing and blocking?   If I cast on more stitches for the sleeves (like, 44 instead of 36 - I don't want batwings or narrow wristbands)...how do I figure out how much to increase and when, in order that I get to 80 stitches at the end? Do I just "wing it"? (ha, ha)  :)

      I was steaming along this weekend, ambitiously aiming to get most of this cardigan done over the weekend.  The weather has taken a decidely quick turn to spring, a rather normal state aided by the clocks goes forward.                  Did anyone have any concerns about those sleeves?  I usually start my projects with the sleeves to avoid ended up completing the body and getting bored with the sleeves.  These sleeves are just so triangular.  The wristbands are very snug and the portion of the sleeves that get attached to the body are quite wide.  With the 2nd size cardigan, you have 76 stitches and if you were to consider the tension of 4 stitch to the inch, you basically have the wrist starting at approx 9 inch(when stretched) growing to 19 inches.   Am I going to end up with bat wings?  Please say if you'll think that's going to happen.  I would much rather rip the sleeves (yes, both of them) out now than to attach and then be disappointed.  The Peace Fleece is a lovely yarn to work with and the meterage is excellent. I used just under a hank each for the sleeces, and as the body is much narrower, I know that I'm not going to run short.

      I finished knitting Sassy, and just wanted to mention that I did have enough yarn - I would say I used just what the pattern said for the size I made.  Although Sassy is more tailored in the body, it has set in sleeves, so they may use more yarn than Everyday sleeves - bottom line is, the pattern was right on for yarn amounts for me.  I have some preliminary pictures at my blog - will post the finals (plus closing thoughts) in a day or two.  Hope everyone is doing well - I'm actually thinking of casting on for Everyday!

      After grocery shopping and taking my dog for his first walk up the road in a long long time, since he got away from me along time ago and chased some people we havent been walking, he did fairly well yesterday, I cast on for my cardigan and got about an inch done on the ribbing for the back. It is looking very nice. Hope to find time today to do more and get beyond the ribbing. How is everyone elso doing? Have a good day.

      I finished my Everyday Cardigan on Saturday.  Made the second size, used Manos del Uruguay (ripped out yarn from another sweater that didn't look good on me), got gauge with #7 and #9 needles.  Fits perfect, looks good (no digi camera to share).  The only change I made was to make it one inch longer.  The only future change I would make on another one would be to make the lower sleeves slightly wider.  Rogue Hoodie (made in PF) done, Everyday Cardigan done, now to finish the Must Have Cardigan.  A lot of us are making or have made these three sweaters...........maybe we will see each other walking around someday wearing the same outfit!! I did buy some sport weight PF to make my sister an Everyday Cardi....ordered it on Tuesday and got my package on Thursday.....same week......don't tell, it's a surprise.

      I finally got my Zarya Fog in yesterday! The color is gorgeous, although a tiny bit more orange than I expected. It is the perfect every color/no color yarn, which is exactly what I wanted. I have already finished my swatch and I am using size 7 for the ribbing and 9's for the body. Casting on tonight!

           Hi everyone, here's what I've done so far on the Aran Cardigan. I've arranged it so that it may be easier to tell what the heck is going on here--the neck is the folded-over part in the middle, and I've started on the right front after picking up stitches on the side of the right saddle shoulder and going down. For those curious about the stitch patterns, it's the Wavy Cable down each shoulder, and (looking at the photo) from left to right on the right front we've got Double Moss Stitch, another Wavy Cable Panel, Trinity Stitch and Half Aran Diamonds on the end. Each panel is separated by a Triple Cross. Am having fun--one thing I like about cable patterning is the fact that even though you may not be finished, you get gratification along the way as you see the patterns form.  I am impressed with everyone else's Peace Fleece cardis--have already put the PF on my wish list for the fall! xoxo

      Hi Everyone. I got my kit and knit my swatch. I had to do it three times to get guage finally ended up getting it with # 6 needle so have swatch done and it is also dry. I measured it and it is right so I am going to cast on and begin today. Can't wait to get going. Seems like I have awaited forever to get started. Hope everyone is doing well and having fun. Hope everyone likes there color choice I love mine, made a good choice. Sometimes I buy yarn and get it home and then don't like the color as well as I thought I would.  Good luck. When I get enough done I will try to figure out how to post a picture for everyone to see. Have a Happy Sunday.

      Just to let everyone know I completed my Everyday Cardigan. Pictures are on my  urlLink blog .  I really loved this pattern and working with the Peace Fleece. As a matter of fact, I am knitting a top-down pullover for my husband using the Kamchatka Sea Moss. I am also thinking of doing a cardigan for my daughter and mother. I. must.buy.more.peace.fleece!! It's a compulsion right now. I literally have nine colors I really, really need/want. :)  Thank you to Kim for organizing such a wonderful knit-along. I love the blog. I will be watching everyone else's progress.

      Alright, I've finally cast on and finished the ribbing, and about a 1/2" of the st st. Here's my progress thus far....      I read comments that adding 2 stiches on the ribbing will help the symetry--well, I must be a little slow tonight, cause I added 2 stictches one after the other, and I think I'm going to have the same problem if I hadn't made the extra stitches. Should I have K1 *P2, K2* K1? Can someone elaborate, please! It's not too late to frog...

      I'm healing.  I swatched again, am switching to 6's for the body, all is well.  Bonus:  Camilla Valley finally came through (with my second order of PF--Tundra).  Details at  urlLink Green-Eyed Grrl .  Thanks to all for their kind support!

      Guess what showed up today?  Yup, My cardi kit finally arrived!  The yarn is a lot darker than I thought, but still a gorgeous shade of purple.  I've already cast on the back and have finished the ribbing and I can say I finally feel like I'm a Cardi-Gal, lol.  You can see a pic of the skeins on my  urlLink blog .  The picture doesn't do the color justice.  I'll have to try and do a better job when I show my progress.

      I'm starting over on my EC; that is, I will start over after a decent period of mourning.  I just kept getting looser and looser and my sweater kept getting wider and wider and, well, the whole sordid tale is on my  urlLink blog , with a telling photo.  Condolences appreciated.

      Good morning ladies. I got my peace fleece, the color is beautiful, and did my guage, had to do three times ended up with size 6 needles. Have been going along slowly a little every day and have the back about 2/3rds done now. It is really coming out very nice and I am enjoying working on it.  I wasn't sure I was going to like working with the peace fleece but it is nice and soft and slides along nicely. How is everyone else doing? There must be somebody that is already done by now. It will be awhile before I am done. I took it with me yesterday to jury duty but the court clerk wouldn't let me in the building with my dangerous weapons, the needles. Imagine. So had to read magazines instead. I knew he wasn't going to let me in but I had to try. Have a good day everyone. Catherine

      I'm totally shocked at how far this yarn is taking me!  There may be hope yet that I'll not have to order more of this particular color.  I've only just begun, and I started on the back.  I stayed up late to finish the first ball of yarn, measured, and I have exactly 12 inches done thusfar.  No complaints when you get not only a quick knit, but an efficient one as well!    I've changed my mind about the Patience Blue.  I thought it was boring, but the knitted fabric has a depth that cannot be imagined in the ball.  I'm posting a picture of the fabric on my  urlLink blog .    Have a great night everyone!  Enjoy your everydays everyday.  (I'm tired, so sue me, lol)

      I've finished the back and the right front, and I'm about a quarter of the way done with the left front. I have added exactly 4 inches to the length of my cardigan, so it hangs down to my hip. I expect to have the left front done by the end of the night, and I'll be casting on for the first sleeve either tonight or tomorrow. I have never knit so fast or been so keen on finishing a project...I just really want to wear the damn thing!  I'm so hooked on PF now, that I'm planning my projects with it in mind. I may not knit with anything else for a long while.  By the way, what is everyone seaming their cardigans with? The PF is strong but it's knobby, and I don't expect it to be smooth sailing if I use it to seam my pieces together. Has anyone had any trouble doing this?

      I just wanted to thank EVERYONE who made such nice comments about  urlLink Sassy .  I was just overwhelmed by the generosity flowing through blog-land.  It is doubly appreciated because I walked around in that sweater for more than one day and no one even noticed, not even my mate!  Well, their comments don't matter one bit to me - compared to the ones coming from all you trained professionals out there.  I really enjoyed making  urlLink Sassy .  The pattern is very well-written - great for a beginner because they are very generous with the text.  The sweater fits very well - I added an inch to the body length, and I'm on the short side, but otherwise I made no other changes.  Nancy Wiseman's book on finishing helped me with the set-in sleeve seaming, and I found the buttons at JoAnne's - chosen because the color was perfect, and I thought they were fun in their triangular shape.  Botton line - get SASS-AY... Oh, and, if you'll still have me, I'm not leaving the party - I've got  urlLink PF Tundra  on the needles for the  urlLink Knitting Pure & Simple Jacket .  thanks again.

      Well, I finished the back of the Summer Tweed hoodie  urlLink (click here to see my progress)  and swatched w/the Peace Fleece. Here's a picture...  .   I wish the picture showed the stitches better, but I'm still new w/the digital camera. Sorry if it's fuzzy! I used US8 needles and got exactly 4 stitches/1" What luck...I must be a very tight knitter. The color is Lena's Meadow, which I adore everytime I see the yarn. The yarn is nice to work with, and..is that lanolin I feel in the yarn? That's very cool...  So, I'm off to get some Addi Turbos to start the EC. I think I'm going to use US7 for the sleeve ribbing and use the US8 for the body and body ribbing. I think the smaller needle ribbing will just emphasize my hips, which I love, but not that much.

      I've gotten off my bee-hind and have cast on for my everday.  I'm about  an inch into the ribbing, and it's lookin' fine for ribbing.  I just don't like ribbing.    I'll admit now that I see what everyone else is doing, I'm getting just a touch jealous that I went with such a safe yarn color.  I almost got the Glasnost Gold, but instead went with Patience blue.  The Blue is a lovely dark blue with the occasional bit of lighter blue, but it's just not the multi-faceted excitement of, say, the Zarya fog.  It'll be a nice wear-everywhere piece though.  I'm making it a bit smaller than my current body type would reccomend for a loose-fitting sweater, but I'm in the process of losing weight, so it should work out great (and use less yarn, woo hoo!)  Here's hopin . . .

      Remember how I cast-on the back and both fronts for my Everyday Cardi?  That's 184 stitches, thank you very much.  And I ripped my first efforts because my gauge was WAY loose, but now I'm on 6's and all's well.  Except, it takes me TEN minutes to purl across 184 stitches.  And eight minutes to knit across.  Six rows to the inch; at this rate, I have seven more HOURS of knitting before I'm reading to divide for the armholes.  Sheesh!  Anybody else this slow?  Anybody else OCD enough to actually time herself?  A little validation here--mucho appreciato!

      Hi everyone, haven't posted in a while. I am coming along slowly I have the back almost up to the shoulders which is definitely progress. Got a part time job so is limiting my knitting time a little.  Going to a knitting weekend with Sally Melville this weekend so won't be able to knit on it much this weekend either. It is coming out really nice. If I can get my son to take a picture with his digital camera ( I have got to learn to use that thing) I will post a picture of the back so you can see the color I am making. Every one have a good day. Cathi

      I finally began my Everyday Cardigan.  All these folks finishing and I just swatched and started a sleeve.  I am not sure what to think.  My gauge was close...a little less than 4.25 stitches to the inch.   I thought the ribbing, on the #6, would change the gauge but it hasn't.  All you finished folks--it's an oversized cardi, right?  Did anyone use a #9?  I have been loose these days so I don't know what to think.  Perhaps it is a good excuse to go buy some Addi's.  I am using a stash needle from my mom's overflowing pile.  I know the needle itself can make a difference.

      Hi y'all!  I have enjoyed reading about your sweaters and seeing the progress/finished projects.  Count me in!  I am knitting the Knitting Pure and Simple Neckdown Jacket in Benat denimstyle for my daughter.  She is not a wool/mohair person, so I had to forego the yummy Peace Fleece this time.  I hope this knitalong continues for awhile, because I would like to do another using Peace Fleece.  The Benat denimstyle is working up very nicely.  I was surprised at how much I like this yarn knitted up.  It is a cotton/acrylic yarn and very inexpensive.  I am loving the pattern, too.  I may be asking for help when I get to the zipper insertion stage.  I have never done that before.  You can see my progress on the jacket on  urlLink my blog .

      Okay, so I decided to do a few rows of the PF, and as I'm knitting, I can't remember why I decided to CO 1 extra stitch instead of two for the ribbing (97 instead of 96). Now, after reading Michele's blog entry, I'm not sure if I should continue. I know there is a very good reason (so I thought).   Does anyone know what to do w/the extra knit stitch I added? Maybe this will get absorbed in the selvage, and I'll have two purls together instead of 2 knits? If anyone can help me make sense of all this, it would be greatly appreciated!!

I've only knitted w/1 skein so far (1/2 of the back) because I've been diligently working on my first sweater, and anyone whose checked out  urlLink my blog , knows what I mean..:)  I plan to be finished soon, another 2 wks, then I can join the ranks of you all, and well, start another one...I'm thinking Georgia Rose...  Happy Knitting everyone!!

      Hi -  I'm a new knitter to the cardi-along. I just received my Buffalo Brownski in the mail yesterday and I am so excited about the color, as it has a wonderful red hue in it. I also ordered the Simple Pie Vest kit in Blueberry Borscht for my husband, so I got a huge box of PF. While I've been waiting for my Brownski, I've been reading all of the comments on pattern changes, so I really appreciate this knit-along! Beth

      I've been an irresponsible knit-alonger.  However, I've finally started knitting my Everyday Cardigan and I'm nearly done with the back.  I have a  urlLink blog entry  (from last week, whoops!) about the modifications I've made to the ribbing.  Based on what I've seen here, I'll probably also be making modifications to the sleeves.

      Hi Cardi alongers! I am finished my zarya fog everyday cardigan! I love it! LOVE IT!      Can you see it?  Is it big enough? I know Miss Kim will come in and save me from having the hugest picture EVER.  The only thing I would change is to make the sleeves a bit shorter.  This is the first sweater I've made that fits me perfectly. I do plan to make another!  This knitalong may never end! Sandy

      I have finished knitting my SASSY cardigan but have a question.  Do I put it together FIRST and then wash it or the other way around?  Could someone let me know?  Thanks!!  I ordered the Everyday Cardigan pattern from PF and plan on knitting that with the "Lena's Meadow" colorway and these really pretty buttons from Blackwater Abbey:  urlLink

      Well maybe not a wrap, more like a finished Everyday Cardigan.      I also found some superb buttons.      I ended up reknitting both sleeve to get rid of the bat wings.  You can see the sleeves best here.      So the changes that I made from the original pattern: 1.  for the sleeves, cast-on 46 stitches and increased every 6 rows. 2.  for the neckline - decrease as per the largest size instead of the second size 3.  cast on 2 fewer stitches on the back, and each of the cardigan fronts  With these changes, I ended up with extra yarn (about the size of a small peach) from the 5 skeins that I have.    Did I mention that this little cardigan is more like a jacket?  It's thick and warm.  While some of you lucky people have been able to wear it next to skin, I just can't.  The mohair makes me way too itchy.    The length and fit is perfect.  I had to wash the darn thing before sewing up and it texture really changed.  Of course, I also noticed that I lost some of the width and was going to get a snugger fit than anticipated.  Yes, I know that I can stand to shed a few pounds, but I WANT TO WEAR my cardigan, NOW!  So, I gave it a very firm hand in blocking and get the width to 41.5 inches (phew!)  I wore it to work on Thursday, even though there were only 4 buttons attached.  No one noticed but by lunch time, I was getting a bit self-conscious, so I went to the bathroom and spent 10 minutes to attach the other 4 buttons.  It's a good thing I have needle and thread in my desk drawer.  While you can find all the details at  urlLink  All Tangled Up , I put them all here too.  Thanks Kim for hosting this!

           Knitting Pure & Simple Cardigan, Peace Fleece Tundra, is completed!  Yes, this is cardi #2 for me.  I love Peace Fleece, what can I say?  More details over at my  urlLink blog .  I found the zipper experience to be a bit challenging, being a novice seamstress, but got through it fine with the help of Nancy Wiseman's Finishing Techniques, and  urlLink Margene's  added touches.  I do plan on posting on this in the next few days.

       Not sleeveless, not backless, but Frontless ~  This afternoon I finished the back and the sleeves of the Everyday Cardigan from Peace Fleece, color  urlLink Ancient Fern . I've been rather reluctant to finish the pieces of this sweater, since that means I'll have to sew it together. GULP. However,  urlLink Sandy  is coming over to help me, so I might actually finish this project!

      I washed all of my PF today and I am so glad I did. I was a little concerned with the abrasiveness of the yarn. I followed the washing instructions of Paula and I was amazed. The yarn just bloomed and became incredibly soft. I can't wait for it to dry. And who's project to do first - the simple pie vest for my DH or the cardi for me?

      I'm brain dead! I am working on the left hand side of my cardigan, and while i can knit just fine, I am terrible at understanding reversing these directions...should I be doing the decreasing on right side rows or should I be merely decreasing on the opposite end of the wrong side rows. I would appreciate anyone's advice/experience doing this. Can you tell it's been a long time since I have knit a sweater? I am already getting worried about the finishing and the neck and button band. YIKES! Maybe if I conquer all this, I can piece together another entirely completed sweater that's been living with my stash for 2 years!! thanks, michelle

      Hi All! Well, I've successfully weathered the domain storm!  It was much cheaper just to move my site to  urlLink unravelings.net/blog.html   instead of trying to get my old domain name back.  What a relief, lol.  Anyway, I'm still plugging along on the cardi and am almost ready to start the front or sleeves...haven't decided which yet.

      The instructions for the button band and collar are giving me fits.  I figured out the button band, finally, but didn't it seem unnecessarily fractious?  Why pick up and then attach the yarn at the other end?  Anyway, I just reversed things and it turned out fine, but now the pattern says to pick up 64 stitches "evenly across neck edge, including tops of front bands."  Sixty-four?  Even with sticking pretty close to picking up 3 for every four stitches and I have 116 stitches on my needle.  Am I on drugs (I wish)? Any advice or words of wisdom from my friends out there would be much appreciated.

       Please, Sir....can I 'ave some more?  When working the back of the Everyday Cardigan I added 3 inches to provide more hip coverage. That's right--I'm a Hipster. However, in doing this, I now don't have enough yarn to finish up. Argh. I've got 19" of the fronts finished, and will need to add 3 inches to them, also. So....I've ordered some more yarn. More yarn?? Oh darn! There are worse things, no? :)

         Here's my verison of a pile o' PF.   EC is finally my #1 project. I've finished the back, and front panals in three days. That's three days of full-time knitting. All that's left are the sleeves--I'm hoping to get those finished by this week, because I want a reason to buy more PF.  My only complaint were the directions for the left front panal. I just realized, when it says reverse, that meant change from right/wrong side for the bindings. I didn't get this till time for 1 bind offs, 4xs. Before then I binded off, cut the yarm and started again...it looks fine, I just have some extra weaving to do for those ends.  Oy ivey.

      I haven't posted for a long time. First of all I had   computer problems that took a while to fix at Best Buy and then I had to go to Maine to visit my folks for a week (my father had cancer surgery awhile ago) to see if the were doing OK by themselves up there. Then I had  the humiliation of not being able to figure out how to post a blog again and had to try to figure it all out. Then computer problems gainf or two  days.  Says now I have the equivalent of a new computer so should be fine. I  had also the humiliation of, not only did I do my  swatch guage on my sweater and then wash it and measure and cast on and knit almost the entire back to find that at this point it looked a little small and it was 4 inches to  small so had to take the whole thing out and staaaart with that swatch thing again which is w hat I think  got me into the trouble in the first place!  Anyway got a different guage on a larger needle and cast on again  making the size a little to the next two sizes so it will be big enough for a jacket sweater for me.  I have cast on and have about 8 inches done on the back and have this anxiety that this one is not going to fit either but anyway I have perservered and am working on the  sweater again after having pouted for awhile about the whole thing. It is going to be very pretty when it is done.  I had  so much as gone to ordering a second kit to do I was liking it so much. Well I guess i have used up enough space and time of everyone for one posting. Thanks for listening to me whine about my woes with my cardigan. Cathi Davis CathiDavis@msn.com

      My additional skein of Peace Fleece arrived yesterday. Time to finish this puppy. With Nancy M. Wiseman's "Knitter's Book of Finishing Techniques", I'm feeling pretty confident.  Hope everyone has had a terrific Mother's Day!

          ah, progress!   Finally finished the top part of the back! It's in the top of the photo, above the folded collar in the center. On the left and right sides I'll pick up stitches for the (huge) sleeves! I will continue the cable pattern down the sleeve and border it with double moss st. Anyone recognize those triple crosses? Yep, I appropriated 'em for use in the Fiona bag!  I think now I see the light at the end of the tunnel! Love the new look over here Gibster--nice work!

      I am almost finished w/Everyday--how exciting! You can see a picture of it on  urlLink my blog  I have seamed all the pieces, knitted the button/collar bands and woven in the loose ends. I've washed it, and it's so soft...it's drying now and then I'll sew on the buttons. Counting total knitting and finishing time, I would've been done w/this in less than 2 wks, but in reality it took almost 4 wks. I'll post again once the buttons are sewed on.

      I have finally finished Everyday! It's washed, dried, and ready to wear. i tried to post a picture here, but it was supersized, so if you'd like to see me and my Everyday in Lena's Meadow, please visit  urlLink my blog    The color is more green than the PF website picture, but I definitely fell in love with the yarn. I liked the texture of the yarn as I was knitting, but once washed, it became extremely soft. I'm not sure if I'd do the actual pattern again, but I'm definitely making something else using Peace Fleece.  Happy Knitting everyone!

      My LYS finally reopened after being shut down for renovation!!  I was dying to get in there, she has stocked up on a lot of new things and it was just wonderful to be in there again.  I love to look at all the yarns and touch them and think of the things I could make.   I am starting the felted tote, I have the base done, but now I need assistance to carry on.  It is on circular needles, which I had never worked with before.  I LOVE them, I really didn't think I would.  I am going to look for other things I can do on them!!

      I am still working on my bag.  I have about a third of the other panel done.  I did not knit at all last night, but I was up at 5 am so I could squeeze some in.  I am looking at a great book right now,   Knit One, Felt Too  .  It has a lot of great ideas in it and basic instruction for felting.  I think I will make the bunny slippers in there for my daughter.

      Holy mackerel it worked!!!  I changed some colors and added a comments section!!  Feel free to comment away! I started the other panel of my bag last night.  It is going to be cute.  I think I will make one for my niece out of magic stripe!!  That would be too cute!  It's off to work today, but I'd rather be knitting.  Only 1 more day till the LYS reopens!  They have been closed for remodeling and I am dying to get in there.

      I tried to make a COMMENTS area available, but it didn't work.  It looked like it worked, but... I finished one panel of my Zeeby's Bag today.  I have to make another 12x12 panel, the gusset and the handle.  I might give it to my niece for her birthday if it looks good. I have been sick and laying around for two days.  I hope to be better tomorrow.  I hope...

      I made a mistake in my  urlLink Zeeby's Bag  last night while watching my show and I had to take it to work today so my Knitting Guru could fix it for me.  Every new knitter should have someone that has been knitting since birth (her own words) to turn to in times of stress.   As of right now this blog does not allow you to post your own pictures.  I want to be able to post pictures of my finished works.  I am looking into how to do that, even if it means switching blogs.

      I tried to knit last night while I was watching the final episode of  urlLink Sex In The City  and I made a mess of it.  That'll teach me!! I for one am thrilled with the ending.  I knew she'd end up with Big!  It's a match made in NYC! I am working on the  urlLink Zeeby's Bag  from  urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch .  It is going to be so cute!

      I just finished this!!  It is co cute and our cat Elsa seems to love it--  urlLink Cat Wonton  We went to a  urlLink Mardi Gras  Party last night and all I could think about was going to buy yarn today for my bag I am going to knit and then felt.  I got the pattern from a friend so I don't have a link to show it.  I would like to try and make this one as well,  urlLink French Market Bag  but it looks more advanced, so I think I will save it for next time. I am also going to start a bag I found in  urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch  (a great book), it looks very easy and functional!  It is called  urlLink Zeeby's Bag  and it seems very easy to do.   Today I am taking Carol to a birthday party then I am heading out to a yarn store...anywhere!!  So I can start my bag!!!!

      Welcome to Continue In Kind, my knitting blog.  I am Lisa and I will be your host this evening... I am a new knitter, which means I learned about a year ago and made a very long, skinny, unattractive scarf and then never picked up my needles again.  Until last November that is, when a dear friend of mine showed me a really cute scarf she had just knit with something called "Fun Fur".  My friend had just learned to knit a few weeks before making this scarf and I thought, "I can do that!”  I made about 10 scarves as Christmas gifts and now I am anxious to learn more challenging stitches.   I am addicted to beautiful yarns and can't seem to get enough.  I don't even know what I will make with half of them.  I am currently working on a tube sock and a cat toy.  I will be starting a felted knitting bag soon and am excited about it!

      My bag is back from the felters (my washing machine is an old laundry mat one and does not have any dials, therefore it is without felting capabilities) and I love it!!  It is a perfect size, but very FLOPPY.  I think next time I will use Lamb's Pride Bulky or Noro Kuryeon.  I have taken pictures, but they are not developed yet. I am now starting a backpack from  urlLink kids knitting by Melanie Falick  ,but I want to felt it.  I got some  urlLink Lambs Pride Bulky in Soft Yellow  and Lilac and it is lovely.  I am just making everything a tad bigger.  The pattern says CO 34 ST and I did 40, it says make the body 10" high and I am going to go to 15".  I think it will be fine.  It's for my daughter and does not have to be big.

      It is finished!!!  I am so happy to be done.  I really enjoyed learning new techniques and working with smaller needles, but towards the end I just wanted to be done.  I bought some yarn last night to make some dishcloths and a sweater for my girlfriends baby.  On to the next project!!! I have to felt my bag today and I will post some pictures as soon as possible!!

      I am in the final stretch of my French Market Basket.  I just started the handles and I love the  urlLink color combination .  I have just a touch of pink at the bottom and now the top edge and handles will be pink too.  I got some help last night at the  urlLink chat board  for the FMB Knitalong urlLink  .  Those ladies are great!  I have really enjoyed this project, but I am looking forward to doing something a little different next time.  I just got a copy of  urlLink Baby Knits for Beginners by Debbie Bliss  and there are lots of really cute things in there.

      Today is my one month anniversary!! I have really enjoyed this blog and now that I am 1 month old the knitting bloggers will let me join their web-ring!!!!  I have put their icon on the page, but the picture isn't working?!  I'm not sure what that is about, but the previous and next buttons work, so have fun!! I have been consumed with knitting, so I haven't posted in awhile.  Knit Nite was great, I really enjoyed myself.  I love to be surrounded by people who knit.  I feel like I am learning more just being around them.  I learned a new way to cast on, a started a sock.  I feel like a real knitter. I am still working on the  urlLink FMB , but I am in the home stretch.  I will start the handles tomorrow I am sure, but I will need help, so I am taking it to work with me. I found so cotton tape I am going to use for my  urlLink poncho   it is a discontinued Ibizia from my local LYS, but I think I got enough.  I can't wait to start that.  Today I am going to start some  urlLink afghan squares .  It is cold and snowy and the perfect day for it!!

       urlLink Happy Saint Patty's Day!!!  Progress... Yesterday was my day off and I did nothing but knit!  Look at how much I got done on my  urlLink FMB  !!  I have had some major mess ups, but I have fixed them myself.  Thanks to my lesson in un-knitting from one of my Guru's.  The mistakes are noticeable and it took me so long to fix them the yarn is kind of streched, but all will be forgiving in the felting.  Please notice the homemade stitch markers in my scan.  My sweet husband made those for me.  He also made dinner, cleaned up, took our daughter to Brownies and put her to bed, so I could knit.   urlLink What a man !

      Okay, let's not get too excited, but I think that picture worked!!  Now, I will try to post some more of my WIP's.  Here is a scan of my  urlLink Galway Felted Tote   I love the colors I chose and it really felted beautifully.  But, while I was knitting it I made an unfortunate mistake.  I some how twisted my yarn and left a series of holes.  They disappeared in the felting process.  I did take some before and after pictures, which I will post as soon as they are developed. I am now working on my  urlLink FMB Knitalong   I chose some new yarn that was 100% wool just to be safe.  I got Nature Spun in a soft pink and Galway in a heathery chocolate brown.  I am not embarrassed to say I stole the color choices from  urlLink this talented lady  because her bag just made me drool!!!  I wasn't sure how I would like knitting on these small needles after so much chunky knitty on big needles, but I have found I really enjoy it.

      I am starting the  urlLink French Market Bag from Knitty .  It has a rounded bottom that you do on 5 double pointed needles...way too advanced for me.  I opted for the flat rectangles bottom.  I got a beautiful Galloway wool in moss green with a small colored fleck.  My only concern is it is 93% wool and 7% polyester!!!!  Will it still felt!!??  I know the simple answer here is swatch it and see, but I am a lazy knitter and that just sounds like too much work.

      I HAVE FINISHED MY FELTED TOTE BAG!!  It is my first substantial project (besides a scarf) and it is truly beautiful.  I can't thank my knitting guru's enough, they made me do it myself instead of making one FOR me.  It doesn't even bother me that in the time it took me to make my bag one of my guru's made three of them! I took before and after pictures, but because I don't have a digital camera I will have to wait to post until I develop the roll! I have started a mini bag for my daughter! Too cute!!

      Okay, I have been knitting like a fiend and I am almost done with my felted tote bag.  I have to finish the last 6" stripe and then attach the handles.  Then comes the felting process.  I think I will ask my friend for help with that.  She has done 2 of them now and they have beautiful shape.  I am already thinking about my next project!!??  I promised my daughter I would make her a bag too.  She will pick out her own colors for that. I have the day to myself to KNIT KNIT KNIT!  Then tonight is  urlLink The Sopranos  ,it has been forever since the last season, I was afraid it would never start again.  I will not knit during that, so I won't make any mistakes!

      My girlfriend Lynne is starting a knitting group.  We will meet at her house on March 17th (her birthday) and knit, talk and laugh!!  I can't wait.  I am hoping to get my good friend from the city to go and some friends from around here. I am well on my way with the felted tote.  It is easy knitting and I still love the circular needles.  Mary brought her bag in and it is HUGE before you felt it!!!  It looks like a sweater.  I am already planning the colors for my next one.

      Questions for your Secret Pal 1. Are you a yarn snob (do you prefer high-end/natural fibers)? Do you avoid Red Heart and Lion Brand? Or is it all the same to you? I have limited funds to spend on yarn. I love the texture and the touch of more expensive yarns, but usually end up with Lion Brand or something similar. 2. Do you spin? Crochet? I am very into knitting, but I know I should have some knowledge of crochet, if only for finishing work. 3. Do you have any allergies? (smoke, pets, fibers, perfume, etc.) I am deathly allergic to bees, but that is all. 4. How long have you been knitting? Like everyone else my grandmother taught me when I was a little girl, but I recently took it up again and have become obsessed. 5. Do you have an Amazon or other online wish list? Oh, yes I do!! Just go to Amazon and click on Wish List, type in Lisa Pritchard. I am the one from Albion with 20+ items!!! 6. What's your favorite scent? (for candles, bath products etc.) I adore Patchouli or Sandlewood. I am not a flowery girl. 7. Do you have a sweet tooth? CHOCOLATE IS A FOOD GROUP. 8. What other crafts or Do-It-Yourself things do you like to do? I am a reader, knitter, movie watcher. 9. What kind of music do you like? Can your computer/stereo play MP3s? (if you want to make her a CD) I like everything, but RAP. 10. What's your favorite color? Or--do you have a color family/season/palette you prefer? My favorite color of the moment is pink. Normally I am a deep tones person, browns, blacks, deep blues and etc. 11. What is your family situation? Do you have any pets? I have a wonderful, sweet, divine husband and an adorable seven year old girl. We also have a dog named Newman and a cat named Elsa. 12. What are your life dreams? (really stretching it here, I know) I want to have enough money to pay my bills, buy yarn and travel with my family. I feel like I have all I could want.

      I have gone back and forth about wither or not I should start this blog up again. I really think I was boring to read, there are so many truly good writers out there in blogland, why clutter up the internet with boring blogs. Then there is the technical difficulty. I know a lot about computers and I don't know even more! I am constantly wanting to do something on my blog, but not having the capabilities to do it. But so much is happening that I would love to have a blog to talk about it all. I am in a Secret Pal group with my Knit Nite and also on the Internet. I have contacted both of my pals, but not gotten any gifts for them yet. I would like to get to know them better before I start buying. I received my first gift today!!!! I don't have a digital camera :
