      just had one gathering recently...hhhmmmm...wow! it has been 12 yrs since i graduted leh..n we are still meeting up like twice a yr...impressive hor... pri sch days was the most carefree wan..we will play zero point, five stones blah blah.. during recess (depending on wat the the fad thing that season).   i enjoyed the times after exams the most...this was when i learn how to knit, do frenship band, cross stitch n all the girlie stuff....not forgeting chinese chess, and all the cards games..n also some foul language...hahah..but i was really enjoyable siah..  those days are gone but i am `so glad that we are still meeting up...tho most of the time we will be reminding one another of all the stupid stuff we did...one classic one that all of us will remember would be that one of our classmates shitted in class...i was the partner...so u can imagine the smell ah....   altho i dun really like it when pple remind mi that i always throw tantrums during practices..but bo bian lor...i cannot erase their memories right? so all i do is to smile n yayaya all the way....anyway, i am still the organiser who take the initiative to gather my frens...=)so i guess i dun really mind all that...

      the new n upcoming initiatives of MOE...innovation n enterprise!!! just attended a one n a half day workshop on that...actually a workshop that makes mi fat rather than reframing my mind to think n teach more creatively.. after having breakfast at 730 at home,  we have tea at about 10, lunch at 1, another tea at 330pm...then off at 530 to go home to have dinner at 7pm...not to miss out supper also...so basically, 6 meals a day!!! wah...damn disgusting...  atually, i dun think the workshop helps, if the syllabus, supervisors, time, results, bonus allow us to incorporate I & E into our teaching, of course i wouldn't mind. but i dun think i can take the risk to cultivate students' questioning spirit by letting them ask more questions n unable to complete the syllabus on time...with more celebrations this term (namely, racial harmony day, national day n teachers' day), how can i possibly finish teaching in the first place?? seriously speaking, at th end of tha day, teachers are still judged by the students' results rather than their ability to question, isn't it?  policies come n go...i wonder how long they will take this time to realised that this doesn't work, n arrange for all staff to go for another workshop..then time to get fat again!!!

      altho vincent say cannot say....but i guess less than 5 person will read my blog, so i dun think it matters...:P  hehe...altho i haven sign the lease...but i paid $2000 for the option to purchase my new flat in punggol....haha...exciting siah.....  i got a call from my fren last friday telling mi that she is queueing outside HDB for a new launch of WIS for hougang, punggol n sengkang....she asked if i wanna go queue as well...news wasnt out n i so i decided not to go down n queue for something that is not confirmed...well, it turn out to be true, so i went down with vincent the next morning....n got a queue number of 108...meaning sure get rich..hahaha... well, my frens got 14, 28 n 30 for queueing overnight, so i guess mine number shud be good enough for someone who slept comfortably at home....  then i turn out that HDB only give you less than 3 days to view n recce the flats on sale...my appt was on tue....so vincent n mi rush through the seletion...that made his dad quite unhappy...and i was so worried that his dad will just stop us from buying cos' we never really think thru carefully...but i was rather determined to buy one...cos this area is wat we always wanted....  so i got my fren's dad to help see the fengshui n got a supposedly will make us lucky for 20 years flat..but the unit number is 13-212...like hungry for the whole life...anyway, hope it will be good...we trust him...cos when its our turn to choose, most of our top choices of the highest floor still available...but we still chose this....  ok, getting keys within 3 months then ROM in 6 months???? hehe...exciting siah....
