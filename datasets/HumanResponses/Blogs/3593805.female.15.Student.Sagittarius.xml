Hmm.....lemme count how many days. 1...2....3! Three WHOLE DAYS. No wonder my sis couldn't wait for me to blog. Haha. I'll make this blog extra long to make up for the days that a haven't blog! Malaysia was cool. We went to Desaru. Swimming was fun. Got water slide. Super fast!!! We went to the beach too. My sixth aunt helped us build a sandcastle. Or rather, a sand palaceplace!Hahaha. The sea was cOoOl~ Lol. The waves were so big it can carry me lor!!! I had a little bit of sand in my eyes and seawater in my mouth. My sis and bro made a mistake from choosing wheather to go to Desaru or not! Haha. You can guess they decieded not to go!
