      Good evening! It's about 9pm, and my day of eating is over - the kitchen is closed. Well, I had a great DAY today, and proceeded to ruin it with an evening of overeating. Here was my menu:  B- Eggbeater omelet with 2% cheese and chicken                            4 L- Veggie Chili with brocolli and 2% cheese                                       5 S- All in One bar                                                                                    3       100 cal oreo pack                                                                             2 D-brocolli with cheese and veggie burrito with salsa                        7 S- 94% FF kettle corn                                                                           4     4 pt energy bar                                                                                  4  Now had I stopped there, all would've been fine. I would have been satisfied, and would have staid within my point range, having used 4 flexies, and the 5 APs I earned this morning on my 5 mile walk/run.  Sadly though, I proceeded to have another 4 pt energy bar, followed, by 3, yes 3 bowls of cereal with soy milk.  I am sure I consumed an extra 15 pts by doing that. Therefore, my balance was probably 45 points! I am very upset with myself, and this seems to be what's been the course of action lately! I am done eating now (of course, since I am ready to burst), but I am going to get my act together tomorrow. I must. Especially just because I don't need to be feeling this way.  WW came out with a new plan today, called the "core plan".  I can stay on Flex or switch over to core, which is a "no counting" plan. There is a list of core foods, which I won't need to measure or keep my portions down on.  Instead, I will eat the core foods in "unlimited" but only "satisfying" amounts, and I will have 35 flexies, plus APs per week. I am not sure if I should try it, but it seems pretty benign. If I find that it leads to bingeing, I will most definitely go back to  flex points though. I'll have to see. So tomorrow will perhaps be the first day of my new CORE PLAN! It's worth a try,considering the fact that this isn't working. I will work out my plan tonight so that I am not scrambling tomorrow.  Wish me luck! I'll be posting again soon!

       Well, I've decided to take the plunge and start recording my weight watchers journey online.  I've been halfheartedly doing the program for a year or so, but now I need to buckle down and actually put some heart, soul, body and mind into it. So I am going to do what i need to do and record what I eat on my blog. Maybe it'll help some other people. i must admit, I have a real problem with nighttime eating. After dinner it seems like I am raring to eat everything that's not nailed down. I am starting graduate school now, and i will be interning at a school, so I need to be able to fit into my clothes! I realize how silly that may sound, but with my overeating at night, I know that I will have a problem if I am not careful! So here starts my journey. Join me if you like! I will post pics if I can figure out how!      I'll post my progress daily!
