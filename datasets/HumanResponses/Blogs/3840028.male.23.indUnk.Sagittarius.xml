      ive got a lot of work after being out for a week.  got a fair bit of work to do with the map (CU work) need to write a log analyzer (contract) would like to fix my homepage and the R6 definatly needs some lovin if i want to ride it in a week.  this blogger thing is kindof dumb, but it is yet another way to procrastinate.  woot.  need some food.

      after going to the flash conference, i realized i can do much better than the flat html that is currently on justinrmeyer.com.  expect something more entertaining.  i'm going to try and throw in some math along with making the band of the day fully functional.  if i can figure out the really cool stuff, i will put it in.  no promises as of yet.  outtay

      i hope there isnt some formula that says you must be a blogger for X days and post Y times a day.  i was hoping to get this gmail invite today so i could reply to mb, but i'm afraid i may loose patience with it.  CPAN is still working on Bundle::DBI so i have some more time to kill with this blogger.    i'm hopign to gain as much experince as i can this season so that i can go on tour with the AMA next year.  If i manage to get some of my debt paid down, then i will get another R1 and race that.  i have some worries that i wont be competative on a liter bike.  racing one of those, i would truly be rolling with the big boys... scary thot.  more text: hats off to those who can tell me where this is from "it smelled like lou dog inside the van"

      in case you were all wondering, the 9secondracing.com site has been down and i am working to get it up and running again.  i am typing into this blog while i wait for things like postgres and cpan to install.  right now CPAN is my friend and is taking care of the postgres driver install for me.    i forget where i was, but the whole purpose of this typing is to

      so here's the deal. while i'm waiting for postgres to compile on josh's computer i decided to write another blog.  this will make me look like an active user and therefor i should get the invite for the gmail account.    ass the compiler output scrolls by, i will waste time by typing.  a few weeks ago i broke my collar bone racing and it is finally starting to stick together again.    aww shit wireless went out....  well so much for the compiling.  hopefully that didnt boof the install too bad.    i will digress for a moment until the wireless comes back: i just moved into a new place and i dont have the T1 setup yet so i'm leeching access off the neighbors connection.  one neighbor left their newtork open so i'm using that right now.  the other wirless network in the area has a password and it gets much better reception.  i will brute force that in my spare time.  back to the compiling.... so the collar bone is almost healed.  i'm not doing pushups yet.  some of the motion is restricted but i think thats just from lack of use.  i'm not sure how this is goign to pan out since the bone healed over itself making it slighly shorter.  that would lead me to believe that i am going to run into some issues but i'm no doctor.    my bike is in need of some TLC. most of its injures were of the bodywork kind. time to get pgsql running. thats it for this post
