       today, it's my oldest sister's bday (Karyn). she's turning 31 yrs old. old, haha, yes i know. lately, she's been really stressed over her businesses (her tax office and 2 busy water shops), also her husband hasnt been helping much either.&nbsp; she has a daughter who just turned two, her name is Kaitlyn.&nbsp; Like a couple days ago, my sister announced that she was pregnant again. everyone was like..  uhm.. cool i guess.. it must be a boy! &nbsp; the thing was that, it wasnt like the right time to have another baby. everyone's busy (esp. my mom taking care of her grandchild and working under my sister). everyone got their own thing going on. well the point is that, karyn went and got an ultrasound recently, and it wasnt that great.&nbsp; the doctor couldnt see the baby. it is positive that karyn's pregnant though.&nbsp; so my sister was really worried (she didnt tell anyone that there were problems, until today. that's when i asked.. i am the only one who knows) so today, we're at the water shop. im still here. karyn contacted her her doctor...   and as her bday present (sarcastically speaking), the doctor said my sister must come in and get her second child aborted. the child that karyn was so excited about. she started maternity shopping! karyn was ready to breakdown, i could see it in her eyes. but i know my sis is a strong person. she held it in, like all her other problems. im very worried for her. i wanted to cry for her, but i couldnt, at least not in front of her. i cant do anything really... all i could do is sympathize, of like not bring it up. i dont know what to do... this must be her worst bday ever.

        i think "love" is a bit stupid.&nbsp; i really don't know what it is. i'm probably gonna wait until it hits me like everything else. for me, love has only placed me in guilt trips. the other would love me, and i'm... i'm not willing to do anything.  i'm sorry, i don't have that same intensity as you. i'm not in as deep.  and then comes the killer guilt trip.  valerie, why did you do that? why did you say that in the end? what's wrong with you?  blah, blah, blah. i need better experiences.    switching topics...    iunno. im just so&nbsp;pessimistic right now. i don't see anything. i'm starting to be apathetic about EVERYTHING> yeah, everything. i don't understand it. i don't care enough to actually want to learn. learn more about the people, the events, etc. i think im losing it. i don't mean mentally bien sur.    im listening to dashboard right now. i just can't put their album down. it's missing rapid love loss, but it's all good- no, actually i want that in there. o well, that's life.    tomorrow i have a tennis tournament against castlewood country club. some rich place. wish me luck! i wanna win so badly.  im determined ! i've been losing too much. i can win practice matches but not the real ones. it's the mind set. i must believe in myself. stop stressing and stop thinking it's very very big. determined i am!!!!!    gosh, i need good friends. i have some, but like... yeah. (damn, that reminds me i have to buy adgie's really really belated bday present, and tran's early bday present.. shit.. no time) would you be my friend??? haha, like i trust you. PSH. well that's all for now. thanks for tuning in. blah bye!

      so i'm at home right now, back injured and the works from tennis. but that doesnt really matter. im just so confused. i think my friend is starting to avoid me. i dunno why though. when im online, he ghosts until i'm off. yeah, that's a bit hurtful. if theres a problem, i should at least have some clue about what's going on. nothing is said. blah, it all sucks! i dunno whats wrong... but hey, tomorrow i get to go to Sacramento! woo-hoo! gonna see some tennis stuff with 2 of my teammates and coach. cool eh? we meet at 12, and come home 12 hrs later! iunno how we're getting there though... but o well. haha, cant wait! gosh, i hope i get happier by the end of today.

       i had a fight with my ex/use-to-be-close-guy-friend yesterday. it was horrible and great i admit. we dont care about each other anymore. guilt is such a wasted feeling. he expected too much from me. he claims me as not a friend. he called me a bitch and hoped i die. wow, thanks. well he's a stubborn fool. he complains that i dont talk to him at all. and the reason, well first off, i do- casually at least. i've been so busy over the summer, i dont even have time to talk with my best girls! of course, if i have no time for them, i have no time for him. i broke up with him, he became bitter. he loved me, i liked him. he thought i was the perfect one, i thought about just giving him a chance out of pity. okay, okay, i have my faults in this relationship. i started it off badly- by not really liking him. i thought i did, but i was so totally wrong. he keeps on complaining and complaining about how i dont appreciate him. damn stupid guy. i was his first gf. he didnt know what to do. i tried helping, but he didnt get it. when we're alone, he's quiet and statue-like. he also gets so freaking jealous easily. i have another close guy friend who he hates. hate may seem like a strong word, but i mean he really really HATES my other guyfriend. my ex doesnt even know him or want to even try to befriend the guy. i tried talking it out, but that hard-head wont listen. whenever i hang around with my guyfriend, my ex would get in a bad mood, not respecting me at all. stupid childish feelings he has. i dont get jealous of all his lady friends, i respect them too, even befriend them. *sigh* lost a really close friend. o well, i'll regret it later. for now, i got peace! =) i dont have to deal with all his childish, harsh, erratic emotions ever again!!! yay!   oh, i used "ex" to make things easier to understand. but for this guy, i dont count him as an ex-boyfriend or a boyfriend for that matter. such an embarassment. we had no real dates. so my record will be clear. hehe.
