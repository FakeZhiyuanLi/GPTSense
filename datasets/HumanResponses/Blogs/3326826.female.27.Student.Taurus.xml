						    urlLink ESPN.com - MLB - Stark: Greatest lefty ever? : "As Don Larsen could attest, perfect games alone aren't enough to put a man in the Hall of Fame. But when a man like Randy Johnson throws a perfect game, it's more than just his 15 minutes of fame. It's the crescendo on a career that had already stamped him as one of the most overpowering left-handers of his -- or any -- time."  Sometimes, especially after having a hard day, life seems to be dull.  When in that mood, something must help me get out of it. Yesterday's savior was the perfect show of the Big Unit.  It is very strange that glory of others can relieve my OWN pain. But it happens.  I'm regularly watching baseball and basketball news these days.  It is my relatively new habit, because I didn't watch sports news  since I was a freshman.  In my high school days (a.k.a. Dark Age), I always watched sports news.  But when I'd become an undergraduate, life was so good, and I felt no need to watch TV or newspaper because I had plenty of fascinating things to do instead.  Now, I'm again watching sports news everyday.  I don't feel sad.  But it's a life.

						    urlLink FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST   Cartoon Network will air this famous japanimation from October. Fullmetal Alchemist is an legendary hit animation in Japan.  It was initially created as a comics by Hiromu Arakawa, and it became so famous that ENIX decided to make it as a TV animation series last winter.  ENIX hired BONES, a famous group of creaters that produced "Cowboy Bebop : The Movie" and "Wolf's Rain", for this project.  In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, "alchemy" is a science that manipulate materials to another by sacrificing something. There were two young genius brothers who tried to revive their mother without knowing that resurrecting LIFE was prohibited, and they lost a part or whole of their bodies while doing the ritual of resurrection.  The younger brother lost his whole body and the older brother lost his left leg during the process. However, the older brother could bind his younger brother's soul to an armor by sacrificing his right arm.  Therefore, this animation is a story about these two young alchemist brothers who are on a way to find the alchemist's stone so that they can recover their own body parts.   I actually only read comics, but I was fascinated by the comics. I'll definitely watch this animation when it will be on air.  There are two cool trailers in the homepage.  Don't forget to watch them!

						    urlLink NBA.com: Fisher's Jumper Gives Lakers Dramatic Game 5 Win : "'One lucky shot deserves another,' O'Neal said."  They're the most improbable two shots I've ever seen in my life. Duncan made a miraculous shot, and Fisher made a nonsense shot.  Take home lesson today : Don't ever never think anything is impossible.

						   Many customized blog-tool designers and many blog-skin designers were shocked by the recent transformation of blogger.com interface. People are spreading their surprises all over their blogs.  Actually, I'm one of the heard-the-news-and-come people and I'm still in a shock by seeing this amazing designs and functions of blogger.com.  I'm not thinking of moving my sketchbook::elendil to here, but I'll certainly use this blog for another purpose... for scratching. :-)  Happy to be here, and thank you, blogger team.

      Yes. So many things to complain about. To tell you the truth, however, I got tired of it. It just makes me more frustrated and more miserable. It's hard not to complain about life, because life really sucks occasioinally.  Nevertheless, it is better not to complain. It might make you feel a little bit happier, hopefully.  Let's be as optimistic as your personality allows, at least from time to time.
