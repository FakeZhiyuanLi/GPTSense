      I've never told this story to anyone, but i feel like getting it off my chest... One summer, when i was 27, i had the worst day of my life. First mistake, i got up and put on a shirt that i had no business wearing in public. i was dreaming of my former figure, but the truth is, the shirt just barely squeezed over my mid-section. but in my defense, it was really frikin' hot outside and i made sure to pull up my jeans a little every now and then. so i went out to run some errands and i stopped at my favorite cafe. i had some lunch and then made my second mistake. i thought it would be smart to take a short cut back to my car through the long, secluded, back alley....IN DOWNTOWN DETROIT! i had no means of defense on me, not even a phone. Boy, did i learn the hard way. So i made my way down the alley and turned the first of three corners, but it would be a little while before i made it around the next two. i pass by a grubby looking man with a beard, a cap, and sunglasses creeping around by the dumpster. so i tug on my shirt, hike up my waistband a little, and i quietly make my way around him when just a few steps later, the man grabs me from under my arms and pulls me back causing my shirt to ride up very high. i find my self cornered behind the dumpster and before i can get a word out or even pull my shirt down, the man pulls out a  razor  sharp knife, so sharp, the sight of it made me shutter! my eyes were fixed on the the blade, dreading what he might do with it. he held the knife at my belly and began edge the blade toward my vulnerable, bare mid-section. he kept edging the knife closer. i thought he would stop at my tummy but it was clear he was just gonna keep coming further, so i swallowed and did the only thing i could do, i had to suck in my belly, waaaaay in!! he held the knife still, nearly touching my stomach. then he pulled a hand gun from his back pocket and aimed it right at my nose. staring at a gun in my face and holding my belly in from a knife, i was mentally preparing myself to die and just then, he demanded to have my purse. i handed him the purse and he put down the gun and the knife. releif...i could breathe again. he took the cash and credit cards out of my wallet then pressed the hand gun firmly into my belly button. he then instructed me to empty my pockets. i turned them inside out to clarify i had nothing else. he put the gun away and ran off with my belongings. still shaken and utterly humiliated, i ran home, called to cancel my credit cards and called the police and went down to the station to give a description of the man. just to be safe, i stayed at my mom's house until a few months later when they caught the guy. as much shame as i feel in sharing this story, i hope it will be learned from. so if you don't want to be mugged or have your belly assaulted, don't take back alleys alone and wear shirts that fit.
