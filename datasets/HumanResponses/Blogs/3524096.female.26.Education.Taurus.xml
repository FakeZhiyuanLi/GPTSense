      Okay so for the last week we've had pretty decent weather.  This is something that could not have been said for the week before.  We had a rash of storms come through that really tore our great state of Indiana all to hell.  I mean I like a nice summer thunderstorm just as much as the next person but we're talking the type of storm that picks your house up and sets it down in the next zip code, rearranges your neighborhood, places your car in the neighbor's tree, we're not in Kansas anymore, the hand of God has just descended and wiped your neighbor's house clean off the face of the earth...   Which brings me to my next rant...  Why is it that every time a tornado touches down the local news inevitably finds some poor backwoods hick with no front teeth and 20 dogs and 10 kids running around to interview?  Oh you know what I'm talking about... the ones that get on the TV and make you wish you didn't have to tell people you were from the same state...  "I was sittin' in my living room watching that there Oprah show when all of a sudden my winders started to rattle.  I git up and runned over to the winder and looked out and der was this huge ole black cloud just a barrlin' down on my house.  I grabbed my beer and tole the little woman to git the dogs and kids in the house and we all went down to the basement.  That der is my neighbor's trailer in my tree and my truck is over yonder in the pond.  Sounded just like a freight train..."  I mean can't they find an educated person who will calmly explain the events using proper grammar, complete sentences and avoid the ever present reference to a freight train?  I mean do you ever here something like...  "Well, the storm was actually very epic in proportions.  I was in the living room watching the History Channel and I noticed that the atmospheric pressure in my house had changed rather drastically.  I ventured out onto my front porch and spotted a spectacular display of one of mother nature's most destructive forces.  After making sure that my beloved pets and family were securely in the basement I retreated there myself to wait out the storm.  The noise was horrific.  My neighbor's trailer did not fare as well, being relocated in my tree..."  I believe they instruct the news crews to find these people on purpose.  I am sure it is way too much to ask for them to find an educated person.  So anyway I had to go to the pharmacy today and I was standing behind this person who had one of those insurance companies that refuse to pay for almost everything.  The pharmacist was apologizing profusely and the customer was cursing them and their first born as if it was their fault.  Finally a younger and more sarcastic technician came up to the counter and said   "Yes, we personally called your insurance company this morning and told them to discontinue their coverage of this medication just to inconvenience you.  We thought your life was going way too good so we decided to pick one of the various medications you need to live a normal life and tell the insurance company to stop paying for it.  I see now it was a mistake to pick Prozac as that drug..."  After the customer managed to close their mouth after having it drop open they quietly left.  I congratulated the young pharmacy tech for being almost as hilarious and sarcastic as myself and then went on about my day.  Sometimes the world can be too funny...

      Well I just started this blog thing today.  My life is mostly pretty boring but a good friend of mine mentioned he was going to start a blog so I decided I'd give it a go myself.  I used to do this on-line diary thing where you had this homepage of sorts set up and then you posted entries.  People would come along and read them and then they could comment on your page and would earn points by visiting your pages and posting comments.  I never really figured out what the point system was or why they had it or what you'd use it for though, and I quickly lost interest in the site.  Well, I'll post a little "All About Me" post later today.  I'm at work right now and they actually expect me to get up and do something.  The nerve of some people...  Take Care,  Mary

       I was talking to a dear friend of mine the other day and he said "How come you haven't updated your blog in like forever?"  Well, I am almost ashamed to admit this, but I had forgotten I even started an account here on blogspot.  I know, don't shoot me please.  But anyway, here I am posting once again after almost two months of not even visiting this site.      I have been up since about 6:30 this morning and I went to bed at 3:30 a.m. which means that I've had almost three hours of sleep.  The night before was the same and so was the night before that.  I believe today I might start snapping at the students and be able to say that I actually "slapped some bitches" when my friend Brian asks me if I have today.  Not only do I have horrible insomnia problems but for the last 3 nights I've had someone over at my house until just before I went to bed or I have had friends on-line that have kept the conversation going until I threaten them with bodily harm if they don't let me go to bed.  It's so hard being so damned popular and in demand.  I am sure everyone knows what I'm talking about.      Well, I'm running out of things to write (and concentration to write them), so I'll be signing off now.  I'll come back and do another post later from work or something if I get extremely bored.
