      The purpose of stories that are not even true is simply to entertain us.  But this entertainment has many great perks.  These stories teach us lessons about life situations without any real life consequences.  Haroun and the Sea of Stories touches on the danger of censorship and a World that is devoid of art.  The Educated Imagination touches on issues that make us pay more attention to the world around us and analyze how that world has come to be.  The Arabian Nights has hundreds of small lessons intertwined within its stories such as be honest and keep your word.  A Good Man is Hard to Find tells us that we may want to look at ourselves before we judge others.  Pale Fire...ah and then there is Pale Fire.  While there is a multitude of things in Pale Fire that I'm sure I didn't even catch there is a lesson of Envy.  Being a vain, narcissistic stalker gets your readers to think you are a complete and utter moron : )  The Tempest teaches us to not take things at face value.  There are many Illusions in the world that may lead you into a world that you never wanted to go.  All of these stories plus many more that I have read on my own are priceless to humanity.  Without these stories the brightness and creativity leave the world.  Children no longer dream to be more than their station in life has given them.  In short everything is Khattam Shud.

      I got to thinking about the subject that we were talking about the comparison between slavery and the Tempest and how some think that it is not appropriate to relate these touching subjects to a work of art.  I would have to go the other way on that.  I don't know if it is because I am a history major or not, but I find it rather natural to compare these thing and in many situations the creator of some piece of art is in reality alluding to these subjects.  So do we blame the artist that created something that makes a statement on a controversial subject or do we blame the observer who realizes that he or she may actually be making that statement.  I also find it entertaining that many of the people that think that this kind of behavior is inappropriate have never gone through the kind of trauma that the subject is about.  This makes me think that, while I understand there compassion for the situation, they really do not have that much more of a right to pretend like they know about what these people went through.  Sometimes it seems like they are only fighting for this because because it is socially acceptable, only to look compassionate in the presence of their peers.  I think that historical analyses of works of art is an intelligent way to go about looking at all things.  It is not being encompassing but a way to talk about difficult situations and try to make sense of them.  Many of the people that have gone through those situations have gone on to make comparisons between stories and their real life plight so others should be able to as well.  It is a learning tool.  Plus not talking about these things is to silence the voices that were actually a part of them.  What I have learned from history is that people are inevitably cruel to each other and it usually gets worse before it gets better.  If we do not talk about these historical situations then we do not learn from them.  Just like with Shakespeare not having to experience the things that he wrote to make them authentic,  a person reading about a touchy subject or a comparison between that touchy subject and a work of art should be able to look at a situation that he was not involved in and form an opinion about it without there being any inference of malice.

      I have started Shakespeare's Tempest.  So far, once you get over the language that is used, it is a pretty fun read.  The story within the story is a fun aspect of this play.  Just as prosperous brother Antonio ursurped the Dukedom of Milan from him, Prospero ursurped the island that he was exhiled to from Caliban.  Caliban in turn attempts to regain power of the island with the help of Stephano and Trinculo, as Antonio took power from Propero.  However, because of Prospero's magical abilities he has the power to foil this attempted coup and symbolically fix what before he had failed at.  This play is also a perfect example of stories that are not even true changing the lives of all the people around us.  Prospero arranges this ruse to regain the Dukedom of Milan.  The other players in the ruse have no idea that it is all just an illusion so they fall right into what Prospero really wants to accomplish.  Prospero uses a story basically to influence people and persuade them to make decisions that affect the real world.  The Tempest relates with Pale Fire in that they both also have the death and loss of  child theme.  When the ship "crashes" on the island King Alonso thinks that his son ferdinand was lost in the wreck and Ferdinand things the same of his father.  This leads both character to act in a completely different way than they would have if they would have known the truth, which also works for Prospero's needs.  The main theme of the novel so far is misdirection and Illusionment.  Both of these methods allow Prospero to get what he wants, just as stories can also change the direction our lives take us.

      Pale Fire is by far the hardest book I've come across in a long while.  Alexander Nabokov must have really enjoyed putting together this ruse for hi readers.  The title of Pale Fire comes from the Shakespeare play Timon of Athens.  It is a story of a professor by the name of Charles Kinbote.  He comes into possession of the poem Pale Fire written by John Shade whom he befriends before Shade's death.  Befriends is a loose term considering he actually was stalking the man.  Shades poem consists of the narration of his young life, the death or suicide of his daughter, and his philosophical interpretations of death after his daughters death.  The last part of the novel is Kinbote's vain attempt to analyze the poem.  It is mainly a difficult poem to read because I am not good at reading poetry, but otherwise it is a very complicated story overall.  Kinbote apparently hails from the Kingdom of Zenda of which he is king of.  Kinbote is an egocentric fool in my opinion.  He is always bad mouthing Shade's poem in his commentary mainly because the poem is not about him and his exhile from zenda.  Oddly enough though the only thing in the book that Kinbote is the poem.  When Shade is shot by Gradus who has mistakenly shot Shade instead of the Judge who put him in prison Kinbote's only worry is that the poem is safe.  Kinbote doesn't have the same skill as a poet as Shade so he has to live vicariously through Shade. The whole book is mainly about art, Narcissism, and Envy.  There is so much more this book that it would take another 50 reads to get an idea of what is really going on.  It seems that many of Nabokov's other novels would also shed light on Pale Fire as I read a essay on the internet that goes into comparisons between Lolita and Pale Fire.  He also uses many anagrams in his books such as Wordsmith and Goldsworth which are anagrams of a famous romantic poet and the author of "The Vicar of Wake Field"  Shade is also an anagram for Hades which is the Greek realm of death or the underworld.  All of these small things in Pale Fire make it a difficult read. One that would take me a very long time to get a full grasp of.  In someways I am honestly glad that I took this class in the summer that way I don't have to wrestle with this thing for a full semester : )

      The other day I was able to a impromptu recital of my Wallace Steven's poem.  I just started reciting it in a car with my friends on the way to a party.  It was kind of weird because they listened rather intently I cannot tell if it was because they were interested in it or if they just felt that something like poetry carries a certain air about it that requires you to listen or it seems like you are being rude or uncultured.  I tend to thing it was the latter because I feel that way about poetry.  I am not that into poetry but when it comes about I feel like I have to listen or it is being rude.  Poetry and a lot of other arts carry with them a status symbol to society.  While I think that it is kind of ridiculous I find myself feeling the same way.  I think that is the reaction I got in the car.  I am not regretful that I did it because the reaction was interesting.

      I had a crazy dream the other night.  I was in Las Vegas with my friends, or a Las Vegas type of place.  We were in a bar and there were dancers in it.  My girlfriend was there as well.  We were having a good time then the dancers started dancing with me.  This of course made me feel uncomfortable as my girlfriend was right there.  Unexplicably I started ball room danceing with them, i guess because at least that seemed a little more classy in the light of my girlfriend being right there.  Because of this, for some reason that i could never figure out the dancer fell in love with me right there and wanted to marry me and be with me forever.  If only ball room dancing would really do that I'd sign up today !!!  Anyway i refuse because of my feelings for my girlfriend.  Finally we were on our way leaving Vegas heading to the airport, but we were on foot and my girlfriend would not keep up with me.  She was just wandering about non-chalantly.  I spied a woman loading a gun in a unpopulated part of the airport that we were lost in and i ignored her, but as i went up stairs i saw her walking intendly toward security in a trench coat.  so i informed the police she had a guna nd they apprehended her.  Then i woke up.  Well thats it.  It was very odd and feel free to analyze my dream if you wish.  Maybe I need some serious help!!!  Or maybe never go to Vegas again!!

      Started reading Flannery O'Conner's, A Good Man is Hard to Find.  This is an interesting story.  The foreshadowing of the encounter with The Misfit is readily apparent at the beginning of the story.  The odd thing about the story is that the Misfit is a more interesting character than one would think from the beginning of the novel.  By the end one doesn't seem to hate the Misfit even though he is a murderer.  The family that encounters the Misfit seems more like the antagonists than him.  The children are little terrors that complain about everything.  The grandmother is a complaining self righteous woman who thinks she know what is good for everybody.  The Misfit is interesting because he has the same thoughts that many people do when they have a bad day, but his are more intense.  He believes he is being punished by god or fate far more than he ever deserved.  Many of us think this when we have a run of bad luck.  So we can identify with the Misfit.  You can also identify with the family but it is in a negative way as in "I've been annoyed by people like them before."  The most interesting paragraph to me in this story is on Page 33.  "Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead...and he shoudln't have done it.  He thrown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can-by killing somebody or burning down there house or doing some other meanness to him..."  This analyses of religion by the Misfit is a little the glass is half empty but i can see the logic within it, even though it is misguided.  If there is a better place waiting for us with jesus after this life then one would want to get to it as soon as possible, if there is not one might as well do crazy fun things to make the most of it.

      I have just started the Arabian Nights and I think it is a pretty interesting book.  It really gives a crazy insight into a little bit of middle eastern culture.  Many gender roles pop out of many of the stories in Arabian Nights.  Many times a woman's indescretion is at full blame for something that has gone wrong in these stories.  Like the reason for the whole story of Sharazad having to tell these stories to stay alive is because of the Kings wife cheating on him while he was out of town.  Now that I think about it, it is not only middle eastern culture but many cultures have stoies of women being evil and the cause of all things bad.  Otherwise this is the source of the interconnectedness of stories in my opinion.  Every story runs together with the next.  It is highly entertaining seeing how all the characters from all of these stories are realted in some way.  The extent of their relationships can be broad but the connection is undoubtedly there.  It gives a whole new meaning to "its a small world".  Sometimes, however, I do get frusterated because a stroy may not have come to its complete conclusion and Sharazad started a new one related to it.  You have to read farther ahead of course to get the end of the story seh started but i wanted the end sooner, because i'm impatient : )  Otherwise its a great read so far.

      I was able to observe a toddler speaking to himself.  My friend has a little boy by the name of Devon and he is about 2 years old and he is beginning to talk.  Its pretty entertaining.  Even though you can't understand him very well he seems so confidant in what he is saying.  He changes words he hears into little words of his own and of course most of the time they are out of context but that is to be expected.  He also mimics other people's speech.  His favorite word seems to be "no" this is of course because he gets told no all the time when he is getting into something he shouldn't be.  it is amazing though how fast they learn at such a young age.  He is able to sit and what cartoons and imitate them with a fairly good amount of accuracy.

      The poem I am to recite in class is Domination of Black by Wallace Stevens.  This poem reminds me of nights when i was a kid when I was walking home from my friend's house at dusk.  All of the sudden i would feel an unexplainable fear and I would begin running home.  It seems there is someone in a room thinking about things that make him uneasy.  The flames in the fire place are playing tricks in the room.  The flames also mimic the fall leaves swirling about out side of the room.  The whistling of the wind reminds the person in the of the shrill cry of peacocks.  Later in the poem the stars and planets themselves seem to bear down on the observer just as the darkness and leaves do.  All of this makes the person in the room uneasy and fearful.  This poem in my opinion is one of the best that I have read of Wallace.  It is a bit more clear or at least there seems to be a somewhat obvious setting.  I do not have a poetry reading mind so a concrete image in my head helps me understand what is happening more.  Many of Stevens' other poems are a bit too abstact for my liking.

      I have begun reading Haroun and the Sea of Stories and am almost finished with it.  I really enjoy this book so far.  It has a very Alice in Wonderland feel to it. Of course in class we have begun discussing the connections with the Wizard of OZ and The Arabian Nights as well.  I thought it also had a connection with the Iliad as well, what with the Gups waging war on the Chups over the abduction of Princess Batcheat.  The book gets a bit more interesting when you learn a bit more about Salman Rushdie himself.  Because of his writing of the Satanic verses a fatwa was declared on Rushdie.  A fatwa is a death sentence instilled on someone for performing blasphemy in the Muslim faith.  I'm sure there is more to this but from what I read  this is pretty much the gist of a fatwa.  Anyhow Rushdie fled to America.  He wrote Haroun and the Sea of Stories during this time.  This information leads one to a more interesting read of the book.  The Chups represent the silenced voice of the story teller and Khattam Shud represents any censorship of creativity.  The chup's are free to speak their mind after they are freed from Khattum Shud's influence.  This is possibly Salman Rushdie's wish for all people who are put under a veil of silence as he was.  This reading of Haroun leaves the story with a far more important air about it.  It is a perfect of example of a work of fiction that can impact society in a much more important way than what is on the surface of what is seemingly a childrens' novel.

      Northrop Frye's ideas in the Educated Imagination are very interesting.  Many of the ideas bring about things that I myself have not thought of before.  Showing that there are many things that I take for granted in my everyday life.  The idea that many of the things we look at in everyday life are constructs of humankind's own imagination is so very simple yet greatly over looked.  The idea that a weed is only known as a weed because man deemed it to be one is one example.  Here we have this plant growing and just trying to survive, just as any other more aesthetically pleasing plant, but it is destroyed because mankind has decided that the weed doesn't fit into the scheme of beauty.  The more amazing thing is that if man had gone the other way in its thinking and kept the "weed" as its symbol of natural beauty the world as a whole would be very different.  Conventional flowers not only symbolize beauty but they are symbols of love, happiness, joy, and sometimes mourning.  If man had used "weeds" as this symbol pictures and even the colors of the world would be drastically different.  Small children would learn to draw thistle weeds and dandelions instead of Roses and daisies.  Funerals and weddings would look much more drab to us.  Clothing would be designed differently.  Poetry would have different symbols in them as well, as many use plants and colors to get across a certain idea or emotion.  The First few chapters of Frye just make all these things more clear.  While it is mostly logical the way that humans have chosen there world around them it is very interesting to think of what could be with a small change in human perception.
