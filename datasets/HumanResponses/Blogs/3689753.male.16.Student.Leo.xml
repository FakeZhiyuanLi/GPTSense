      We're putting a lot of photos up on the website under gallery.  Scroll down and look for the pre-wilderness album.  We are not sure if we'll have any contact in the wilderness tomorrow so don't count on hearing from us for awhile.

      hey everyone! today we woke up early and were on the road at 7:00 to go to yellowstone. we drove for a long time today. we got all the way down to old faithful and it just pained me to not go to my grandparents ranch which is like 2 hours away. we had so much fun today! sarah and i sang a lot on the way there, which people either enjoyed or hated. oh well. we saw bison, elk, birds, and a little black blob which everyone said was a baby black bear (i didn't have my glasses on). we stopped at mcdonalds on the way back and got here at about 9:00pm. i showered and we are going to finish the movie we rented last night (gothica). tomorrow some people (including me!) are going to hike up a mountain which is close to here. it should be great! hope all is well to who ever reads this

      Today was wonderful and so much fun.  It was the first time I was in Wyoming and the first time I peed in the woods this trip.  It was a blast with everyone and seeing old faithful.  There were beautiful mountains and animals.  Also with Mcdonalds and ice cream it doesnt get much better. Tomorrow we are climbing a mountain.  No blisters today so hopefully I wont get them.  Hope everything is well in SC.

      Well we all made it to Montana and we're safe so you don't have to worry.  Pretty nice here, it rained a little but other than that the weather has been great.

      Well as usual Rachel is going nuts.  She's trying to get the ferret to respond to her high pitch screams.  Yeah....  Anyway people seem to actually want to do this blogging thing so I guess you'll be seeing a lot of the posts around the biographies.  It's all good.  I'll be sending more later.

      Well all is well here in Montana.  We just had a thunderstorm run through, but we didn't get all that much rain.  As you've probably heard, this morning I got sick on the airplane.  It's really beautiful out here, and now I'm just trying to get used to the time change.  We had dinner at what would have been my 900.  It was really weird and now we're all dead tired from the long day.  I don't know what we're doing tomorrow, but I guess we'll find out soon!!  ttyl.

      Yes, I'm cutting this one a little close.  Everything is packed.  But, I needed to set things up so that I can post updates.  So, here is the first one...just hours away from departure for Montana.

      Well I've spent a few days trying to get people to sign up to use this tool so they can make posts like this to their biography.  To no avail.  If you bump into any of them that don't have posts like this, yell at them for me.

      after hours of walter's undivided attention (not something everyone can say they have had, but all want) i have finally made myself a blog. i'm still not sure what a blog is because it sounds kind of like an animal but at least i have one now. see you all soon

      Well this is pretty cool that we can post stuff on here, and then people can read it!!  Even cooler about the whole audio thing...although I have yet to try that.  Well, I'm just at home now merely brainstorming about all the stuff that I need to find and obtain for this trip.  It's coming up pretty soon, and it sure is awfully exciting now, isn't it?  It'll be awesome, and all I have to worry about now is not forgetting anything.  I say overpack.  My luck will probably leave me without any underwear! lol.  Well good luck to everyone else as you go through this packing adventure!

      Today,  Walter and I were entertained by Sarah P concerning all of the neat things she purchased to look cool on the trail.  Later this afternoon is the final team meeting to assure that all are ready.  Then Team is free till 5:00 AM Tuesday.  We convene at the airport.  Let the adventure begin. :-)

      We're almost done packing all the gear for the trip, well the Doc is, nobody else has done any work. Hopefully we will have one more preparation day before heading out. I will redesign the template to integrate to the site and I hope to set up audio blogging when I get out.

      After eleven straight days in the woods, we have finally emerged for the most part unscathed.  Desperate craving pizza, we have elected to find the nearest joint in Bozeman.  Throughout this long trek many things have come to pass.  In the woods we have sampled squirrel, snake and trout.  We have gone without showers, some elected to use the 5 degree waterfall, but the rest of us held out.  More stories will be posted as time goes on but the most important thing is that all the research got done and our trip was a major success.  We would like to thank everybody that made this possible including our corporate sponsor, Accuweather.
