      Ok its been a week since my last entry, since then my birthday has come and gone, it was pretty disappointing., considering everyone I called was unable to hangout with me and my friend. On Saturday Alex and me tried having a Halo party where we gather our friends and a few X-boxes and play 4-8 player Halo. It took us several hours gather the people then 2 more in an attempt to find a second TV, which we never found. So Robby and I decided to play co-operative on the final two levels our friend Ashleigh chose that moment to tell us that she's pregnant. In the middle of blasting some Covenant scum she goes 'what would you guys say if I told you I was pregnant?' because of that comment I was shot by a grunt. We them proceeded to gather from her that her on-again-off-again boyfriend josh was NOT the father, but he doesn't know that, the fact that he would think he was almost surprised us as much as the fact that she was pregnant. She wouldn't tell us who the father was but she did say that she and josh were going to elope…in Mexico. She pent the rest of the night convincing us that she was actually pregnant but steered away from the topic of the father, and from us telling us that what she's doing to her boyfriend was wrong not telling him and letting him think the child was his, which is his only reason for marring her. This whole thing got me really depressed so I spent the next three days away from everyone thinking things over. Then Alex called and asked if I wanted to go for coffee, I told him I didn't want to see anyone because of Ashleigh. He then tells me that Phil overheard Josh, her boyfriend; say that it was all a JOKE! They made the whole thing up! She made it so convincing too. Saying that she couldn't go to her other friends 'cause they would tell her parents. And we believed her! I would have been ok with it if at the end of the night she had said "ha, ha just kidding" but no she kept it going and spinning her web of deceit, making it thicker and thicker. So in retaliation we're going to make a false abortion bill from some fake clinic and we're going to send it to her mom. Ha, ha paybacks a bitch…bitch. &nbsp;I found out today that the trip to Michigan's Adventure I've been planning with my People to People friends got cancelled because the people I was going to go with apparently don't want to pay 23 dollars to have a days worth of fun. Jerks. But that's more money I can spend on anime I guess. I mean these people raised 5000 dollars to go to Europe but can't seem to find the money for one day's amusement at a park. Well there's always people I can call and hangout with. I rented the DVD of Van Wilder it turns out I got the rated r version of the disk instead of the un-rated version. Apparently the difference involves the menus and the disk itself not the movie. I also rented the movie Resident Evil. But because I haven't played the game Alex and me are thinking about renting all the Resident Evil games and playing them in succession. Good news [adult swim] fans! The Venture Bros comes as a series to [adult swim] on August 7th at 11pm. Cant wait for it. That's it.

      Well today kinda sucked. ive been waking up to this weird bend over and the world spins feeling for the last couple of days and it sucks usually it goes away after noon but today its still with me. i just rode my bike to the malland when i was starting out i noricedthat the bike was handling wierd so i got off and found it was me that was handling funny. ya i bought the 2nd volume of  Rebirth  manga and the 1st disk of  Tenchi Muyo GXP and i think partially because of this head thingy im really depressed, or it might be that ive been thinking of this girl.*sigh* i met her on this student ambassador trip to the Mediterranean. shes, well i can't acuratly describe her, she likes vampires, especially the Anne Rice kind, and anime, which is awsome cause most of the girls i meet dont know what anime is, and she is just like, wow. any way everyone that went on the trip is from the west michigan area and she lives close to me, like real close. and i was hopeing to meet her at Barnes&Noble, well my friends coming over so i guess ill go read some jokes to try and cheer me up till he gets here.
