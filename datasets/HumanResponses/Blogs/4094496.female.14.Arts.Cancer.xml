          This is my approach to a whole different blog. I like this one better because it's more private. My name is Madeline, I am 14 years old, and I would like to become a musician, writer, or businesswoman, but I'm not sure because I am at a very confusing stage of my life right now.

						    I just read a Kleenex box which said the world population has grown from 1 billion in the 1800s to 6 billion now. I find that pretty odd, because whenever you read old books, its seems all the families have 6 children or so! But after a few seconds, I realized that, actually, people now live longer and children don't die as often. Stupid technologies in hospitals! Now I can never live alone without anyone near me. I think I'll research Switzerland or Austria real quick and see how much room they have...

						     I do not very much feel like writing after doing so so many times today, but I feel I must, especially since this is my first entry. I feel I must introuduce myself...   My name is Madeline Anne Horan. Most people wouldn't give out this sort of information, but I am proud of my name and I feel quite secure...I would like everyone to know my name. I would like to grow up and compose or write something so wonderful that people hundreds of years from now will still know my name...I don't like my last name but at least my first name, Madeline, sounds a bit elegant, no? I am living in this present time, 2004, but I was born at the wrong time, my body craves for the 1700s-1800s, to live in the times of romance and art. My heart craves for the special love so rare in our society, full of sluts and low-lives who can't even imagine what real love is-they know love as looks and money. My soul craves for the smell of real food, the sound of real music, and the sights of the real world, the real flowers in the pasture, the mountains untouched, the valleys unbuilt on. I hate all these buildings, all of these man-made lakes, man-made clouds, even! I want to see the world as it was supposed to be, before those natural beauties were destroyed by selfish man who love tall buildings to show off their wealth.   My name is Madeline, and I am a musician, writer, reader, inventor, lover, thinker, and dreamer.   When I grow up, I will decide what I want for myself, how I want to live. as U2 sings, "She's going to dream up the world she wants to live in...she's going to dream out loud."

						      Welp. I live on the same long street as Andrew Callaway so of course that has it's disadvantages and advantages. Today, that was an advantage because he decided to have like 10 guys over-those jocky people like Thomas Bullock and Gunner Delay-and I was still in my bikini when I got home. Well, I was about to go out in the middle of the street and yell MAHA to scare them, cause I hate them, but then my dog ran out. I couldn't just run out there in my bikini because my dog ran out-too obvious-so I had to change, but quickly so my dog doesn't get abused by them-and I ended up wearing the ugliest outfit EVER.    I did find out they don't know my name. "Bye Andrews-next-girlfriend...uh....Samantha?..Come back!"      Stupid bastards. I think I'll let my dog attack them next time.

						     I always carry my school picture from 6th grade in my purse. I looked  so beautiful  back then. I had long brown hair, much lighter than it is now, my skin looked tan in all the right places, my face was clear, my eyes were open just enough, and I was much skinnier. As Josh's mom would say, "You get prettier and prettier every day!" But that is not true, because after that, I wasn't a child anymore, and I turned into something hideous, pale, and acne-friendly.    I always carry my school picture from 6th grade, for something I was.

						      In France there is this bookshop were Shakespeare used to write and students can work at this bookshop and live there for free if they help out. I think I'd like to live there and look out the window all day, watching people in black walk by and figure out each of their personalities.

						      Would I like a "Partner" when I grow up? As in boyfriend, you mean? No. To live with. HECK, NO! I mean, we're living in the middle of nowhere, think of it? Yeah, he could rape me, maybe?    Okay, even if he wasn't an insane raping guy, I wouldn't. Even if I was    madly  in love with him. Because I decided that I will never have a boyfriend again, realizing that all guys are not worth it and they just don't fall in love like they say they do.    "It's cold." Well, I'll have my Maine Coon kitty to warm me up if a blanket won't satisfy me.    Trust me, I'm an extreme introvert, I don't need or really want people, and I want absolute solitude and an understand kitty with me. Oh, and the piano. Violin, perhaps? You know, Mozart wrote some of his best music locked up in a castle. (Not that I could ever write quite that well.)    MAYBE if the guy was Kyle, because I have a  vivid understanding  of how different he is from, well, everyone. He thinks much differently and more intelligently, and I believe that he could very well  fall in love  because of that.     Now that's settled. I watched "Girl with a Pearl Earring" last night. I liked the movie-partially because of the camera, which I believe makes all the difference. I read "Elske" this summer which had the painting on it. Oh, my gosh. At first I didn't think so, but later on in the movie you'll notice what a great job they did hiring the actress because she looks  exactly like the painting.  It was weird. I also enjoyed the movie because of the fabulous set they created of the 1800s, even if most of it was in a house, but it had a very pretty...garden (?) and house.     I was humored today when Mrs. Ellezian said, "In 9th grade Lori did drill team...madness..." It was very funny because of her accent and it's SO TRUE! It is very mad. Mrs. Ellezian won't admit that she thinks drill team is retarded, but you can tell she does. Haha.       Hum, Courtney inspired me to make a rough draft of what my schedule could be in high school. *Note-subject to change dramatically.* Wait. WTF. I'll just put the electives. The core classes are very undecided and half of them I don't even know the definention of.   My High School Schedule!   9th Grade  Orchestra * Journalism 1 (Because they're nothing better.) P.E. (ONLY because it's required.)   10th Grade  Orchestra * French 1 (I don't care if colleges disapprove on that because I'm NOT going to live in America.  I've done Spanish unwillingly, -same with German-, and it sucks. And French is a beautiful language. Too bad they don't offer Italian, though-most Switzerland uses that.) PE/Health   11th Grade  Orchestra *  French 11 Pre-AP Debate 1   12th Grade  Orchestra*  French 111 Pre-AP (Maybe I can go to France again, but this time I'll have an idea of what people are saying! -Sneaky American-.) Music Theory AP (Mrs. Ellezian said this will be difficult, but I can do it! :P)  Okay, this required crap like PE, Health, and Oral Communications is gay. I'm going to go find the governor and give him a talk soon. (Hey! That will look good on college.)  Okay, what's with this lack of creative writing or poetry classes? This is very upsetting! After each year of winning the Writing and Reading awards at CTK, and getting in the Arkansas Catholic for my essays, and reading for the church because of my wonderful reading abilities, and writing the essay for the Veteran thing, I am insulted!  This school system sucks.

						       There are so many hateful people in this world!       Du's quitting orchestra, so who would the Kaundarts hang out with? I think Northside is one of their biggest mistakes. I really hope they don't quit-they aren't talented, but they're good, and really-journalism over orchestra?      Mozart composed at the age of 5. A terribly good song, too. How I envy him! It really puts you down to hear all this, because it makes me feel that I will never be a great composer. Cross that, I will never be famous. Or terribly good.      Not that I want to be famous. I don't want to be rich or powerful. I just want to be  known.             I don't understand why everyone uses Xanga. It looks messy and what most people do is state their day, without any details! Like, "Went to McDonalds...went shopping...went home...", It makes me feel intelligent to read theirs. Even Du's is dumb, of all people!           I can't think of anything interesting to say.

						      I woke up into a dusty brown room inside my wooden house. After looking out the window with hills of green, I got out of bed and walked into my den to my black grand piano. (Although the wooden floors were harsh and nailed crookedly, my feet didn't hurt because of the calluses developed from walked foot-naked for so many years.) The piano, my companion, the extension of me, shined from the sun, and the sunlight coming in through the window let the dust dance to my music as I played "Noctourne" by Chopin. Once I got to the Climax of the song, I was interrupted by my black kitty...

						      There are so many CTK memories and fads that I had forgotten about until just now when I talked to Tin...    Okay, I will have no problem about worrying about falling in love with any guys next year. I just looked at the yearbook and the only smart ones are like Cliff, Patrick, Grey, and all them, but I just couldn't see myself with them. I guess I don't know them well enough or something...sure, I went to Euper Lane with them until 3rd grade, but I doubt them remembering me, except Grey, that is.    In 3rd grade at Euper Lane we had to keep journals, and I remember how Grey would always try to imitate my entries! He was really smart, though. I don't think he really needed to in order to become a good writer, hey, he's really nice. I think he should be voted nicest. Him and Danielle Dudding or Lyhn Duong. Lyhn is  very  nice. Crap! I forgot about her very existence this summer and I had sat with her. That's pretty darn sad.    Okay, at times, I can be very disciplined and a pretty good actor. For example, I had given up junk food/Coke in 5th grade for Lent, and I KEPT IT! I've also gone up and down that hill 18 times before, so I can be good.    So I just need to make sure I am as much like Courtney Peterson or something as possible next year, nice but not as talkative as I usually am. (At Christ the King, people would always comment, "You talk a lot!" Plus, everyone kept making fun of me because of my 'stupid stories' at camp, but at least I don't talk about Surge trucks.) I absolutely cannot daydream! This can be more easily done without Kyle to distract me, but that does not mean I do not have memories. Memories haunt me forever, all I ever do is remember things.    It's so weird...memories...    They're gone forever! (Okay, this is getting cliche here) but to think of "Too bad it's over" as a memory, in one day, already...    Wow, Kyle is a  genius  to think of that. If he thought of it like that, it is. Of course, he did win the science fair with a microbiology project, but still his sister said that their dad is a chemist so that would help.

						    I wonder if Kyle ever thinks of me, and I wonder what he thinks. Candace has overheard a conversation from him, once:   Matthew: Now Madeline likes me, too.   Kyle (sarcastically): Isn't it GREAT?   Of course, Candace could easily be making it up. Funny she didn't mention it for such a long time, right?   Brendon Kelly could be lying, also, when he said Kyle said he had a girlfriend because Racha got her friend Erica to ask him if he had a girlfriend and he said no.   Well, I'm pretty, or very certain, he doesn't like me.   Or he could, secretly...   Countless times I've seen him look at me with all admiration, but more me watching him than him watching me. But gosh, he's so wonderful! Such a musician! Such a great student! I loved the mock trials, I wasn't really sure what he said in his speech, but he did pound that podium with force as he made sure to exaggerate his point.    I can't quite understand why I like him.   Okay, I've only liked 2 people-Josh Bowen and Kyle Peterson. No matter how hard I try, I cannot seem to like Matthew in or as much as I like (d?) Kyle. I cannot cry over Matthew because of absense of conversation on Valentine's Day or I cannot get butterflies in my stomach at the sound of his name.    I do understand Kyle in a way, because I was Kyle once and I still am sometimes, I just hide it very well. My mother has gotten me to change that, through constant lectures and reminders on the importance of fitting in. Kyle's mom must be much smarter, though, not seeing that as a priority.    But I've been in the bus on trips where he has sat by himself, countless times, and I've seen his desperate attempts to not look as lonely and left out as he feels, tapping Matthew's shoulder to pretend to make some interesting conversation. Julia told me she had lunch C with him once and she saw him sit by himself and look around as if he was waiting for someone.    But maybe, in a way, we are secretly going out, we secretly adore each other. We secretly will not allow ourselves to like anyone else but another because we are so in love with each other, but our age differences simply will not allow ourselves to completely admit it.    Our eyes reassure another, as we speak over something, (but we don't really know what), our eyes look into another and we tell our love into anothers eyes. I cannot even begin to say how many times he's looked at me, how many times he has studied me. Each day at Chaffin I lived to have my eyes breathe into his...I don't care what people think! How can they think he's ugly? How? Such a stereotyped society, I believe what most people think are the most ugly are the most beautiful, the most deformed are the smartest. Can no one else notice what beautiful eyes Kyle has beneath those eyebrows? Can they not notice how he trembles right before a solo, no matter how he pretends hes not nervous?       There is deeper meaning to, "Too bad it's over," than anyone else than Kyle and I will ever know. But truly, there is no end.

						       I've gotten to the point where I cannot even understand myself. I have definently been very hormonal these last few weeks, I dare say.      My emotions are a yo-yo, as Shelly from that diary would say.          And now my breasts hurt to top it off. And other 'hormonal' crap happens at just the  most-convient-times.          I hate being a woman sometimes.

						       Jazz Improv for Strings Camp is over. But it's not only that.         I had my long-lost, always-there, best-friend Michele come to my concert last night. I was suprised to find that about 250 people or more people can only take up that small portion of the theater. I expected it to look more crowded, but oh well. Less people makes you less nervous.     The two guys by me can't play crap. I got totally lost in "Girl from Ipanema" because each of them were playing something totally different and I couldn't hear where Mrs. Jeter was in the piece.     I think I looked really cute. I wore a blue shirt with a blue frilly skirt that said 'Bonjour" from Abercrombie but this lady, after the show, told me that I should wear a longer skirt next time because you could 'see my underwear' but Michele said you totally could not. Stupid old lady. Probably Kyle's mom or something. (Oh, Abercrombie is going out of business now! Where am I going to shop?? All the other stores clothes suck. Buckles just ugly/expensive, American Eagle just has polo and tees w/ words on it, Vanity/Rue 21 are just cheap-their clothes will either fall apart or get holes in them, Gadzooks is like gothic, and Aeropostale is just plain ugly. And childish. Oh, but we're getting a Hollister, but everything I've seen from there looks just like American Eagle. So GREAT.) I curled my ends of my hair, also. Just for Matthew!     About that. I got Michele after the show and said I had some 'business' to do and Matthew and Mitchell were walking and I said bye and have a good time in high school. Then, because James was saying Matthew was mean but I said he was the sweetest guy I know the day before, I said, "What am I going to do without my sweet Matthew?" And you know what he said? "I dunno." WHAT? COME ON! ! ! ! ANYTHING BUT I DON'T KNOW! That is the worst thing he could've possibly said. I wanted to shot him. What the heck?     Plus, when the alumni or other combos came up on stage, our 'Watermelon Man' combo had to sit in the audience and each time Blake sat by me which I found kind of odd. I hope he doesn't like me. I rather think of him as a friend. More fun that way.     Okay, I do  not  get Kyle at all. After the show he said, "Good job" to me for no apparent reason, (My improv sucked by the way. I'm so not doing that again.) but I said he did better. Later on, I went back in to tell Mr. Pinkston about me getting in the high school orchestra camp so he would not allow Allison (I HATE HER!) to get a higher chair than me, and Kyle walked by and said something but I didn't know what so I interrupted Mr. Pinkston and said, "What?" and Kyle just gave me a longing glare and turned around and walked off. I was like wtf. Also, earlier that day, (I looked cute then too.) we had to sit in a circle in dim light to 'talk about the show' and who was across from me but him? And so he kept LOOKING at me and so I couldn't look straight from me because of that awkwardness. And plus, his SISTER kept looking at me WHILE SHE WAS PLAYING SOLO! I was like omg. What's wrong with his family?  Anyway, after that we went outside to figure out what we were doing and Kyle kept looking at me again. But he HATES me. So like what the heck.     Oh, I whispered to Michele to look at a big lady in blue. (Who was Mrs. Kaundart.) We both started cracking up and I think she knows it was about us because she walked by when we started cracking up but I didn't tell Michele who it was. Then, after the awards were given out, Mrs. Kaundart saw my flowers and asked if she could have them and who gave them to me and crap. Oh my gawd. When she found out that I had cake her eyes got really big. lol Then she said, "Now, who are you?" To Michele and I explained to  her that Michele was my long lost best friend from Trinity and Mrs. Kaundart said she was my journalism teacher and you should've seen Michele! She had so much trouble not laughing...anyway Mrs. Kaundart said to Michele, "Well, anything bad you've heard about me from her isn't true." And I was like crap!  lol     Anyway, afterwards Michele and I went to Eddie's, then home...then we went to see Little Black Notebook. That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was confusing, too fast, and just stupid. And Brittany Murphy is way too skinny. And every two seconds in the movie she'd go from totally pale to tan, and vice versa. Kenny kept calling Michele during the movie so I yelled, "GOSH! WHO'S CELL PHONE KEPT GOING OFF?" and everyone laughed cause it was obviously Michele's. (Michele's dad had a heartache!)     :Gasp!: I'm FREE! ! ! I'm free, I'm free, I'm free! No more dressing up. (Except for my mother gawd.) No more impressing guys. No more Matthew, no more Kyle! I can't like anyone anymore! I'm freee....     No more straightening my hair! No more curling it! No more foundation, no more shopping for cute clothes to impress them. No moreee...      In a way, that sucks.     I mean. It's over. Forever. There will never be another time when I will be with those Chaffin people, and we will never be in that same group again. By the time I get to high school, they will all be driving and having tons of bfs/gfs, and they'll already be getting ready for college. And the Kaundarts won't even be at my high school.     I was so mesmorized last night by this. I just kept staring at the ceiling in my room, trying to let it all settle in my head. Matthew does not like me. Kyle doesn't want to forget. I will never be in that same orchestra again, the experience is now a memory. As Matthew said, yesterday, "Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives." I will now become this woman who will only dwell on my future and never on the present. I don't live in this time. I'm always preparing, never enjoying the moment. Except when I play, that is. I have a baby sister. That is hard to belive, also. But, after this long year...this orchestra...I've gotten to know everyone so well, and now that I'm beginning to fit in with the now sophmores, they're leaving. Already they've grown into the high-school selves. Matthew was really nice to me, but once the concert ended, so did his personality. He was suddenly serious. I even saw him  driving.  "Too bad it's over."     I will be forgotten.

						     I am  so tired  of my mom caring more about my popularity than my studies and violin. For example, we went shopping today for 4 hours to go look for an outfit for the concert tomorrow and she made me try on almost ALL of Abercrombie and Fitch's clothes. Once, I said, "You know...I just need jeans, really" and she got all mad and told me that all I did this year was wear jeans and look like crap and she wants me to dress up at LEAST once every 2 weeks. That made me very frustrated...   And this shirt she said was coming in style...looked like a freaking pajama shirt! And she said, "Do you like it? Yes or no?" and I said NO and she got all mad at me.    Like wtf.    Plus, I have to improvise tomorrow. In front of at least 250 people. Oh, my gosh, I'm already shaking.    Someone shoot me please.     PLUS! !! !  TOMORROW! LAST DAY TO SEE MATTHEW! I'm cursed!

						      I belive in black and white photos, in classical music, in true love, in secrets, in talent, in Beethoven...        You know how people believe in God?        Well, to me, Beethoven is a God. I don't care how wrong that is, but  he  was amazing, and I think that there's a Beethoven up there, somewhere, watching me like a 'guardian angel' and nodding his head at my accomplishments.        Seriously, I have learned the violin in a year and I'm already better than a lot of the people in 10th who have been playing for 4 years. I made the high school orchestra and I'm at a high school camp. I can already do vibrato, get  some  of my notes in tune, *haha*, and I have this wonderful violin.        Oh, I  loveeeee  my new violin. Actually, it's an old violin, but I just got it! I got it for my birthday along with an excellent, although pricey, bow. This violin is beautiful, (to me), very brown and it fades from color to color. Matthew said once, "Wow...it's straited but small...", which is rare and hard to find. It was made in 1813, although the dealer/my father think differently, and I just love it because of that. Sure, I'd like a shiny new violin without any nicks in it, but after I think about it, it's really cool to have an old one. I love thinking of a fiddler playing it in the cold during the Civil War in the cold weather or something...         I think of each nick as an important moment...and when I make them, it's like... I made a mark in time .           I love my bow, too. It doesn't sound nearly as scratchy, and it feels really great to play with it, like its floating across my strings. Beautiful, too.         Sigh...' I made a mark in time.'

						       I  have  to learn the lyrics to "Bows on Fire." Everyone keeps singing it!         Matthew sung today. He actually has a pretty voice when he's not talking.         Ha. I'm so proud of myself. I did that 'one thing, everyday, that  scares  you" and so I IMed my long lost love Josh just now:           i am just me: Hey        Bodaciousbowen: whos this?        Bodaciousbowen: ?        Bodaciousbowen: ?        i am just me x: Oh Madeline        Bodaciousbowen: oh hey        i am just me x: How are you?        Bodaciousbowen: good        Bodaciousbowen: how bout you?        i am just me x: I'm okayy        Bodaciousbowen: ill brb i gotta go eat        i am just me x: K

						      My back has hurt so much throughout my life to where my brain has learned to ignore the pain and I don't even know what it feels like to feel 'fine' anymore.     I better write down my plans for next year.      My Plans for Next Year   I will not poison myself with 'junk food' and Cokes.  I will not act silly.  I will not waste my time daydreaming or talking during class.  I will not talk during orchestra.  I will be very serious. (That's basically what I've said above.)  I will learn at least 5 vocabulary words a day for the SATS, and use them, also-whether in speech or writing.  I will practice my piano and violin for an hour each weekdays, and at least 2 hours each on the weekends.  I will not give up to procrastination.  I will be very disciplined in my studies...  I will try to read a book a week, if a hard classic, half a week.  I will not go on the computer or watch TV on weekdays unless its for educational purposes.  I will not settle for mediocrity.  I will get as much bonus points as possible, as recommended by Matthew.  On weekends, I may only spend 2 hours (maximum) in a leisure manner.  I will read the Sunday newspaper at least.  On the weekends, I will spend an hour devoting myself to musical theory, rhythms, and scales.  I will walk up and down the hill 20 times on Saturdays and Sundays.  I will not have a boyfriend until after college and I will not let myself like anyone except Kyle the Prodigy who does not need to be impressed and I won't have to worry about him liking me anyway.  I will not wear any eyemakeup.  Comfort over looks.  You never learn anything by talking.      I think that's it. But surely by tomorrow I'll think of something else I forgot.

						       Gah...so difficult...         Oh, Jazz Improv for Strings camp is wonderful. Kinda. Ughhhhh. Okay, we had to be in our 'combos' today, and I, being a year younger than I am supposed to any, signed up for the easiest piece, of course! (Watermelon Men.) Heck, I didn't know what a combo was! I was thinking it was an ensemble when I signed up for it. Anyway, it turns out you practice 'Watermelon Men' by Duke Ellington, I believe, as an excersise, then you IMPROVE from the G Blues Scale. And isn't it wonderful that I am in the group with the most people? So more people can here me?         I am not good about this improvise thing at all. I get really shaky, (and how can you blame me, with all those high schoolers judging me?? :coughhh: Like prodigy Kyle or Matthew?), and for some reason, at these times I cannot seem to get my notes in tune and it doesn't sound good at all. I mean, people like Kyle play and you'd think they're playing some fiddle or jazz song professionally. Me, and all you'll hear is some random notes that do NOT go with the background music.             Well, I had to, of course, in front of everyone...like 4 times...And isn't it oh-so FORTUNATE that I play the violin, the loudest and highest stringed instrument? Oh, and it was just terrific when I squeaked after 3 lousy notes.            Mr. Lane knows very well that I do not like this at all, but he says, "Good job, Madeline!" I know that he is only being extra nice because around Christmas my parents donated 2500 bucks to the orchestra fund instead of the church and he's hoping they'll donate more, but what's the point of him worrying about it when he's moving...in 2 WEEKS! ! ! Why is it that whenever I get a really great teacher, they leave after a year? Or leave the year before I come? Ugh.         I even told him that, and he said, "But you did really good!" and gave me a hug. How he lies!         Blake made me laugh, as always, today. Matthew was complaining about having to switch to cut time in all these jazz songs, (which is really hard to count!!!) but he was saying 'half time', not knowing his mistake so Blake got up and said, "Okay, I hate it, too. It's like in the middle of the song we all get up and scream, "WOO!!!! PIG SOOIE! ORCHESTRA!' " Silly Matthew didn't even get it for about 30 seconds.        Of course, my mom was like 30 minutes late picking me up and of course the Kaundarts decided it would be oh so wonderful to help out after class, being the perfectionist they are, and of course everyones mom's pick me up immediately. (BTW The Kaundarts keep talking about movies! Like they saw I Robot yesterday and The Village Friday and gah..you'd think that's all they ever do! And yet you never see them.) So of course they're mom is in the van watching me which kinda freaked me out and I just wanted to go HOME! That was really awkward but I did  not  want to say hello again to that witch so I pretended to count my music.        Hum, there's nothing to say really. But I believe I am getting musically smarter each day, and I'm glad I'm making myself go to this camp.         Oh, funny story though! See, we were talking about forms and rhythms, etc in songs and so we'd listen to a song and we'd go up to these posters with charts and you had to put your sticker on what you thought the song was. So Justin Spathe, being a bit...large, couldn't fit in the crowd and so he told me to put his sticker on the Chromatic part of this chart but I got pushed and accidently put his sticker on a Minor part, when the song was NOTHING  like it was minor. SO I couldn't get the sticker off and just kinda forgot about it. So after we did that, Mr. Bailey goes up there and he says, "Who thought this song was MINOR?" Everyone was quiet and snickering...like what an idiot! Who did that? And then Justin goes, "HEY! That's my sticker!" I had the hardest time not laughing...        I am sooo evil.        I think I'll go drink a coke and then I'll have to have my father help me improv.        Why are my posts so BORING lately?

						   I have so much willpower. For example, I have gone up and down that hill by my house, as in up and down counting as one time...eighteen times. Today, I have spent at least 8 hours playing the violin. I'm taking a break for the moment, but after this I'm going to go back and note more music.  I have found that if I sit down at a desk and note my music, I can make it look much better and concentrate. There's something about that which makes me hear the beats in my head, and I instinctively conduct myself with my hands. I feel so intelligent that way...so musical...wow, it's great. Although I hate highlighting my music as if I'm some retarted person who needs colors to read music, I still did because of all the key changes throughout the pieces.  This jazz camp has amazed me. I think I have improved myself musically so much these past two days. You see, rhythm and time, (which are pretty much the same thing), are my weaknesses in music. Same with improv, which is very discouraging to me because I used to compose awhile ago, but I find it much harder to do on the violin than on the piano. Also, composing is a totally different thing than improv...improv, you just make it up, right there, whereas you can play around with the notes and use various forms when composing. Still, I had composed a song on the piano in 4th grade, *and never since*, and I can still play it and I still love it. I even played it for the class once in 6th grade...however, I messed up of course because of my stage fright.  Oh, but I loved playing for them! I miss Christ the King dearly. There, we didn't know rich or poor, we didn't know what drugs and sex were, and we acted and lived as children should. At public schools, they cuss and drink, and they all have their little boyfriends fingering them when they are in 6th grade. At Christ the King, we thought it was a big deal to hold hands with someone, and that didn't even happen.  Anyway, at Christ the King, everyone knew about my dreams to be a pianist, and everyone heard me and knew my level very well. They all thought I was a tremendous player...in 4th grade, for the talent show, I played Canon in D and Bridget Wall cried. A few months or so later, we were listening to classical music in computer lab and Mrs. Cravens turned it up and said, "Now, what song is this?" Everyone replied, "Canon in D! The song Madeline played!" and she then said, "And do you know who the composer was?" And they did! "Pachbel, of course!" Whenever Mrs. Weisenfels would bring in the keyboard for music, everyone would beg me to play and once I played a Minuet and my friend Matthew, afterwards, looked up and said, "Wait...Madeline played that? I thought that was a CD!"  This story gets worse though...I haven't practiced, really, throughout my junior high years and I'm still on the same level as I was in 6th or 7th grade, which is now at a low level for my age and it will take awhile to catch up. I'm even better at the violin than at the piano now.  Still, I love playing music and I'm glad to tell anyone that I'm in orchestra. I don't care how "dorky" any airheads think it is, or how low on the social skill I am. In fact, I think being a geek is the way to go and I like myself and my friends. Sure, it would be cool to wear cute clothes, be a cheerleader, and have guys drool over me, but I know that's not going to happen and I would only want to be that for a day for the experience because I know those people aren't going anywhere in life, and they will continue to be airheads. Even cheerleaders who make good grades, because while they may get into a college, they won't go anywhere prestigous because colleges frown on cheerleading, athletics, art, and any other classes, but it has been proven that people who do music, particurually orchestra because stringed instruments are the most difficult, are smarter than the rest of the society and make the highest SAT scores. Think about the school...think about the smartest people there, and just think of what electives they're in. Orchestra. Which makes sense, because they'd be smart to join orchestra and you just wouldn't make it if you weren't extremely smart. Besides, I agree with Mr. Bailey when he says the music on the radio is junk-come on-the top 40 is either noise or it has very nasty lyrics. These artists just wear slutty clothes and lipsync. And they're  idols!   What is wrong with America? We have no cultured music, our teenagers think  rap  and  pop  is "music", and Mozart, one of the greatest composers ever, cd's are bought for 4 dollars at the most, but Britney Spears cd's are $20? I beg to differ!

						    Okay, no more stupid entries to take up space.   Hum. If I were a princess, this is what I would like to be like.   I would have long brown hair, green eyes, and I would be really skinny. Also, my name would be something pretty like Lila. Unlike what I do now, I would eat like a bird and do my best to keep my figure. I would wear green velvet bodice dresses and I would be very quiet. I would have a soft voice and I would speak surely and slowly. All the princes would want me for their Queen and I would be very flirtatious. I would have a private tutor who would teach me various languages, from Latin to French, and I would become very fluent. Also, I would study art, literature, and music.   I would walk slowly through the gardens...I think I would like to live at Versailles in France-it has a beautiful garden with rectangular blue ponds. However, I would become a great politician and make very smart decisions.      Okay, that was the suckiest thing I've even written. Gosh, everything I've been writing sucks today! Okay, time for me to get going...I really don't want to be half-asleep tomorrow, too. Bleh.

						       I'm going to be like everyone else and just state my day. At least it was sort of interesting. This Jazz Improv. for Strings camp is  hard.  It's not difficult as in playing ridiculously fast with tons of notes or having to change strings and positions a lot, or it's not so slow that, (most of the pieces, anyway), intonation is wrong and very obvious and it's hard to count BECAUSE it's so slow, but its difficult because of these weird beats with ties and weird rhythms are all over the place...and we have like 7-10 pieces and most of them are more than one page long, also.       Don Bailey doesn't let us clap/count, play pissacato, or play slowly before we play any of these pieces, also. He  makes us sightread them at the correct speed, and no mercy for us!       The second violins suck...its just Matthew, Allison, and these home-schooled people, and I'm here to say they have a lousy violin teacher because these people can't play anything! This morning this Logan guy seemed smart so I let him share my stand but he can't play very well at all and he's going into 11th! Plus, on the other side of me is the violas, so it's like I have to figure out it the whole time. It's wonderful that sightreading is my weakness. And ear training. Which is basically the camp.      Also, we have to IMPROVISE in front of EVERYONE which is horribly embarrassing and nerve-wracking. I didn't really want to play but Mr. Bailey made me, (that bastard!), and EVERYONE was listening, all 31 of them, and judging me. I was still shaking an hour later.       I was hoping Libby wouldn't be there but she was, but I went up to her and asked if she knew Michele Marsh from volunteering at the hospital. She didn't really, (haha), but I kind of changed my mind about her. I used to think she was horribly rude because of that tank top incident, but she was really nice this time. Probably because I'm the only girl she knows besides Sarah and Sarah is bi which kind of freaks me out. I mean, I found out at the end of the orchestra camp and I had been changing in front of her! :Shudders; Yeah, I'm horrible.      Hum, Matthew clearly  doesn't  like me, he's just really nice. The only 'special' thing that happened today was when Sarah was talking about Cameron dancing at camp when we played and Mitchell said, "God, that guy was annoying..." and Matthew said, "Hey, that's Madeline's friend!" but that's about it. But it's not really a loss, I guess, because I secretly knew he'd never like me and I don't know...I didn't like him as much as my two loves-Josh Bowen and Kyle Peterson. Don't ask about the latter, he can be horribly rude. But I'm afraid his life is a lonely one, if only he had more friends.      His fault though! His sister is really nice though...kind of weird. Like I was telling her I wanted to attend a college like Harvard and she was like, "Go for it!" She says those things a lot, I noticed. Not many high schoolers are like that.      In other news, Blake gave me a hug today and I didn't even ask him to. I love hugs. Especially from Blake, his is the best. He hugged me because all of us Chaffin people, (or retired Chaffin people, rather...the rest are sophmores) were trying to play ping pong, all ..10? of us but the other table had all the rackets so we just used our hands and all of us girls, except me, aimed for Blake and hit him about 10 times. Poor guy has a red bump between his eyebrows now! So he gave me a hug for not hitting him.      I dare say, it was a sweet hug, too.         Okay, enough details of my sad, corny little life.

						    Yes, I do realize that all of my posts are called 'Such a Darling World' but I made that up and for some reason I'm  way  too proud of that. And I like how that just kind of continues throughout my diary. (I'm sorry, but I hate using the terms 'journal' or 'blog.' They seem way too boyish and I believe anything I write in deserves a nice name. In fact, I recently named my old-fashioned paper journal Emily. So shot me.)   For some reason, my tendency to be oh-so-full of myself, because my father appreciates and encourages it, has made me think of Beethoven. There is a quote by him, which he said to his friend Prince Lichnowsky, (how I envy him!) which never seizes to humor me, "What you are, is by accident of birth; What I am, I created myself. There are, and have been, thousands, of princes...there is only one Beethoven." In fact, Beethoven is so amazing that I think I'll just go paste his biography in here to honor him. I also added in my own thoughts! This is, after all,  my  diary:   His Story Ludwig van Beethoven was born in December 1770. He was a serious little fellow,  fascinated  by music. Vienna was Europe's cultural capital. When Ludwig was 17-years-old he made his first trip to this city. He went to study classical music with   Franz Joseph  Haydn   . *Wow!* While in Vienna, Beethoven played the piano for         Mozart    . Mozart told him, " You will make a big noise in the world".  That year his mother and baby sister died, and Ludwig's father lost his job. He returned to Bonn and supported his family for 5 years, until his fa ther's death, then Beethoven brought his "bigger-than-life" personality back to Vienna for good. He was an unkept,  awkward,  (very much like me), brash, and very, very  self-confident  (my role model!) young man. Ludwig easily made his place as both a  performer  and a  composer.  Sometimes he was rude and violent, other times he was kind and generous. He threw hot food at a waiter. He hit a choir boy. He swept candles off a piano during a bad performance. (Mwah-ha-ha.) Ludwig van Beethoven's intensity caused a bitter custody battle over his nephew. To escape the fighting, the nephew actually tried to take his own life. Beethoven was kindhearted however, and he helped raise money for     Johann Sebastian Bach's       only surviving child, who was living in poverty. He donated new compositions for a benefit concert in aid of Ursuline nuns. (So he basically knew the 3 greatest composers in the world...Bach, Mozart...and himself.) Ludwig van Beethoven was 25-years-old when he first performed as a  piano virtuoso . He was supposed to play his own Second Piano Concerto. Two days before the performance Beethoven hadn't finished composing it. He was sick with an upset stomach. A friend fed him remedies while Ludwig wrote out the music. The copyists (people who made the orchestra's music copies) sat outside his bedroom waiting for each new sheet of music. Beethoven seemed often to work down to the last minute. (Tisk, tisk. As they say, "Procrastination is the killer of time." Not that I don't procrastinate. I'm probably one of the worst there is.) On the morning of the concert for the   oratorio  , Christ on the Mount of Olives, a friend found Ludwig sitting in bed composing the   trombone   part. The trombonists rehearsed from Beethoven's handwritten music at 8 a.m. that day.  The ink was barely dry.  (What a wonderful line to describe how he had just finished!)       Beethoven's Friends Despite his difficult behaviour, Beethoven made friends easily. (Of course! I would be his friend anyday. He sounds terribly interesting.) He was  admired  and  respected  for the wonderful music he created. (My role model, again!)      Franz Joseph Haydn   (Another famous and great composer!) was his piano teacher for a very short time. The student/teacher relationship didn't work for them, but friendship did. (Just like me...I spend more time talking to Mrs. Ellezian about her past Russian life than actually learning, which very well explains the easy level I'm on. That and her particularality.)    Antonio Salieri was   Mozart's   rival, and Beethoven's friend. Ludwig dedicated 3 violin sonatas to Salieri. *That's disturbing.* (Do you know about the rumour that Antonio Salieri poisoned Mozart?) (HOW DARE HIM!)    Beethoven lived in the home of  Prince Lichnowsky  (I am  GREEN  with envy.) for awhile. Prince Lichnowsky was a musician who studied and played Ludwig's new piano sonatas. He paid for the publishing of Beethoven's Opus 1.    Johann Nepomuk Malzel, the "Court Mechanician", also became Ludwig's friend. Malzel invented the musical chronometer. ( I hate him .) It was refined to the   metronome  . (A metronome ticks at a specific pace to guide the musician's tempo or speed.) Beethoven loved the chronometer and even composed a little canon to the words "Ta ta ta lieber lieber Malzel." (I'm starting to belive Beethoven was gay...Just kidding!!!)    Beethoven was very popular with the ladies. (Of course!) He never married, but he dedicated some of his music to the women in his life:  Moonlight Sonata  (that angry song is so fun to play! but difficult) and Fur Elise, (easy. Alex lies.)  for example. (I know! ! ! I always wanted a boyfriend to do that...Beethoven is so inspirational...I love that song! And the sweet words.."Fur Elise.". In fact, my sister named a dog a long time ago Elise, but she wasn't thinking of that dangit!)       There is only one Beethoven.    To Ludwig van Beethoven, respect was more important than friendship. A person's position did not matter to him. (Haha! My idol! My role model! I want to be him! *I'm so evil.*)     Composers and musicians were considered the servants of nobility . Beethoven's fiercely independent spirit challenged that thinking. He said, "It is good to move among the aristocracy, but it is first necessary to make them respect."    Here are two incidents that show the strength of Ludwig's convictions.    A nobleman once talked during a performance. Beethoven stopped playing and declared, "For such pigs, I do not play!" (YES!)    He would say to the face of a prince and benefactor,"What you are, is by accident of birth; What I am, I created myself.There are, and have been, thousands, of princes;There is only one Beethoven."    He lacked tact, but he argued a great truth.       There is also only one of you .What are you creating with yourself? (I think I'll put that on my profile.)       Beethoven's Heartache    At only 28 years old, just before writing his very first symphony, Beethoven began to lose his hearing. (Me, too. Those stupid headphones!) He tried every treatment he could find to fix this problem. Sometimes he could hear just fine. The last 10 years of Beethoven's life, he heard nothing. Beethoven sadly and bitterly mourned the loss of his hearing.    He continued to lead rehearsals and play the piano until he was 44 years old. Ludwig may have "heard" music by feeling its vibrations. He knew music so well he could probably hear it in his head. (Bah...)    The older Ludwig got, the more absorbed he became in his music. He was so focused that he didn't care at all about how he looked. (Yes!) He would pour water over his head instead of actually washing. In his rooms sat 4 pianos without legs and piles of manuscripts that no one was allowed to touch.. To feel the vibrations better, Beethoven composed music seated on the floor at a legless piano. He often worked in his underwear, or even naked. (Oh, dear.) If friends came to visit him when he was composing, he completely ignored them. (Take that! Just kidding..)      I'm not going to copy the rest except "The last words Beethoven spoke were, ‚ÄúI shall hear in Heaven.‚Äù' Because my mother just HAS to get on since the baby is asleep. Anyway, my dear friend Courtney, I was at the lake yesterday and I just sat in the recliner the whole time and wrote in my diary. I didn't even notice everyone leave to go on the boat until it was nearly the time for them to get back. Of course, everyone just HAD to read it my diary, but I didn't let them. My precious words aren't always for the eyes to see, but I'll let you see them. Oh, and camp's tomorrow gahhh and I believe, according to Candace, (I went to the mall with her today and got a forest green shirt, just like a princess!) Matthew knows that I like him, but he only knew in the middle of the year I think. I must go, my mother the beast has to get on the computer but she can't even figure out how to get on MSN of course. (Yes, I'm horrible.) Night.       PS. Thanks for what you wrote in your diary! It was very nice and I felt flattered. I'm glad I found such a great friend, finally.

That is Switzerland and that is one of the closest things I've seen to how I want to live...but I will live in some valley deeper, prettier, and even a darker, longer grass will grow.
