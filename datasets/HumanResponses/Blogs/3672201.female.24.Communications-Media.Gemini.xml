       * All-out honesty with yourself and others * Practice saying how you feel * Be free to express yourself in authentic ways * Love yourself deeply and truly * Confront issues inside and outside of yourself * Complete what you've started * Keep your word to yourself and to others * Embrace trials of all kinds; choose to see God in the midst of them. Discover and learn the lessons he's trying to teach you * Maintain and be true to your commitments * Learn to stand alone(find your true identity), then learn to stand with people * Have courage and advance fearlessly.--B. Girl

      Things are getting pretty crazy around here. Been doing some last minute packing before heading out to Chicago very early tomorrow morning to spend time with my father.  Thanks for the prayers.  They are availing much.  I do not know the frequency with which I will be posting while I'm gone. Might be daily. Might not.  But I shall return soon. Be safe!

      Ah man! Have you come across my mom's comment under the african women poem? lol. I completely adore her.  She reminds me to commune with that little girl within me.  In a world where young people are trying so hard to be grown, wanting to grow up so fast, I am learning to welcome my inner child to this enormous space of womanhood.  Actually, my inner child is one of my biggest inspirations.  Some of her memories give me hope (wings to fly)...Like, I remember that little girl who was not shy to battle grown-ups in the middle of the dance floor at birthday parties. And they got served every-single-time. I want back that kind of freedom...lol...freedom is too expensive now-a-days so people don't go after it. They're not willing to pay the price...well, I am. I'm counting the cost and going for it--whatever "it" is. oh, back to the topic at hand,(lol) I remember that little girl who walked around with a bookbag full of literature(still do, ha!), always had a notebook with pen (still do too), and passionately memorized quotes/poems by her favorite authors and poets (yup, still do this too). I would walk around quoting Gwendolyn Brooks (first poet I was introduced to in 3rd grade), Ralph Emerson, Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Henry Thoreau, and other favorites, to my friends (who did not understand them; I would try to explain the words, and when they still didn't get them, I'd become frustrated--as if we weren't kids. lol). I would recite them to grown-ups who always appeared to be in awe; and certainly I quoted them to myself...you would've thought I was crazy. And people probably did! lol. But even as a young girl, I just genuinely loved the art...I respect it...indeed, God gave it to me as gift. I remember how when my friends were eager to go out and do "fun stuff", I deeply desired to be stuck in a corner reading...and the weird thing was, I found excitement and joy in it. lol. I didn't want much of anything else. But I would go out and sometimes be miserable (people-pleasing)because I did not want to endure the comments about my strange love-life with words. Basically, I was weird (still am, but I celebrate it now fully) because I grew up in an environment and a culture where people did not value the "peculiar" devotion I had to learning. See, I remember...and those memories got me here....right now.... at three something in the morning...fully awake...writing....sometimes words hold me together. And as you can see, they keep me UP too.:)  Thanks mother, for reminding me that that little girl is still here with me today. And oh yeah, for those of you who have kids, work with kids, or are around kids enough to influence them, please introduce them to different kinds of literature.  Especially, children in the urban communities because unfortunately, their world starts and ends right where they are. A lot of these kids are not fortunate enough to travel. Well, a book can transport you to destinations unknown. Teach them to expand their world through reading. But first, you've got to check you... make sure you read. One cannot truly succeed at teaching what he/she is not living. If you try to, you won't be able to live with or answer the questions. Selah. Blogging off....B.Girl.

      Just sharing a few sentences. (Imagine what this man does to me)...haha...  "I need You waaayyyy more than a casual affair You seduce the wind to move me My spirit soars to the realm that I can recognize Your voice."  ... There is no love more amazing than God's. And, it  is  real! -B.Girl

      A random thought:..If love was a spew of colors, it would be black, white, red, blue, green, pink, gray...  It would be black because it's bold and definitive, solid, and can go with anything.  It would be white because it's pure and celestial and accepting.  It would be red because love gives you courage; love is fire with an eternal flame. Blue because its vastness links my mind to a blue sea, peaceful, calm but sometimes chaotic. It would be green because in love we are constantly evolving. Pink because love is sensitive and nurturing. Yellow because love lights me up like the sun.  I stay shining and beaming for no apparent reason. And gray because sometimes love is filled with compassion and sorrow. And truth is, sometimes it hurts though it might not mean to.  -B.Girl

      Well, since he asked...big shout out my homeboy Jason Reynolds--that literary Prince. I appreciate the love man. Thanks for sharing the poem. I hear you! Told you...  If Christ was a young poet you'd be his voice yes, that messianic voice that be resurrecting the spiritually dead that healing voice that makes crippled minds walk that power.full voice that rearranges mountains by questioning their stance And direct lost stars to find their their path You bring light to our troubled world And God... well, he spits abundant life through you.  ....Write on!

      Sometimes life throws things unexpected at us. Whether it's an illness of you or a loved one. Financial emptiness. Emotional ruts. Job loss. Relationship stress. Injustice. Or the like, we have to position ourselves to receive the hit. Trying times are inevitable. It's how you cope, how you strike back against adversity that really counts.  Never choose to give in.  Meanwhile, when things are all good, you've got to be sowing for the unexpected.  Putting in physical and spiritual work (the natural comes before the spiritual).  For me, it means immersing myself in God's word until I am drenched, wet from Living Water. So that when those hardtimes hit, I can pour out of myself to myself. This way, I am equipped to encourage myself from allowing my spirit to sink down below.  Are you doing the work? God  will  allow the trials to come.  Be sure to prepare for your day. It might just be within the next hour!  -B.Girl

      My dad's been hospitalized off and on for a while now.  Illnesses regarding his heart, lungs, bones, and so forth have been plaguing his body. Among many things, it's teaching me to value my relationship with him, to become conscious of my own health, to value my relationship with God and with others, to write and share my gift with people because I never know the hour. Let me share my truth in regards to my writing life...See, though it would be nice, it is not a fantasy for me to become some big and famous writer/. I am satisfied with just being quoted while my words breathe life into a dying soul/. I just want the messages God has given me to connect with people throughout the distant and vast corners of the world/. To reach the women in villages,/ and small towns,/ on broad city streets,/ in crack-infested alleys;/ the men toiling under hot sun,/ the men gone self-destruct,/ the single fathers struggling to nurture little girls because mommy's  too far to fetch/ the children displaced,/ the children war-torn,/ the children society-raised/ the ones fatherless and motherless.../just to let them know that God cares; that he sees the emblem of tears engraved on their hearts; that the hope lying dormant inside of them can be awakened if they just open up to that true, true Love/. All the while, we're looking around, God is right there./ You have a choice. Choose to see Him. OK...ok....enough for now...anyway, let me request...if you're reading this, please say a prayer for my dad, Mr. Kamara. Gratitude! --B.Girl

       African women…/   We dance ‘til  beats breathe through our skin Shake our tumbahs Flaunting femininity’s grace.  To African balophones and djembe drums We rock our bodies Creating stylistically distinct melodies  With shakeras, tambourines, and the kora.  In call and response form We spit sporadic truths Moving as if our rhythm has power To merge our souls with the Son.  We stomp our feet Sing atop our lungs.  Expressing our RIGHT  to BE…  Our song is our hope  Our music is dialogue Our dance is our way  Of declaring our freedom.  Oh yes, We dance ‘til beats breathe… Through our skin.  by Erica Kamara Copyright 2004

      Had a great weekend. Spent a lot of time creating and writing on Friday evening. Drove to the train station and rode the metro to Eastern Market on Saturday afternoon. Spent hours in a bookstore filled with worn books. I loved it! Bought a book by one of my all-time favorite authors, Kahlil Gibran.  He's from the 1800's but his work is so relevant today. Also, bought a beautiful long tie-dyed skirt for $20. It's pink and red. Flared and very eccentric. I had a great time riding the subway. It's always fun observing the people and using the time to read or write while riding.    For some reason, I've been starting poems and not ending them.  It annoys me. I like to finish stuff---go all the way. And when that doesn't happen, I find myself getting frustrated at the poem.  Sometimes I try to force it, though I know I shouldn't. It's teaching me patience in a very weird way. I'm learning that sometimes, a poem just needs time. Time to come about. Space to sit or just be. And then it might revisit me. --B.Girl

      The last time I subdued myself to tears was probably about a month ago. I'm trying to figure out, since when has it been so much work for me to cry. Crying used to be relatively easy.  Now I have to surrender myself to the tears that are probably tired of sitting in my eyes, or the unresolved issues that are tired of living in my heart. The last time I cried...I guess I was disturbed at the uncomfortable changes that were taking place in my life. God was planting seeds; and you know when seeds are being planted, there has to be a certain amount of digging up taking place. It can be a painful process. God was uprooting all of my bitterness and insecurities at the same time and I was trying to figure out what was going on.  Yet I was asking him to bloom me recklessly.  Well, how can that happen without, first, dealing with the root? I find that sometimes we ask God for things, but we don't want to take the whole process that is required to manifest that thing for which we've asked.  I am learning to either deal with the process, or limit God and myself by asking for what I ‘think’ I will be able to handle.  I find the former to be more beneficial-- so I put on and put up; or sometimes, I just simply let go! When was the last time you cried? --B.Girl

      So...God answered my prayer. I FINALLY have my own spot. I just talked to God about this like...um..2 days ago, (but I thought I would have to pay a fortune to my own blog) and now I am all of a sudden lead to the site through some random clicking on the web? GET OUT!!  I have so much to learn from the world, yet I have so much to say, so much to give, to share. Lord knows my thoughts are many. I just needed somewhere to put them down so the world can have (limited) access to 'em.  I hope something blesses you while you're here....  And just so you'll know my purpose for being on here, I am aiming to be free....free to express myself beyond imaginations through whatever means I choose. Whatever inspires me, I'm posting. Whatever pushes my buttons, I'm posting. Whatever brings joy to my heart, I'm posting. Whatever tickles my soul, I'm what? Posting. (lol) As much as I learn, I'm posting. It's about the art of LOVE, freedom, hope, music, denial, GOD, reality, honesty and loyalty, companionship, grace, peace, heartaches, surrendering, sacrifice, purpose, growth, balance, soul, poetry, imperfection....(I could go on).  It's about how my appreciation of LIFE meets my love for words, and how that passion is made transferrable to paper; well... in this case, my personal blog. ENJOY....But also, please give back to me and add to others by sharing/commenting/posting your thoughts as well....GOD's BEST TO YOUUUUUU.:) --B.Girl

       When it comes to living life unpretenseful and real, children inspire me.&nbsp; In particular, my three-year-old niece, Breanna.&nbsp; Though she is a darling, Breanna is what some people would probably categorize as a mean kid because her smiles don't come too often and she is as free as can be to speak her mind.&nbsp; She only smiles when she feels like it, not even caring to gain approval or someone else's affection.&nbsp; I find many children in their formative years to be this way. It's when they begin to get older and adults&nbsp; start telling them what&nbsp;is "polite" to do, that it&nbsp;becomes confusing for them to find balance so&nbsp;they end up losing some of their freedom to be themselves.&nbsp; Sorry to say that, unknowingly, some parents&nbsp;enforce their insecurities upon their children; whereas, they want their kids to behave, the reasons behind their kids behaving are not always because it's the right thing to do, but because they want them to be&nbsp;perceived in a certain way by onlookers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I'd like to think that no parent consciously puts their child through this, but this happens, sometimes without even realizing it.&nbsp;   I admire how&nbsp;children keep it real by honestly communicating their&nbsp;&nbsp;feelings.&nbsp; A friend recently made a point to me that it's because they're not as insecure as adults.&nbsp; To think of it, we grow up and put on armored fronts to protect our insecure/soft&nbsp;spots.&nbsp; As writer Sark says,  we stumble from one obligation to another, lost in a series of have-tos.&nbsp;  People   buy gifts they don't want to, attend functions out of guilt or fear, spend time with people they don't even enjoy, or end up doing random things they would really rather&nbsp;not do.&nbsp; We go through all types of headaches just to&nbsp;be approved by&nbsp;people.&nbsp; And litte by little, anger builds up in our hearts and we become mean and crabby because somewhere down the line, we were not being true to ourselves. Sometimes we just snap or continue to walk around with a nasty countenance or demeanor. And we're supposed to be a reflection of the Light in this world?   I&nbsp;think as adults, we become masked and unbearably ugly because our real selves are covered up with masks to fit other people's perceptions .  We deserve to&nbsp;be free and live life unpretenseful.&nbsp; That's when we are able to most add to the world.&nbsp;   Truth is, a lot of times, being the real you will be at someone else's expense.&nbsp; Not because you want it to, but because others are not always happy to see you walk in your destiny.&nbsp; I am learing that with freedom comes the responsibility to deal with other people's unlawful reactions. You can choose to give in to people's attitudes toward you or you can overlook them with love&nbsp;and keep shining. Keep being the SUPERSTAR that you truly are--MASK FREE.&nbsp;   As for me, my greatest desire is to walk in the path that God has set out for me--only me.&nbsp; No two people's route in life are exactly the same; so&nbsp;why even bother to go through the headache of gaining people's approval to go about your route? It's proven over again that people can never&nbsp;fully understand what they have not encountered.&nbsp;I have realized that no one has the answers to the pivotal questions about my route. All the answers are within me. &nbsp;All&nbsp;your answers are within you. Any complications as&nbsp;you are walking, should go, first, to the One who's directing&nbsp;your path.&nbsp; That's the only approval&nbsp;we really need behind what we do and how we go about them.     " We deserve to be caretakers of our spirits and dreams, and this means truly sensing and listening for our most alive route.&nbsp; It may not be a common path, or&nbsp; popular one, yet it will be clearly ours." --Sark      &nbsp;   blogging off....b.girl

      I got this from the back of my favorite tea box. Wanted to post it since it inspires me:    Add Joy To Your Daily Life     &nbsp;   1.&nbsp;  Pay as much attention to the things that are working positively in your life as you do those that are giving you trouble.      &nbsp;   2.  Memorize your favorite poem.      &nbsp;   3.  Learn three knock-knock jokes so you will always be ready to entertain children.      &nbsp;    4.   Don't let weed grow around your dreams.      &nbsp;     5.    Remember that everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something. &nbsp;       &nbsp;    6.&nbsp;   Watch a&nbsp; sun    rise at least once a year.      &nbsp;   7. Look people in the eye.     &nbsp;   8.  Compliment three people everyday [genuinely]      &nbsp;   9.  Live beneath your means.      &nbsp;     10.    Live so that when people think of fairness, caring, and&nbsp;integrity, they think of you.

      Ashley Woodson is a beautiful and sweet inner city young girl I met on July fourth at a retreat center in Woodstock, IL.  She appeared to be very quiet in passing. But once I sat down to talk with her, I became amazed at how much she had to share with me. Three hours passed seeming like minutes. She walked around with a book bag on her back filled with writing materials, and a composition notebook filled with writing.  At eleven, she already has several books filled with poetry.   With anxiety and passion, she read her work aloud to me.  I sat in awe of the issues she addressed and I marveled at her play on words. As I complimented her work, she told me that she thought they were just ok and that she writes a lot of bad poems. So of course, we had this whole interesting conversation about 'bad poems'. If there is even such a thing as bad poetry; and if so, what  subjects a poem to that category.  Ashley went on.  I listened.  Ashley kept on. I learned.  She is by far, the most intelligent and focused eleven year old I have conversed with.  Then I aked her to tell me about herself.  She talked about how she wanted to become a poet and about how she started writing. As she fluctuated from one subject to another,  I found out that she had a really low self-esteem, she did not like her looks, and that she no longer liked the fact that she found companionship in writing. When I asked her why, she explained how her friends tease her for carrying around a notebook all the time and writing "stupid poetry". They ask, why can't you be like a regular young girl? Though it infuriates her when they say things like that, she does not voice her feelings to them because she says they won't listen any how. So instead, she turns to her secret world of writing to release what she calls "bad poetry".    For Ashley, bad poetry is depressing poetry. Poetry that depicts the harsh reality of a young girl lost, trying to fit in. Bad poetry is poetry about a young girl who writes about how she hates her calling to words because no one seems to understand her.  For me, if there is even such a thing as bad poetry, it would be poetry that does not have a heart or soul in it. Ashley's poems has her heart and soul in them. Furthermore, like famous writer Rilke, I believe that all poetry that arises out of a necessity to write is good. Because the writer acted on the calling to write down what was put in his/her heart/mind. I pulled out a poem I wrote a few months ago, particularly to uplift young girls esteem.  I read it to Ashley and we both had tears in our eyes. The big smile on her face was enough of a reward for having written that poem. I dedicated the poem to her, gave her the copy to keep, gave her all the wisdom my experience have taught me abut writing and self-esteem, and we exchanged information to become pen pals.  Before she walked out of the door, I heard her recite lines to the poem I had read to her moments before.  I guess she was the one God had in mind when he gave those words to me. And I wrote them for her without even knowing her. Blogging off...B-Girl.  p/s: oh yeah...shout to my writing pal Ashley Woodson from Evanston, IL. (I know you're reading this...haha)

      While most people are either walking around with eyes wide shut or have their heads turned and would rather not see, while developed countries, or politicians and people in elite positions come up with endless excuses as to why they cannot intervene, and while you and I go about our daily routine of living the good ol American way, the world is dying.  Whether it's a slow death of living on an erroneous perception of reality, or maybe through inadequate diet of media programming or 'subtle' lies from crooked officials; whether it's through the mental and physical deterioration from drug use, or an apocalypse of ethnic cleansing and mass slaughters, our brothers and sisters on the other side of the globe, right down the street from us, right in our own homes, in some cases, even ourselves, are dying.    Because I have a background different from most people I am in day-to-day contact with, in that I had the unfortunate experience of living through a devastating civil war in Liberia (for four-and-a-half years), and since I tend to be extra sensitive about isues regarding wars and innocent people being massacred, I was trying to refrain from posting about this issue.  However, I think it's important that I do, because through exposure, who knows what may happen?    Almost since the beginning, I've been following the news stories on the horrific genocide presently pervading The Dafur province of western Sudan, Africa.  The atrocities have been going on for the past 16 months (since March 2003) in Dafur. It is a fact that the Sudan government is trying to eliminate the black population.  ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND people (innocent mothers, fathers, grand-parents, children, etc) are already dead, and a minimum of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND more people will die.  It is fact that up to ONE MILLION people could die.  According to Boston Globe, "If they [atrocities] are not stopped immediately, the world will witness a human calamity on the scale of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda." Are you famaliar the Rwandan genocide? Well, it is important to know that over 800,000 people died in Rwanda during a span of a short few months. For what? But out of ignorance, selfishness, and intolerance. It's sad to know that the organized persecution and massacre in Dafur is a historic continuum in which successive Arab governments have sought to entirely destroy black Africans in Sudan.   So...what can WE do about it?? If you are in the DC area on Thursday, July 22nd at 12 Noon, there is a "Die-In" being held at the White House.  "One thousand people will lie down, as if dead, in front of the President's Mansion powerfully reminding the US Government of the number of people who are dying in Dafur each day." (http://darfurgenocide.org/dcprotest.htm) Please visit the site for more details.  And if you can't make it, please go to the site to educate yourself about the situation in Sudan, search the web to find out even more info about the crisis and other crisis on a global scale so that you will know what to pray for specifically.  I believe that everything intertwines.  We are affected by the incidents over there even though it might not be directly.  War has no justification.  It can never answer for its physical, mental, or emotional destruction; nor can it answer for the blood of innocent lives that are lost. I know first-hand of what it's like to be on the other side and I cannot seem to post this without crying for the memories are still with me today. Don't feel sorry. Just take time to pray for the people of Dafur, Rwanda, Haiti, Liberia, Iraq...the list goes on. Do the research, you'll see. It's time to act! Who says one person can't make a difference?

      "Our worst fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, "Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?" Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God; your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God within us. It is not just in some of us, it is in everyone. And, as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."   - Nelson Mandela

      In undergrad, I took a sociology class (in particular) that included discussions on interracial relationships, mainly focusing on blacks and their relationship with people of other races.  I've never thought it was wrong; and I was never bothered with it, unless people become strict in saying I will ONLY date in my race or ONLY date outside of my race because I think that an opinion of such is indeed a biased one.  After all, who are we to tag love, or stamp it to stay within a certain color line or boundary? At the same time, I respect people's personal preferences; but I don't respect how people throw their preferences on others and make it a law for all of humanity to follow.   With that being said, I wrote something for that Black girl and that Asian guy who educated me. By just being, they made me realize that true love is not necessarily colorblind. Even better, love recognizes the color differences, willingly accepts it and radically celebrates it for what it is.    Remember the time  when we were sitting in a restaurant  eating and having fruitful conversation And all of a sudden this guy pulls out his camera and starts to take pictures of us?  As if we were infamous  or as if  each of us was ill-representing our race... Like you were betraying all black men And I, all asian women?  And remember the time that brotha, in utter disrespect, was trying hard to hit on you even though I had you on my arms?  And how it's constant  for people to stare... and stare...and stare... at us like we're committing crimes?  Funny how, when holding hands We exert burning chaos and fill hearts with irrational rage.  And our travels together  sparks secret chatters as if we're moving down social ladders.   But hey,  though it's not even about that, I love... the thick texture of your natural hair the deep darkness of your complexion the dynamic richness of your African culture the way you stroke my mentals and reach deep inside of you  to give me yourself   And I love... your natural inquisition  to dive into the abyss of my Asian culture how you find beauty in the slant of my eyes and make me feel good about the thinness of my hair and how I give you me, like the pureness of a child  I mean,  why use racial backgrounds as foundation to build upon when we've got passion and love more abysmal than the Atlantic ocean?  And since our relationship is platform, Let's be that voice that'll tell the world that love is color--Full.  And while most people believe  we are representations of  all that's wrong with society  We know we are an example  of all that is right.  Because this is how it  is.

      I miss writing on here daily. I've been procrastinating to come online because I don't like the keyboard on this computer. lol. What's the purpose of dividing the keyboard letters in half. Can someone please tell me? For real, I'm trying to figure this one out. Anyway, all is well here. Since it's been a some days...let me go back and recap...Saturday, I got to Illinois at seven thirty in the morn.(8:30 AM eastern time)...chilled with my family who were so delighted to see me....took an afteroon walk with dad (who happens to be doing so much better, by the way), came back home and slept myself away. I had to be up at 3a.m. on Saturday morning to leave and catch my 6:15 flight for Chicago. Thanks to my amazing potna who risked sleep to take me to the airport.  Anyway, Sunday, went to church, and then went all around Chicago with my fully sanguine brother Eric. Monday, went out to the mall with my sister. We spent 2 hours in Sephora, her favorite store and my new found obsession. lol.  Tuesday, spent 70% of the day twisting my hair...ahhhhh...then went out with my sister and her boyfriend to eat and play miniature golf, my new found hobbie. I had so much fun playing. I'm surely finding a spot, once I get back home, to go play. Wednesday, two of my sisters and me went to my other sister's house to watch movies and eat. But I ended up in the corner reading  The Diary of Anne Frank  instead of watching the movie. Oh well! And today, well I'm feeling like going to sit in Borders, catch up on reading my Word, and just chill man.  Till next time...Peace out, Love out too...blogging off....this Bohemian girl:)

      Every so often I get to accessing my life and almost always, I realize how much I take for granted the immense blessings God's given me.  I mean, besides the basics of having my every need met--food, clothing, shelter, healthy mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual states--I have even my silliest wants met too. lol. I have such an imperfectly wonderful life and I am hooked up with some of the most wonderful persons in the world.  It's an amazing gift to have the unconditional love and support of family and friends who adore me and vice versa.  It is so easy to overlook the simple things, the everyday people in our lives. Yet, it is those very people who add meaning to us and keeps us going on.  When it all comes down to it, isn't it true that what we really miss the most are the simple things? The conversations with friends, the embrace, the smiles and laughter, the hanging-outs, and so forth? I am so glad for the opportunity to create memories with the paternal side of my family. I am making the most of it and having a blast. After all, I am surrounded by a bunch of people who love to reason intelligently and have ongoing discussions about one end of the spectrum to another. Now, anyone who knows me, knows that I'm not big on food, but my dad can cook up a storm. (what does that mean anyway? ...cook up a storm?...lol)oh well, since he's been feeling a lot better, he spends a lot of time in the kitchen or in his garden. I find it very interesting watching him. And because I did not grow up around him, I have this inexplicable fascination with observing his mannerisms and so forth. I think I'll write about that sometime. However, I miss pinching my mom's cheeks, cooking and going to the mall with my sister Pink, the teachings and hugs from people at COLD, the love and conversation from my beautiful friends, and the unexpected hugs and kisses, along with answering the wide-range of blatently innocent questions that comes from my 4-year-old nephew Elven. Oh how I miss him so!! I would give anything for his hug right now. Anyway, to serve as a reminder-- Take advantage of the simple things. Author Keri Smith said, "simple things hold the secret." Appreciate the love of the people God has placed in your life-- in your household, at work, at church, wherever--realizing that they were all placed there with you for a reason. Add to them, encourage them, and love them like tomorrow will not come. Peace! -B.Girl.

      Sometimes life just ain't all it's cracked up to be. And our deepest desires may not turn out to be all we imagine them to be. Still, we follow our sensual longings to find out, Only to end up drowning in a sea of regrets. Yea, we go through mental growth  or the conscience awakening of having found out for ourselves But we experience moral loss, with innocence lost. And it's never really worth it.-B.Girl

      " Beware: perfectionism can kill you "-Steve Brown  Perfectionism induces procrastination. I am fighting to overcome this perfectionistic mindset I've acquired. Often, I would rather wait to do something perfectly or not do it at all. Somewhere down the line, I've told myself that if it can't be done right now in the right way, then I won't even start on it.  ahhh...so upsetting because I find myself not getting things done because of such flawed mindset.  What is "perfection" anyway, but a figment of imagination.  We create this (sometimes unrealistic) ideal in our minds, and try to grab it; but since it's out of our grasp, we never attain it. Hence, we feel inadequate when we're already adequate and have eluded the fact that our ideals were unrealistic to start with any way. O yes, perfection is certainly worth striving for, but when it gets to the point where I'm at a standstill, not moving because I want something to be "perfect"--whatever that means for me, then it's time to check  in. One way I look at things now is that everything, in itself, is already perfect.  Every art project I start on is already perfect.  It's when I begin to measure it against something else that it becomes less than adequate.  You cannot compare art. Each stand on her own.   Blogging off~~@ Bohemian girl

      "There are three things important in life: honesty, which means living free of the cunning of the mind; compassion, because if we have no concern for others, we are monsters; and curiosity, for if the mind is not searching, it is dull and unresponsive." -Beatrice Wood

      I saw this somewhere and wanted to pass it on. I think we need to go back to the days when we actually had a community. You know, those "it takes a village" days. Now, neighbors don't even care to speak and whatnot. We need more love in the world man. All may not be applicable, but adopt some:  How to Build a Community  turn off your tv~leave your house~know your neighbors~greet people~look up when you're walking~sit on your front steps~plant flowers~use your library~play together~buy from local merchants~share what you have~help a lost dog~take children to the park~honor elders~support neighbourhood schools~fix it even if you didn't break it~have pot lucks~~pick up litter~read stories aloud~dance in the street~talk to the mail carrier~listen to the birds~put up a swing~help someone carry something heavy~barter for your goods~start a tradition~ask a question~hire young people for odd jobs~organize a block party~bake extra and share~ask for help when you need it~open your shades~sing together~share your skills~take back the night~turn up the music~turn down the music~listen before you react to anger~mediate a conflict~seek to understand~learn from new and uncomfortable angles~know that no one is silent though many are not heard~work to change this~initiate a conversation

              There is an appointed time for everything, and a time for every affair under the heavens. A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot the plant. A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to tear down, and a time to build. A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance. A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather them; a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embraces. A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away. A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak. A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.         Ecclesiastes (3:1-8)     What season it is for me:          Time to ...       ADOPT MINDSET OF THE ANT (sow, grind, and sweat)      WORK DILIGENTLY TO MEET MY EDUCATIONAL GOALS      WORK HARD TO MEET MY FINANCIAL GOALS      WALK IN TRUTHS AND FORSAKE SELF-TOLD LIES      WORK HARD TO MEET PERSONAL GOALS      RISE EARLY AND SLEEP LATE (sow in morning, sow in evening)      GROW IN CONTENTMENT      SACRIFICE MY WANTS AND SETTLE FOR MY NEEDS       GIVE UP FEAR AND PURSUE MY DREAMS      UTILIZE AND ENHANCE MY GIFTS/TALENT      STRETCH!!---MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO STEP OUT OF ALL COMFORT ZONES (moment by moment)      DILIGENTLY STUDY GOD'S WORD      PUSH PAST SELF-IMPOSED FEARS      HEAL      BUILD      LEAVE LEGACY      SPEAK UP      UNLEARN, AND THEN RELEARN      MENTAL REBIRTH

      According to TIME MAGAZINE, (August 2, 2004 Issue), poetry makes the heart grow stronger.  Columnist, David Bjerkie states, "It all has to do with breathing patterns and their relationship to cardiac rhythms.  It turns out that reciting epic poetry--especially verses that follows a specific rhythm called hexameter makes an excellent breathing exercise." Through practice you will result in an increase in the synchronization of certain cardiorespiratory patterns that are believed to be favorable for the long term prognostic of cardic patients. Needless to say, whether or not you like poetry doesn't matter.  So start reciting.

       Things have been so stressful lately.  So much have been going on with my school process that I don't know where to start.  God has been testing my faith level all the way.  There are some days when I don't feel adequate enough to deal with the level of trials He's allowed to come my way.  From the beginning of my journey to grad, there have been complications.  I didn't expect attending grad to be so much more of a headache than undergrad.  I often wish for the days when I had less responsibility than I do now.  But this is how God is growing me. I prayed a while back, "Lord I will trust you throughout this process of pursuing higher education".  My prayers have come back to haunt me whenever I sit up at night worrying about how school will be paid for, how my apartment will be paid for, how other bills will be paid for, how will I find a job in such a disastrous job market, and so on.  Everytime I start to worry, there is the reminder of the vow I've made to trust God.  Through it all, I am here in VA Beach at Regent University, in my very first flat, broke and all (lol) but I have the rich promises of my Lord with me.  And it is overwhelmingly enough.  I am growing so rich in taking responsibility and in perspective, that I'm shaming my self-critic. God is living through me, inspite of.  And I am more than grateful.  After all, there is a price you pay for wisdom.       Bless your sweet sweet heart Lord.       Blogging off...this BohemianGirl
