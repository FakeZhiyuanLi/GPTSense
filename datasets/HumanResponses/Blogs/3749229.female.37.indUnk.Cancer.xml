      And I came back with not only a tan, but a much better attitude. One of my friends brought a picture we'd taken together 3 years ago, and holy cow. (literally...cow) I was totally shocked at how different I look now, in a good way. It's really what I needed to get my head straight again. The fact that I have come a long way since 3 summers ago, just gave me the inspiration to see this through.   I ate pretty healthy every day we were there. Lots of fruit and veggies during the day.  Also drank loads of water. Drank a few too many beers probably, but maybe the sun cancelled those out? ;) I also had a great walk on the beach yesterday, it felt so good. My calves still hurt today. I need to stretch.   Yesterday on the ride home though, I was craving chocolate, so I had a 3 Muskeeters bar. Then last night I ate a piece of coconut cake. Blaming it all on starting my period, finally. Apparently sugar was going to be my poision. But it's back on full speed ahead today. I feel good.   breakfast: 2 pieces of swiss cheese toast (on ww sugar free bread) and a diet pepsi

      After reading countless entries of people who are using blog as their weight loss journal, I thought why not. This can be the place just for that. No ramblings (hopefully) about other things in this journal, only things that directly affect my journey to lose the remaining 25 pounds I want to lose.  So I'm going to use it for a food journal, mood journal, a little self reflection thrown in here and there, and also exercise. No holes barred, all out being honest with myself. Painful honesty. This is it.   I turn 37 in just a few weeks. I've already lost 30 pounds in the past 2 years, 25 more to go. I've been backsliding lately and I can feel it. This is the turning point where I get back the mindset that this is a life change not just a quick fix. Back on track. And that starts right now.    Breakfast: 2 slices of swiss cheesetoast / 1 cup of black coffee.  *I already see the big mistake here. 2 pieces of toast? Why not just one? Because I'm pms'ing and I wanted 2. Plus the fact that we're moving to our new house in less than a week, and the cupboard is bare. But that's not a good excuse, is it?  Exercise: yoga stretches. Deep breathing. 20 minutes.   I leave this afternoon for the beach and won't be back until Monday night. But I am determined to write everything down in a notebook while I'm on my trip. Wish me luck.

      We're finally moved into the new house. And yesterday I went to the grocery with a healthy attitude in mind. I've gone back and forth with eating healthy/and not too healthy for about a week now, getting ready to move.   Stress, and just grabbing what was around, since we were trying to eat what was left in the fridge, and then had take out the last two nights. But, I do feel like the amount of work I've been doing as far as unloading and unpacking hopefully will balance it out a little. I've been going non stop for the last 2 days, and yesterday only thought to eat lunch, and then last night had a bowl of cereal.  But I feel "hippy." Like I can feel an extra pound or two right there. So I know somethings up. But today I'm going to do it right. Start journaling again and keep it going.   Breakfast coffee 3/4 low fat vanilla yogurt with blueberries and strawberries
