      I'm not anti-Google. When I first got news of the fact that Google was going to offer prodigious amounts of mail storage, I visited the site and kept refreshing until there was something resembling "Sign up" on the page. Like I kept banging the door. It came, and they told me they'd think about offering me a place. I was disappointed. 

After numerous reviews about how Gmail was going to destroy our privacy by reading mails and displaying ads related to them and even not allowing users to delete mail (or at least the mails would be stored on the server even if the user had deleted the mail), my spirits sort of flagged. Google  is  the net, after all, omnipresent, omniscient. They shouldn't be petty about earning money through ads on email.  

Not that it was a big deal, anyway, I wasn't reading the Pentagon's state secrets.  

Meanwhile, Google's search engine itself has come under severe criticism. Google's PageRank system, which is automated (as compared to that of Yahoo's which was partially human),  is getting 'spammed' .The top ten results are irrelevant, uninformative, babbling blogs that swamp the more useful results underneath. Anyone who 'feels lucky' is in for a hard time. My experiments with Yahoo search are much more fruitful nowadays. 

But I digress. Today I got an 'offer' asking would I like to 'test gmail'. I said yeah sure, so here I am. 

First impression: the interface could have made a college going kid proud. But the interface isn't so nice. I've got to search around a bit for common things like compose, or how to delete mail (yeah, I checked that out first).  

But lets forgive them, the interface can always be improved upon. This is only a Beta. How is the functionality? 

Google's gone in for an interface where you don't see _mails_ in your inbox, you see _conversations_. Which is the same as "threads", you don't see older replies as such in the inbox - they are shown as cascaded 'windows' when you read the latest in the thread, so we can refer to all older mails in their context. It looks interesting, promising. It means we don't have to include the original message in our replies and the reader needn't scroll up and down getting the context. Not bad, but I'm worried about when there are too many replies. I don't want to be cluttered with 'HTML windows'. 

Then there's this concept of "Labels", as opposed to folders in a mailbox. They say this is different, because you can assign different labels to the same mail, and you can search for it quicker. I didn't test that too much, but it seems to work. We'll know when we have a few more mails to experiment with. I was bored with sending myself mails. 

You can also 'Archive' mails, so they needn't be an everyday eyesore and you can just search them out. Then you can select a few mails to be shown together in a view (they call it "Starred") and manipulate them. Search results look like the results we see when we use "Google cache" in the regular search - the keywords are highlighted. That's nice. 

All in all, you get the picture. I haven't seen the 1 Gig yet, and they strive to make us feel it by having messages like "No conversations in the trash. Who needs to delete when you have 1000 MB of storage?!" when your trash is empty. Well, I need to delete. 

Thats about all that is different about Gmail - everything else is there - "Filters" (rules), Spam control (supposedly), the works. Free Mail can only give you so much. 

I'm happy I've got a 1 Gig mailbox, no doubt. But I'm not going in for a knee jerk reaction yet and declaring all my other email ids null and void - for starters I'm quite happy with a 6 MB Yahoo id. Tomorrow maybe we could have 1 Gig mailboxes in our current ids itself, with Yahoo and MSN caving in to the pressure. 

Bottom line: I feel it's not just about storage. When you've got your current mailbox already configured with addresses, folders and rules, you've got no reason to shift to gmail just because they're offering storage and a few features you won't even use. It'll make better sense to use Gmail as a backup when your current mailbox runs over. 

Maybe we needn't fall for the 'G'immick so soon.

      Yesterday's guitar class was better than usual, if only because my Guitar Sir said I was doing well. I didn't go last week, and the week before that I hadn't practiced too well, so the sum effect of all this is that for the last three weeks I've been playing the same songs again and again. And getting nowhere. It's a fairly hard climb nowadays. I told this to him, and I told him maybe I should take a few weeks break to catch up on my practice. He disagreed, told me I was doing okay, and asked me to keep coming for the present. Then suddenly the songs became easier to play. I don't know why. 
Why did I find it hard to practice? I know that it's not a question of lack of time, though it's true that I am working longer hours at the office. The lack of practice started after we'd done a song called " Faith of our fathers ". The song sounds simple, but for me as a beginner, it has a few complex chord shifts, which means I have to change the fingers on my left hand to a new position quickly to keep up the timing. And it has to be accurate, of course. I couldn't do it. Every time I tried the chord shift I was late, and it didn't sound good.  
I kept putting the guitar away in frustration. 
My fault is that I tried to play  fast  all the time, and I tried  hard  to play fast. Guitar playing shifts from a purely physical activity to a mental activity as we progress, and I was trying to physically break the bonds while the bonds were in my mind. I can move my fingers quickly enough, but I have to be in the right frame of mind to do so. Calm Mind,  Fast  Good Fingers. 
Why did it become easier to play I was told I was doing well enough? 
What are these doubts that keep accumulating in our minds, taunting us, forcing us to question our own abilities, where do they come from? It's the red imp sitting on my shoulder, this lack of self confidence. It pulls me down, and I don't know that I am being pulled down. It affects the way I work, the way I see people, the way I think.
 
Today was a good day too. My friends from  Anna University  got together to wish a friend bon voyage on his way to Munich, Germany. We saw the movie ' Gothika ', even though it wasn't a popular choice (the guys wanted to check out either ' Hawas ' or 'Murder', quite understandable) and we got ourselves a few not-so-cheap thrills. One of the guys wanted to check out ' Spy Kids 3D ', but we convinced him it wasn't worth the headache. Gothika wasn't worth the headache either, but sometimes an choosing an unknown devil is better. 
I'm not a movie buff, much less a scary movie buff. But sitting in a theatre with a hundred others hooting and heckling and passing comments that make a scary movie look like a joke is worthwhile. Scary movies are nothing more than a rising crescendo of music followed by a thud which turns out to be an innocuous bat, anyway. When we most expect the ghost, it just shows a flash of itself. It's most malevolent intentions are justified as noble minded, because the person who's a ghost was unfairly killed and only wants to take revenge. Quite a new story line, isn't it? 
The most thought-provoking thing whole day was that the friend who was leaving to Germany warned me against becoming too philosophical, because though I wouldn't have a problem, the world around me would.
 
If I were to start discussing people and the world, this post would never end.
 
For now, it's "Faith of our fathers". Slow version.

      I'm not much of an English-big-words guy, all I know is what I can pick up from novels and the like. We know those fellows who go chasing words. They make it a point to repeat a new big word they've discovered, and they find out its history and all, and they impose those words on us. We in turn feel so ashamed of not knowing the word that we don't ask them, and we don't look it up either, because in our shame we forgot about the word itself entirely. Anyway, I'm not one of these guys, even though people sometimes tell me my vocabulary is good. 
I found this word, soliloquizing, and I suppose most of you astute readers must be already familiar with it. It  urlLink means  to talk to oneself.  I have a feeling that the word is a bit condescending, as if the person who coined the word sort of felt that people should not be soliloquizing, but anyway, it's good there's a word for it, because I've decided that's what I'm going to do over here. 
 
It seems to me as if I suffer (?) a wavering mind, whose period is around 6 months. 6 months is the amount of time I can write a blog before I decide to scrap the whole thing and start again. Every time I start I start with the idea that this time its going to be "it", but after six months I dry out, thoughtless, 'idealess'. Or I stray into dreary streams of thought that bring me no joy, and I know that if I write anymore it would only be farcical. 
 
See,  urlLink farcical  -  a word that encapsulates the meaning very well.
 
After some time, however, the mind starts ticking again, it gets some ideas that I want to discuss with people because I have to find out if they can be developed further or can be qualified as right or wrong. It's paradoxical that I have to address a  lot  of people with my ideas, even though I know that a lot of people may turn out to be  not  the right audience. Some people don't get the drift or the essence of thought itself. Yet, it has to be publicized, in the hope that someone out there is going to criticize the things that I say. 
Sometimes it's purely philosophy. Like I was listening to music while I was working today and I was simultaneously examining my brain, as it worked and listened to the music. I am currently designing the way that Font files must be stored in the kernel for a custom application we are building, and these fonts are to be shown on an LCD, like that of a cell phone. What I was doing isn't important though. Anyway, designing something technical is always mind consuming because it asks for both sides of your brain, the left side which keeps checking about the way that size must be represented, and the pattern is to be shown, and details about the LCD controller, and the right one which is worried about designing  elegantly , something which is functional and beautiful.  
Elegant - that's a nice word too. 
Well, so here I was doing something mentally demanding,  and  enjoying music, and because I was enjoying music, I figured that a part of my brain was busy translating the sound that was being registered, and therefore my output in my main task could not be 100% of what was possible. 
However, that was not totally the case, because sometimes music helped me finish jobs quicker. What was happening?  
At this point I launched into a whole series of thoughts (which I hope I'll put up here someday) about the way that the brain processed information, and at one point I turned and asked a colleague about what his personal experience was. 
The colleague is not daft, but I'd say he sometimes has a higher opinion of his own understanding. It irks me sometimes. Other times I think it's a positive attitude to have confidence, but sometimes it's tough getting ideas across. We tangle a bit and we eventually discuss about what "hunger" is. I tell him that any "feeling" is not scientific, because we cannot write a technical document that dissects "feeling".  He tells me yes, we can, and proceeds to tell me about stimuli in the brain and the effects of it, in the case of hunger, salivating. 
That's not the point, I say. I say that in between stimulus and response is a "processing", which is the "feeling", and can he tell me it's component parts? 
Well, I think he sort of side-stepped the whole issue and went into details which I heard patiently, and in the end I was wondering if there was any point in the discussion, as all I was trying to do was to convince him that my view was right. That was not my objective - convincing him was immaterial. Anyway, at the end of it all he now stakes his claim on the fact that machines and robots can  really "feel", and quotes a movie starring Robin Williams to substantiate it. 
I left him to think about it and think some more myself. 
You see, it's not important about what "hunger" or "feeling" really is. It's people. It's this whole "double mind" thing I have that has to analyze my weaknesses and analyze common things and has to get   feedback  from people about it. 
Feedback - sounds bad. It sounds like a snake eating its own tail. 
So here I am, trying once again to document whatever comes to mind at whatever sporadic frequency I have to do it in. Maybe it'll be gone in six months, depending on my "circumstances" and the choices I make then. I am not even sure about how much to write here and what to write about, and that's a good thing because it leaves the door open to whatever seizes my fancy. I will try to document something meaningful, something I can refer to as ground already covered when I have my doubts again. Ground which might have to be toured again, if need be. 
Blogging. How I hate that word. It sounds like a marsh that keeps pulling you in.

     You can't escape these nowadays. Everybody who isn't anybody has one of these things. They're filled with inanities, spouting a million characters, meaningless, useless. Someday when an Alien Invasion indeed happens, they will read them and decide that our mental capacities are alike to a slug. Perhaps in Alien Lingo 'Blog' and 'Slug' rhyme (they oh their use), in which case  The Enterprising Green Man  would print this poem in it's Sunday magazine: 
      [...after much thought...]  
      
     Earthian Slugs, 
     Spout Blogs. 
      
      
     Spiffy, I call it. 

     But, but. I just had this desire to see my printed word on the web once more. Never mind if no one reads my printed word, and never mind if you have in mind one or more unprintable words. The astute reader (don't look behind you - I mean  you , you ass) would have read para 1 and para 2 and therefore concluded that the author is a slug.  
     That, brothers and sisters, is something I wish to prove wrong, through these pages. These pages will someday herald the new dawn of humankind. Ahem. To know how that is possible, keep visiting these pages a hundred times everyday, and you shall be bestowed with mysterious powers. Believe me, it's true. 
     So, there. You wanted to know why I started this blog. Rather, I wanted to tell you why I started this blog, just as I am going to want to tell you a lot of other things. Now it's told.  
     Bring on the aliens.

       Google Answers, eh? Anyway, I want to know why some people, like you and me, no matter how hard they try, can't keep their blogs alive for more than a few months. And I'd also like to know why they keep coming back to it. There you go. Now start writing. Raj.  
Raj, 
Before I start in earnest, I'd like to point out that we  don't  try too hard. That's the way it should be: blogging should not be hard work at all.  
To understand the reason that some of us are inconsistent with blogging (which is an understatement), we will seek to understand why people who blog consistently do so. Thus we could perhaps figure out the differences between the two, and then maybe we could debate about whether there is indeed a "problem", or whether it just a characteristic that can be lived with. 
And so my first search on what blogs mean to people:  urlLink Why Blog ? A good explanation comes from  urlLink Jeremy Wright : 
  
I write for myself. The parts I love about blogging are the social aspect, the concept of opening up my ideas for review (by others or myself) as well as the ability to search my thoughts: knowledge management.
   
Which is about as good an explanation as any. Note that when Jeremy says he writes for himself, it does not mean he writes  about  himself - immaterial of the theme of your blog, you blog because you want to write about the theme. You blog because it is exciting to get people to see your views and discuss them. And Man, as they've always said, is a social animal. Show me a blogger who is a misanthrope, I'll show you a hypocrite. 
What Jeremy does not say is why people continue to keep blogging once they've started. Well that's one answer to which there is no one consistent reason which suits everyone. For instance,  urlLink Robert Scoble  says this:
  
... why does ANYONE keep blogging?
 
Isn't the answer going to be different for everyone? In fact, if you asked me three years ago, I would have said "cause I'm making cool friends cause of my blog." (I was invited to Steve Wozniak's superbowl party by Dave Winer just a few weeks after starting to blog).
 
Last week several venture capitalists walked up to me at Demo and said "I love your blog." Today I had lunch with Microsoft employees from around the world and one guy said "I was a little afraid of riding in your car cause you're such a superstar." That's wacky. Bill Gates is a superstar. Steve Jobs is a superstar. I'm just a guy who likes hanging out with geeks and using technology and writing about it.
   
Well that's just his take on the matter. But he does highlight an important fact: sometimes a blog can make you feel like a very important guy. Who doesn't want to be a big shot? When you have a blog you get people to read you, people to judge you and maybe like you. You want to be liked. Which is why there are so many commenting softwares around.  Here's another take by  urlLink Scott Johnson :
  
When it comes right down to it, even if you are only commentating on stuff you found on the web, do it regularly.  In the blog community, your "currency" is your output.  This isn't to say that it's quantity over quality but you will find that blogging regularly is key to being accepted.
   
"Being Accepted". There's a very good reason why people blog often - because the more often you blog, the more regularly people are going to visit you and comment and make you feel  accepted . That's an important reason. You may not want to feel like a 'superstar', but you might want to be 'one of them'! 
And so, my friend, I come to us. 
There are  many  bloggers who have a blog and do not update it often. Or they let it die. The reason for this is perhaps that they do not get the feeling that the above guys are talking about. Perhaps they cannot wait for the first hundred comments on their blog and they lose patience. If you had a 100 comments in the first 20 days you opened your blog which told you how well everyone likes your blog, maybe you wouldn't have thought of quitting. This isn't about wanting attention : it's about being accepted, especially when you  start  a blog. Being a superstar comes later. It's no fun at all if the only person who reads your blog is you. 
The reason could be different - maybe you're not being read by the right persons. Worse, maybe you're being read by the  wrong  persons. Maybe you do not write for yourself - which is precisely why you should be blogging.  
Most other reasons, I think, will only be extensions of the above. In the end it should be the one reason - that you should blog for yourself - that should count. 
Think about it. 
 
Google search keywords used: "WHY BLOG", "WHY KEEP BLOGGING".

      I am going to do an experiment...  

 
My aim is to  try  to make this site more popular than it is, now. To that end, I am going to test my writing skills by asking people to give me topics to write about. I just want to see if I can come up with the goods. 
 

The procedure is this:
 
 You can give me any topic you want written about, could be fantasy, or current affairs, could be anything. Example: "Where's India's economy heading under Manmohan Singh?" or "What's the best way to propose to a woman?" or "What's the best way to close this damned site?" (my answer - no way :) - anything. 
 I'll try to do some research and write an article on it. Admittedly it won't be an expert opinion, but I'll try. 
 You come back, read it, if you're not happy, you don't read this site anymore. If you're happy, you spread the word. 
 
What say? Keep the topics coming.
 
Addendum: 
I realized Google answers does just this...!! 
Still, mine's free..

      Is "spontaneity" a good quality? 
Let us say, you could control your mind to the extent that you could control precisely the thoughts passing through it. You would have no room left for "out-of-the-box" thinking, since you would have thought of thinking such thoughts long before you think it. No spontaneity. 
But if you could not control your thoughts, you leave room for mistakes. You could think 'wrong' thoughts ('wrong' being a generic term to represent... hmm.. "run time errors"?), and therefore make mistakes. 
This implies => Room for spontaneity => Room for errors. Side effect. 
I'm sure if I had a poll, 99% would choose the extra free room, with side effects. 
Therefore, is consistent (perfect) behaviour, paradoxically imperfect, because it is not desirable? 
What do you think?

      It's  Fantastic ! 
The new Blogger interface is very user-friendly, large icons, easily accessible, good colour scheme, and the new feature for commenting makes it the very best journalling system now available. All of you live/dead/~misc~journal guys, it's time you looked a little  envious. For years now (two, to be precise) I've envied the LJ guys who had an inbuilt commenting system available which wouldn't falter, while I (and many others) had to rely on unreliable third-party commenting systems which would suddenly disappear. The only reason I did not switch is because I liked to design the page too, which was not possible in LJ. Paying was not an option. 
And now this. Again, fantastic. 
Which makes me think about where Google is heading. If at all we're going to be looking at "Web Monopoly by Google" (is such a thing possible?), I say, let 'em have it. Why? Here goes: 
 
 They've got the best bloody search engine currently available. They've refined it to such an extent that users can 'manipulate' the search results, which isn't so good for the lay user, but can't take away the fact that it's still the best.
 
 They're redefining email. Everyone has sat up and taken notice: no wimp who offers just the 4 MB can hope to survive any longer. They've changed the rules, now. It's  their  game.
 
 (Now) They have one of the world's most mature blogging services I've ever seen. 'Mature' is the word I choose, because it shows quality combined with experience, combined with a great deal of back-bone. I can just imagine Google's servers 'chugging' away to hold all the millions of posts of millions of users worldwide. Those posts ain't goin' nowhere. Neither, now, are the comments. 
 
They have the best News Aggregating site. Can't say more.
 
 They listen. They're accessible. Their sites have not been hacked as often as other sites. You can't do a  urlLink DOS attack  with several roomful of servers. They've got a good research team. They have a sense of humour (imagine Bill Gates making us April Fools through a press conference). 
 
 
All in all, you've just got to like these guys. It's like what Linux would like to be but never can, because it falls short in the user-friendliness department while rising tall in the developer-friendliness department. They're now fighting hard to get the market share, particularly  urlLink RedHat  Linux.  Google - it's every man's web interface. You can have Google APIs on your site while you whimper about your girlfriend on your blog. I wonder if they'll release a Google OS soon, so they can be on the desktop too. 
In the end, all this also puts them with a great deal of responsibility.  urlLink Eric Schmidt  must know how and where to call the shots from now on. 
Way to go, Google.
 
My apologies to all those who've commented on these pages before. I can't think of a method to get both to co-exist without having two "comment" links. Or is there. Any help?

      There I am, driving my bike in a  urlLink sweltering heat ; my helmet clammy from sweat. My visor is lifted up, to allow whatever little air can come through. The road shimmers. 
 
When driving a bike, you drive on instinct. Peripheral vision is everything. You're watching nothing but you're watching everything. You don't think about driving, about the nitty-gritties involved. It's magic. 
 
Trucks come up ahead, the local buses weave their way through.  Slow down, accelerate, slow down. Signal... go.  
 
It's hypnotic. You gradually become secure, you have faith in the magic. Your mind starts to meander, to trace it's own independent path while your body keeps reacting to what your vision feeds it. Turning the handlebar, braking, gear shifting, you never notice.
 
 
I've touched 60 now, the traffic is moving at, say, 55. Marginal, really. There's a big green bus ahead of me. It's thrilling to overtake buses. You should try it sometime.  When the bus is going just under your own speed, it's even more thrilling. 
 
 
 
It's a dangerous hypnotism. There are hidden risks involved in the road that you have not encountered for so long that your mind discounts them, ignoring them, unaware of their possibilities. While your hypnotic trance continues they creep up on you.
 
 
I've got to pick up courage before I start the manoeuver.  It begins with a slight irritation, as I can't see much beyond the bus, and he won't allow me to easily pass by. Who does he think he is. 

Then there's a slight gap on the left. I accelerate. Cyclist in my peripheral vision, weaving, slow down. Bus goes ahead, I try the right, accelerate. Middle of the bus now, and gaining. Straining, but gaining. 

Suddenly in front of me, on the road is painted  'Accident Prone', with a yellow 'stick man' painted lying prone. 

 Realization. Awareness. Humility.  

I let the bus go, and stop to fill petrol.

As far as I know, only two of my classmates from MCA have ever tried out personal web logs, Raj (above) and the enigmatic Mr.RG. RG does not update his blog anymore, so it's upto the two of us to uphold the pride of our batch. 
I remember when we guys put up a community website for our class, the first time I had ever worked on web development. Raj designed, I wrote, and Arunan carried the drinks. It was great fun and a source of joy to see our site come in the top results in Yahoo or Google. I've saved the  urlLink index  html of that site, right now it doesn't look good because I didn't save the CSS too.  
Even back then - and this was late 1999 - I see that we had thought of a concept similar to blogging. We had a "Local Diary" section that was supposed to report the recent events. We also threw in a "PracWag" which was to be the technical journal, "Unwind" was supposed to be jokes, and a "Lateral Side", where we posted miscellaneous interesting things from around the net. As time went by we found lesser and lesser time to update the site regularly, until it gradually wasted away and finally  kicked the web-bucket when the URL we used (www.aumca.org) became invalid. But as long as it was there, it sure was an exciting time.  
Later we tried to start a similar website, but it never caught on. Community sites are created only once.

      Well, might not be really *New* (!) but at least a different blogging software. 
Check out  urlLink www.reger.com , I  urlLink signed up  just for kicks and I feel it's very powerful, just that it's not very popular yet. It's got photo uploads, comments, calendars, customizable webpages, "GPS positioning", the works. If you're planning to start a new blog, try it out.

       urlLink Cringley on web logging : 
 
A lot of this comes down to production values, which is a subject those in the web log world tend to ignore because it is to their advantage to do so. There is a lot of bad television, but its packaging is such that we still seem to sit through the shows. Network TV spends perhaps $500,000 on an hour. How much do you spend on each web log entry? No wonder most web logs are so boring.  

Well, I'd say the lesser time spent on a web log entry, the better. People should be interested, but not made to ponder long and hard about the post itself. Can't agree with his comparison with television. Can agree that most web logs are boring, but that is the way it should be. If the whole internet was completely full of 'interesting' web logs, what would the definition of an interesting web log be? Know what I mean?
 
Annotation:  urlLink Joe Reger  
Addendum:
In case Mr. Cringley is referring to the time spent  writing  a post, how do you measure that? For me it takes around half an hour to write a post from beginning to end, to think about it or to decide that there's something writable could take weeks, months. What, then, is the time taken to write a post? Either way, the comparison with TV can't be done. This is a new medium, setting its own rules!

       urlLink Greece beats Portugal . I had a presentinment that Mr. Figo and co. would be overconfident about the match; and Greece was supposed to be very composed before it. It's all in the mind. 
I love watching football. I'm not a big "follower" of football, in the sense I do not know the names of most football players, but a little bit of football in school, where I was a well built defender, has taught me the basic knowledge of the rules. I discontinued after my 8th, and started on volleyball in my new school, which is hardly as demanding a game as football. But it is an interesting game in its own right.  
In my undergraduation I played a little bit of football with my friends. Football in college meant no shoes, because if the majority didn't have shoes, the others couldn't either. Boy was it tough. I played forward for a very short time when my friends saw I could 'feint' well with the ball - I could shift weight suddenly and send the defender in the wrong direction. What I couldn't do was run fast, and I became taller, so they decided I could be a better goalie. Nah, not my style, so I left it at that. Anyway, my feet were hurting. 
Cricket is a whole different ball game, and like most other Indians I know cricket inside out. Most of the inside, anyway. When I was in class three I used to play with the bigger boys in my colony, and almost always I never got to bat or bowl. You know what that means. My moment of glory came when I ran out a batsman from what I now know as leg-midwicket. It was one heck of a throw, straight onto the stumps, and to my wonder then (and even now) the stumps shattered. I can't recall if anyone ran over to give me high-fives, but it couldn't have been very high, anyway. 
Undergraduation, again, was the place where I found my cricketing skills. In college we used to play with cork balls on muddy tracks, which meant the ball could spin almost 80 degrees. I loved it. I found I could bowl batsmen round their feet bowling leg spin, and those guys were just baffled because they couldn't do anything about it. It was a legal delivery, just that it was out of their reach. I could even bowl offspin to mix it up a little, but they always managed to hit the off-spin. I even tried to get into the college team as a leg spinner, but on the mat the ball just went straight. Everyone was baffled - about why I thought I could get selected. 
Over time my leg spin has degraded, now I'm not sure if I can turn the ball at all. Anyway, you can't spin tennis balls. Right now I fancy myself as a batsman, sort of mixing the styles of Dravid and Laxman. Tendulkar, unfortunately is too short for me, otherwise I would have mixed him too. It's great the way people can go around mixing all the batsmen they know. I knew of a guy who thought he mixed Kambli and Tendulkar. He never quite figured whether to play right handed or left handed. He'd go in with a headband and wristband and collar up and come back to the 'pavilion' (which was just a place under a tree) the same way. The sun, you know. Even when it was raining. In the end we thought he mixed Ambrose and McGrath in his batting. 
Team sport is great. It's a lot of fun not because you can hit the sixers or score the goals or win the game, but the sense of camaraderie that prevails, the jokes, the criticism, the repartees, the fights, the people, and the sitting together and chatting when everyone's tired. Sometimes in the rush that the world gets us into, into office and work everyday, we forget the small joys that sport can offer. I know many, many people who don't play  any  sport, and I can only think of what they've missed and are missing. 
And they say life is a game.

      From  urlLink Kitchy Quotes : 
 
"Do not keep company with people who speak of careers. Not only are such people uninteresting in themselves; they also have no interest in anything interesting. . . . Keep company with people who are interested in the world outside themselves. The one who never asks you what you are working on; who never inquires as to the success of your latest project; who never uses the word career as a noun -- he is your friend."
 
-- Roger Rosenblatt.

      There was an interesting dicussion among my friends which started out as something along the lines of who are Aryans and Dravidians and which ended up as a discussion about racism. I have posted this  urlLink here  (without their permission, but definitely copyright). It isn't too well formatted, and I've removed most of the personal remarks passed, but it still makes interesting reading. What goes on in the mind of a 25 year old who has experienced racism first hand for the first time? 
When asked to 'politely ignore' racism, my friend Vikram (now in Germany) had this to say: 
 
Politely ignore - What would you do when you are refused of information
when you ask for it - say in a enquiry counter in bus station?
  
Tough. 
I myself had little to contribute. I've never been subject to racism - it exists only in TV or in the newspapers or when someone else tells it to me, it's sort of "out there" and not immediately something of concern. I can't figure why white people think (or thought) they are superior and coloured people are inferior.   But first I had a few concerns myself - belonging to a 'coloured' race, as opposed to a 'black' race, did I consider myself superior to the latter? Was I unconsciously prejudiced when it came to forming judgements about them? Did I unconsciously look UP to white people, did I try to ape their customs? 
To my shame, I did. 
To be frank, if I look at it I'll blame it on the "system" ('wasn't me'). Somewhere along the line there is this idea that talking English like a Britisher or an American is cool. It's present in schools, English teachers try to imbue pupils with a sense that talking 'polished' english is good. In college students join 'spoken english' classes to improve their diction. In job interviews we are supposed to have good communication skills if we can speak English well.  
In a sense, all this is fine - it's the curiosity to learn a foreign language. But that's not true in India. Here we make a big deal of English speaking skills, our careers depend on it. Other countries do not take so much pains to learn English - a peer in my company in Germany does not know any language other than German, his English translations need a second level of translation by us to make sense. For them, knowing English is  helpful , like knowing German in India is helpful, and not necessarily  required .  
Maybe our fixation with English is what they call the 'Colonial Hangover'. I was firmly opposed to Mr. Murli Manohar Joshi when he started changing History textbooks ( urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ) to reflect more Indianized (if, possibly, imperfect) content, but now I sort of get the motivation behind it. Perhaps his opinion is that if we were to write our own history books, we might somehow "forget" the colonial hangover and emerge a better nation. 
Could be a load of bullsh*t, for all I know. History should tell the truth, nothing more, nothing less.  
Maybe we are making a mountain of a molehill. Maybe it's not wrong at all to ape the west, maybe all we're doing is to combine their style with our substance. English is only a language, we learn it well, so what? 
So what is, that people who are intelligent but cannot speak English should not be discriminated against. I see it all the time. 
So what is, that given a choice between holding to our roots and going the 'phoren' way, we should hold to our roots. Does not mean you do not go overseas, just that you hold true to who you are. 
So what is, that when the lady behind the counter refuses to tell you the schedule because of your colour... 
I don't know what you should do.

      Must have done this long back, but better late than nevah! Now that he's got a few posts up, (*Drumroll...*) 
 urlLink Music technology and philosophy  is being blogged by my colleague and ex-college-mate, Kaarthik (*wild cheers all around*). Check out the stuff there. He says this in one of his posts:
 
Disclaimer: This blog is not to initiate others into music, it is for others who are already initiated into some kind of music to agree and/or argue with my thoughts.
  
It's not only music, there are also  urlLink surprise gifts!  ("What..?? Me???"). 
 And some deep philosophy on offer: 
 
 
* If the other doesnt agree, or is simply on a parrallel 
* plane of consciousness which won't meet , what is the state of 
* the communication now ? Has it broken down ? Psychological 
* maturity allows subsequent communication (read more such 
* discussions), the lack of it gives scope for a better sense 
* of judgement about oneself, the level of tolerance to alternative 
* perspectives one can handle.  
 
  
He goeth deep.

      When discussing software design, it sometimes happens that participants fail to agree to a consensus, and a decision is reached only a senior engineer decides that  this  is that way it ought to be done, and everyone agrees, some reluctantly. 
When creating a design we invest a lot of thought and energy into it, we "create" it. We are making a product of our thoughts, the components of the product drawn from personal experiences, knowledge, and likes. It's a bit like laying an egg. And not surprisingly, we act like the mother hen protecting the egg. We build walls against non-existent opponents. 
Perhaps that's good, in a way it promotes debate and eventually a better design emerges. Very often participants in a design process 'compromise' their designs and throw in a bit of each others ideas - that ends in a very bad design which is accepted anyway. But building walls often means we fail to see the salient points of the others designs, we do not make use of their experience and knowledge.  
It needs someone who can see through barriers to really pull things together. That's the leader - someone who can look at the good points in each design in a dispassionate way and build a design which will suit the purpose best. He is not influenced by people, he is not influenced by his personal likes and dislikes and can use the participants' knowledge, skill, experience. He rises above to see the complete picture. A good leader advocates debates, free speech and free flow of ideas. No one is afraid of expressing their thoughts with him. In such a scenario, designs can be made quickly, and more importantly, well. 
There's just one hitch, though. It's tough to find good leaders. We more often meet  managers , who are concerned with schedules, deadlines and goals and fail to grasp completely the technical details that go into a design. In such situations it is up to the team members themselves who have to gain  sufficient maturity to understand the requirement, and come up with the goods. The design might not be a Monalisa, but it might be  some  portrait, nonetheless. That's why so many designs are only "good enough" and not really "good". 
In the end, when you're called upon to serve omelets and you serve it scrambled, you're not sure whom to blame.

      There is something I want to write about, but I can't put my finger on it. I get the feel of it, it's about people who want to do something most of their lives, but suddenly find themselves not doing it. They're unhappy, but only sometimes, usually they are cheerful enough. People we meet everyday. I could be talking about you. 

 More » 
 

But I can't write about it yet. I can't be honest. I can't look in the mirror and say I'm perfectly happy with what I am doing with  my  life. But it's  okay . Okay. It's not bad. But it's not me.  

I never really wanted to be a software engineer. I was studying to be a software engineer around 720 days after the first time I was told to be a software engineer. I was told - "you can't speak clearly enough, you are an introvert, you don't like meeting people, but you are reasonably intelligent, so go and be an anonymous, intelligent guy plugging away at the computer. You'll earn well, it'll suit you fine."   
At 18, I was enthused by all this. I  believed  I was an introvert, I  believed  that programming should be the best thing I could do. I took them at their word before I had even looked at a computer. At 18, you're not even supposed to be thinking about knowing yourself. At 18, you're raring to get somewhere, because Tendulkar made his debut at 18 and you always believed you could do the same. And you're afraid. Very afraid. Of not "making it". There is always the need for Approval.  
Cut to the present. Software programming turns out not to be so bad, after all. It is a passable profession, it deadens reasoning, but it stimulates the mind in other ways. I think I am good at it, and I even like the work I do. Which, you could say, is a rare thing.  
But it is not all. There is this something that wants to be expressed, like some music which wants to be played but can't be played. I don't know what it is, but it is there. I know it's got to be let out - but for that, I have to know what it is. And like an endless loop, I have to start again, to know myself.  
This is why I can't write about people doing what they want to do, though it is a principle I agree with. I hear people who are unhappy with what they're doing, that they could  have been  someone else  if only  they had done that. What could have been if only. Sometimes I meet people who are good at something else, and they love it intensely, only to mask their regret, years later, when they say in a matter-of-fact way, "oh, I was good at that, but I had to leave it".  
Let me say this. Don't leave it.  
I can't write about people doing what they do because I realize it takes something deeper for them do it and derive satisfaction from it. They have to know themselves. "Know Thyself". So many people have said it,  urlLink it has become meaningless . It always boils down to that one single, essential philosophy. I can't say that face to face to another person because a person who spouts philosophy is not taken seriously. Philosophers are dime a dozen, philosophers are loony. Know yourself. And philosophy is best when it is self-learnt.  
Well, so I ruminate. I look into the mirror and see, only sometimes, that I am not all that I can be. I started on someone else's path, and I did fight to hold my own during it, but this path is not my path.  
And I did not write this post because I do not know my path. It's supposed to be ironical. I can't put my finger on it yet.

      Give me the strength to do the right thing at the right time.  
Let not my actions be weakened by doubt, of my actions, or of the self.  
Clear my path of obstacles, or serve only those that I can surmount.  
Give me strength of judgement, so I may carry those who place their trust in me without faltering.  
Give me strength of wisdom, so I may choose the right paths to travel on. 
Give me the strength to believe in me.
