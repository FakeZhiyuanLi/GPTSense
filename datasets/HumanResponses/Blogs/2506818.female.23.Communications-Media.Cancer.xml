      I'm sitting here at my boyfriend's house, playing on his computer while he's taking a nap on the couch, a consequence from staying out too late the night before.  I don't mind really, but the keyboard is loud so I hope it doesn't wake him.  We're going to go shopping later cuz I need something to wear for tonight.  The dry cleaners lost our clothes and all my good sweaters were in that batch.  But, I think there's a good chance our clothes will be recovered.  I talked to the manager and he said they always find the clothes but it takes a couple of days cuz they have to sort through everything.  If not, they'll reimburse us.  That's about $60 for each item of my clothing, and I had, like 7 or 8 things, and on top of that, all of my parents' clothes so...if they don't find our stuff, there's a lot of money to be owed.  I don't even want the money.  I just want my clothes back.  I'll never be able to find duplicates cuz they're all last season's designs.    Okay, I'll stop being materialistic but you'd be pissed too if your clothes were lost by some mindless dry cleaners who could give two cents about your precious sweaters.  Last night, Nick and I went to Mint Thai, the best restaurant in the world.  I always get the Mussaman curry with chicken and always have a lot leftover yet, I never take it home.  Then, I kick myself the next day when I'm hungry cuz I realize then that I could be eating the best food on earth if I had taken it home.  Perhaps I should next time.  Then we went and saw "Big Fish", which is a really, warm-hearted movie and I totally recommend it.  Billy Crudup looks like an older version of the Smallville-guy, I think his name is Tom-something-or-other.  Anyway, if you like being told good stories that aren't too complicated but very explorative of your imagination, then this is the movie to see.  Then Nick and Mike went out for basically last call and I went home cuz I didn't feel like drinking.  And speaking of drinking, what is up with me not wanting to drink lately?  Ever since I got off my antibiotics, I just haven't been feeling it.  Even the idea of consuming alcohol makes me feel like vomiting.  Whatever it is, I better snap out of it because tonight is the end-all be-all of all nights to get completely obliterated.  Hey, I'm young, healthy, and legal so why not?  I think the idea of a hangover is preventing me from getting drunk but isn't that the purpose of New Year's Day, to work off your hangover?  :)  I still have no idea what we're dong tonight and the minutes are ticking away.  I don't know if I wanna hit up Scottsdale's block party because a) it's really expensive and b) it'll be more expensive once we add in the cab fare.  I'd really like to go to Shayna's, but I think the guys want to hit that up later in the night.  What's so wrong with just going to one place and staying there?  Especially on the one night when no one's going to be driving and getting cabs just to go from point A to point B is really expensive and very inconvenient.  I mean, is it really worth the hassle and money to go to more than one place just so we can show up at the second place fashionably late?    I should wake Nick up soon.  I'm being loquacious, which probably means that I'm gettng bored.  Hope everyone has a safe and exciting New Year's!  The next tme I write in here, it'll be next year.  Haha...I just wanted to write that.

      Hey all.  I was house-sitting all weekend and I didn't have access to a computer so I wasn't able to update this.  But, I'm home now and very proud of myself for being up so early.  I'm going to be very productive today, at least, I hope to be.  So, I got an offer in the form of a voicemail for a job position and I called the lady back the next day and that was one week ago and she hasn't called me back since.  I called her yesterday but her phone keeps going straight to voicemail.  Could she be out of town?  Busy?  I dunno...but I'm so confused.  What does this mean?  That the job isn't available anymore?  I can't imagine her just leaving me hanging, especially since I accepted the position.  I have no idea what's going on...  This past weekend was quite boring.  Everyone is either in a homebody mood or out of town.  On Friday, Nick and I went to McDuffy's to meet with Tiesha and her friends and I had three margaritas.  This is a lot for me, especially since I hadn't had a drink in weeks due to being on antibiotics.  So, I got pretty buzzed but once we got out to the parking lot, I convinced myself that the cold winter air was sobering and drove home.  I'm an idiot, I know.    On Saturday, we went to Joel's little shindig and it was very nice to see him again (along with Nikki, Jose, and Boz).  He seems like he's having a good time in Missou-rah and he should know how proud I am of him for following through with his dreams.  One day, he will blow Oprah out of the water but because he's so nice, he'll invite her to be a guest on his show.  And Nikki...well, what can I say after that show-stopping booty performance by the door?  Two words:  Get Low.  ;)  Then we went to Elixir in Scottsdale to meet up with Mari, Jenni, and Al cuz he had turned 21 on Christmas and with everyone being out of town, Mari felt bad and wanted to take him out for his very first "bar" experience.  Well, this technically wasn't his first bar experience.  I've been to bars with him before where he'd gotten in illegally but he was fine and knew how to handle himself.  But on Saturday night, he was a complete mess and I really started to get very annoyed by him.  First of all, when we all met up, he was sooooooo wasted that when he was talking to me, he kept spitting in my face and I told him what he was doing but he just ignored me and kept on spittin'!  Secondly, he was embarrassing himself and therefore us (since we were with him) at the bar by grabbing the bartender's arm for his attention...something you should NEVER do.  You don't grab the bartender.  You just don't.  It's just bar etiquette.  And last but not least, he was ALL over Mari, trying to kiss her and grabbing her ass and hugging her from behind and trying to nuzzle her neck.  And she was FREAKING OUT and begging the rest of us to save her (we did the best we could).  I guess this wouldn't bother me so much if A) he didn't have a girlfriend, but he DOES and B) if he wasn't Diego's best friend, Diego being Mari's on/off boyfriend.  Now, I'm sure he doesn't remember any of this cuz Mari called me the next day to apologize for his behavior and she told me he puked all night long and I don't know why this should even bother me since it's completely none of my business but I was there that night, being affected by his drunken behavior and I hate being around non-fun drunks.  Then on Sunday, Nick and I woke up late and did nadda.  Wait,...I think he might have done his laundry and we took a quick trip to Target and we went out to dinner with my family!  Yay to doing stuff!    I've had a lot of thoughts lately on a whole bunch of different subjects.  Just my opinions on things and why I'm so affected by them but I'm kinda tired right now so I'll write more when I'm a bit more clear-headed.    I wanna go to Disneyland...and soon.

      Merry Christmas!  I hope everyone had a good day.  I ate lots of food, sat around, ate some more food, and sat around some more...so I guess you could call it a good day.  Last night, I went to Zoolights with Nick's family and that was really cute.  You can't see any animals and most of the paths are blocked off, but it was enjoyable to just walk around with hot chocolate in hand, looking at the lights and listening to the Christmas music on the speakers.    Today, I woke up and went to Nick's house and had a wonderful turkey meal.  I got a Burt's Bees facial kit and aromatherapy oils from his parents, which is perfect for me cuz I've always wanted to try the Burt's Bees stuff but it's like, $10 for toner at Whole Foods and I don't wanna waste $10 on experimentation and the oils are nice because I've always had trouble relaxing and hopefully this will help.  His sister got me a Victoria Secrets lotion combination set and they all smell really, really good!  I put one on and the scent lasted through dinner and a few handwashes.  Nick got me the Jason Mraz CD, which is what I had asked for ("You and I Both" has been in my head for the past week!) and, this is the best part, a hot stone and scalp massage at Spa du Soleil   urlLink    His gift is perfect, I couldn't ask for anything more.  He's getting better at this gift-giving thing every year!  :)  Anyway, after lunch, we all sat down to watch "The Santa Clause" and according to Nick, his dad, sister, and I all passed out during the movie.  Well, I guess turkey will do that to you.  Later that night, we headed over to my sister's house for Christmas dinner with my parents and Aaron, Sally (his mom), and his bro Nathan, and his sis Erica.  Dinner was delicious!  Sally cooked so we had great, Midwestern cookin'!  In fact, I think I'm still full, but I would gladly eat Sally's cooking anyday.  Then we sat around and watched home videos of the wedding/honeymoon and my mom invited Nick to dinner Sunday night even before telling me about it.  My mom is like this, very forgetful and flighty, but she means well and I love her.  I know it's assumed that I'll be there but it's just the way she handles situations.  She treats me like I'm invisible and completely not an important voice in the family yet, when it's just us, I'm everything in the world to her.  It's tacitly assumed to her that I will always be there and be a contributor to the family, but every once in a while, I'd like verbal recognition and appreciation for the fact that I will always be there and be a contributor to the family.  And anyone could tell me that I am, but it's different when it comes from your own mother.  I dunno...am I just blabbing?  So, I house-sit this weekend, from Friday until Monday.  Just thought I'd let ya'll know.     YOU & I BOTH words & music by jason mraz  Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me Oh things are gonna happen naturally And taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side  And balancing the whole thing But often times those words get tangled up in lines And the bright lights turn to night Until the dawn it brings A little bird who'll sing about the magic that was you and me  Cause you and I both loved What you and I spoke of What you and I spoke of Others only dream of the love that I love  See I'm all about them words Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive Now you and I, you and I Not so little you and I anymore And with this silence brings a moral story  more importantly evolving is the glory of a boy   Cuz you and I both loved what you and I spoke of and others just read of and if you could see now well I'm already finally out of  and it's okay if you have go away just remember the telephone works both ways and if I never ever hear it ring if nothing else I'll think the bells inside  have finally found you someone else and that's okay cause I'll remember everything you sang  you and I both loved what you and I spoke of and others just read of and if you could see me now well I'm already finally out of words.

      Yay! I made a difference! I got a reply the very next day from Senator Kyl's office that read:   Ms. Lee,   Thanks for finding the error on the Senator's reading list and bringing it to our attention. I'll correct it right away.   Sincerely,  Julie Katsel

      When I can't fall asleep at night, I have this habit of reading random Xanga or Livejournal weblogs.  So, I'm on Xanga and I just click on a recently updated username and this is what I get:  - in a bizarre coincidence, this guy is from AZ and goes to ASU (like me!) - he plays the violin (like me!) - he's playing in a quartet at a couple's wedding on Jan 2nd...the couple, whom by the way, are named Nick and Mindy (don't flip out...I'm writing this on a purely "isn't this weird?" level...don't read too much into it)! - his username is a reference to a Radiohead song that happens to be one of my favorite Radiohead songs - and he referenced Roald Dahl.  Okay, the last one might put you off but hear me out:  Earlier tonight, I was on Jon Kyl's website (yes, I look on Senate.gov when I'm bored...I know, I'm boring) and he has a Children's Reading List.  I clicked on the link to see what books he recommended to kids, just to see if it's anything I've read and the last book on the list is "B.F.G", which we all know is written by Roald Dahl, because we all read the book and loved it.  Well, Senator Kyl's website cites the author as Tom something-or-other so I wrote him an email to correct the mistake.  Isn't that weird?  I mean, how often do I think about Roald Dahl and have a completely random weblog I read reference the author, too?  Am I being weird?  Should I get some sleep?  YES.

      Hey all.  Let me tell you about my weekend.  Let's see...what did I do?  On Friday, we (note: we= Nick and me) had dinner at his house cuz his mom makes the best pizza...and from scatch!  Then, we went to Casey Moore's, only to be disappointed at how crowded it us so we left and headed to Four Peaks and stayed there for a little bit.  Then we went to Old Chicago and hung out until closing time.  Nick and I had a really good conversation about our ifutures and what we hope/plan for.  I had a good time.  After three years, conversations can either get repetitive or boring so it's nice to know that after all this time, we still have interesting things to talk to one another about.  On Saturday, we went Christmas shopping at the Chandler Mall then to Chuy's for dinner.  We wanted to go see "Bad Santa" but it seems that we always want to go see a movie in the in-between time.  If you look in the paper, most movies start around 7 or 9pm and we always wanna go around 8.  So, anyway, we didn't go and instead went to Native New Yorker for a little bit to hang out with Mina and Aaron and their friends, then we went to Red Star Tavern and hung out with Mari and Gillian.  Nobody's in town right now.  Everyone is either away at home for the holidays or not back home from their respective schools.  But, this upcoming week should be fun.  Christmas Eve I'm going to Nick's (and hopefully, we'll go see LOTR with his family), then on Christmas Day I'm going to his house in the morning then he's coming to hang out with my family later that night.  Then New Year's Eve, who knows what will be going on?  I'm sure there will be some house parties, which is what I prefer to do for New Year's or if not that, then I heard Scottsdale's block party is pretty cool.  But, I am definitely going to avoid Mill Ave, unless I am forcibly made to go there.  Please...that was SO what I did in high school.  On a bright note, things are starting to look up and I only hope that this trend continues.  I got a job offer today!  Woo-hoo!  But, I wanna think about it for at least a day before I made my decision.  The thing is, I applied for so many jobs...I have a hard time keeping them all in order!  So, I don't know if it'll be stupid of me to just say yes to my first offer when I've got so many balls up in the air.  What if something better comes along?  Or what if nothing else comes along?  I don't want to screw myself over, yet I want to take advantage of the best opportunity that comes my way.  I have some thinking to do tonight.  I also have another interview tomorrow morning then two more replies from prospective employers who want to set up interviews.  Maybe I should slow down before I burn out and really fuck up an interview for a job that I really, really want.  Or maybe I should rank all the jobs that I've applied for and go from there.  But, I've applied for so many that that'll take forever to do and it's late and I'm tired so I'll do this tomorrow cuz it sounds like a really good idea.

      I went and saw Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King tonight and let me just say...actually, I don't have anything to say, I'm just in awe.  I love it when you walk out of a movie and you feel as though you just had an experience.  With over 200 people in the theatre, I felt personally bonded with the movie.  Wow.  Just wow.  I even cried a bit.    It's okay if you've never seen any of the movies in the trilogy (*cough  Joel  cough*) if you're really not interested or just haven't had the time to get into it.  I'm the same way about "The West Wing", but for those who are anti-LOTR just to be cool and different...well, I pity those people because they're never going to see some of the most visually inspiring images I've seen in my entire life.  Pity on them and pity on their imagination.    I'm never going to get this "Scottsdale" thing down or much less, understand it.  And some of you may think that there is nothing to get or understand but there really is a noticable difference in the people up here.  I lived in the Mesa/Tempe area from the age of 4 to until a couple of months ago, and maybe this is just something an outsider can see.  I can't wait to move back to Tempe.  East Valley...I miss you soooooooo much.  You are my home.

      I've felt really depresed lately.  I have no job, I have no money, and I have this college degree that is starting to rapidly depreciate in value.  I feel so alone...like I'm the only one who feels like this, and I was starting to believe that I was the only one who understood the state that I'm currently in.  I was bored earlier tonight so I started reading random journals on xanga and livejournal only to realize that I'm not alone.  Other people are currently as depressed (or more) than I am and in some twisted way, it actually make me feel better, or rather yet, feel human.  I'm sure I'll snap out of whatever I'm in, I've been in worse conditions and prevailed.  My motto used to be, "It'll get better"...maybe it's time I started believing that.    Tonight I babysat Adam, Dana, and Emma and let me say that I love those kids as if they were my own!  I hadn't seen them in over a year and I'm so amazed at how fast kids grow up.  Dana and Adam are now in 7th grade and Emma's in 4th.  Adam's voice changed, Dana wears make-up, and both are so tall!  To me, they're still the little 10 year olds I used to nanny yet when I think back to my 7th grade year, I remember the things I knew...and the things I found out about life, boys, and puberty.  So, as I'm catching up with Dana, I have to remember to not talk to her like a little girl anymore and to start talking to her like an adult.  And Adam says"shit" without any tone of hesitance, but I know he said it to impress me, though I rolled my eyes at him.  And Emma is still my favorite little person in the world.  I told her that if I have a girl, I'm going to name her after her and she felt so honored.  I want her to know how in awe I am of her, she is such a wonderful, intelligent, adorable person, every parent in the world should strive to have children like her.  She gave me a school picture and on the back it says, "Mindy~ I missed you!  Come and babysit me sometime, Emma" and then she drew and colored in a heart next to her name.  Too cute.  I want to be there for Dana as she goes through these next few years, but my presence isn't as consistent as other female adults in her life, specifically her current nanny.  But, Dana and I have a bond and I think she knows that she can trust me.  She is such a bright and mature girl that I want her to be okay during the hellish early teenage years.  And, on a bonus note, I got to see Sydney!  She remembered me, as evidence in the fact that she jumped up and literally hugged me and followed me around for 30 minutes, leaning on my legs.  She knows that I have a lot of love to give her, she is just so cute!

      Today I had two job interviews, I have another one tomorrow (on top of a nanny-ing gig...just helping out the Paikowsky's for a day), and two more on Thursday.  As anyone can see, I'm working my ass off to get a job, as opposed to just sitting on it and watching t.v.  When I was sick last week, I realized how bored I am with my life.  I have nothing going on, nothing to look forward to.  It's gotten to the point where the most mundane things, like daily errands, are becoming quite amusing to me.  I'm totally type-A, well, not totally, cuz if I were I'd be working three jobs right now...but I do know that I'm the kind of person that needs to stay busy in order to find some happiness and content in my life.  I'd rather be really really busy and bitching about how I have no time to do anything than chilling out and being mellow.  Uptight?  No.  Just motivated.

      Well, hello everyone.  My weekend was quite relaxing.  I didn't do much, cuz I'm getting over being sick but now I'm much, much better and so I must dive back into my life and get going again.  Let's see...on Friday, Nick and I went out to eat with my family since my aunts and grandma were leaving for South Korea the next morning.  It was fun.  We ate a lot of Korean food and Nick impressed my aunts with his chopstick abilities.  Then we went to Hollywood video to rent a movie.  We have this horrible habit of spending way too much time picking out a movie.  Last time, we were in there for an hour!  We're picky...or rather, we both want to see different things and have trouble compromising our tastes.  So, we ended up renting this movie called "The Shape of Things" cuz I once read a good review about it.  So, we start to watch it and it sucks!  I think we got 20 minutes into the film before the duo-interp (for those of you who were in Speech and Debate, you'll understand) vibes got too strong and we had to stop the movie.  Thankfully, "Goodfellas" was nearby so we popped that in and enjoyed watching what is considered a "good movie".  Neil Labute could learn a thing or two from Scorsese.  On Saturday night, it was Nick's mom's birthday so we all went to Z Tejas, which was tres yummy.  Afterwards, they wanted to buy a treadmill so we all went to Sports Authority.  While his parents talked to the customer service reps, Nick, Hayley (his sister) and I played around on all the gym equipment.  It was fun, like being a kid again, though I'm sure the Sports Authority people were probably looking as us like we were major retards.  Anyway, later that night Nick and I went and saw "The Last Samurai", which actually ended up being a pretty good movie.  However, it was nothing new.  To summarize, imagine "Dances with Wolves" mixed with "Braveheart" and set in Japan.  It was very formulaic (sp?) but worth watching...though if you're like me, you'll cover your eyes during the battle scenes cuz quite frankly, how many times can you cut off a guy's head or stab a sword through his chest?  Yeah...I'll pass.  Anyway, then we went back to his house and watched "Pirates of the Caribbean", which we've already seen but it's so cute, it's worth watching again.  Especially for Orlando Bloom, though I don't think Nick would agree with me on this.    Then on Sunday, Nick came over and we did nothing.  Oh, I did get a new phone.  It's a Samsung E105 and it has a colored screen and it can download polyphonic ringtones, which is all I wanted in a cell phone anyway but never got with my last phone.  Now that I can download tones, I'm having trouble deciding what song to download cuz there are so many good ones.  Should I go hiphop like everyone else or pick something funny, like the "Saved by the Bell" theme song (no, I haven't found it yet)?  Should I pick something classic like "The Beatles" or something pop like "Rock Your Body"?  Yes, these are hard decisions.

      Hi everyone!  I decided to switch my weblog over from Xanga to here cuz I realized that on Xanga, you can't post a comment unless you're a registered user and I thought that was kinda wrong.  You shouldn't have to register to comment...and on here, you don't!  So, I look forward to everyone's comments!

      Okay, so "Law and Order SVU" wasn't on so I decided to watch CNN and can you believe John Kerry won the Iowa caucus?  And that Howard Dean came in third?  I've always rooted for John Edwards (I especially like his education and health plans), I've always been indecisive between him and Dean so I'm really glad to see that he did so well in the caucus.  Now I'm watching "The Daily Show" and I swear, it's the only show on television that gets me to laugh out loud.  It's so hilarious!  They froze a frame of Dean saying something about sending Bush back to "Texassss" and they computer-generated Dean's face to Gollum's to compare his "precious" to Dean's "Texasssss"...oh my gosh, it was sooo funny!    On a sidenote, isn't it ironic that Kerry won the caucus and he held his rally in Waterloo, Iowa?  And what's with all the celebrities endorsing Gen. Clark (Ben Affleck, Madonna, Michael Moore)?  If this was a high school popularity contest, I'm sure he'd win but these celebrities are foolish to think that their endorsement is really going to sway my vote.  But before "The Daily Show", I was watching this show about real weddings on Oxygen and it made me think about the whole subject of Marriage.  Here are my thoughts:  - They're all about tradition, tradition, tradition...but whose traditions are these and why do we blindly follow them?  A tradition means nothing if there is no meaning behind it.  Also, a lot of these traditions seem very old-fashion and very sexist.  I don't know if sexist is the right word but I can't help but feel that a big underline meaning of a wedding is to "give away the girl", like she's some sort of property.  - The purpose of a wedding is to proclaim, pledge, announce (enter any synonymous and overly dramatic word for "say") your love for one another but I say, why?  Why do I have to stand in front of a whole bunch of people and feel completely uncomfortable on a day when I'm supposed to feel my most beautiful?  Who says a couple must do that?  Can't I just get married, in the most technical and practical sense of the word?  I'm a very private person and I don't need to vow myself to someone in front of other people.  My relationship with my future husband is to be sacred and not shared amongst others, even if they're family.  And frankly, who cares?  I doubt anyone in the audience really gives two cents about my relationship and I don't blame them.    - I dunno...I've just been beginning to think that a wedding is so full of superficial hype and it's a rather selfish thing to do.  You're saying to everyone, "Come and celebrate my relationship with me and let's party cuz I'm married!" but why would anyone else care about me getting married?  I certainly don't expect them too.  - When I was younger, I wanted a fairy-tale wedding, with lots of people and a huge party but to be honest, I don't think I want any of that anymore.  A wedding is just an excuse to spend a lot of money and look pretty for a day.  The only part of a wedding that I agree with is the honeymoon.  All I want to do is travel.  Give me a decent ring, a nice guy, a judge, a courthouse and some exotic honeymoon and I'll be happy.    I'm seriously contemplating moving to Paris for one year, just to do it.

      My weekend was quite uneventful but full of relaxation, just the way I like it sometimes.  Friday night Nick and I went and saw "Along Came Polly" which really wasn't that funny and Jennifer Aniston did her "What?  Huh?  I'm so confused" act throughout the entire movie.  I'm just so sick of her.  Can we say "overexposure""?  My top 5 list of the most overexposed celebrities in no particular order:  1)  Jennifer Aniston 2)  Jennifer Lopez/Ben Affleck 3)  Britney Spears 4)  Paris Hilton 5)  Anyone on "The Bachelor" or "The Bachelorette"  My list of the top 5 celebrities that should receive more attention (for purely eye-candy reasons)  1)  Orlando Bloom 2)  David Beckham (although I'm sure Brits would disagree and put him in the first category) 3)  Hugh Grant 4)  Colin Farrell 5)  This one is open for revolving door options.   Notice they're all British?  What can I say, I've got a thing for the accent.    Anyway, then on Saturday we had dinner with his parents at Serrano's (yummy bean dip!) then we went and saw "House of Sand and Fog".  I didn't know what to expect with this movie.  I either thought it would be surprisingly good or really long and overly dramatic.  Well, it turned out to be the former.  I would highly recommend this movie.    Today, I woke up and ran some errands.  I went and picked up my paycheck, all of which I'm depositing into my savings account first thing tomorrow after work.  I am so excited to be saving up so much money!  I know I had the upbringing of the biggest spoiled brat in the world but now I'm finally learning the gratification of working hard and receiving its rewards.  Nick came over but left before dinner time because his back was hurting too much.  We went and got him one of those IcyHot medicated patches for his back so I hope that at least helps to alleviate some of the pain.  Mina and Aaron came over for dinner and we all talked about Europe and my parents' potential trip in the Spring.  I convinced my father to go in April, when the weather will be nice, the costs cheaper, and there will be less tourists.  I mostly convinced him of this because I want to go to Europe in May and it wouldn't work out if we went at the same time (for work reasons),  Then again, this is all hypothetical so who knows what will really be going on once the planning begins.    I have a busy week ahead of me.  I work all week and on top of that, I have a dinner date with Kiki tomorrow night, I close my mom's on Tues and Wed night, and I have a doctor's appt on Thursday afternoon.  On top of that, I have to finish my grad school applications whenever I have a gap of time to sit down and write some brilliant entrance essays and statement of purposes.

      I've been wondering...how do you find the one thing that makes you completely happy?  I'm not talking about relationships but instead, I'm talking about finding the one thing in your life that you're really good at that makes you truly happy.  How do you know how to find it?  How do you know if you're on the right track?  For once, I've done a decent job of looking after myself.  I decided that instead of pursuing just one path, to pursue all of the paths that interest me.  I'm applying to graduate journalism and education programs, as well as looking at entry-level jobs at t.v. station.  I have a job right now and it's good but I still have one foot in the job market.   Hopefully, I'll gain acceptance to everything that I've applied for but I'd rather try then never know at all.  Yet, I can't help but feel somewhat foolish because I have no idea what I'm getting myself into.  Am I trying hard enough?  What if I don't get into any of the programs?  How do I know that my best is good enough?  I feel like there's a certain level of control over my future that I'm not able to attain and it really bothers me.  Am I the only one who feels this way?  I had quite a busy day today.  I worked in the morning, had an hour to get my fingerprints taken (for my work, it's for clearance reasons and illegal not to have them when working with children in the state of Arizona), went and nannyed the Paikowsky kids until 7:30 (and loved every minute of it, I adore them!), went over to Nick's afterwards and we went to Wildflower and I got a grilled cheese that way waaaay to plastic-y looking and full of grease (ha!  writing that makes me want to listen to Sarah McLachlan's "Full of Grace", "...I know I can love you much better than this..." Haha), then we watched Frontline and they had an entire episode about the "Parlor Maid"/FBI counteragent/espionage/love triangle and it was very interesting.  Too bad I fell asleep about 3/4 of the way in cuz I was so tired.  When the show started, we didn't know what the stories were going to be about and they started showing shots of Chinatown and the narrator said three words regarding the "Parlor Maid"  and Nick and I looked at each other and got really excited.  Maybe I exhibit nerdy tendencies but I'd rather be informed and intelligent than ignorant, especially since we live in the U.S. and if you're an adult and still completely live in a cave then I blame noone but yourself for your ignorance.  By the way, Frontline is way cool.  It's beginning to become one of my favorite shows.  Speaking of t.v. shows, what is up with "The O.C" craze?!  I know the storyline, I know the actors' names, I know the characters' names (all by osmosis and watching E!) but I just can't understand why teenagers all over the country are addicted to this show.  I was talking to Dana today and mind you, she's 12, and she couldn't stop gushing over "The O.C" and it made me start thinking that maybe I'm just getting older and this is the "90210" of their generation cuz I used to watch that show religiously.  So maybe this makes sense after all.

      I haven't been sleeping that much lately, at least not as much as I'd like to.  I have to get up early now but for some reason, I can't seem to stop my nocturnal habits so I end up screwing myself over in the end and being very tired at the most inopportune times.  Today, let's see...what did I do today?  I actually did a lot.  I worked until 3:30pm then went to Target to get a new throw blanket (my other gave the one in the family room to my sister when she came into town for my other sister's wedding.  Sure, mom, just keep givin' our stuff away :), cleaning supplies, and some other stuff.  When I got to the check out line, my body sponge (which I still call a "loofah" though I am very aware that loofahs are those beige, sandpaper-ish dried up sponge things) didn't have a tag on it so the checkout girl had to call customer service who then pages the "health and beauty" dept who then calls the register that I'm at and gives the checkout girl the code for the tag.  Now, I don't know about you, but that's a little extravagant for a freakin' loofah?!  While we were waiting for health and beauty to call, the check-out girl starts talking to me and asks me things like, "Would you call this an orange?", while holding my loofah in her hands and tossing it back and forth from one of her hands to another (hey, I have no idea where they've been and we're talking about my future loofa, the one that I'm going to be using to clean my body.  I'm not paranoid but it was just gross), and I reply very dryly, "It's a peach".  And so we wait and wait some more then I finally volunteer to just go get another loofah with a code on its tag and I bring it back to the register with me and throw it in the bag myself and tell her that I wanted "a purple" instead.  So that was how Target went. :)  Then I headed over to Albertson's and got an Iced Chai Latte with Soy at the Starbukcs inside the store and boy are those things yummy.  They taste like gingerbread men.  I think its my new favorite drink.  And I found out that if you go to a Starbucks in a Safeway and use your Safeway Select card with your purchase, you get the 8th drink for free, which I think is really cool cuz this is the first that I've heard about Starbucks doing any sort of a frequent-buyer-card thing.    I really don't want to see "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton:.  Granted, the guy from "Las Vegas" is in it and he's kinda hot but something about Kate Bosworth's bangs bother me.  I don't know what it is...remember that halloween movie that was a cartoon about a boy whose head turns into a pumpkin and he has to save his family from being turned into pumpkins by the evil witch that lives in some dark mansion?  I don't know the name of it and I really wish I could give you a better description but I do remember a scene where they're outside of the mansion and all of his family members are in this big tree and the tree gets lifted into the sky and starts spinning...does any of this ring a bell with anyone?  Anyway, my point is Kate Bosworth reminds me of the pumpkin-head in the movie.    Then I just kinda hung out at home for the rest of the night.  I had some phone calls with Justin and Mari (and I have to call Tiesha back) and talked with Nick on-and-off throughout the night, which is how it usually goes when we're hanging out at our own homes for the night.  I watched  t.v., gave myself a pedicure, used this French Clay mask from Burt's Bees that Nick's mom gave me for Christmas, and flipped through the new Glamour.  I like these nights.  Sometimes, it's really relaxing to just stay in and take care of myself and do my own thing.    Okay, now it's time for bed or otherwise, I'll be very tired tomorrow and not fun to be around.  Goodnight, ya'll!

      Tonight is one of those nights I feel like writing but have nothing to say.  I should probably go to bed since I have to be up for work in 6 hours.  My body's tired (I went on the treadmill for 30 mins today!  Yay!) but for some reason, I just can't seem to get myself off this chair and go get ready for bed.  Oh no...now I can.  Maybe I just needed to write that down to get it off my mind.    I think it's good to be happy but some people are always so jolly and for no reason at all.  I'm not saying you need a reason to be happy, I would like to think it's nice to just always be in a good mood, but some people seem to have struck gold with the pot of neverendling happiness and I can't help but feel like they're cheating me out of getting to really know them.  My automatic judgment is that they're hiding something, burying something underneath their skin and just appearing to be happy when there's really something going on.  I don't ever want my friends to be this way with me.  I never want them to sugar-coat how they're really feeling because then they're not being real.  I want true friendships, not tons of acquaintances that I have superficial relationships with.

      Okay, so I set up my digital camera and downloaded some pictures of Nick's dog that I had taken a few weeks ago but I still can't figure out how to post pictures on this blog or in emails.  The photos get uploaded and put in a folder under " my pictures" but I can't seem to post them anywhere.  Help...  I think I smell like little children when I get home from work.  Don't freak out, I work with kids all day but who knew their "baby" smell would rub off?  I like working.  I feel productive and useful and maybe it's sad, but I have to feel needed in order to feel good about myself.  I like that I have a list of errands I have yet to run, that I'm too tired to get on the treadmill (though I really want to), and that I don't have much time to relax.  This is what makes me feel good.

      I think I'm beginning to exhibit pack-rat tendenices.  My desk is so cluttered and every time I get around to cleaning it, I can't get myself to throw anything away.  Maybe I just need a bigger desk.  Hmmm...  I have piles of papers, all deemed "important" by me.  Or maybe I just need to re-organize.  I've decided to go vegetarian again.  I will, however, continue eating fish and dairy because I'm a growing girl and I need my nutrients.  I started eating meat about three years ago and it has contributed to my significant weight gain (okay, so it's significant to me but that's cuz I still remember the body I had three years ago and I know that that body is still attainable).  In 5 years, I don't want to look back and say, "Oh, I used to look good" when I know I can do something about it now.  I'm not going to put off being healthier any longer because for once in my life, I really am uncomfortable in my skin.  I can still fit into most of the clothes I wore a few years back but that doesn't mean anything.  All my hard work on the treadmill and pilates is now embarrassingly evidenced in my flab.    Being vegetarian is fun.  That's when I actually enjoyed food because you start becoming really creative with what you eat.  If I hadn't been a vegatarian, who knows if I would've ever experienced Thai (my fav), Indian, or mediterranean foods?  (Pita Jungle, your garlic dip ROCKS!)  Or maybe I can attribute that to Mina's influence cuz she's the one who always took me to different kinds of restaurants whenever I went down to see her in Tucson during her college days.  I was staying at her's and Aaron's place all week for two main and one sub-reason.  Main reason #1) Aaron was outta town so she asked for my company.  Main reason #2) I was fighting with my parents and I really needed time away from them.  Sub reason:  It's closer to Nick, all of my friends and my favorite places to go.  It's hard hanging out down there on a weekday night, only to drive 30 mins home whole fighting to stay awake on the road the entire time.  But, it's my choice to make the drive and take the risk DWT (driving while tired) but it sures beats a night home with my parents.  And sometimes it's nice to just stay in but I think if I had the choice, I'd rather be down in Mesa.

      I got this off of my friend's website.    1. What did you do in 2003 that you'd never done before?   I took the road less traveled.  I let go of my strict self-made plans and started listening to my heart and getting to know myself better.  2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year? I usually don't make new year's resolutions so there's a huge chance that I won't be making more of them.  3. Did anyone close to you give birth?  Not this year.  4. Did anyone close to you die?   No.  5. What countries did you visit?  Canada and Mexico.  2002 was so much better.  6. What would you like to have in 2004 that you lacked in 2003?   That extra "umpf" I need to really go forth whole-heartedly with my goals.  I'm an ambitious person but lack the spirit to execute my goals.    7. What date from 2003 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?  Sitting in the bar at our hotel in Boston, watching the news as Dubya is telling the nation about his plan to rid the Husseins.  It was my last collegiate Spring Break vacation and this is how it was spent.  8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?  Graduating from college, though I bitch about it a lot, the day I received my diploma in the mail was quite exciting.    9. What was your biggest failure?  Graduating from college with the wrong degree.  This is so not how I planned my life to go.    10. Did you suffer illness or injury?  No.  11. What was the best thing you bought?  My scrapbook.  I love getting it out after every few occasions and putting it all together with cute pics and shiny markers amd glittery glue!  12. Whose behavior merited celebration?  Anyone who has made a difference in somebody else's life.    13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?   I try to not let people get to me.  14. Where did most of your money go?   Going out to bars, restaurants, and the movie theatres.  Also, I have this knack for shopping.  15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?  Figuring out what I truly love to do in life and planning a way to make my dreams a reality.  16. What song(s) will always remind you of 2003?  Sadly, 50 Cent's "In Da Club" only cuz it was everywhere!  Who didn't know that song?  17. Compared to this time last year, are you:  i. happier or sadder? sadder ii. smaller or larger? larger iii. richer or poorer? poorer but not for long But don't feel bad, I'm workin' on it!  I have a plan...  18. What do you wish you'd done more of?  Spending time with Justin, Tiesh and Coley...I miss you guys and love you and think about you more than you know.  19. What do you wish you'd done less of?  I wish I had spent less time planning and more time being in the now.  20. How did you spend Christmas? With my boyfriend's family and my own.     21. Who did you spend the most time on the phone with?  Nick  22. Did you fall in love in 2003?  I stayed in love...awwww.  23. How many one-night stands?  I'm not a hoe.    24. What was your favorite TV program?  I like shows on TLC, Discovery-Times (it's a collaborative effort by Discovery and NY Times...tres interesser), and old syndicated Saved By The Bell episodes on PAX and TBS.  25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?  No, the shit list has pretty much stayed status-quo...;)  26. What was the best book you read?  The best book I've read wasn't read this year.  27. What was your greatest musical discovery?  Jason Mraz  28. What did you want and get?   A digital camera, a Louis Vuitton purse, countless items to feed into my materialistic ways.  29. What did you want and not get? Money.  I could always use more of that.    30. What was your favorite film of this year?  LOTR  31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?  My 22nd birthday was spent at Four Peaks Brewery with a good handful of my friends.  Then we all left and went to Ra on Mill which ended up sucking out all the energy from the crowd so everyone left right at 1am.  No after party...so it kinda sucked but I was surrounded by loved ones.    32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?  Nothing.  I don't really wish to change things that have happened in my life, good or bad...  33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2003?  Less fashionista, more simple, casual and financially conscious.  I used to buy clothes without looking at the price tag but now I'm a bit older and I pay for my own clothes which explains how ugly my wardrobe had gotten because I can't afford nicer things as of this moment.  What I eventually want is a look that is elegant, timeless and sophisticated yet contemporary and not washed out.    34. What kept you sane?  Having talks with Nick.  He always seems to know when I'm having a problem, even if I don't say anything to him.  And he doesn't try to get it out of me, either because he knows I'm the type of person who will come to you if/when I need help and that if you try to pull my emotions out of me, it'll just make me push you away farther.  I like that he is patient with me and understands how I process emotions.  All my life I've wanted space and he backs off just far enough without getting off radar.  35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?  Orlando Bloom.  David Beckham.  Justin Timberlake.  Colin Ferrell.  Hugh Grant.    36. What political issue stirred you the most?  I don't know if ya'll knew, but there was some news about some sorta invasion into Iraq?...  37. Who did you miss?  Justin.  Tiesha.  Nicole.  Mari, though we talk often, I feel like we're not on the same level anymore.  I miss our talks and you knocking some sense into me whenever I get all flighty and overwhelmed.  And of course, Joel.  38. Who was the best new person you met?  My sister's new in-laws.  They're lovely people and I'm glad that they're part of our family now.  39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2003:  Make the most out of your college years and don't pass up on any opportunity.  Your friends going to Mexico on the fly?  Go.  Never been to a kegger?  Go.  The years go by really, really, really fast.  Graduate without regrets.  That will be your key to happiness.  If only I had known this four years ago...  40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:  "I wished I'd a known you Wished I'd a shown you All of the things I was on the inside" -"Top of the World" by the Dixie Chicks

      Happy New Year everyone!  I got so wasted last night but let me say, it felt so damn good!  It's always fun to just let go every once in a while, it's kind of like cleansing yourself.  Though you're drunk, it's highly rejuvenating, especially if you rarely get drunk.    Here is how my new year's night:  Mike and his roommate from UofA, Irvin came and got us (Nick and I) from Nick's house and we headed to Teakwoods in Gilbert to start off the night.  What we ended up starting the night off with were tequila shots and margaritas.  After hanging out there for a bit and getting a slight buzz, we headed over to Shayna's house for the party and from that moment on, everything is a blur...but in a fun way.  :)  Let's see, there was definitely drinking going on.  Lots of it.  Mixed in with lots of socializing with people I've never met (and some guy telling me a sneeze is like an orgasm...??) and let's see, oh yeah, did I mention there was lots of drinking going on?  There were, like 5 people inside and none bothered to come outside and let everyone know that midnight had passed!  So, we all ended up missing the countdown but Nick and I did our own little countdown so everything turned out okay.  ;)  I think I passed out around 2am and I woke up a little while later to find that half the party had left.  So, the rest of us there ate chips/salsa and I made easy mac for my boys and we left around 3am.  And yes, I vomited when I got to Nick's but it felt so good and I wasn't hungover at all today!  However, we did sleep in until arond 3pm, hey we had a lot of alcohol to sleep off!  We went to BJ's brewery in Chandler Mall for dinner then went and saw "Something's Gotta Give", which I don't recommend to anyone who isn't a successful, mid-40's, divorced woman.  I can't believe I paid money to sit 2nd row and watch old people make out.

      I know these weblogs are quite self-indulgent.  Many people who have one write very affectedly, knowing that others are reading what they have to say and only wanting to write what others want to read.  I, on the other hand, know that nobody reads this.  Well, may be a few people, but that's okay with me.  For one, I don't really write in here about what's going on in my life anyway.  I write mostly about how I'm feeling at that moment or just blurt out random thoughts that have no meaning or pertinence.    I think, mostly, I write in here for me.  The days are so blurred that this allows me a somewhat chronological idea of my life.    My new thing is cooking.  Man, I'm gonna be such a good cook!  Rachael Ray is totally my idol and I'm addicted to the food network.  Not cuz I'm hungry but because watching chefs cut, chop, grind, and mix food is so relaxing and meditative.  It also awakens my creative side.  I watch Rachael Ray make something and think, "Hey, I could do that!  But I'd add this-or-that and make X into a side dish instead of a topping..."  The two recipes I wanna perfect right now are the taco salad and mussaman curry.  Yummy.

      I'm a good person.  My boyfriend tells me so.    Sometimes, I feel as though I'm in way over my head.  Do you ever feel so emotional that you lose yourself in it and then realize later on that you really have no idea what you're saying/feeling/doing?  I'm either fucked or really in awe of myself.  Who do you listen to when you can't trust your own thoughts?  I'm a good person.  I hold doors for people behind me, I let others in first on the elevator, I never cuss around older or younger people and I take care of myself so others won't have to worry about me.  I really try to do what's right.  But, right now, I'm feeling really dealt with.

      There's a bright side to driving so much:  it gives me time to think.  I wish I had a tape recorder or something because my most insightful thoughts occur when I'm driving.  And believe me, they are worth writing down...:)  Now if I could only remember what I was thinking...  But I don't.  So I will move on.  I've become addicted to www.emode.com.  They have the best online quizzes!  They're so cute and original.  For instance, I now know that my signature city is Seattle, my emotional IQ is 130, my wedding date is July 28, 2007 (I'll be 26 then, which will do), and what renews me the most is shopping.  Hey, I've never been one to ignore the urges for retail therapy.  There are so many things that I want.  I've recently bought a few new books, there are some more that I'd like to purchase, I'm running low on MAC stuff so I'm thinking about getting their tinted moisturizer and sheer shimmer powder (so that my skin will glow instead of looking cakey with foundation and regular loose powder) , there is this new Louis Vuitton wallet that I want, and last but not least, Banana Republic has their spring line out and I want to stock up on those Martin Fit pants!  I really do indulge.  I tend to "overlook" the price tags and for that, I am guilty.  Another thought...why don't I have any Asian friends?  It's not like there's a shortage of Asians in Arizona.  Come to think of it, I've never really had any Asian friends and I find this very odd.  Here's the 411 for all you non-Asians:  In every city, there is this sort of underground Asian community.  They mostly stick to their own nationalities but I would say an underline unification exists between all parties.  The Koreans (or shall I say, "Koreanz"  haha), the Chinese, and the Vietnamese are the primary groups.  My guess is that the Japanese either a) keep to themselves, b) there aren't enough of them, or c) are the silent minority of this community of silent minorities.    They all go to church together, hang out together, and all in all are a very tight-knit community.  I've never been able to break into this.  There is this barrier that I can't seem to get past.  My parents are "in".  They know EVERYBODY in the Korean community here.  Every Korean restaurant or store we go into is owned by their friends.  And all their friends have kids.  And all these kids hang out with each other.  And the more they hang out together, the tighter the Korean community becomes and the more distanced I feel from my own people.  In grade school, we all knew each other and probably hung out in a big group during the holidays.  But high school began and the good  (intelligent ones) and bad (experimental, curious) seeds starting sorting themselves out.  You see, I was somewhat in the middle and that's the reason why I've never been able to fit "in".  I maintained mostly above average grades and always enrolled in at least one AP class every semester but I also did some crazy things that I'm not too proud to admit.  I grew in my own way and found m own path and I guess that's the most important thing that's come out of this realization.    I don't really want to be "in", yet I don't understand why I've always been "out".  I swear, sometimes I experience the bi-racial syndrome.  But instead of  being  too Asian or too White, I'm  acting  too Asian or too White.  I'll be honest.  I do wish I had at least one Asian friend.  A Korean girl, around my age, who wasn't so devoted to anything else besides her personal happiness.  This would be nice, because I'd have someone to relate to and who would REALLY TRULY understand where I'm coming from.  And then, she could introduce me to her Asian friends, then we'd all start hanging out and eventually I'd be "in".  ;)  p.s.  to my boyfriend:  we make a good team.  and bravo to our timing!  i love you.

      I had a dream in which I saw the faces of my future children.  I take this to mean something, like a rite of passage into maternity hood.  This is not to say that I want to have children anytime soon.  I love kids but I'm way too young to be thinking about making any.  I want to travel, be free, and indulge in my individualism before I have to settle down for a lifetime in surburbia.    But, I'm not ready to do that yet.  I'm so far from it.    I saw my children.  The eldest was named Emma and she had a younger brother named Jake.  Her eyes were round on the bottom and slanted on top and her eyebrows had a perfectly round curve (thank goodness because bushy eyebrows seem to run in my family).  She was holding her little brother's hand, the way an older sibling does with just the right amount of protection.

      When I was younger, I was terribly afraid of tornados.  Granted, I had never actually seen one or knew anything about them.  Judging from the pictures I had seen, I knew that they were these amazing and uncontrollable forces of nature that dropped onto the ground on its own agenda, plucking up and throwing everything in its way.  It was the sky's tamper-tantrum and nothing but itself could calm it down.    The summer monsoons in Arizona can be so beautiful and though I appreciate them now, as a child, they freaked me out.  The calm before the storm would devastate me.  The sky would be gray and the clouds positioned ominously low.  The air, colored a thin beige, would stand so still that you wouldn't move, for fear that you'd upset some sort of balance that this calm was trying to prepare.   I'd go outside and the clouds looked like they were about to touch the ground.  I had no ideas how tornados formed, much less know that Arizona was not geographically located in the "Tornado Alley".  My pulse would increase, I'd develop a lump in my throat, my palms became sweaty, and I was so sure that this tornado had singled me out and was coming straight for my backyard.  I wanted to rush inside and call my parents but my eyes would not stray.  They were so fixated on the sky.  The tornado was coming to get me.  I had done something bad and this would be my punishment.  It would strike down, just on my house and rip it to pieces and take my family away.  Thinking back, I wonder why I thought I was being punished.  Why was I acting like a masochist?  Why did I think that I deserved to be punished?   So, today was Valentine's Day and I suppose I should say a few words about love and relationships.  First of all, this is a bullshit holiday and no one should be treated better today than they would any day of the year.  It's just another commercialized holiday and plus, everyone knows I can't stand girly stuff, like hearts, stuffed animals, or anything pink.  Flowers are a nice gesture, but they would mean so much more if I were to receive them on any other day for "just because" reasons, not due to pressure from Hallmark and FTD.  And they would have to be lilies.  :P  I'm so grateful to have a wonderful boyfriend who loves me unconditionally.  As I love him the same.    I'm reading two new books, "Fear of Flying" and "The Professor and the Madman"...I'm so excited!  Also, has anyone been able to find "Empress Orchid", the new book by Anchee Min?  I've gone to a handful of bookstores and they're all out.

      I really don't have anything to write about.  My life is rather boring right now.  There are things going on, but none of which I'd like to talk about here.  Maybe later.    I had dinner with the folks tonight.  It wasn't fun and highly embarrassing.  Korean people seem to think that just because the people around them don't understand them, they can't hear us, either.    I have so much to do tomorrow.  On top of a growing list of errands, I have a job interview.  I'd really like a job right about now.  Sometimes, I feel like such a failure because I have this degree but nothing to show for it.  Or maybe I should just blame Bush and not feel so bad about myself.  :)  So many things to do and I want to do them right.

      According to NAKA (National Association of Korean Americans), there were 9,123 Korean Americans living in Arizona during the time of the 2000 U.S. Census.  The same data shows this:  State         # of Korean--Americans Georgia      28,745  Texas         45,571 Virginia      45,279  I have to ask...why the heck are there so many Koreans in the South?  Why would they wanna live there?  Brave, brave people, I must say.

      I've decided to take on political activism.  Now that I'm a U.S. citizen, I feel that my actions can actually make a difference.  Don't worry, I won't be turning into one of those radical political activists who rants and raves about current political news on their weblog.  I'm not that outspoken.  But, I will be doing as much as I can to support the organizations that believe and want the same things that I do.  I'm interested in so many different things but I've been able to narrow it down to these three as my major platforms:  - The Department of Peace (www.dopcampaign.org).  We need this.  Yes, it creates another cabinet position but I really believe in this idea.    - National Organization for Women (www.now.org).  I don't know if I'll ever want to have children but I'll still fight for women's reproductive rights.  I just want to be assured that my rights are protected.  - Human Rights LGBT campaign (www.hrc.org).  I make a good activist for this cause because the idea of the Federal Marriage Amendment (www.allianceformarriage.org) really pisses me off!  That's right!  I'm fucking irate!  And an irate activist makes for a passionate one.  I don't know if I'll ever be married myself but it break my heat to think that my closest friends, who are gay, aren't able to share in something that I am.  And fuck this "civil union" shit.  They should be given MARRIAGE rights and nothing lower than that.  LGBT's should not have to lower their standards.  The thought of that just pisses me off!  Uh-oh, here I go again...  John Kerry is only for civil unions and unfortunately, he is the our best chance of getting a Democrat in office.  Dennis Kucinich was the ONLY Democratic presidential candidate that supported gay marriage.  That's right.  Kucinich would not settle for anything less that full-on marriage rights for LGBTs.  I really want to kick myself in the ass for not supporting him more and rallying for his nomination.  I really should've been more active.  Granted, it always pays to be active but I feel like it would've mattered more when he was still in the race.  I was too busy listening to Dean (how could I not hear him?  I mean this figuratively so all those Deanies don't get pissed) and being charmed by Edwards.  Damn his sweet Southern smile.  Damn him.  Oh well.  Now all we have is this guy who looks like the tree people in "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers".  And he sounds like them, too.  Can't wait to hear those State of the Union addresses.  I bet UPN's "Girlfriends" would get higher ratings.    - And, of course the ACLU (www.aclu.org) because everyone should be fighting for civil liberties.  Okay, I'm off my soapbox.

      I really don't have anything to say.  Why do I feel so obliged to my weblog?  An update?  Hmmm, let's see...  Tonight I had dinner with my family, thus including my aunt and uncle who are visiting from Seoul.  My aunt has a familar face but my uncle does not.  He keeps asking me if I remember him.  Apparently I used to go over to their house all the time.  They have a daughter around my age so I guess we used to hang.  But, I don't remember any of this so I wish he'd stop asking.  No offense, but I've been going through a lot lately and mindless banter is just one of the many things I don't have the patience for anymore.  I've been thinking and I must say, my mom is rather cool.  She's been completely understanding and supportive of what I'm going through and I really respect her for respecting me.  It's taken 22 years but I think I'm starting to LIKE my mother.  Sure, she pisses me off to no end and her nagging is pure hell but she's not so bad anymore.  Every once in a while, she treats me like an adult and those are the times that she really shines.  I can see all these sides to her personality when I'm not looking at her as my mom but as a person.  She's fun and sociable and full of vibrant energy!    I'm going to be an amazing parent.  I'm not going to shelter my children.  I'm not going to protect them from seeing things as they are.  I'm not going to sugarcoat reality for them.  I'm not going to be overbearing, overprotective, or overindulgent.  I'm going to let them wander, explore, ride whatever wave they're on.  I'm not going to hold them back from the truth or try to read their minds.  I'm not going to put words in their mouths.  I'm going to let them decide what is best for them.  I'm not going to intrude, invade, or infringe in their matters if I am not invited.  I am NOT going to control them but instead, let them control themselves.    I'm tired so off to bed I go.  Goodnight!

      Thing that annoy me:  -Pro-Lifers.  Hey Ladies, thanks for setting back the movement 30 years and putting us in our place.  Let's not give ourselves the right to make our own choices.  Let's instead let the men do it for us.  While we're at it, can I have a man carry my bags and walk me to my car?  We're helpless women-folk...after all, we're stupid enough to allow men to make our decisions for us, right?   -Those who oppose gay marriage.  What is it about gay people that is so threatening?  Conservatives argue that they want the sanctity of marriage to be upheld between a woman and a man because that is how it is to be intended.  Intended?  By whom?  God?  And though I believe in God, I also believe in the separation of church and state.  Politicians who oppose gay marriage use religion as their excuse but don't they have a civic duty to uphold the law and not to base it on their religious convictions?  And what about those who say the only purpose of marriage is for procreation...I think that's a totally weak and bullshit argument.  There are heterosexual couples who do not have or plan to have children.  Should we just not allow them to marry, either?  I don't know if I'll ever want to have children.  If I were to marry, wouldn't my situation be just as same as gay couples?  Yes, it would.  Why am I allowed to marry?  I, a heterosexual woman with no intent to procreate?   -People who say "Indian" when referring to Native Americans.  And while we're at it, those who think I'm referring to Native Americans when I say "Indian", when in fact I am referring to people from India.  Columbus made a nasty mistake centuries ago and we're still paying for his ignorance.  When I say "Indian", I mean Indian.  And if you don't get it, it is not my responsibility to clarify anything to you.    -People who spell the word "definitely" as so:  "definately".  It is wrong.  Fix it now and never make this mistake again.    -People who ask me if I need help.  I don't have pride issues so I will ask you if I need help and unless I do, assume that I don't.    -The fact that I'll probably have to vote for Kerry when there are so many more eligible candidates out there.  Ugh...but then again, I did always say that I'm on the "Anyone but Bush" wagon.    -Those out there who think liberals are nothing but environmentally-friendly, vegetarian, PBS-watching, PETA-supporting, radicals.  Well, so what if they are?  It doesn't sound so bad to me (except for the radical part).  -Thai curry made without coconut milk...like, did you intentionally forget the main ingredient, Pink Pepper restaurant?  Huh?  Huh?!  Why can't every restaurant I go into be Mint Thai, or at least have their menu on the side, just for me!

      I'm tired but sleep seems so far away.  Why do I fill out stupid surveys about myself and post them here?  It's ridiculously self-indulgent, I know, but it sure beats having to talk about current events in my life (because  that  wouldn't be self-indulgent).  I miss the first week I came back from Paris.  I had gotten so used to the European keyboard that all my "a's" became "m's" and so forth.  I miss the re-adjustment period, it was symbolic to me re-adjusting to life back at home.

      I feel kinda bad because I have nothing to write about.  Yet, I owe this blog an update.  Let's see...hmm...I'm interviewing for a ton of jobs this week.  It feels good to know that I'm not being overlooked.   Finally, having a degree is paying off.  Some people have told me that it doesn't matter what your degree is in as long as you have one and I'm beginning to think that's true.  I'm overqualified for most of the jobs that I'm applying for but the economy sucks right now so I'll take what I can get.  I'm not looking for something that'll advance my career, that's what grad school is for.  In plain honesty, I'm just looking for something that'll pass the time, pay the rent and distract me for a few hours a day.  I know this sounds bad, like I've given up on myself, but it's not like that.  I have full faith that I will one day have my dream journalism job.  I envision myself living in some coastal town, decorating my Cape Cod house, working as a columnist for The NY Times (I can email copy to my editor!) or as a journalism prof at some nearby small liberal arts college and relaxing on Sunday afternoons with Nick, a golden retriever and a good book.  I sound so domestic but really, all I desire is a peaceful life where I can hear the ocean waves from my bedroom window.    My new thing:  Going on the NY Times website and checking out the real estate section.  Try it and fantasize about your dream loft in the Upper West Side (East is too snobby).  $1.2 mil for a 2 bedroom apartment?  Sounds crazy but only in New York City.    I am craving Mint Thai but rarely have the time/energy to go get it.  It's sooooo far from me!  But so worth it so maybe I'll treat myself and go the extra distance later this week.  Mussaman curry w/tofu and white salad sans chicken, here I come...

      I'm sorry I never told you.  Please don't think I was trying to keep it from you.  It was never my intention to hide it from you.  You're an adult and I'm not going to step in and "protect you" from the truth.  I was just respecting the needs of someone very important in my life.  That is what I've been doing all along.  I tend to withdrawal from others when I'm facing a problem because I'm a private person.  I don't like everyone knowing about my business and I also don't like people telling me how to handle my problems.  This is called advice and I only take advice when I ask for it.  I'm not trying to be rude but I want to be direct.    I deal with things independently.  I don't like to cry and go to my friends.  I like to go into my room, lock my door and deal with the problem by myself or with one trusted friend.  I like having the comfort of knowing that my friends are there to support me when I need it, but I would also like my friends to know that I'll probably handle the situation on my own.  Sounds like I wanna have my cake and eat it too but remember, people deal with things in different ways.    There is only one person that I whole-heartedly trust with my life.  There is only one person who I will go to for support because he already knows the blueprint of my emotions and   will understand me better than anyone else.    I'm not trying to be rude but please understand that this is how I am.  I'll be distant, unfriendly, quiet and reserved but please don't take it personally.  I don't despise you, in fact, I thank you for being there even when I've refused your help.  Your presence means so much to me.

      I'm sorry that I haven't been posting a lot.  I've been going though some changes and I'd rather not talk about it here until things are a bit more stable.  I'm sure ya'll can tell I've been avoiding matters of the heart, seeing as though all I post are surveys that I get off of random blogspots, xangas, and livejournals (these online journals are quite addicting).  Believe me, if I wanted to reach out and get support, I would but I'm not like that.  My support comes from inside me...well, and Justin.  ;)

      My days are uneventful but I'm okay with it.  I like being on somewhat of a schedule.  It makes my hectic life a little easier.  I tend to do the same things everyday.  I eat the same breakfast, I eat the same lunch, I eat a variation of the same dinner and I'm in bed by the same time every night.  And this is what I do to get through the day.  I've had an epiphany.  Most of my friends are fair-weathered.  They say you'll know who your real friends are after going through something like this and they were right.  I've counted and so far I've only got two true friends and you know who you are.  You think your day is tough?  Try living in my shoes for an hour.

      I had an okay weekend.  First and foremost, I got to sleep in!  That in itself was more than enough for me.  Working full time has really put a dent in my schedule.  I hardly have the time to do anything anymore.  But, I don't mind it because I like my work, it keeps me busy, and it's paying the rent!  Anyway, on Friday night, Nick and I had a date night.  It was so cute!  I rented Bottle Rocket and The Fog of War but we never got around to them cuz we stayed up until 2am just talking.  We don't get a lot of private time, which is completely understandable, but it was really nice of him to plan a night just with me, so we could catch up on being a couple.  I slept in on Saturday until 1:30pm then rushed to my haircut appt at Carsten's, which was schduled for 2pm.  The girl did a really good job.  I susually leave the salon fidgeting with my hair because I'm not comfortable with the style but this time, I left with full confidence that my hair looked good.   I ran about a billion errands afterwards then went to hang out with Nick for a while.  We watched Bottle Rocket with his parents and then I left to go hang out with Justin.  We met at his apt and then his friend Jennifer dropped us off at Pookie's.  We stayed there until 12:30am-ish (there was a really fun drag show going on!) then headed over to Charlie's with a couple of his friends for after hours.  I've realized that my tolerance is shit.  I know I've never really had one worth bragging about but now it's non-existent!  I had maybe 5 Coronas and that was enough to keep me drunk all throughout after hours, all throughout the dancing, and up until I passed out on Justin's bed at 4am!  And what a bed it is!  I am going to steal his sheets and covers because I'm convinced that Justin's discoverted the formula for the most comfortable bed ever!  Let's put it this way:  satin sheets, down comforter, and the softest duvet ever...wow...  I didn't do much today.  I woke up around noon and headed back to my place to shower.  Then I went and hung out with Nick until 8pm-ish at which point I came back to my place for laundry/cleaning/etc...Sunday is maintenance day.  Now it's 11pm and I'm going to get ready for bed.  I have such a busy day tomorrow and I'm done with being tired all day cuz I don't get enough sleep.  See ya'll later!

      I'm having a hard time gaining perspective.  I think it's one of those times that I'm too prideful to ask for help but I'd really appreciate it.      I feel like all my friends have better things to do.  I don't blame them, I'm not much fun these days but I could sure use a nice conversation.

      On another note, I think Jason Mraz is gay.  I know there have been rumors but I ignored them cuz I think he's cute but now it's undeniable.  Here is my evidence:  1)  I like him. Enough said.  2)  Have you heard his speaking voice?  It's really soft and although it doesn't sound affected, it does mince a little.  Or maybe it's just a nice, Southern-boy voice.  I wouldn't know.  3)  I saw him perform on TRL and he does this hip swaying thing when he's singing and it looks really flaming.  Trust me, I would know.  I've seen more gay guys dance than Mick Jagger has fathered children.    4)  If you go on his website and watch the videos that are titled, "The Making of Jason Mraz" you will notice that there is NOT even one girl in the entire video.  He is surrounded by guys.  Read his journal entries, there is not even one mention of a girl, except maybe his mom or something.      5)  He has a girlfriend, yet he never mentions her.  However, he always talks about how open he is with his experiences and emotions in his songs and shows.  If he were in love, don't you think he would've mentioned it by now?  6)  He was previously enrolled in a Musical Theatre school in NYC.  7)  His best friend in high school came out.  He once said he was confused and thought he was gay, experimented, and found out he wasn't.  Ummm...okay.  Who does that?  Unless you already had the gay building blocks to begin with.  I only had a few points but then I started writing and all these other points came out...just like he should.  Hee-hee.

      An excerpt from the transcript of President Bush's call for an amendment to the constitution that bans gay marriage.   "America's a free society which limits the role of government in the lives of our citizens. This commitment of freedom, however, does not require the redefinition of one of our most basic social institutions.   Our government should respect every person and protect the institution of marriage. There is no contradiction between these responsibilities."  Huh?  It's completely a contradiction!!  If our "free society" is one which limits the role of gov't in the lives of citizens then why is President Bush trying to INTERFERE with the lives of gay couples?  He's just being a bully...and not a very good one cuz I'm not intimdated.

      I am so disgusted by all of the news regarding the Iraqi Prison scandal.  To hear and read about such atrocities as forcing prisoners to hit each other and masturbate to seeing their naked bodies on my television.  I was initially embarrassed to see such a double standard take place.  It's as if we told the world, "Saddam can't torture the Iraqi people but we can!  We're American, so it's okay!"  As an American, I was mortified by the actions of these few soldiers.  They represents our finest and this is what they did.    But, I'm not embarrassed anymore.  I'm pissed.  How dare we set this kind of example?  Thomas Friedman states it best by saying, "It is more important that the president appear to be true to his team than that America appear to be true to its principles."    I couldn't agree more.   urlLink    I agree that those individuals who participated in torturing the prisoners should be punished.  Even though the military might run its laws differently than ours, there is the common law of individual responsibility that precedes everything else.  Since 9/11, people of Middle Eastern and Arabian ethnicity have, for the most part, been treated by Americans as potential terrorists.  Now due to this prison scandal, Americans will be treated as batterers, torturers, and hypocrites by the rest of the world.  We became the biggest international power by living up to the principles and morals we have always attempted to dutifully uphold.  Isn't it odd how the acts of a few can wrongfully represent the intentions of an entire nations?  Hmmm..think about that.

      Wow!  The Blogger people have updated their site and now I have all these cool edit options.  This new format is a lot easier to navigate around so, good job Blogger people!   Anyway, here I go again with an update yet nothing to talk about.  Nothing new is going on in my life.  I moved out (finally!) and started a new job and while these seem like exciting things, nothing really fazes me anymore.  I know that some of my friends were surprised by this news, and I apologize for not telling anybody, but it's really not a big deal to me.  It's nice having a job and income coming in, though it goes right back out to rent and other expenses.  This new kind of stress is somewhat calming.  Probably because it's manageable and I have control over it, unlike some things in my life.  I like my work, I like working.  In fact, I like it so much that I'm looking for a weekend job, just something that'll cover my food/gas expenses for the week.   So, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I like being independent and living on my own and working hard and experiencing the gratitude of it all.    What did I do this weekend...let's see.  On Friday night, I hung out with Nick.  Then on Saturday I went and saw "Mean Girls" with my sister and it was hilarious!  I thought the movie had its flaws (as do most movies) but overall, I had a good time watching it and caught myself laughing so hard that I actually slapped my knee!  That's right, I did a "knee-slapper"!  My favorite parts:  K.G. the Mathletes team captain/part time MC and Damian, who's "too gay to function".  Haha.  Then I went and hung out with Nick for most of the night before heading to the new Dos Gringos to meet up with Tiesha, Tovah, and Mike.  Tovah is so freakin' funny!  I DO feel bad for the guy who was hitting on her but then again he DID say, "So, your name is Tovah, huh?  Are you sure it isn't TiVo?"  Any guy who says that deserves to get a wrong phone number, which is precisely what Tovah gave him.  We left a little early and I was in the mood to keep drinking so I stopped by Fry's on the way home and grabbed a six pack of Corona.  Even though I'm almost 23, I've never bought alcohol in a grocery store before.  I've gone with Nick several times when he's bought alcohol but it's never been for me cuz I'm not much of a drinker.  I guess the weird part is that I was thirsty and craving beer.  That's never happened before.  Anyway, I came back to my apt and one of my roommates, Emily, and her boyfriend (whose name I don't recall) were still up so I had myself a few Coronas and hung out with them.  I really like my roommates.  Even though I don't see them a lot, the times that we are all under the dame roof are always good times.  They're really easy-going, understanding, and just overall nice girls.    Then today I didn't do much.  I went shopping to find some cute accessories for the bathroom and ended up buying just one thing.  Otherwise than that, I spent my night with Nick and headed home around 11pm.  Now, I'm just hanging out in my room, listening to the radio and writing this.  I have so much to do tomorrow!  On top of going to potential employers and filling out applications, I have to switch over my health insurance, unpack some more, and do a load of laundry.  On that note, I will bid adieu.  I hope everyone enjoyed my update.

      Childless by choice  Growing number of couples living lives with 'no complications'  Barbara Yost The Arizona Republic Apr. 30, 2004 12:00 AM   When Cathy Rhodes was about 12, she asked her mother what motherhood was like. The answer: rewarding but challenging.  "I don't think I want to do that," the girl replied. "Is that OK?"   Her mother said it was.  True to her word, Rhodes, now 39, elected not to have children. She and her husband of 12 years, Mike, 37, devote themselves to their careers.   "I like my life," says Rhodes, who works in marketing and lives in Scottsdale. "I love my career. I'm not willing to give that up."  Rhodes is part of the community of women who have opted out of motherhood, and their numbers are increasing.  In 2000, 19 percent of women 40 to 44 (considered the end of child-bearing years) never had a child, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That was nearly double the 10 percent who were child-free in 1980.   Although the numbers include women who are unable to have children, the rise represents what sociologists consider a little-acknowledged trend with wide implications both for individuals and for society. Although child-free couples report greater marital satisfaction and more freedom, the idea still is not completely accepted. And economists worry about what the trend might mean in terms of society's ability to support an aging population with fewer workers paying into such programs as Social Security.  Kristin Park, an associate professor of sociology at Westminster College near Pittsburgh, has done an extensive study of child-free couples and said it's primarily an Anglo phenomenon. Couples without children, she said, are more educated than average, have higher incomes, are more likely to have professional careers and are less religious. And they are not without stigma.  "Not having kids is odd at best," Park says. "There are still some negative images against people who deviate from a 'normal' family."  When Carol Wilcox, 49, and her husband, Paul, 53, married 24 years ago, neither wanted children.   "In the 1980s, it was a radical decision," Wilcox says.   People told them they were selfish or, assuming they were infertile, urged them to adopt.  "The culture we came from was very traditional New England families," Wilcox says.  But the couple felt having children was no requirement for happiness. They spent long hours with their gourmet food and antiques business in Rhode Island.  "That was our baby," Wilcox says. "We got used to a life that was free."  When they needed a "baby fix," they played with their nieces.  "We like kids a lot," she says. "We're happy to play with them and spoil them and send them back to their parents."  Indeed, married couples who choose to remain child-free report the highest levels of marital satisfaction among all couples, says Mary Benin, associate professor of sociology at Arizona State University.   "In the research I've done and others have done, there's a huge transition to parenthood for married couples," Benin says. When couples have children, she says, the marital relationship often takes a back seat as parents try to balance work and family.   "People who are married and don't have kids have less of those conflicts. These people are extremely happy. Childless by choice is an option that works well for some people."  When Rhodes became pregnant several years ago and then miscarried, it was a "wake-up call," she says. She and her husband had to make a decision whether she would have a hysterectomy to treat her severe endometriosis or try pregnancy again.   She had the surgery.  "I love children," says the former high school drama teacher. "I just don't want to bring them home and raise them."   Marielle Marne, 38, is frank about not loving children. She says with a laugh that they tend to be "sticky and needy."  As a little girl, she told her family she didn't intend to be a mother, and they believed her, never pressuring her to change her mind.  "I like animals," she says. She and husband Steven Moore, 47, have 11 pets at their Cave Creek home. "People say I'd be a great mom. I don't believe it." She describes their life as "no complications."  Separate from the social implications, the continuing trend toward childlessness does have broader implications, according to David Popenoe, co-director of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.   New generations are needed to support the pensions and retirement of the elderly. The Census Bureau recently issued a pessimistic report forecasting that the nation's population growth is slowing, worsening the financial status of the Social Security system. By 2050, the population will grow by 49 percent, down from the 87 percent gain in the previous 50 years.  Already social scientists have become alarmed about dropping birthrates in some European nations, Popenoe says, including Spain and Italy, where rates are well below replacement level.   In 2002, the birthrate in the United States was 13.9 per 1,000 people, the lowest rate since data have been available.   America's national character also would change if more couples chose to remain child-free, Popenoe believes. We would lose our child-centeredness, he says. Children would be less valued and become a lower priority. Unsavory elements now held in check to protect children, like pornography, might explode, he believes. "It's good for a country to have children. It keeps morality in line," he said. "Children are what life is all about."  Cathy Rhodes, however, looks forward to the day when all choices are respected equally, when women don't have children just because it's the thing to do. She urges women to weigh the pros and cons of raising children and not be swayed by romantic notions of motherhood.  "We'd live in a much better world," she says. "Every child would be a wanted child."

      I really need to get on a workout schedule.  I'm not gung-ho on losing weight but more intersted in getting fit.  I used to be so much happier with my body and my self-esteem when I used to workout.  Even 30 minutes on the treadmill or a session of Pilates would make me feel great.  I need to do that again.  Just three times a week would be nice.  And now that I've cut back at J Crew, I might actually have time to hit the fitness center in my complex.  I've heard it's really cool, with treadmills, bikes, and weight mchines.  I'll start out slow, with a little cardio first then weight training.  If I was really into exercising, I'd go every day for an hour but it's more like me to go three times a week, 30-45 minutes per session.  The mattress I have now is really a pain in the ass!  My neck and back hurt all the time!  I'm not used to it, it's too firm.  I need something that's very, very soft.  But seeing as though I don't have the means to buy a new bed right now, I'll look into getting one of those featherbed mattress-tops.  Mmmm...  I haven't had any "Mindy-time" lately and it's starting to effect the way I think, my mood, etc...  Now that I've cut back at J Crew, I actually have two days off a week!  That's like having an actual weekend!  I don't mind working on the real weekends, it's better than working on a slow weekday, but I've always been one of those people who needs time alone.  I need solace, not solitude.  One day to run my errands and one day to have time for myself would really make my life better.  I need some new clothes but I'm hesitant to buy anything right now cuz I'm unhappy with the way I look in summer apparel.  Then, of course, I'll have a day when I'm feeling more confident and I'll go out and buy some skimpy little thangs only to come home, look in my closet and see the piles of skimpy little thangs I wore only once last summer that I could wear again now.  Ah, the perils of being a girl...     I really want to get a haircut but yet again, it's that time issue!  I wish my hair was thinner.  Not in the Jennifer Aniston, baby-fine with flyaways kinda way but just thinner.  I have so much of it that it drives me nuts!  Anytime I lean forward, my hair gets in the way.  Anytime I brush my teeth, eat something, write, there it is, constantly in my path!  I know I could pull it back but it's so long now that if I do, I look really young and my face looks rounder.  Perhaps cutting it won't make a difference but I wonder if a technique exists that would actually make hair thinner.  I know there are tons of ways to make hair fuller but please, somebody, fix my hair!    I am craving Mint Thai sooooooooooooooo badly!  Maybe one day I'll have time to go out of my way and get take-out.  Or maybe I'll have my sister order me some Mussaman Curry with tofu the next time she goes, would should be soon cuz they go all the time.

      Although life can be quite tough sometimes, I've realized that there are hidden blessings in almost everything.  Case in point:  I went to donate blood today while Nick was sleeping and I got a free meal coupon.  This may not seem like a big deal but it just so happened that I had no cash on me (the cafeteria only takes cash) and I was STARVING!!  So, yay to free dinners.  I'd donate blood everyday if I could get a free meal.  Another case in point:  I think my neighbors have wireless connection because every so often, it'll be available to me and I can go wireless as well.  I'm doing it right now!  Instead of sitting on my bedroom floor with my laptop on my, well...lap, I'm sitting up properly in the dining room with the laptop on the table.  In case you're wondering, I'm waiting until IKEA opens in August to get a computer desk.  They have this really pretty curvy one with purple legs.  I must have this desk.  There is no other option.  And it's only $50!  Heck yeah!    All I do these days is work, work, work.  Sometimes I have to choose whether to eat or sleep because I don't have enough time for both.  If I'm not at my jobs, I'm either sleeping, eating, or with Nick so please don't think I'm ignoring or avoiding you.  As you'll notice, I don't really complain about being so busy because I rather like it.  Sure it may be trying but isn't that what being on your own is all about?  I'm desperately trying to find the equilibrium of being successfully independent and still liking myself.  It's easy to drive yourself crazy and get absorbed in the rent, bills, and everyday struggles of being on your own.  But I'd rather focus on the liberating aspects of all of this.  I've said "liberating" twice, once in this post and once in the previous.  Maybe I'm subconsciously living off a theme right now.  Who knows?  I don't have time to think about it.  I'm busy.

      Even though I'm almost 23 years old, I still get major crushes on celebrities.  Why can't I go one day without thinking, "Wow...Orlando Bloom's a nice lookin' gent"?  Maybe it's not even him but the tall-dark-and-handsome, British accent thing he's got going on.  I don't even care that he's a movie star, I'm not attracted to men of status.  What upsets me is that he's dating Kate Bosworth, whom I think is incredibly boring.  Simply put, I think he's too good for her.  She's just another blonde actress, probably a size 2 and from a rich, upper class family.  Where's the personality in that?  He should be dating someone with a weird name and an even weirder story on how she got that name.  She should be from Europe, like him, and be knowledgeable on all worldy subjects.  She should eat pomme frites and ham sandwiches and drink him under the table.  What am I saying?  I wish I was a girl like that.  Not for him, because I'm already spoken for, but for the pure enjoyment of knowing that I'm  that  fascinating.  So, Orlando, if you ever read this, dump the blonde and date someone more fascinating.  Someone who'll instigate and provoke every one of your thoughts and beliefs.   I used to be the type of person who planned everything.  I felt that by being this way, I could maintain some level of balance and control in my life.  I relied on my organizational talent for everything.  It helped me see clear through onto next week.  I liked that I could enable structure in my life.    Now, I can't even see what the next hour will bring.  This is liberating.

      I feel so alone in all of this.  No one is there to support me.  They are family, so obviously they have each other to lean on.  But me?  I'm in this alone.  Thanks to everyone who cares.  Oh wait, that's no one.  I'm so tired of carrying this load on my own but it seems like whenever I hint for support, everyone is suddenly too busy.  I guess nothing can keep us from the bars on Friday nights, not even cancer or a friend in dire need of a shoulder and some warmth.  I have to believe that there is some good out there, that some people are genuinely loving and caring.  But my faith in people is almost non-existent these days.  Sad.  Screw it.  Fuck everyone.  I just want Nick to beat this.  To survive.  To grow old with me.

      I just spent the past hour going back and reading through my old posts. My, have I changed, and I'm still ever-changing. I can't believe I enjoyed being a work-a-holic cuz right now, all I want to do is nothing. I can't believe I was depressed about stupid random shit back in late '03. Perspectives and feelings are allowed to change. That's what makes us human and it's a weird feeling to go back and read your past thoughts.  I never thought I'd be where I am. Never did I see it going this way. One thing I've learned is that life is unpredictable so there's really no use in planning it because it'll take its own course. All you can do is be prepared and content with yourself   as of this moment  . Because you never know, this moment may be all that you've got.  My heart is on fire every single day for the love that was taken away. But I still feel him with me, all the time, every moment of every day, sitting right next to me, loving and protecting me.
