              “t h e      f a r t i n g      i n c i d e n t”   Carrie Bradshaw farts. And I fart. No big deal. Even if I did it in the presence of the boys with only the accordion door of the bathroom between us. What have I been doing for the past couple of days? I’m afraid to admit that I haven’t been doing things as much as i expected and I barely have three more days to make things happen. I still plan to go back to the beach, get drunk at Lan Kwai Fong and Wan Chai, go to the National Library, buy things at Mongkok and Ikea, board the star ferry, promenade along the harbor and have coffee at my favorite Hong Kong coffee shop which name I can’t remember. And in the process, I’m having a hard time trying to balance my time with Nobel and Lalen. So you could just imagine the pressure. For the most part, I’ve been sleeping the days off and going out sporadically. So far, the realizations of my dreams have been few and far between. But I’ve already given up on that thought. Given the time limit, I think that I will just have to be content with doing what I can… sort of like “stealing glances”, not so much moving mountains. Meanwhile, my rendezvous with  Jaime  have been moved again. As of this writing, we will be meeting up at the Philippines on July 25 or 26. And I still don’t know what’s gonna come out of it. So help me God.

       “box of professional chocolates”   So what is to become of my professional life?… I am faced with this question and I am filled with uncertainty of Forrest Gump eager to see what’s inside that box of chocolates… in other words, I don’t have the slightest idea… that is why, I guess, I am in this sort of a stump… I am slowly rotting away in the uncertainty of things…  I have written in my journal - “I have been so blessed in life that I don’t have any reason to complain” - not so long ago… and I genuinely felt it… it wasn’t just some beautiful phrase that I felt I had to write down to contrast my whining… I actually believed it… and I still do… it’s just that I have so much time in the world now to do things to earn my keep but alas, work is hard to come by… I’ve had phases like this in the past but It didn’t drag for as long as it does now… maybe because there really wasn’t much urgency at that time… after all, I was working for only myself and it really didn’t matter much as I always had the liberty - and the gall - to come running to my parents for help… but now it’s different: I am in a relationship THAT I TRULY CHERISH - and somehow it requires vast reserves… both emotionally and financially… I don’t actually have a problem with the former… it’s the financial part that is kinda shaky… and the sense of urgency, I suspect, comes from the fact that I would really want to be with him and again, it requires a lot of things… it’s hard to maintain a relationship with all its usual trappings… let alone when you have money issues… it’s not much of a money issue as an obsessive-compulsive issue on my end… everybody knows that I want everything to be perfect, especially with regards to things that really matter to me… Things are kinda looking up with this school tour project… it should be big - 50 schools!… but it still could dissipate… we are moving, God, I am moving… but we still have to see those initials on the C.E… well, I hope it happens… otherwise, I’d be showing up at Livewire not looking like a million bucks and begging for work…  Speaking of Livewire, I don’t have any issues… at all… it is more like I have been away for a real long time… a lot of things have happened - I was in Bicol for a week, in Hong Kong for almost three weeks, with my boyfriend for a day, in Manila for a week, back in Bicol for two weeks, and back in Manila for about two weeks now - and through all these, I wasn’t in contact with any of the people form Livewire… what I mean by all these is that somehow, a re-acquaintance would be in order… I’m sure they want me there… but it’s me… what this probably boils down to is my unwillingness to face the inevitable question, the kind that everybody thinks but nobody says - “so what has become of you?”… I know one of these days, I should show up and just hang out… not out of need for work but because I just basically want to hang out with them, because I just wanna be with them, because I just miss them… and I do… and I am gonna do it… And maybe I should just say yes to that dinner thing with Ms. B. and Ms. Jet… what am I afraid of?… God, Dracco666, you are nowhere near failure…  Sept. 12 / 12:12am
