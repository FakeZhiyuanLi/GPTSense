        So um yea..my night    sux   .&nbsp;  I was   suposed to   go to Krome w/ Kelly and Cassie..But my mother screwed that all up. So I'm spending my night   home alone  ..with my dog Ivo..  Cutting myself  . This just royally sux. My mom had said she thought that cassie seemed kind of   selfish  ..and the more I think about it..the more true it is. Like the only time she wants to hang out w/ me..or even talk to me is when I'm with Kelly..or when they're hanging out and Kelly wants me to come. We used to be   BEST  &nbsp;friends..and now we're   barely even   friends. She moved closer, and instead of helping our relationship..it just recked it. I was rite wen I said Kelly was taking   my   life over..and it's gets truer and truer each day.

      Yest. I went over to Kelly's for the night.   [-] I only got 5.5 hours of sleep last night..  [-] Micheal will NOT stop making fun of me for being short..okay I can tolerate it the first, i dunno, 100 times from the same people, but after that it gets really annoying...really.  [+] We went swimming last night.  [-] I can't hang out w/ Kelly with out Mike being there. It's really pissing me off. She always invites him along EVERYTIME we hang out. Personally, I find him really annoying and immature. Plus, he likes me, and I swear to God if he doesn't stop touching me I'm going to deck him.  [+] As of last night I quit smoking..it's disgusting.  [-] I gained 5 more pounds..I'm now 122.  [-] I have an hour long violin lesson..  [-] It's raining.

      ::Fierce anger is derived by Passion::  I've been thinking about this a lot. The first time I heard it I thought it was crap..but now that I think of it..it's true.   My friends have been bumming me out a lot lately. Just the stupid things set me off. My two best friends (both of whom hated each other before I finally got them to talk..and I was friends w. both long before they even knew each other existed) hang out all the time w/o me. This includes my birthday that was like two weeks ago. It makes me so mad, and it's the stupidest thing in the world. But I guess if they didnt mean so much to me it really wouldnt matter to me..would it?   I'm also a very jealous person. At least over some things. Like if I got hurt by a guy I was with, and he started going out w/ someone else, I'll hate that person for pretty much no reason - for indirectly pissing me off. It really wouldn't matter if that guy hadn't meant anything to me. I dunno..a bit of thought for my night.
