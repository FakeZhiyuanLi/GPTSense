        band camp is over, got a lot done those 5 days, but im hella tired still. so rachel is gone again, for a week. so that means no rachel for a week. she gets her license a little after she gets back. im gonna hang with people i havent seen in a while cause of work/volunteer/band/nfi. finally, hoping the end if summer is good. also hoping school year comming up will be good. i heard my chem class is gonna be HUGE or something like that. my real lunch seems like its gonna be bad. who has lunch-a. but i also have lunch-d with tons of ppl. i might have senior study with rache. so thats good. right now im just doing all that summer assignment work and other stuff. planning to go out monday and other days of the next week. also planning to go to the mall. its a place i dont enjoy but i need clothes very badly.  other than that its been pretty much the same. shows comming up at the end of september. should be interesting. well anyways, ill ttyl soap and gulia. oh the good thing is that i have a ride to school now, instead of stupid buss. thats good. alright payce. ill talk about band camp later... like how it was tiring and the sun, and the glasses, and getting 4 in. but how i really wanted 5 haha. payce

PAYCE!

MADE PEACH COBLER WITH jeff aka payches and mom, im not really gonna count allie, cause just beacuse. it turned out pretty good. i kicked ass in poker, dont even try stopping me now. im just a killer. and then.....thats it i dry humped mike a few times. showed him whose boss, and left. though all this was spread in a span of a long time.  CAMMP monday, still dont kno the songs, thats ok. ill get by ....time to do other stuff BYE. oh yea. more shows are comming

        so its been a while since i posted, and ive been chastised (sp?) by gulia. lemme add the fact that im a bad speller. OK, so friday we had a show in Long Island, NY. FUCKING FAR AWAY. lets say 4 hrs away. it was at a bowling alley. it was alright, they had a 30 thousand dollar PA, but they had it on the setting for the last band. all the horns got cordless mics, EXCEPT FOR ME! wtf! but thats ok. we werent that tight musically and we sounded a little out of tune. but all in all it was a decent show. we met another band thats cool, and we realized the hijinx is really cool. bowling was fun, thought i didnt do too good, which is surprising because usually i do, do good. the ride home was long, but we got through it with jeff on the walk talkies, screaming things. and when we reached mikes house, we played texas hold em all through the night. i didnt get more than a minute of sleep. and....we ate food at mikes, and stuff. so then my dad comes(now saturday) and picks me up, i get in the car. i remmeber that i have to go to some religious thing... i get home, shower, eat, leave to religous thing, i fall asleep at total of 7 times during it. my dad counted for me. but its ok, cause i can get through most things sleeping. once i get home i just go to sleep and sleep all fucking day. like 16 hours or something. in the morning (sunday) i wake up and realize shit no one is home. i have to go to mikes, cause we have a show at bloomfield. and yahtee yahtee yahtaa. i end up being picked up by cara and mike. and we go to mikes. and pack up the cars with all our shit     and go for the hour long drive to bloomfield. alright ill finish this up later, in a new post. dont wanna type about the past anymore. its water under the bridge, but ill leave you with one word about the bloomfield show. STUPENDOUS!
