						    Yeah im gonna forget all this…. But I guess you’ve no idea what im talking about…im gonna be giving u a bit of background…a couple of days ago I was chatting with someone…someone that I ac2ually used to like…and then suddenly I blurted “well,it seems that u talk to no member of the opposite sex....” and this was exactly what I sed,coz I saved that chat.then this person quotes it wrongly saying that I sed  “you don’t have any social life with members of the opposite gender” well that’s not what I sed….it had SEEMS  in it…coz that’s exactly what it seemed like…she didn’t seem to talk to any boy whenever I saw her..so she has mixed it up..and hey a joke’s a joke’s isn’t it?come on she’s taking it uber seriously….and since it seems,that she has no intention at all of forgetting this….eventhough I sed sorry and I admitted I was a jerk the other day then f$ck this!yeah,nagmura ako…ano ngayon!?
