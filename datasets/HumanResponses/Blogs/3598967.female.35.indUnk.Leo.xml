      So, he said he'd be back to talk after the basketball game.  I teased him and asked "even if they lose?" and he said "Especially then. I'll need cheering up"  So the game was over an hour ago and he still isn't back.  An his IM just went offline.  I HATE THAT THIS MAKES ME PARANOID.  I have 100% faith in his love for me.  But why doesn't he want to talk to me?  I don't want to push him or bug him and there could be a thousand and one reasons for it...he's still at his friend's house....they've been drinking....etc.... that would explain why he's not home yet, but the IM going offline after 4 hrs of being idle really does bother me.  It's only 10pm where he is.  Surely he's not going to bed.  Gah. I'm turning into one of those awful girls that just sit by the phone.  My husband already took his sleeping pill, so we have privacy and he's not here.  I guess I just need to pout a bit here so that I don't do it to him.  I DON'T want him to feel smothered.  *pout*

      OMG.  I can't believe I'm doing this.  We have plans in the works to meet up for an entire weekend.  IN TWO WEEKS.  Oh god.  *panic* can I lose 20 lbs in 2 weeks? (That was a joke.)  Seriously though.  I know that he loves me for me, but I still want to be at my very best for him.  Whew. Talk about motivation!  Slim Fast, here I come.  And ooh. I need to get my highlights freshened up... get my eyebrows done...ooh and maybe I'll try a bikini wax.  I hear great things about that.  I just don't want to feel selfconscious about my body so that I can just enjoy being with him.  I mean...he's a great, handsome, single guy. I'm housewife with two kids.  I hope he doesn't expect a single body. I've had babies...I may be in great shape (I'm not) but I'll never look that perky again.  Not that I'm in horrible shape now, I just....oh man....no one's really looked at my body in 10 years. Hell yes, I'm nervous.  But I'm also so incredibly excited.  To actually get to  feel  his arms around me, his hands on me, his lips on mine....I'm in heaven just thinking about it.  Perhaps the guilt will come, but so far, I feel no remorse.  Does that make me an evil person?

      Maybe I am. I just miss him so much. He's watching the Laker game at this mom's house.  How sweet is that?  It's one of the things that I love about him.  He's normal.  He's such a  guy .  He loves action movies and basketball games. :) yummy.  We talked today about how it's so important to have your own life, on it's own merits and want to share it with someone.  As opposed to having no life or making your partner everything.   We are both grownups going into this with our eyes wide open.  No one will die or be destroyed if this doesn't work out... You have no idea what a relief that is to me.  Rereading what I've just written and it sounds as if we've just only met.  Not true.  We've known each other for almost a year, and we've been getting close for the last five months.  We've been intimate with written words for maybe two of those months and last night...whew... last night he made me cum while I was on the  voice chat with him.  With my husband in the next room in full view and me, sitting at the computer trying to behave normally while my whole body was shaking.  It was intense.

      I've fallen in love with the most amazing man.  I am just overrun with ridiculous corny overused phrases about love =) It just feels soooo fabulous.  The downside is that I'm married.  13 years this summer. Two beautiful children.  And believe it or not, I'm a committed Christian who comes from a family where divorce isn't even spoken of, let alone contemplated.  My marriage is as emtpy and hollow as the plastic milk jug I just threw away.  Again, I'm a cliche.  I got married too young (I was 21) and I got married for the wrong reasons (perhaps more on that later).  I've never really loved him, he was just an island of safety when everything else was such choas and he seemed the only sane way out.  He's a good person, and he treats me as well as he can, I suppose.  But there's no passion.  There's not even much friendship anymore.  He works crazed hours and for several years I've turned to the internet to entertain myself after the children were in bed.  That's when I met him.  I need a secret code for him...don't want to use his initials....hmmmm....KD. There we go. I know what it means and you don't need too.  I've chosen to write this journal because I need to get all this stuff in my head and my heart out. It's theraputic.  And I have no one I can talk to about it.  No one I know would be at all sympathetic if they knew I was actually considering have a wild affair.  But there it is, in black and white.

      I talked to him for six hours strait last night.  It was incredible.  Everytime I think I've hit the top, he takes me higher.  I've never been in love like this.  It's ... it's everything that all the movies make it out to be. lol. I just didn't believe that it was possible.  I feel like every love song all rolled up into one.  Today I made my first real, tangible step toward him, throwing caution to the wind.  It's either the best choice or worst mistake I've ever made.  I don't know which yet.

         Neither one of them took off their sunglasses as they kissed. . . he, out of habit and she, out of fear.    For one brief moment, all the bustle of the airport dissolved.    The cars and busses creeping by, the smell of exhaust fumes, the closing of car doors and trunks, soft swish as the revolving doors behind them continued on it’s unending journey – it all faded as she fought to hold on to him for just one more minute.                   “I love you,” she told him as the kiss broke.    The words seemed hollow and inadequate in her ears, but she knew no others.    “I can’t say goodbye. I have to believe that I’ll see you again,” she began, but he silenced her with another kiss.       “Stop that.    Just stop.    Don’t go there.    I love you.    All the rest is just details, right?” He smiled down at her.    “We’ll work it all out.”        Stripping away her last defense, he slid her sunglasses to the top of her head to look deeply into her tear filled eyes.      His thumb brushed her cheek as he cradled her face.                   “You’re the one.    You are the one I’ve been waiting for all my life.    We’ll find a way to be together.”    He paused, waiting for the nod he knew would come.    When it came, he smiled.    “I know you don’t want to go, but you have to.    You are the strongest woman I’ve ever known.    You’ll be fine.    And we are in this together, right?”       Blinking back her tears, she tried desperately to live up to his confidence.    “Yes, of course.    We are in this together.”       His smile was broad.    “Handy,” he said making her chuckle.    He gave her a little push toward the revolving door and forced himself to let go of her.    She didn’t look back until she knew that he was in the car.    Barely five steps into the building, she dropped down to the bottom step of a staircase she didn’t know was there and watched his car disappear around the circle.       And let herself cry.
