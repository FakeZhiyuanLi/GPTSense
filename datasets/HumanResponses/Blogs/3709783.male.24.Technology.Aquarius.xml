      Recently I was promoted into a better position in the company.  Great all around, or so it seems, but what if the newer guy that will be hired is more amazing than me?  What if unlike myself this newer guy does not surf the web on company time?!  Once the mind has opened the box an almost infinite amount of negative what ifs come spooling out.  Of course that meant I could only do one thing, post in my blog about it.  Once I am done with this session of deviance the guilt will force me into an extended lunch break.  Policy and Procedure revisions will update themselves, right?  On the cooler front, the recent upgrade to Active Directory is exciting me in dirty ways.  What starts as a basic upgrade with very naked structure can quickly become a fancy sexy beast of network and identity management that has the potential to give handjobs to nerds and normal users alike.  %windir%\system32\rundll32.exe dsquery.dll,OpenQueryWindow

      (cross-re-post-from-Livejournal)  I am nearing the end of my apartment's lease and just tonight fall in love with the corner bar. Who knew Tuesday nights were two dollar pints of Micros and gloris Wednesday spelled two dollar pints of goose and bells. What a relaxing way to spend after work laundry time.  Looking forward to a company boat cruise tomorrow night. Joel is soo happy it won't be super hot and humid, my back sweats alot. Either way, it is going to cool tomorrow night or the free bar on the boat is air conditioned; I am going to have a blast. Even more cool, Sasha has the pleasure of attending. Joel is thrilled to be able to show such a wonderful woman off. =)  How do you spell cheese tortellini? However it goes I had it today. Peace out to teh hommies&

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite the interesting day.  I was called into the boss's office after lunch of  not grapes , a roast beef sandwich, and was told that a fellow member of the IT staff was getting fired.  Being friends with this person it really shoke me up to hear the news.  At the same time I was torn, for here was a person that was hired from the same consulting firm at the exact same time, he came in at a higher level, making a hefty amount more than me, and obviously there were reasons for firing him.  That all adds up to missing a friend and being excited about what the future holds.  Hopefully I will have the oppurtunity to rise or at least work with someone that is more qualified for the now open position.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We Might see  urlLink FAHRENHEIT 9/11  tomorrow.  Other than that no plans for this 4 day patriotic vacation called 4th of July Weekend.  There are always the fireworks and drunken millions at Navy pier.  Maybe CTA offers free rides the night of, similar to new years?  Showing love to Chicago Transit;  Last year we caught the fireworks from the old #6 whose route consisted of: Leaving Downtown, down Lake Shore, through Hyde Park, along South Shore, and finally meandering into the distant Southside.  No longer in service, parts of the route can still be found alive and well in the new #26 Express route we know and love today.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  urlLink friend  is spinning house records at a house party, also tomorrow, always a posibiity.

      Thanks to  urlLink Bloglines  for introducing me to  urlLink Boing Boing  !  I can tell you it is a news blog, but words can't describe the mix of news this site will throw at you.  Check it out, it's wonderful.

        Finally, a GMail invitation, and.!  Work has not moved to block yet!1 Second invitation went to Sasha.  I guess both accounts will in-turn generate new invitations to pass out to others?  I have generated a few filters and contacts, I bookmarked this migration  urlLink tool , sent a few emails, and that is it.  So far, so good.   In other, much more somber news, the   "One Piece"   Anime Boxset collection  purchased through  urlLink ebay  shipped with no first box..  I contacted the seller and they promise it will be here soon.  The shipping cost is too high not to be annoyed by all this.  At least now I have episodes 31-120.    Just in time for our semimonthly journey to Bloomington/Normal Illinois. Sasha and I make this journey to visit my old college roomates: Craig and Cro.  My good friend and his little brother also make the journey, from my home town, leaving us with six people crammed into a small apartment with their gaming machines.  This installment could see the return of  Everquest  as the major game of the LAN Party Weekend.  Last time this happened I got so burnt out on EQ that I vowed to never play it again.  I will be sure to report back on the ass-kickings I administ0r.
