      I haven't lost a friend, but it sure feels like it. I guess it's growing up. We no longer have anything to say to each other. It just seems a waste. Have I changed that much? Is it time to say goodbye?

      Well today is day one at summer. I've been up since 8 but still haven't done all that much. I'm leaving to go to a friends place soon. Then we'll be off to down town for some shopping and then to the beach for a little fun in the sun. After that we are going to some party. *Smiles probably going to meet up with some Notre Dame girls. SHOP SHOP SHOP I think I'll get me some tna capris.  Checked my e-mail today of the 92 I had 90 unread. I really shoudl check it more often. *Sigh check my other accounts? Meh, maybe later. Woah there was some weird e-mails though. Trevor seemed mad that I never e-mailed him back. I should call him.

      We'll school is almost over. I don't think I'll miss grade 10 so much. I mean sure I might miss Canada and the United Sates and the grads of '04. Never did get to go shopping with Patricia before she graded. Won't have Sug to help me with my math. No Shawn to walk home with. I guess it has all just gone by so fast. I remember being a grade 8 like yesterday. I remember my first crush, first locker, etc. It feels weird that I'm almost in gr 11. I always looked up to the older grades the gr 11's and 12's when I was younger they looked so much older. When I see my self I still look so young. I'm not mature, not pretty, just well me. I'm not sad that grade 10's over, just can't wait for the changes to come.

      One phone call after another, just leave me alone. Why can't you see I'm doing other stuff. Why can't you see I'm not in a talking mood. You try to be helpful but all you are doing is pissing me off.

      Things that pissed me off today. Three things thrown down my top. Number of times someone has touched me in a manner I didn't aprove of too many. Degrading? Yes. Why do I put up with it? Not sure.

      We'll it was my first day of summer school yesterday, it was well "okay". What do you really expect I'm spending the time I could be making money, doing graphics or painting at school. *Sigh I guess it isn't that bad. The teacher seems tough but I'll pass. It's all good thought Mr. L reminds me a lot of him and he was one of my favourite teachers.   *Sigh Keeping two blog sites leaves me neglect this one. I'm not all that fond of blogger. I mean it's a horrible set up. The html on blogger isn't easy to mess aroung with. I like it less than livejournal, that's pretty damn sad because I hate livejournal. Blogger will never be as good as Xanga. Xangas functions are a lot better. It's easier and more private. I love being able to hide entries and only allow some people to read certain ones. Maybe I'll leave this one. *Shrugs I really shoudl change it that damn quote picture is getting annoying.   Complaints: I'm sleep deprived. I don't remember what it feels like to be single. Seriously I stay single for a day or two and than I'm gone off into something new. I have a headache and I've been trying to deny something for the past couple days. I got bruises on my upper thighs (Which my mother freaked about when she saw one of them. I'm just glad she didn't see the rest). I have cuts on my feet from being dragged. I have a spraigned wrist. I'm not so tough, my ex boyfriend saw me and was a little drunk. He decided to beat me. That is the truth and that is what happened yet I guess I'm just accepting it now.  I need a vacation or a reality check. I'm tired of being strong and don't need this shit. All it is doing is making me a bitch because all I do is let everything build up. I'm not one to really complain to others when something is wrong. I build it up till I can't take it anymore. I guess I'm not there really after calming done I realized I'm pretty damn lucky in other ways. I was happy for a while well I thought I was. I mean I'm pretty damn lucky somedays. I have great people in my life, opportunities and if I keep working a good future. *Sigh and I always thought I was pessimistic. Lol Wait that will never change I'm sitll pretty damn pessimistic.
