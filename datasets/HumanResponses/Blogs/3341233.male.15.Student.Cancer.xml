      this morning, woke up with a hurry, my mind was in a hurry, my body was in a rush, everything was zoned and hurrying and rushing... until i found out that there was no practice today.  just anotha time i got conned by my chairman again... sheesh. so irritated. never mind. is everything so bad? is every1 so evil? or is it... coincidence? hmm... i noe dis gal, and she just unconsciously hurts herself and those hu care... she doesnt know... y? muz some take the fall for others all the time? i dont know what to do with everything. all i know is that i'm being torn in so many directions. must it be that way...? maybe i should cut myself away from all this help i must give, this prescence i must maintain, but what would that leave me with? n-o-thing. what does the future hold if i do what i want, rather than what i must? what if the way i want to go is so dangerous that i could fall and fail but if i do succeed, da suffering is all worthwhile? does nobody care? does this life only give suffering, never... joy? you talk to me, but do you care? you hear me, but do you listen? ...you warned me, but did i heed? no... and i ended up with nothing. who can i blame but myself? this fascade i keep up is so fragile, so breakable, but it keeps me happy, protects me from the pain... then again, it blocks me from true happiness, trueness of my heart.. maybe i should just keep it inside, lock it away and throw the key. it will never materialise anyhows. i'm so surprised you actually read this whole chunk of stuff, even i wouldnt read this, haha... thanks for reading this. i'm stuck in all dis, and maybe there's someone who will help me, listen to me... are you reading this? whoeva this person is...   now i gotta sign off but, again, thanks for listening to me. stay happy!
