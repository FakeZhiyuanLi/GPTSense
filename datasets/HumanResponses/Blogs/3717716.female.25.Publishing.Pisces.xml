      I can't believe I forgot to tell you all my wayward pigeon story! you all know that i hate pigeons, and that i've been shat upon by quite a few, but monday night takes the cake. i was sitting in bryant park (with about a thousand other people) waiting for THE THIN MAN (very good btw) to begin. i was sitting on a blanket in the grass; the sun had just started to set; it was a lovely evening. well, that is, until something hits me in the head. i turn around, thinking that some idiot has bonked me with his backpack, and i see a pigeon floundering in the air. the rat with wings finally flies away and it dawns on me that the little rodent-bird smacked me upside my head! if i had better reflexes, perhaps I could have chased down the #*&^@$, but alas, it got away--I was laughing too hard once I realized what had happened and the fact that there were witnesses to my head-on collision!! once i had determined that no icky pigeon poop or other nastiness had stuck to my head and that i didn't have a concussion or anything (Ok so it didn't hit me that hard, but you never can be too careful!), I calmed down and enjoyed my movie in relative piece. ahhh...  in other news: so you know how i have had a major crush, i take that back... how have i been in love with Ferris Bueller for like ever?? =) come on, who wouldn't be?   urlLink    Ferris Bueller you're my hero!&nbsp; urlLink     well, on my evening run down the westside highway yesterday (don't worry, not an actual highway but a lovely path along the hudson river), i saw matthew broderick! in fact, i nearly ran right into him! and as i watched him shuffle away, the years just fell off him and he was transformed, once again, into the boy i love! gone were the extra pounds, the receding hairline, the look of bliss that i can only contribute to new fatherhood... ferris, my love! =)  on a more serious note, when i got home last night i decided to douse my ferris fantasies with a big dose of michael moore! yes, i finally saw Bowling for Columbine! and to be honest, I wasn't as annoyed by him or by the movie as i thought i would be! i know, its shocking. i have to say i was more impressed by his editing skills (the footage from Columbine was eerie beyond words) than his interviewing skills (the bit with Heston was just plain dumb). i found the progression of the movie and Moore's argument to be a bit discombobulated, but overall i thought it was a film that people should see. i don't imagine it would have much impact on the gun-toting, redneck population of this country, but one can always dream.

       urlLink    Melissa and Chris and their wedding party!!&nbsp; urlLink     Even though I'm a big loser and am sticking to my film-fabulous camera, I did have this roll put on a cd so i could share the joy that was my friend's wedding! Unfortunately I drank a little too much cheap white wine at the reception and forgot to take any pics of the actual event, but this is from the night before and includes the whole wedding party. Chris and Melissa are in the middle (looking oh so happy). Bridesmaids are her sister, Amber, and I. Groomsmen are Melissa's bro (not pictured), Paul, and a guy whose name I can't remember! oh how embarrassing!!!  Weddings are pretty crazy aren't they? especially when you are 25 and your friends--people you've known since they picked their nose and ate it (unabashedly)--are all taking the plunge, so to speak. this particular wedding was a couple weeks ago. i flew home for the event, and it turned out to be a totally crazy, emotional weekend. i guess when you get to a point where you are this far removed from 'home,' physically and emotionally, thats the way it works.   Anyway, good times were had by all... don't we look like we are having fun?? my best to the happy couple.

      indeed, it be monday. back at work after a fun-filled weekend. too much food, too much booze, and a whole lotta pride! i sat in the window of johnny's and drank myself silly while watching the overflow from the parade. i have to say, halloween and gay pride in the village are two events you have to see at least once.   in other news... the running is going well. i'm still adopting a wait and see attitude for the marathon in november (don't know how well my ankles will hold up with all the training), but i'm getting excited about my 10k next month. ran my usual 6 on saturday and beat my best time by almost 5 minutes! thats almost a minute a mile! i knew i was going fast, but i didnt know how fast til i checked my splits. by that time i thought i might as well go for it. felt so good to push myself like that; all the tension of the past week seemed to explode out of me at the finish line. i almost cried.   last week was really hard for me. oma is doing better, but who knows. watching someone die, from a distance for me, is a strange thing. my cell phone never left my side and i kept waiting for that call from my dad. of course, felt powerless, angry, etc. i thought a lot about the ways in which people talk about death, and was disheartened by the realization that death itself seems so cliche. everybody does it. i guess people are supposed to be comforted by that fact, but because everyone has gone through losing someone, everyone thinks they know what you are going through when it happens to you. cheapens the experience somehow? i dont know. still havent figured out to talk about death in any meaningful way.

      so i have spent the past two days thinking about whether or not i really want to have a blog. its kind of a weird thing, right? am i jumping on the bandwagon just to be cool or do i really have something to say? who is actually gonna read this thing? i cant even make time to write in my journal (and when i do, what actually gets committed to paper is basically crap), so how will i commit to entertaining what im sure will be hordes of adoring fans day in and day out?  after some consideration, i decided that i do got shit to say and maybe this would be an interesting and worthwhile endeavor, both for me and whoever is bored enough to read about me.  with all that out of the way, let the blogging begin!!

      i am one of those people who admit without shame that i am addicted to my television. my tv is my friend. its gets me thru a saturday hangover with beloved 90210 reruns. it keeps me informed of all the shit that goes on in the world while i get ready for work in the morning. it allows the me immense pleasure that netflix has brought into my life. my tv offers a welcomed distraction from the hours that i sit on my couch copyediting nauseatingly boring romance novels. i love the wb evening lineup when i get home from work; i look forward to the excitement of finding the perfect movie on at the perfect time (for this reason i do not own ferris bueller or the goonies--my two favorite movies). i love my tv, and now i miss it.   my tv bit the big one a couple weeks ago. at first i thought it was the cable, indeed i even made an appointment for some guy to come out and look at it for me. alas, as time went on, and&nbsp;it began working less and less, it became painfully clear to me that time warner hadnt fucked up, and that my tv was on its last legs; was saying a final farewell.  now it works occasionally. this morning it worked for a good three minutes, but that was plently of time to check weather on the ones (humid and warm with a chance of rain--big fucking surprise!). when i go home tonight, i will invaribly turn it on as i throw down my bag and change my clothes. will it work tonight? will my tv give me another five minutes of satsfaction? or will i turn it on only to see the five brilliantly lit lines that slash through an otherwise black and dead background?  thank god my new roommate is moving in in a few days. thank god he is bringing a giant monstrocity of a tv.   goodbye my little piece of shit toshiba that lasted a little over a year; i will surely not miss you once the big boy rolls in.

       so i ran my first 10K (6.2 mile) race on Thursday. It was hot, humid, crowded (10,000 people making their way&nbsp;along a small path thru central park), and not a lot of fun. then again, i dont know if races are necessarily supposed to be fun. i mean, does anyone really say, after a hard race, "wow, that was really fun?" somehow i doubt it. but this race was specially designed to be just that: FUN! it was the nike run hit wonder, meaning that there were one hit wonder bands performing before, during and after the race. to name a few: flock of seagulls, tommy tutone, devo, dramarama. unfortunately i had already been having a bit of bummer day (see previous post) and i didnt know anyone there (and wasnt feeling particularly social), so i just left afterward instead of sticking around to hear devo and do my world famous whip it dance. am happy to report that although my legs were tired, there was no pain. the shin splints seem to have finally gone away (after taking more than a week off), the strained hamstring was fine once i started moving, and the ankles seemed to hold up okay. i didnt get the time that i wanted, but i guess under the circumstances being a few minutes off isnt the end of the world. there is always next time, right?

       my dad called a few minutes ago to tell me that my gramma passed away last night. ever since she went into the hospital a couple weeks ago, i have been carrying my phone with me religiously, anxiously awaiting just that call. every time my phone would ring and the display would let me know it was him, i would answer with trepidation, knowing that it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;the call. today when my phone rang, i was happy that it was my dad. i figured he had remembered my 10K tonight, and was calling to wish me luck. it never crossed my mind that this call could be the call. it was.  &nbsp;  he assured me that she was in no pain; that it had been peaceful. while he explained that there would be no service now but that we would all scatter her ashes when pat and i were home for christmas, silent tears streamed down my face. then the phone got all staticky and i heard him say that he would call me later tonight.  &nbsp;  so this is the thing about death: no matter how prepared you are, it still comes as a shock; because there is no way the concept of&nbsp;death has any real meaning until it happens. death is shocking no matter what the circumstance.  &nbsp;  my dad told me that she is in a better place. whatever comes after this life, i am sure it is better than losing your mind (which&nbsp;has to amount to being that same&nbsp;as losing your life), having your body deteriorate to the point that you can no longer take care of yourself, and knowing on some level that you are no longer a part of the world that is still occupied by your physical body.  &nbsp;  i am sad because i lost someone who loved me unconditionally. there are few people in one's life who love them in that way, and even some of those who are supposed to that&nbsp;don't. therefore, when you have people like that in your life, you should cherish them, love them back, and learn how to love from them. i hope that i have done those things; i hope that oma knew that i loved her. every time i saw or talked to her, no matter how much time had passed since the last time, she told me that she loved me, and that she was proud of me. she told me how much she loved all of her family. she was genuinely happy for every happiness that we had, and she was so proud of every success.  &nbsp;  one of my favorite memories of oma: it was a thanksgiving or christmas gathering sometime when i was in high school. i think it was&nbsp;some holiday; it must have been since all sorts of extended family&nbsp;had invaded&nbsp;my house. i remember sitting at the breakfast table with oma, other family members milling about between the kitchen and the family room, all happy to fill their mouths with food so as to dispense with the required pleasantries. at one point, my other gramma mentioned that i had looked very much like a monkey when i was a baby. and that as i got older, i loved to hang on the monkey bars, and that--ha ha--people wondered if i really was some sort of monkey-child. of course this seemed to break the tension, and everybody laughed. including myself. ive had worse things said about me, and it was probably true that i was a little monkeyish as a kid. oma, though... boy, she did not appreciate this at all, and was quick to defend her beautiful, brilliant, and favorite granddaughter. i remember her actually getting a bit pissed off as the other, obviously uncouth, family members continued to laugh. i dont recall the specifics of what followed, but what stuck with me was the fact that she could not fathom how anybody could say anything negative, no matter how harmless, about her granddaughter. i was her little girl. recently, even though i'm&nbsp;no longer&nbsp;a little girl, she would remind me of the curious, brave, and independent child i once was. she started calling me her "little world traveler" when i flew to hawaii by myself at the age of 4. or maybe it was because i flew to a wedding when i was 6 months old with my parents. i dont remember. but i think she was so proud that that i had manager to live up to the moniker.  &nbsp;  although i didn't see oma very often and she didn't play a big part in my day to day life, i will miss her. i will miss knowing that there is someone like her in the world.  &nbsp;    i love you oma.

        i spent the past four days attending the Pacific Northwest Writers Association Conference in Seattle. had a total blast, am sooo tired, wish i was still there! this is what i learned:     &nbsp;   1. when an editor or agent participates in a writer's conference, they are 10% there for the benefit of their firm (acquisitions), 10% there for the authors (giving advice and encouragement), and 80% there for the drunken networking (those in the biz sure like to drink!!). &nbsp; meeting&nbsp;other publisher-types was my favorite&nbsp;part of this experience.   &nbsp;   2. there is sooo much to be learned from hanging out and getting drunk in the hospitality suite with your colleagues. editors, agents, and those running the conference like to talk shit about those not within ear-shot. oh yeah, you will also learn a lot about what projects people are working on, who are the cool people to work with, and which firms treat their employees like crap.     &nbsp;   3. bring visine. lots of drinking and a lack of sleep will cause you to look like a zombie. best to appear as professional as possible.      4. if you have an expense account, use it! you look really cool if you treat colleagues and/or authors to lunch! i got to treat one of avalon's older authors to lunch and she was so appreciative i thought she was going to cry!    5. don't appear to be too snobby or full or yourself, no matter how cool you really are. i hung out quite a&nbsp;bit with the little people (authors), and was told at the end of the conference by those in charge that i was totally approachable and professional and that they would love to have me back next year.    6. since these things are mostly by invitation only (for editors and agents), if you are enjoying yourself and would like to attend next year, kiss up as much as possible to those running the show. i even sent them an email today thanking them again for putting on such a well-organized and smoothly-run conference.    7. editors and agents, although they dont tell you this outright, always seem to be looking for their next gig. i met some really cool editors and learned about some really cool firms that i would like to work at someday. this weekend allowed me form a detailed plan of the path i would like my career&nbsp;to take.     8. (this is the most important!)... i learned that i have sooo much to learn! not only am i a total newbie in this industry, but my current job is also particular in that we are sorta oblivious to so much of what fuels the rest of the publishing world. so i am taking it upon myself to learn as much as i can so that i am prepared when it comes time for me to move on.     as everyone was saying goodbye yesterday, i commented that it felt like we were all going home after spending a week at summer camp! i look forward to seeing everyone next year!

      a while ago, a friend of mine prefaced her blog entry with this warning: "this is a self-conciousous blog." she proceeded to apologize for her lack of recent entries and wonder if anyone had even noticed. we had, her friends assured her; it gives us something to do while we are supposed to be working every day. a few days later, i got an email from a friend of mine who i don't really keep in touch with as often as i would like to. he inquired into what had been going on in my life, and for fear of sounding redundant, i asked if he had read my blog. his was an interesting response, which i will paraphrase. he felt that reading my blog was akin to reading my diary; that it was conceptually too personal, yet too impersonal as a means of keeping in touch.   yes, the blogging phenomenon is a strange bird. there do seem to be some conclusions that we can draw about the blogger and the act itself;  the blogger, no matter how lovely a person, must be a bit of a narcissist. dont worry, i'd be the first to admit what i consider to be the non-flaw of thinking oneself is cool. this narcissicm is evident in the varying, yet similar, motivations of the blogger. for instance, said blogger has a penchant for the art of monologue; whether this is manifest verbally or through the typed word, the blogger likes to talk about him or herself. in some cases, whether true or not, the blogger thinks random thoughts and stories (mainly about oneself) would be of interest to the world. in many cases, the blogger just likes to 'talk.'  there is an element of voyeurism in blogging. its sorta like having sex underneath a blanket in the park, or turning off the light in your apartment and watching the couple across the way have sex--except a whole lot less messy and fun. admit it, peeking into someone else's life, no matter how drab or mundane that life is, is interesting. plus, opening yourself up to others in a personal yet highly impersonal way is a bit sexy.  i guess no matter what one's motivation for blogging, it is always and necessarily a self-conscious act. whether or not anybody besides the writer pays attention to words that are written, there is no way for the blogger to not write for a potential audience. what a strange forum. one usually writes for oneself OR for an audience; the blog has created a space in between these things in which the blogger is able to do both, or neither.

      although the fourth of july isn't my favorite holiday, it does provide a good excuse to eat, drink, and be merry. and that's just what we did. bbq on the roof! i don't remember a lot of the night, which must mean that i had fun! thank you to the girl who did all the dishes!  not much else is going on. its way past closing time and i'm sitting at my desk like a good girl. =) damn those people who instilled a work ethic in me!  a real post will have to wait... still got a load of crap sitting here that i have to deal with. ok, its not that bad!

      i don't know whats gotten into me, but i felt compelled to go see fahrenheit 9-11 last night. perhaps i have hit my michael moore quota for the week; perhaps i didn't give it a fair shot. but... i was pretty disappointed.   i remember a lot of people not liking bowling for columbine because they felt like moore was talking down to them, that he had a dumbed down message for the masses that came across as arrogant and overtly manipulative. as you know, i didnt feel this way about columbine. and i was rather surprised that the movie didnt offend me after everything i had heard. this one did.   the facts can more than speak for themslves. let them. i admit, parts of this movie were damn funny, but having a sense of humor doesnt make up for treating your audience like children. the images and facts that moore presented were very powerful, and would have been even more effective if he had shut up and allowed the audience to process them without his obnoxious commentary.   what i found most striking about the entire experience was that the post-movie conversation revolved around the movie itself. of course my friends and i concurred, again, that bush has got to go, that the link between bush and the saudis is and always has been questionable, and that the war in iraq was unfounded and will have disasterous longterm effects on all countries involved. this took about ten seconds. the remainder of the conversation was concerned with how we felt about the movie. did we feel talked down to? yes. did we feel manipulated? yes. was it a horrible mixture of sentimentality and shock value? yes. did we learn anything new? not really.   are we voting against bush in november? yes. because michael moore said to? whatever.    urlLink    get off your ass and vote!&nbsp; urlLink

      there are crazy people in the world. sometimes i have to deal with the crazy people. unfortunately the ones i come into contact with professionally are not cool-crazy, but sad-crazy. they are recluses that sit in their basements and hit key after key on their derelict typewriters until they have decorated two hundred pieces of paper with smeared ink and messy prose. they will then lovingly place this bundle into an envelope and pay twenty dollars to have it overnighted to my office. i will open it, struggle through the cover letter (in which i will inevitably be told that Mr. X is the next big thing fer sher), then attempt to disregard the spelling errors, atrocious grammar, convoluted plot, and terribly-named characters which populate their great american novels. after much thought and consideration, i crush all their hopes and dreams with a form letter to which i rarely sign my own name. And after doing this for about a year, i find that i don't really feel bad about it anymore.  what i find so shocking is the amazing depth of delusion within which people operate. seriously. plus the scary almost-threatening phone calls and the ransom letter-looking correspondence which comes after the initial rejection and just breeds more, you guessed it, in your face rejection.  i wish craziness went hand in hand with heightened creativity and aesthetic appeal. unfortunately this is not always the case.

      so the last really good book i read was jonathan franzen's 'the corrections.' i was so stoked that i ran right out and bought another one by him. i was so disappointed that i didn't make it past page 20. i can't even think of the title right now. i know, there is a huge difference between falling in love with a book and falling in love with an author. i feel like its been soooo long since the latter happened to me.  enter paul auster. i read 'the book of illusions' in no time. while the style may be a little on the simple(?) side, this book was so well-constructed that i couldn't help but immerse myself in it. always the editor, i was actually a bit bummed (for like two seconds) that the plot didn't move in the direction i was hoping it would, but i quickly got over that and was able to recognize the brilliance of what was going on. the self-conscious style, the layers of reality, the stark non-realism of it all... i was in love.  since i didn't learn my lesson with my pal Jonathan, i immediately borrowed 'the new york trilogy' from a friend of mine. please, please, come through for me! was my plea as i opened to the first page. i am about halfway thru the first novella, and am anything and everything but disappointed. there is actually a moment that comes within the first twenty or so pages where i said, 'thats one of the coolest things i've ever seen in literature!' first of all, this guy is a genious, and it shows. while his work falls into the category of mystery, it is so much more. in the piece i'm reading now, i'm getting quite an education on milton's 'paradise lost' and the parallels between the fall of man and the fall of language (hmm... any connection to my thesis and Heidegger's ontological considerations of lanaguage? we'll have to see...). all i can say is this stuff is fucking amazing! and i haven't said that in a long time.  off topic, but having to do with the nature of aesthetics and meaning: did anyone happen to see frank gehry's plans for the 'tolerance museum' in israel? all i can say on that one is 'what the fuck is he thinking?' actually a friend of mine, who is half jewish if that means anything, had a lot to say about the supposed philanthropy of liberal american jews. bottom line: does gehry really think that that monstrosity of a building (seriously, take a look if you haven't already...  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/01/arts/design/01FREE.html  --its truly frightening), plopped down in the middle of a war zone is going to remind the suicide bomber to be a little more tolerant of the religious differences of his neighbor? come on. why don't the 'do-gooders' behind this project take that buttload of money and do some real good. they can start by tearing down that ridiculous wall, running sharon out of town, and dealing with the heart of the issue: the monetary, military, and moral support that america continues to lend israel.  ok, im done.

       so, i'm not a big fan of tooting my own horn (yeah right), but i thought that i would... toot my own horn, that is. so... today is august 2nd. this is a good day. is it someone's bday, you ask? sure, but not anyone i know. did i find five bucks in my pocket this morning? no, because i scoured every pocket i own yesterday looking for tip money for the grocery delivery guy. am i stoked to be alive on this glorious summer day? well yes, but lets be a little more specific.       today is the first day that i am allowing myself to say "i quit smoking." its no longer "i'm quitting," or "yeah, someday i'll quit for real." today i get to say, with some sort of confidence: "I QUIT!"       "so you had a cigarette like two hours ago and now you have decided to quit?" i know thats what you are thinking. but today, august 2nd, is cool because i have not had a cigarette since july 2nd.         --collective gasp!!!--     i didn't want to say anything to anybody until i made it to a month because, frankly, i didn't want anyone bugging me! there tends to be a very fine line between being supportive and downright annoying. and we all know, overcoming addiction is something that has to be done for oneself! =)      so anyway, congrats to me.

        dont worry, no GSW or any other acronym that might land one in the emergency room. it was only a pretty bad case of strep (my throat was so swollen i couldn't swallow), but because HMOs suck so much i couldnt get in to see a doc and got to spend a couple hours in NYC's favorite looney bin on thursday. here is a shout out to lauren, who rolled out of bed and walked over to the medical field's equivalent of hell to sit with me in the ER waiting room.       i was finally seen, and, because i couldn't swallow, given a shot of penicillin in the leg. the doc actually warned me ahead of time that this was one of the most painful shots a person could have, and asked whether i wanted it in the ass or the leg. i told him that because i value my ass (for the purpose of sitting and being lazy, of course), i would prefer him to stick it in my leg. holy crap! it hurt so much i started laughing uncontrollably. then, although the doc recommended that i sit for a few minutes to give my leg time to recover, i limped right outta that stupid hospital. literally... i limped. and i kept limping for days; kept on hobbling around long after my throat felt better!      i also learned that scotch does wonders for clearing up any lingering bacteria on the tonsils! also helps to numb the pain of the real medicine!
