      well, not exactly back to SF, but back as in out of Europe. I had a good tour, lots of fun, and i even met some new friends. Some of you who know what im talking about might know Mrs. Smirfy also. I met Dr. Jacky but didnt like him very much. Mrs. Bicardinia is doing well, but i still didnt see her as nice and sweet as Mrs. Smirfy. anyway, enough of my new found friends. I had a bunch of fun in Paris and Amsterdam, which were both great and wonderful citys. Amsterdam was the most interesting and crazy. Paris was beatiful. the plane rides were ok, i watched a bunch of movies and stuff...nothing big. anyway, i am now in Florida, and im having a bunch of fun. soon to be home. post later.

      today was one hell of a waste of time...wow    ok, so i woke up today and i actuallly felt good since it was like 9:30 ( i actualy got to sleep in today ). I had a quick breakfast and then Lily, Robert and I decided to go take a "mega-walk"...which is a huge long walk with the dogs ( Koosh, Krack, and Boomer ( if you care )).   so we go up to the top of mount Davidson and hang out there for a while, come back down, and then go home and stuff...have some lunch, and then we decide to go back up since lily lost her glasses ( these really expensive nice sunglasses ) ... so without the dogs we go up and check it all out...and then Lily decides to go on the bus for no reason at all ( she claims it is relaxing )...so we check out the 43 bus and start riding it....wow, that was the most relaxing ride of my life...are you kidding, the bus is the worst place to ride around for 2 hours for no reason....well, we get to lilys house, have a pizza, and now im here with a huge head ache and very tired...ho-hum...

      Today was the first day of those darn brutal finals!!! i had a normal sized Bio test that was pretty much easy except for the first section ( i dont think it will do much to effect my grade since we figured out that in order for the top student in the class to have his 2nd semester grade affected he would have to get at most a 44%...and he has a 98% in the class...so I ( having about a 95% ) wont have to worry about a grade change...even if i do get something like a B ( which i am expecting )).    The Religion Exam, on the other hand, was the longest thing i have ever done...ok, i was going along with the first page of pretty much simple straight forward multiple choice questions...and im thinking this is a breeze and that im gonna get this done in 20 minutes max...but them i turn the page and POW...there are like 20 vocab words from Islam, Judaism and Christianity ( most i knew well ) and about 15 short answers ( which the teacher usually likes a couple sentences for each )...and on top of that we were supposed to write an essay on comparing two of the three religions...so there was a crap load to be done in an hour and a half.    estimated grades for todays finals ... Bio=85% min. and Religion=90% min.    wasnt too bad....but now i gotta study for my english and geometry coming up tomorrow...

      "The Flames, threatening to become one of the most unlikely champions in NHL history, were held to only seven shots in a dismal first two periods before making a frantic late surge started by Craig Conroy's power-play goal midway through the third.   Ruslan Fedotenko scored twice, including the critical first goal just as he did in the conference finals, and the resilient Lightning held off the Calgary Flames 2-1 in Game 7 Monday night to win their first Stanley Cup."   first the sharks are out..and i loose hope in them, and then my good ole flames loose...oh well      its a beauty

      Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a movie i would give about an 8 (of 10). why? well you can definetly see and feel the difference between Alfonso Cuaron's directing in this movie and the  Chris Columbus' directing in the others. Most people said that #3 was better than the first two, but i think that they are about the same, or even better in some ways. The first two would switch from scene to scene with not many breaks, which kept the watcher on the edge of the seat, while the third has these funny fade outs and interesting endings of the scene ( mostly with Harry Potter fainting or passing out to make it seem like its supposed to be like that ).   There were also a lot of things put in that made the movie seem a lot different than the book's idea of how it was supposed to go. The main  plots were there but somethings ( like the music that Lupin played ) gave the movie a weird feeling. anyway, you would have to see it for yourself to see what i really mean.  I would go see it. It is a fun and exciting movie. 8 out of 10 is what i would give it.

						   Today was an extreme waste of time...at least i got to sleep in ( till 9:30 )...but besides that the day sucked...
 
firstly, today i have walked up to the cross on Mt. Davidson twice...yes twice, why?...well...the first time was becuase of this "mego-walk" dealy which i really wanted to do with the dogs ( from down the street ), and so we went up once, then we went up again becuase one of my buddies lost their glasses ( very expensive sun glasses ) and so we went to look for them ... then the rest of the day consisted of a stupid bus ride and soe pizza and some homework and some sleeping since i have an insane headache right now..,
 
on the bright side of things, as you know ( if you read my profile ) i like to collect classical cds of my own ( my family as a whole has over 400 cds in the dining room but they are all either old, in bad shape, or are just stupid...so i decided that once i got my new room i was to start my own private collection of the ones i like and have...and it has grown to almost 75 ( started it sometime in March )...so i think just for no reason im gonna type out all the cds i have as of now...and ill put after the title how much i like it ( on a scale of 1-10 )

						   Yes......has been a loonnngg time since i have had a three day weekend....and, this is a very special three day weekend... NO  Conservatory ( which means i dont have to get up at some stupid hour (usually 6:30) and then get to the place by 8 ),  NO  YO rehearsal ( that means no going to Davies at 1 and practicing till 5 ), and ofcourse i have NO school on Monday....which makes this weekend the best ever. And My granparents are coming next friday so i'm very pleased.
 
thing im not looking forward too=studying my butt off for the history and latin I exam coming up this teusday , but it wont be that bad

						   well...i got this smacking huge packet from the YO today and it had a whole bunch of junk that needed to be signed so i did all that, and then theres this paper that has all the songs we are playing in the tour...and guess what, the two songs i was looking forward to (  Le Corsaire  Overture and the Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor ) i wont be playing...
 
why? well, first of all, im the last stand of the second violins ( pathetic...i know, but there are some pluses for sitting in the back ) and so the Grieg ( since its a soloist playing ) will need a "reduced strings" thingy...which pretty much means that everyone thats in the back of their section ( in the strings only ) will have to get outta there when the certain song is played...
 
now, the deal with the  Le Corsaire  Overture i have no idea about...they just decided not to play it, which sucks, since i really wanted to play it and its a reealllyy fun piece...oh well.
 
i guess i'll post the paper with all the repertoire for every day of the tour on it soon...dont feel like typing it all out....but these are the pieces we are gonna play and how much i like them ( scale of 1 - 10 ):
 
Bruch / Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor, Op. 26 (7) 
Grieg / Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16 (9) 
Ravel / Suite No. 2 from  Daphnis et Chloe  (6) 
Tan Dun /  Orchestral Theatre I: Xun  (3) 
Tchaikovsky / Symphony No. 4 in F minor, Op. 36 (7) 
Copland / "Hoedown" from  Rodeo  (8) 
Gershwin /  Promenade  (?) 
Tchaikovsky / Pas de deux from  The Nutcracker , Op. 71 (?)

Well, it might seem like a no brainer to you computer guys out there, but if you go to the bottom right hand corner of the paper after you have clicked it and the new window has popped up, there is an enlrage button ( yes, an enlarge button )...well, click it and there yah go (:

						   hmmm...i know im missing something, and im worried cause my suitcase is exactly the size maximum and it is just on the weight maximum, so i hope there are no problems at the airport...and i still gotta pack my carry on backpack, theres so much to worry about, i gotta pack the bag that im taking to FL when i get back, hopefully i dont run out of batteries for everything. 
 
I went to See's Candies and a hair saloon store to get candies (a pound of them) and some nice gel. Then i got back and watched some Reno 911, then i packed, then we went to west portal to get some food for the smores tonight, and there was a huge line to Farhenheit 9/11, and i really want to see it, hopefully itll still be in theatres when i get back. so, we had a campfire thingy again, and then we played football till about 9, then i was tired and started packing more. Still have a lot to do. very excited about the trip. you can always go to http://www.sfsymphony.org/templates/youth.asp?nodeid=82 and find your way around, there will be a person posting news and updates during the tour, with pics. The link to the tour pages will become active after we depart. sooo, if i have the chance i might post something up, but there wont be any pictures until i get back, since i dont think there will be computers available with the plug ins and all that stuff. I definetly will post smoe really good pics that i take from Florida and defiently the Euro tour. post soon

						   ok, so today was a somewhat fun and somewhat tiring day. First i went to YO rehearsal at 10:30, but found out once again that i didnt actually have to play for the first 45 minutes of rehearsal since i dont play any of the solo concertos. and guess what, i didnt play for a good 2 hours of the rehearsal today. I also got a 2 hour lunch (while the others got 45 minutes). so, in some ways its a good thing. i also dont like the Bruch that much anyway, so no loss there. BUT, i am hoping to move up a couple stands for next year since we are playing some really cool solo pieces (and the concertmaster (whose rreeaalllyy good (and only 12) is playing the solo for it). Got the letter saying what pieces are up for next year, and they are really fun (except for one whole concert which is full of ok pieces, no big ones or anything. 
 
 
During the huge lunch break i went to the Flight 001 store, which i have to say is one of the coolest stores i have ever been to. It is by far the best travel store i have ever gone to too. So i walk in and they have ten times more things than i thought (from looking at the stuff online). I was there for many things, but my mom wanted me to get first and foremost one of those things that hang under your shirt from your neck, which you can keep your passport and money and travelers checks etc. in. So i found one of those, and then i checked out the alarm clocks...and theyhad some reeally cool ones, but my favorite was this alarm clock which is a small cube (about an inch and a half in height and lenght and width). It has the temperature, date, alarm, and time on four sides with a light and other cool things...
  
 
 
anyway...after the rehearsal i took the Muni to Waldenbooks where i used up my gift card...and then my mom came and got some other books...got my three summer reading books (The Hobbit, Into Thin Air, and The Things They Carry) and i got another spiderman comic collection...and i then went to the camera store on west portal, and got a nice camera bag (which just fits my digital camera if i sqeeze it in). so now im set. just gotta pack the extra suitcase thats going to florida after i come home. and i gotta finish with the euro packing too. got my travelers checks which add up to 200 euros and 100 euros in notes, and then i have my credit card so i think im set in the money section...shouldnt spend too much though, cause its coming out of my own bank account so im not too happy about that. 
 
 
tomorrow will be a day full of playing games and stuff since my violin is packed up, i have nothing to do...except pack.

<date>25,June,2004</date>
<post>

						
						   soo...everything is ready except for my camera bag, which i gottas buy. I also need a pair of sunglasses (or do i reeally need them...i guess not), and i gotta get that converter crap, and i gotta get the darn travel alarm clock...which is all to be done tomorrow...which i just remembered have a humongous YO rehearsal from 10:30 to 4:30....which is the time afterwards where we are supposed to pack our instruments up in the big cases...and then they are shipped off...not to see my precious violin for a good what, two days...boo hoo. anyway, after the packing i gotta go to the Flight 001 store and see if i really want to get anything, and if not mom will just give me 50 bucks and ill give her the gift card, since my dad might like something from their, or maybe even my mom. 
 
 
soo...you wanna know what messed up about my laptop, that is stopping me from bringing it to euro and to FL, well. its just plain f***ed up. i have tracked this messed up ness to the cooling system, which isnt working, which is causeing the computer to just shut off when the comp gets too hot. i cant bring it to euro because it especially gets hot when it is playing something in the disc drive, which will make it shut off in the middle of a DVD, which was its main purpose there. so, the problem: it is overheating thanks to the messed up fan and coooling system. so its toastm the waranty is over with, and the people that try to help you arent that great. so, i was thinking of selling it and then using that money, along with some of my own, to buy a better and improved one. Also, my laptop wont play some new games that i buy (ie: Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow), which is a drag.  
My 256 mb card came today, for my Digital Camera, but im not sure how many pictures it can actually hold, so im gonna have to do some experiment pictures sunday, which my mom says will be the day for partying and stuff...so she actually said i could play videogames...amazing. Some friends are coming over to play and watch hella movies...not sure which ones im gonna rent. hmmmm
 
 
so, today i woke up earlier than usual (like 9 ish) and had to take my grandparents to the airport...too bad they had to go...but who cares, im gonna see them in 2.5 weeks, so i might as well not get tooo used to them. after that i chilled at home for a bit, watched some more Reno 911, and then went to get my hair done. I had to walk errol (my littlest brother and sibling) down there at 1, while mine started at 1:30. and mr mom wanted me to put some money in the meter for the car's parking spot, so i had to break my 20, so i went to Ambassado Toys (dont ask) and got a tiny puny little deck of cards, and two rocks, which you are suppsed to break open in half with a hammer, and then if you do it right you get one of those cool crystrals-inside-a-rock things. so i put in 12 minutes worth of change into the meter and got my haircut, which isnt too bad, unlike the other time i went to Supercuts, and some barely0able0to-speak-english girl who was probably an illegal immigrant cut just about all my hair off (this was like March, so no big deal). then i went home and started to pack and do all that stuff...

						   ok, my days have been getting busier and busier...and i have more, and more to do, since i got the SFYO Tour coming in ... 4 DAYS!!! yah, so i have everything done on the checklist except for the converter crap...why cant europe just do what we do here, i mean, its just an outlet. So gotta go to Radio Shack and get the two thingys. I also have to get a camera bag for my new camera...which is a really weird shape, so i gotta get a good size and good fit one. I got my visor, i got a suitcase, which is exactly 62 linear inches, which is the exact limit for a bag, now the problem will be keeping it under 50 punds or something like that. I got more socks...and i got a jacket finally, and i got my new "kicks" and all my new shorts and i still havent used my $50 gift certificate to Flight 001...darn, they have some cool stuff but im not sure about what to get...its all so overpriced. anyway
  
Today i got up and did the usual. I watched some more of my great Reno 911 the whole first season, which i got yesterday at Target, and that reminds me, i still havent gotten the LOTR 3 on DVD...well, maybe after the tour. I also got some new swimming trunks that actually fit. the only thing that i dont get is...it says the whole first season, and it only has episodes 101 to 108 on the first disc and episodes 109 to 114 on the second, including the uncesored bonus stuff...weird. so, after that i went to what is now my least favorite store...ROSS: dress for less....it sucks...the place is a wreck, its for cheap-ass loosers and i hate it...its soo cheap, its where all the stuff that no one bought at the real stores goes and the price is cut in half. Why do i go there...i dont know. I would think that i was a bit better than that (no offense to the people that shop there regularly). ok, then i went to Baskin Robins, where i had a nice huge great icecream, and then i had a darn good violin lesson, which btw is the last violin lesson i will have for 2 whole great months!!! yippay. actually only grom June 28th to August 1st, but still. Then i came home and rushed the two rental videos (Dickie Roberts and Malibus Most Wanted (which were both ok but not the best)) on my bike back to the store, and then rushed back and had dinner, which was kinda weak, just a bit of lamb, and then i went outside and played on errol's jeep for about half an hour, taking it on the most rugged courses it has ever been on, and then i was caught by robert with the battery dead, but he didnt care, he just was making sure i got my swimsuit so that we could go swimming, and we did, with errol and my grandfather, which was really fun. The rec swim lasted from 8:30 to 10, and we left at about 9:45. Good excersize. sooo...im still waiting for that darn memory card to come, Amazon.com said it would be here by the 25th, and i checked earlier on the status and it hadnt been shipped...what kind of service is that, pretty damn lousy if you ask me. anyway, im really tired. and my laptop is really messed up, ill talk about it next post.

						   ok, so yesterday i didnt post becuase i was really busy...actually, i wasnt, i was just lazy like hell. Not much went on, except for going to the eye doctor and finding out that im a bit near sited (but no worries, im sure i still have 20 20...or i better) and that i have some kind of weird eye infection that is causing this burning sensation in my pupil and is decreasing my sight every second...actually its not as bad as it seems...the doctor was really nice and friendly and told me to get this tupe of "eye drops"...but i knew there was a twist to it using my erik-senses. And what do you know, there WAS a twist to it, i get home after raiding Walgreens and its an effin gel!!! what the hell, how am i supposed to drop a gel that comes out of the tube not in drops, but like toothpaste into my eye...and the worst part is, it says apply two DROPS into each eye before sleeping...well, how is that gonna go, i have two options, a. do it like a normal person would with a normal eye drop thingy and then find out that a big long chain of it has dropped in (which is definetly not the most comfortable of things) and then have a big bad time fixing the mess...or b. put a dap on your finger and try to force it gently into your eye...well, last night i attempted plan b. and found that 50% of the gel got in my eye lashes and eye lid and only a bit got into my actual eye...oh well, better luck tonight i guess.
 
 
besides that ordeal, i got home and found out that my spanking new and shiny and cool credit card had arrived, so i activated it and decided to go and take it for a test drive, so i went to the nearest Video rental store and got two movies....well, robert got one of them, Malibus most Wanted, and i got Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, which i havent atched yet. So we watched Malibus Most Wanted...which i would give a umm...5 out of 10...its not really a good movie, its kinda pathetic and the plot is weak, but it does have some comedy and stuff, not too stupid that its unbearable to watch...(like Garfield). anyway
 
 
after the show i went down to my neighbors house down the street, where i found a giant mess in the dirveway(the night before we had a huge barbeque with smores and the like, which we made ourselves, inculding the fire). There was a bunch of ashes and pieces od burned wood everywhere, and once we cleaned up that mess we found a crack in the cement and a ton of burn marks around the place where the main fire was...and found out that it was permanent...but fortunatly we can do it again tonight, except putting the fire about 5 inches off the ground with dirt underneath...which will help with that problem. 
 
 
today, on the other hand, i got up and had some breakfast and played some cards and did some puzzle and filled in some crossword and then went with my mom to the tailor to get my good suit fixed and fitted and cleaned...then me and the rest of the kids went out to eat and then we went to Nordstroms for some new "kicks", where i found a really nice pair of K Swiss...which is unussual for me since i usually dont like K Swisses instead this time it had like a running type of bottom (not the usual plain flat bottom) and it looks nice...and i got some new t shirts and a really nice looking tie...so, until next time....

						   today i had to wake up at 9 to go to the Fathers Day Breakfast at church, which wasnt bad for a church breakfast, it was actually quite nice. We had some hashbrowns and some pancakes and some sausage and some orange juice and some eggs (i didnt have any eggs, but everyone else did) and some fruit and then some carrot cake to finish it of (which i didnt have either (carrot+cake...don't do much for me)). Then we had an amazingly on schedule church service and then i got home and chilled for a bit, then had hamburgers for lunch and headed for the YMCA swimming pool with gramps and the rest of the kids (instead of lap swim it was Rec. swim so everyone got to go) and it was really fun. I had my new state of the art goggles and checked out the jacuzzi and then the pool and then the sauna and after a good hour or so we decided to go. This whole time my mom and dad were out somewhere at a party from 1 to 5, so we had the home pretty much to ourselves. After getting back from the Y we stopped by the Baskin Robins 31 flavors place and i had some ice cream and then we got home and watched Moulin Rouge, which was a very good movie, i liked the music a lot, thinking of  getting the soundtrack. Then we made our own pizzas, dough and everything, and i made mine somewhat better than last time (last time it tasted like a dried up breakstick with some weak cheese on it). This time it tasted like a pizza except it looked square, and could have used a bit more sauce...but it was good. Then we chilled for a bit and my neighbor down the street, who has asked to keep his/her name confidential, came up with the brilliant and somewhat random idea of doing S'mores over a homemade fire. Well, anything that involves fire and eating is all good for me...so we rush down to west portal to pick up the supplies (marshmallows, chocolate, graham crackers...you know). By the time we were there i started to get a bit worried since it was past my parents due time to get home (they were supposed to be back at 5 and it was something like 6:15) and they wanted to celebrate my dads birthday and fathers day right when they got back, and if robert nor i were there we would be toast...and i didnt have my cell phone...so we would be burned toast. anyway, we get back and there not there, so we decide to start the fire then just incase they get back soon. At first we have a pile of newspaper and sticks that are just making smoke and ash and a mess and it was really windy so nothing seemed to be working, but then we got smart and made the usual pyramid shape and things started to get toasty...we got out the goods and had a party. so...at about 9:15 (4.25 hours past their due time) my parents roll in and we go home and do some more celebrating and then get kicked into bed and now im here typing away while my friend is looking up on the web if its illegal to have a bonfire in your driveway (which is YOUR property so i dont see a problem with what you do on it). sooo...my eyes have been killing me forever so im gonne gat them checked tomorrow...and im hoping to see one more movie before i leave. I finally ordered the extra big SD memory card for my camera and hope it gets here before i go (i did the free shipping one which takes 5 to 9 days to ship and its June 20th and i gotta go June 28th...that means i need it by June 27th, which means it better noe take more than 7 days or i am screwed...). so, until next time

						   so...i was woken up by my grandfather who said he was going out to get the ingredients for the cheese cake we were supposed to make  for fathers day (and they are really good when i make them). But, i remembered that i had a crazy YO practice from 10:30 to 12:30 and then a lunch break and then the concert at 2. So i got dressed and started the drive over but then my mom called and i had left some tickets and the purple form which had all the tickets i had sold for the contest at home...so we drove back and at the last second got back to the free way and i was about a minute late...turned in my pruple form, only missed a couple announcements...and we practiced, then i found out at lunch time that i had WON the CONTEST and i get a free deck of cards, two free Mahler tickets to any of the SFS Mahler 2 concerts, $50 gift certificate to Flight 001 travel store ( urlLink  ) and i got the GRAND PRIZE which was one of the two official Bon Voyage concert posters, which i got for myself...which im gonna put up in my rooms which is pretty empty on the walls, so its a good addition. anyway, tomorrow i have to go to some Fathers Day breakfast at the church...ho hum.

						   the biigg Bon Voyage concert is tomorrow at 2 pm...and i might have a chance at some grand prizes for the most-tickets-sold contest. After getting home at 10:30 after our intensive rehearsal i found out that i have 27 tickets sold total up till now...and they are due tomorrow at 10:30 when the pre concert rehearsal starts so i have a good bunch on my purple paper to hand in. very pleased with my success , didnt think i would get so many.
 
anyway... we are gonna celebrate my dads birthday tomorrow so i get to go to Outback Steakhouse (one of my favorite resturaunts) and make a cheesecake for fathers day which is coming up fast...until then, theres gonna be rehearsing from 10:30 to 12, then a lunch break, and then the concerts at 2 and it is supposed to be pretty long since we are also playing some encores at the end (which makes one full concerto, a full symphony, and a couple short pieces, and then two encores...its gonna be long).

hmmm...well, first off, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is a hilarious movie. It is full of laughter and jokes, even though the commercials gave some of the good ones away. The first two thirds of the movie are full of new and exciting stuff (if i try and forget the ads on tv) and then it slows down when it nears the last third...and then the ending was kind of awkward, but its still a good movie!!! believe it.
 
 
the storyline is pretty straight forward...A bunch of loosers enter a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament in order to save their cherished (yet pathetic) gym from a health fitness chain called GloboGym...yep, not too complex and not too stupid, which is just right for a good comedic satire. 
 
 
so if you feel like spending a good hour and forty minutes on a movie which gets you to laugh a lot and if your ok with the not so spectacular bang at the end, and if your ok with leaving the theatre with not as much laughs as you got in the beginning or middle, then this movie is just right for you. I give it a 8.5 out of 10.

						   well, today i woke up and went t a friends house and watched a movie (Chronicles of Riddick (read previous post (if you havent already))) which started at 11:30 am, which i think is the earliest i have ever watched a movie...i think. I always remember it being at least past noon...anyway, tomorrow im seeing Dodgeball at 1:10. So, after watching the movie today i went back to his house and played some games and then went to my violin lesson which started at 4 and then went home and then went to my YO rehearsal which started at 7, but i was 15 minutes late...but it didnt matter since i dont play the Piano concerto in A minor ( since im in the back ), so i had a good hour and a half to do stuff, so i got a bit to eat since i didnt have much time at home earlier...and cruised around Van Ness (i just remembered i should have brought my gift certificate for a book store near there). And i called the Waldenbooks hotline for gift cards and found a whopping 30 bucks on my card that thank god hasnt expired (since i live in CA). Anyway...thats just about it. I totally forgot about a rehearsal with a friend for his recital coming up and he got kinda pissed and decided to call it off, but im glad he did since im kinda busy with other stuff...or am i?...hmmm.

Ok, first of all...i would like to give it a 6 out of ten...why? because it was really unstable. Yes it had tons of action and fighting and sometimes some suspense, but it would start some bits of plots and not evolve them...it would skip from a start of an evolving storyline to a big action packed fight which would then lead to another not fully understood story. Yes, i havent seen the first Riddick Pitch Black, but people tell me that the first was just as confusing.   
In the beginning you see Riddick running away from some bounty hunters (which supposedly is five years after the events in Pitch Black). After fiddling around on Inam's planet (Inam being one of Riddicks old pals) we find out that there was a girl named Jack (which he supposedly saved in the previous movie) that has been put into a prison...so he goes and saves her, but she gets taken away by mercs, and then he goes after her again, and she ends up dieing and he becomes the leader of the mercs...thats the whole movie in a nutshell.   Now, the battles and fighting by Vin Diesel are awesome and very intense...and there are some really cool parts where he shows off his skills as a Feore (the race the Riddick is which is something that the Lord Marshall is afraid of and the reason why the mercs are all after him (to destroy the Feorian race forever)). anyway, there were plenty of times when there was also a ton of computer graphics, which made it look totally fake...but if you are really into the movie you can kind of look past that (since it is in space on some weird planets). So, in general, The Chronicles of Riddick is a movie i wouldnt recommend seeing, but if you are a person who loves action and computer graphics and is usually too dumb to pick up any plots (like the Matrix), then this is the movie for you...and by the way...the ending was the thing that made me actually start to dislike it...it was horrible, but im not gonna ruin it for those who are actually willing to go see it for themselves.

						   well, i went to go see a movie today with a friend. Had to see Mean Girls again since he had watched all the ones i hadnt and i had seen all the ones he hadnt...but still, Mean Girls is a ggoooodd movie. If you havent seen it...SEE IT. anyway, heres what i think about it :
 
   

During the first 2/3rds of the movie there was just non stop comedy. Its hilarious. The only thing that could have been better was the fact that the last third of it turned into a big, G rated, everyones happy ending with the morals of true friendship and blah blah blah.... It made you leave with a not so mean feeling that the whole beggining put you in the mood of. But still, it was a very good, naughty, and lots of hot girls movie. I would give it a 8.5 out of 10....yah
 
 
anyway, after the movie we went outside waiting for someone to pick us up and a woman comes up and starts asking us  questions for a survey or something...and after that little survey she hands us a pair of flyers asking us to go to some videogamers get together ... it said on the paper that i was invited to participate in a focus group to learn more about my thoughts and opinions on a variety of topics....hmmm, well they are paying $75 in cash for a little meeting , and the woman said that you watch commercials and pick which ones appeal to you the most and test games and stuff...but who knows...and its on a day that im busy on so, just to tell you ... 
  for tomorrow: The Chronicles of Riddick!!!!

						   today i went swimming again at the Y (tried to go yesterday but it was one of those closed-for-cleaning sundays). Got both my new shelves up and running, still dont know what to put on them. Still looking around (mostly online) for a good stereo system (something like a 5 disc changer with a subwoofer and some satellite speakers that i can set up around the room). Im gonna check out the GoodGuys today and see what they have and to actually find out what i really want (i know what i want but looking online i noticed that it doesnt exactly exist, there are mostly speakers sets, home speaker systems for a home theater, and a thing that has DVD and CD player that has its own speakers...but im still not seeing a system just for CDs, but i guess ill go for the DVD ones (that also play CDs) so that i have something incase i get a nice little flat screen TV for the wall (im looking ahead a long way)).
 
Also im gonna go and spend all the gift certificates i have amassed this past year (none have expired luckily). They are mostly small but i have a lot of them, Borders (including two coupons that i can take along), Waldenbooks, A Well-Lighted Place for Books, and Tower Records gift cards and coupons...
 
Gonna go and make some Jello and some Chocolate Pie before i go.

						   well, today was a very slow and tiring day for me. first of all, i spent the night at a friends house and stayed up watching tv and the movie What Women Want while eating popcorn and tons of icecream. So i got to sleep at about 12 and then woke up at about 8:20 remembering that we had to be at a rehearsal across town at 9:00. Amd to top it all off, neither of the parents were home to take us there. So i called my dad and he picked us up and got us there a bit late but not bad. While waiting i played a really fun game called crimsonland or something like that. When i first got to the friends house i played the demo with him a few times, but then i timed out, and we were addicted. So we payed the small fee to get the whole thing and played it for a few hours when we noticed that playing one player taking turns was starting to get dumb and we needed to get something like a joystick or a game pad from the nearby RadioShack to play 2 players...so we got one for a small fee again and played it about an hour...then did the tv and movie and then my friend played the game got a few more hours while i tried to go to sleep. Anyway, if i cant get a copy of it i guess ill just get it myself...since im getting some kind of credit card soon for Euro trip i wont have to ask my dad or mom for theirs if i want something off the Internet...which will be a big plus (since they wouldnt let me spend 20 bucks on a downloadable game off some site (but its reeeeaaalllyyyy good (trust me))).
 
This all happened after watching Garfield, which absolutly sucks (as you would know if you read the previous post).   
  I just wanted to give you a bit more on how much that movie sucked...here what CNN's David Germain thought of the movie:
 
 
""Garfield: The Movie" elicits laughs about as infrequently as a hairless Sphinx kitten sheds fur. The movie's vocal coup -- landing Bill Murray as mouthpiece for droll Garfield, the lazy hero of Jim Davis' comic strip -- falls flat amid the banal lines he's given to mew.  

And the curious decision to make Garfield a computer-generated cartoon figure amid live-action cats and dogs -- while not quite the distraction it could have been -- still is bothersome enough to yank viewers out of the story now and then.  

That is, yank them out of what little story the filmmakers dredge up."
  
he also points out that "The structure of the comic strips is often maintained, with Garfield handling much of the dialogue as one-sided monologues. Too bad he's given virtually nothing funny or interesting to say." and that ""Garfield: The Movie" hits its low point as Murray caterwauls an awful ditty, "New Dog State of Mind," to the tune of Billy Joel's "New York State of Mind." The many zeroes in his paycheck for some easy voice work must have been all that sustained Murray while crooning the insipid lyrics."  
and to finish off the article he ends with this: "Young children may get a few laughs out of the movie's many pratfalls, but even the slapstick of "Garfield" runs thin compared to a decent Looney Tunes cartoon. 

The filmmakers seemed content to toss out any old stray cat of a movie with the "Garfield" brand name, figuring fans would show up. 

They may be right, but some viewers may not be such cat lovers when they leave."
  
....my case rests...

						   well, today i had the pleasure of watching the one and only GArfield~~~yes, it is so great i actually left the theatre after about 20 minutes of hell. It started ok with the usual "let me show you the ropes" beginning. After about 15 minutes i started to get uncomfortable not knowing what the plot was, but my patience hadnt run out yet. After a bunch of random junk and mini mini plots things started to get hairy. Firstly, they were using the same tricks and jokes many many times, as if we "little kids" (its a PG movie ) would forget about them and laugh again. For example, Garfield had already made the point that his chair was his chair, and no one sat on it. Well, when Odie comes and sits on it, Garfield states that again, just to remind us, which wasnt bad. The he pushes Odie off the chair and he starts watching his music video. Well, after about 6 times of puching and jumping and listening and dancing i started to get really pissed off. OK, we get the picture!!! Odie is a dumb bitch and Garfield hates him. Garfield on top of that has the stupidest "jokes" i have ever heard and not only that, he repeats them about a billion times. And one other thing that just really got the worst of me. I was on the verge of going crazy when all of a sudden, Garfiled starts singing!! What was he singing? I dont know. First of all, Bill Murray cant sing. Secondly, i did not pay 8 dollars to watch a fat orange fur ball sing about how this lame dog has taken over his owner....dude, cmon. So, i just couldnt handle it.
 
Now the question is...why did i go see it in the first place? well, i was on a time budget, and that was the only short movie that started at the right time...but from now on, i guess ill just play games instead. And a warning to all....Dont go see Garfield or you will die!!!

						   wow, my grades were a lot better than i expected...i was really worried, luckily a friend allerted me that it arrived today and to get it before my parents did...but there is nothing to worry about, lowest grade was a B+ in darn English I....which actually is not my least favorite class but i am just not an english natural here so i try my best...but the books that we read are not too bad, and i am really good at grammar thanks to my middle school english teacher so there isnt much of a problem. In the other classes i got almost all As except for Geometry and Biology, which believe it or not are becoming two of my least favorite classes...even though i used to like science and math best. Well, things have changed.
 
 
Today i woke up and started a new puzzle after we finished the other violin and chocolate 500 piece one. This one is 500 pieces as well but the pieces are a bit bigger (making it 20"x20") and its a mystery thingy were you read the short story and you try to figure it out while doing the puzzle, which you dont know what it is at all (no piture anywhere) which makes it a bit harder. 
 
Robert and errol are still into Zelda. Every morning i hear the usual sounds...getting kinda annoying. Got a couple more cds today in the mail and i have some big plans for my room. Hoping the get an identical cd tower that i have on one side of this book case and put it on the other side (since the one i have is getting full), but im not sure since there was only one left at the place i got it, hopefully there are more online. Then im hoping to get rid of my 8 year old boom-box thingy and replacing it with the new 5 disc cd player/dvd player ( most are cd/dvd players, just incase i have a tv ) with a subwoofer and a couple satelite speakers (maybe 5 that i can put in the closet and one in the bathroom and three around the room), along with some other extras, which arent too expensive (if i were to get all this it would have to be my own money since its like an extra that is not necissary. I see most that i want at about $400, but there are cheaper ones that could work. 
 
 
So after checking out the new puzzle i got ready to go to the YMCA with my grandfather (the lap time) and so we did and stayed from 12 to 1 and then went to get some lunch and then headed to Home Depot, where i got one new big dark oakwood shelf (for above my bookcase) and another smaller pinewood shelf that i will put somewhere, which will probably hold some random stuff....not sure yet. Then we went to Albertsons to get some Jello and some Chocolate Pie Mix (will make two probably tonight or tomorrow morning). 
 
Hoping to see some movies before next week.

						   Today i woke up to three people banging at my door: robert, mom, and victor, and old friend from middle school (more like elementary). I got up, played some videogames and watched my brothers play Zelda for some stupid reason....and then had to go and wash the cars, do my practice, make and eat lunch all before 12:30 which was the time Harry Potter 3 started. Today was gonna be a "movie day". I was gonna go see Shrek 2 with vistors brother and the rest of the kids were gonna see HP3. So we wash the first car and victor took it for a "blow dry"...if you catch my drift, and then we tried to evade the second Yukon XL...but my grandfather got us out there...it had to be done. Anyway, we come in and eat some hot dogs and sausages in 10 minutes and then rush to the movie thaters....getting there 10 minutes before HP3 started and a whopping 40 minutes before Shrek 2. So victor's brother and I hung out in the arcade for 10 minutes and then bought ourselves some food and sat in the theater....then it began!
 
  
So...after battling a fire-breathing dragon and the evil Lord Farquaad to win Princess Fiona (Shrek 1), he now has to get by the king and queen and Price Charming and Charmings mother The Fairy Godmother. Of all the chraracters my favorite this time would have to be Puss in Boots...it was hilarious (last movie my favorite would be the donkey). 
 
 
Mike Myers=	        Voice of Shrek 
Eddie Murphy=	        Voice of Donkey 
Cameron Diaz= 	        Voice of Princess Fiona 
Julie Andrews=	        Voice of Fiona's Mother, Queen Lillian 
Antonio Banderas= 	Voice of Puss-in-Boots 
John Cleese=	        Voice of Fiona's Father, King Harold 
Rupert Everett=	        Voice of Prince Charming 
Jennifer Saunders=	Voice of The Fairy Godmother 
 
Just in case you were wondering...
 
 
ok....so this is what i thought about it...well, it was just plain funny. I got to see more of the three pigs, the gingerbread man and Pinocchio (including his desire to wear women's underwear) which was good. Even though the first was by far better because it was all new and just stuck in your head funny, the second had (along with the first's themes and jokes) some of its own fun stuff. It took a lot of stuff and used them from other movies, especially the Beauty and the Beast's themed dance thingy with the moving furniture and stuff with the Fairy Godmother and some Mission Impossible and Spider Man added in (the mission to save the prisoners and the special kiss between Fiona and Shrek respectively). Thery also added some real worls things (Hollywood themed place) which made it seem more realistic in a way...kinda. The Donkey is just the same being his annoying and crazy self as the first one...except this time he is jealous of Puss in boots. Shrek 2 may not be as fresh and new as the first, but it still gives the viewers a good laugh or two.

 
 
so for a film that has hit the record for playing at 4,163 domestic theaters and for being ranked (currently as of June 9th) at number two on thw Box Office charts, it is definetly a must see movie. i would give it 9 out of 10.
 
 
 
So after the movies i came home and hung out with some friends...then i had to go blow the leaves from the garage and driveway, which got very tiring and annoying when the wind started blowing the opposite way...but now theres a big line of leaves and stuff in the middle of the street ready for the street cleaner tomorrow morning.
 
Got a good bunch of new cds to my collection, will update the list when i reach my 100 mark! (:

						   today was another somewhat fun since my grandparents were here yet somewhat boring since there was not much to do day....
 
first i got up and had some breakfast like usual...then i walked about while mom and her mother went out shopping...and printed out a humongous walkthrough for errol and rob for Zelda (Orcarina of Time)...i dont know how but all of a sudden they have sparked an interest in it once again, and the game has been taken out of the dusty box and played for a consecutive few hours (first time in years). I have to admit it is a classic...and i did have an urge to go and start where i left off, but then i remembered why i left it in the first place...oh yah, it was way too hard and i was sick of having to take it to my friend Max's house and having him beat the entire thing for me (actually up to the Water Temple i think...if you care)...and then we got the second one that came out about a year later (Majora's Mask) and it was impossible....so it was probably played for a day and then stuffed into a closet box somewhere...that game i have to admit was one of the most complicated games i have ever played...anyway, so now robert and errol are into that old game and all day i hear the good ole sounds of my childhood...kind of.
 
 
So my mom and grandma arrive home and tell me to try this stack of maybe 6 shorts and 4 t-shirts which i desperatly need for this summer (since i need 9 days worth of clothers for the euro-tour and i need some stuff my grandparents are gonna take back with them to florida so that i dont need to pack a whole bunch of florida stuff with me (since im not coming back home between trips (might be spending the night with some friends))). So they were all pretty good, and the t-shirts are fine...
 
I also had a chance to play arounf with my camera today...my grandfather gave me a loonngg lesson on what all the special words meant (aperture, exposures, shutter speeds, telephot postitions, etc.) and now i know a lot more about the tons of different modes i have...finally got the cool night effect of all the lights and things blurring when you keep the shutter open for a long time...they look cool, figured out and tested the timer thing and the progressive thingy and taking 5 pictures a second and all that jazz...very cool. 
 
Watched the Lakers game...but dont know who won (left to go get ice cream when overtime started)...even though im not a basketball fan at all...i think the pistons should get the championship this time...im tired of the lakers...anyway
 
got some cool pictures but im tired of having to delete them so i got a couple downloaded onto the comp and may post some later one...still gotta get that 256 mb card...will hold tons of pictures...oh, and i got the cool movie mode working, it is tons better quality then i thought it would be...anyway, im gonna post two pics that i thought were interesting...check them out

						   "The Flames, threatening to become one of the most unlikely champions in NHL history, were held to only seven shots in a dismal first two periods before making a frantic late surge started by Craig Conroy's power-play goal midway through the third.
 
 
Ruslan Fedotenko scored twice, including the critical first goal just as he did in the conference finals, and the resilient Lightning held off the Calgary Flames 2-1 in Game 7 Monday night to win their first Stanley Cup."
 
 
first the sharks are out..and i loose hope in them, and then my good ole flames loose...oh well

						   Yesterday was a normal somewhat boring but still ok day. I got free time with my grandparents and errol since katarina and rob had to go to church from 10:30 to like 2 ( after they had gone out to eat somwhere ). I started the puzzle my grandparents brought here for me. Very fun and challenging (500 pieces, which isnt that big, its just has a lot of similar things and the pieces arent normal). Got about a quarter of the pieces together yesterday and have about half of it finished now ( its a violin surrounded by chocolates and some flowers ).  
 
Today I woke up at about 9:30 and had some breakfast and did some puzzle and then played some cards and then had some lunch (hotdogs on the grill) and then played some more cards and the went to the dentist to get my braces removed (finally) and then got home and found that my camera (the new digital one (Minolta DiMage Z2 4.0 MegaPixels)) and i got to play around with it (makes cool sounds when it turns on and off and it has a lot of different modes and i cant wait to take it to euro trip).
 
 
anyway....now im waiting for a bunch of cds i ordered saturday...which are still being shipped, and i gotta get a 256 mb sd memory card before i go to europe...maybe a bigger one if i want...i found one for 37 bucks...not sure if they get much cheaper than that. I also got the LOTR Fellowship of the Rings soundtrack at west portal Music Store for 10 bucks (which is really good if you like opera and very loud and good orchstral syphmonic whatever music) while robert got the South Park Movie  soundtrack for however much it was...they said they accept any kind of somewhat decent condition cd for money or trade...so lily, rob and i and gonna try and collect cds that no one listens to anymore to see if we can make a bit of a profit...anyway, gotta go eat a big see-food dinner

						   So far these past few days of no school or anything else have been great. Thursday night at 6 was the SHHS Back-a-loree-et ( i dont know how to spell it ) service. I had to play some songs w/ Chauncey and stuff. Not the best but everyone thought it was amazing...anyway. Friday at 8 was Prize day at school, and then it finished at 10 ( might as well not have come ). Then i got to go home and went to go see Harry Potter 3, which was ok, ill get to that in a second. Then i rushed home after the 2.5 hour movie and got changed into a suit and rushed to the Hotel job. Then when that was over at 6, i went to go to my YO rehearsal at 7 and it ened at 10. My Grandparents arrive at SFO at around 7:30.
 
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a movie i would give about an 8 (of 10). why? well you can definetly see and feel the difference between Alfonso Cuaron's directing in this movie and the  Chris Columbus' directing in the others. Most people said that #3 was better than the first two, but i think that they are about the same, or even better in some ways. The first two would switch from scene to scene with not many breaks, which kept the watcher on the edge of the seat, while the third has these funny fade outs and interesting endings of the scene ( mostly with Harry Potter fainting or passing out to make it seem like its supposed to be like that ).  
There were also a lot of things put in that made the movie seem a lot different than the book's idea of how it was supposed to go. The main  plots were there but somethings ( like the music that Lupin played ) gave the movie a weird feeling. anyway, you would have to see it for yourself to see what i really mean. 
I would go see it. It is a fun and exciting movie. 8 out of 10 is what i would give it.

 
Another thing. In the YO we have a bunch of enchores that we are gonna play after every concert on tour, and i found one of my top favorite pieces today. Tchaikovsky's Pas de Deux from the  Nutcracker . It isnt my usual exciting huge sound orchestral pieces ( even though it does get really loud thanks to the brass ). It is more of a really intense love song sort of. It sounds really good. Jut if you were wondering what my favorite songs are nowadays....

						   some new things going on around here...getting ready for my grandparents to come, so ofcourse my mom wants everything in mint conditions ( as in we gotta clean all the floors and get their room ready and do the yard etc...)
 
Now that schools over...pretty much, i was able to sleep in until 11:30 today ( a record for me since i always wake up hungry at about 9 )... 
Got to go and do the back yard, which is a humongous mess. Let me make this short...imagine a backyard were weeds have taken over every inch of dirt, the wooden fence is falling apart with holes in it, the trees are practically obstructing the path to get anywhere, and there are pieces of toys, play stuff, etc laying around in the weeds and sidewalk and pieces of brick and glass everywhere....yes, thats our backyard.
  So i have to go and get that mess picked. And i have had this sudden urge to do some gardening (ever since i went to the garden store on sloat to get the items needed to repot my cactus ). So i am gonna not only have to clean up the backyard but attempt to grow and garden of flowers and some kinds of vegetables...
 
My dad finally ordered my digital camera...hope i made a good decision ($450 camera cant be a bad thing). Should arrive in 7 to 10 days...cant wait.

						   Yes...today was the last day of "school" ( i do have to go to the campus on Friday since its something like prize day or some junk like that...ho-hum )
 
Friday's Final Exams: English ( did ok...at least an 85 ) 
and there was a crazy hard Geometry Exam...which i didnt finish ( but i got to finish up a couple problems today ( i had to leave right about 12:05 when almost everyone else stayed till about 12:20 )) 
I had my Latin I and History exams today...Latin was ok, maybe at least an 85 ( maybe less, i hope not ) and History i kinda messed up on but it wont really effect my 98% grade so...oh well 
anyway....i didnt do as well on most of the finals as i wanted to, but still, its only freshman year and its not the end of the world....did ok . 
now i have wednesday and thrusday off...and a little thingy that i gotta do on friday morning..and then im definetly free forever...this is great
 
Freshman year has gone by fast

The Bourne Supremacy is a pretty good thriller. It still isnt as thrilling or action packed as the first one, but it is pretty good considering the fact that most of the time sequels arent always up to snuff. Since this is the second installment of a trilogy (yes, there will be a third coming soon), im not sure how the third do. maybe itll be a blast, but i doubt it. anyway, we'll see when it comes.
 
 
Unlike the first one, Bourne is not very interesting. In the first movie, Bourne is a guy who is just trying to figure out who he is, while at the same time doing all these amazing things keeping the bad guys away and keeping himself alive. The plot was more interesting. In The Bourne Supremacy, Bourne is just a crazy killer, until the last half hour, when all of the sudden, he becomes all sorrowful and compassionate, which is kind of awkward. In the Bourne Identity, the fight scenes were more clear and exciting. In the sequel, the fight scenes were so cut up and edited and stuff that they were just hard to follow. You might as well just waited till the end to see whos left standing. The car chases and stuff make up for that though. Besides those points, the movie was good. I would give it an 8 out of 10.
 
 
now your probably thinking....is he going to give The village a better rating than Bourne Supremacy?. actually, they both have their good parts and weird parts...but Bourne seemed to have more than i wanted. so thats that.

						    urlLink    This is the cathedral (one of the many) in Salzburg. Its so far my favorite cathedral (i didnt get to see the inside of the Notre Dam so i cant say thats better, even if it might be). There are five organs inside, one above the main entrance where there is usually an organ, and four around the corners of the cross section in the front. It is also magnificantly decorated and is just amazing!

The Village is a very interesting movie. I would split it up like this. First half, somewhat scary, middle section gives away a lot of unknown info which totally changes everything, late middle section, somewhat scary,  and the last part is very good. if all that made sense to you, good. if not, oh well, watch the movie.   
The Village is not a run and hide and have nightmares scary. It is more of a suspense mixed with some scary. There are a few jump-out-of-your-seat parts...but other than those the movie is suspense. The movie dumps the audience into a world with no explanation. Through observation and close attention you figure out that its really happening in the late late 19th century. If you didnt pick that up (most people dont), then you see a whole bunch of pilgrim people that look like they just got off the Mayflower. I'm not going to spoil the whole thing for you but all i have to say is that when you get to the middle of the movie your gonna start not liking it...for several reasons. The biggest of these is that the movie spits out a lot of new things at you that you totally didnt expect, and it starts to seem like that the whole beginning was just a waste. but it wasnt and just hold on till the end, cause its worth it! I give The Village an official 8.5 out of 10.

						   so far vacation after Florida has been not so good....first of all, i actually have to do stuff like practice and clean up and HELP OTHERS....who thought of such a thing! actually, i only needed to help two friends with some music stuff, so it wasnt that bad. anyway, a neighbor from down the street and my brother and I have been playing around with this huge and thick tree branch which we cut down yesterday, and now are trying to make something out of it. besides that, we rented four movies...Magnolia, Euro Trip, and two others which i dont remember. we went and saw The Bourne Supremecy, which was my second time seeing it...its pretty good. i havent finished my unpacking, but im just gonna take out clothes that i want for the day and then after they have been washed theyll get put into the closet in the right spot...which is a kind of slow way of just taking it out of the suitcase and putting it away. less work actually.

						    life is slowly moving back to its original state...now i have practice to do, school is coming soon, got some summer reading to do (actually a whole books worth, i finished The Hobbit in Florida and now have The Things They Carried), i had to do that friday hotel thingy again...im starting to find it not worth 50 bucks...and i also gotta unpack all the junk in my suitcases, and get used to this somewhat cold weather (50s in the mornings and nights, 60s and low 70s during the day, with a nice dose of fog added to the mix). im really missing the nice 70s at night and 80s and low 90s during the day...it was reeally nice sitting out by the pool at night listening to the quiet Florida night, well, there is a lot of those weird bugs that make that chirping noise, but you get used to that. the only thing that i was missing there were friends that were my age, then it would be the life. I did have the neighbors to have fun with. A family with two little girls and a really nice mom and a cool dad, i went over a couple of nights to play XBOX with him on his hhuuggee screen tv, which apparently came with the house, including the surround sound. anyway, he didnt get to play the games that much, and when he did it was by himself against the computer, so he was happy that he had someone to play with, and a challenge. the mom was totaly different than what i expected after the stories of her from my grandmother. she was very alive and loved chocolate...i mean Loved it, as in she ate brownies that were so undercooked that the insides were still someone liquidy, covered with chocolate sauce and chocolate sprinkles and chocolate icecream...and i thought i loved chocolate.
  



so, even though i was in FL for a good 2 weeks, i still wanted to stay longer. found out that my camera held 200 pics with the 256 MB card. got about 160 of europe and 30 of Florida. i deleted 20 pictured that werent important earlier. will post some soon.

  


plane rides back were a mess. unlike the nice and easy plane rides to Florida, this time there was a delay in the air between Palm Beach International and Charlotte, thanks to some thunderstorms. then, i didnt have any time to stop for lunch as planned since we landed at Charlotte and 3:30, which was the boarding time of the next flight, and even though the airport is fairly small compared to some other ones i have had troubles with (Newark...huge) i still didnt want to be too late. i then found out after sitting on the plane for a solid 30 minutes that i did have 10 minutes to stop by at a Burger King on the way. now i know that its ok to get to the gate 20 minutes after boarding has started, since the plane left 30 minutes after. anyway, i get on the plane and they cant lift off thanks to the weather. so im really hungry and i get some pretzels and eat them...and after 3 hours my stomach isnt feeling very good. all i have is 2 extra bags of pretzels from the flight and half a snapple (kiwi strawberry flavor) and two raspberry smoothie drinks...which are the last things i want at the moment. unfortunately i didnt have time (or i thought i didnt) to go to the bathroom on the way to the gate in Charlotte...which is bad since i have a personal rule to never use the airplane bathroom...i didnt even use the lavatory on the euro flight from NY to Vienna. but i just had to...which was better than i thought. so, after landing i felt a lot better, went to the baggage claim, and there was none of my suitcases to be seen. well, i had to get them to deliver it to my house...kind of a pain in the neck. but ok. so they delivered it today at 2.
  



got a new cellphone...since i killed my old one in europe, forgot about the 120 volt to 220 volt thingy in europe. it is color and looks a lot better. and it flips out, so i wont be accidentally dialing people in my pocket....even though i usually lock the keys. im hoping to get a new computer...was hoping for a new laptop but im thinking for money purposes to get a nice desktop, since i only took my laptop out of my room once, and desktops are less expensive and usually pack more for less $ than a laptop. and once i get to be a senior i might give the desktop to the family and get a good laptop for college. anyway, those are my computer hopes for the next couple of years....but this one seems to still have a bit of life in it. the stereo system is on hold...im gonna wait for a tv or something like that....wont be soon.

  

so today i went to go see The Village with a friend, and it was good. gonna right an official review later. tomorrow im hoping to take the MUNI downtown with some friends and just walk around and chill and talk and stuff....not too exciting.

						   this summer so far has been very fun thankz to this tour...too bad it only happens every three years or so. anyway, i loved just about everything except for the plane rides (which im quite used to by now). The plane ride from SF to New York was pretty easy because the plane was not full at all, the last ten or so rows were totally empty, which meant that people could move back there and do just about anything, and since i was extremely tired i decided to put up the arm rests on the middle four chairs in the back and lay down like a bed, which was very comfortable, and i caught up on my sleep which i lost after waking up at 4 am. So we arrived at New York and i didnt feel all too happy, since i knew there was an even loonnggeerr flight up next. So the next flight from NY to Vienna was actually a lot better than expected. First of all, i had nonly once before been on a plane with little tvs in front of every seat, which was very nice, since i could play games and watch a selection of five different movies, and i could watch the progress of the flight, and i could look at the front of the airplane and the bottom view (thanks to two cameras in the front where the pilots are and one facing down under the plane) which were very cool while taking off and landing. I watched Welcome to Mooseport and a little bit of comedy stuff. didnt sleep much though.
  
When we arrived at Vienna, we had a good couple of days totally free to ourselves, and it was great. Vienna was my third most favorite city, next to Amsterdam and Paris. I had 300 euro to spend, but i was worried (i dont know why, since i had my credit card also) so i didnt buy that many souvenirs or post cards and stuff in Vienna, which sucks, i should have gotten a key chain or something. anyway, by the time i got to Paris i got a whole bunch of souvenirs and post cards, and i sent a bunch, even though i totally forgot about writing down people addresses, but i had a few memorized (i even sent one back to my house, where no one is since the rest of the family is in Italy, but theyll see it when they get home). I bought almost 20 postcards, most from amsterdam and Paris, and i sent about 8, so i have a bunch left over, which my mom is ok with since she doesnt care much about pics that i took if im not in them. I think there are about 5 pics with me in them, so i guess the post cards are ok to keep anyway. 
  
The concerts were all pretty good. The best by far i think was the one in Paris. The worst probably the one in Rheingau Musik Festival, not that it was bad bad, it was just not as good as the others...but people still liked it. The two best places that we played for me was the first and last, the Musikverrein in Vienna and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, they are both insanely nicely decorated and everything is great. Ill post pics later. The bus rides were long but they were pretty fun, since there were people to talk and play and do stuff with, and we stopped at places and bought stuff. Really fun times. Took about 125 pics, and still have a lot of space, so ill get some pics of FL too. 
 
 
The ride back was very interesting. First of all, we get to the plane in Amsterdam and we are about to leave and all of a sudden theres a problem with the Cargo door, which they cant close, so it takes a good 30 minutes to take out all the cargo, fix it, give it a test-run, and then load everything back in. Then we took off.&nbsp;I watched The Practice, four episodes of CSI Miami, Walking Tall, and some comedy stuff...which all took up a good part of the flight, and then i played some games for 10 minutes and slept the rest of the way. Somehow the flight got behind even more, so the plane landed about an hour and a half late...weird. The only problem was, we were given an hour and a half to get off the plane and go through customs and then check out bags again and do all that, but we were an hour and a half late....so we had about 5 minutes. But ofcourse the airlines is not gonna re locate 40 people, so they held the plane while we got our own lines through security and customs...like we were VIPS, which was ok. So we get on the plane a half hour late...and then the captain announces that there will be a good 2 hour wait...why? well, the taxi thingys that take the planes out to the runways were on a very tight schedule, which means that they had to skip our plane thanks to the YO coming late, which was because of the cargo door, and the taxi thingys had to go through all the others in line and then come back and get our plane. So after 2.5 hours sitting on the plane, we finnally get out of there and get in line for the runway, but then...there was supposedly a thunderstorm near SFO....yah right, so anyway, they close the runway and we go to another were we are in the back of the line....and then they open the other one when they realize there isnt a problem...so after a good while we are finally up...and the flight is long but not bad because i was pretty used to 8 hour flights...and this was about 6, not including the long time in the plane on the ground. 
  
anyway, got some things to do today, like trying to get my pics out of the camera and building my model. post some pics and more stuff later.

						   well, now that in the past two days i have been on the plane and in the airports for a nice 21 hours approximatly (um, 8 hours from Amsterdam to Newark, 2 hours wait on the next plane while it waiting for a taxi thingy, then a 6 hour flight on that one from Newark to SF, then in the morning i got on a plane from SF to Charlette NC which was about 6 hours, and then 2 hours from NC to West Palm in FL). anyway, im pretty messed up timewise, everyone is going to sleep when i should be getting up, but im very happy to be here in FL and cant wait to do what im planning to do, like swimming ofcourse, and building my model of an airplane, and going kayaking and other stuff. gotta go through all the pics from europe and somehow get them to the comp or online. ill post details later

						   finally got enough time to get to the internet, yet i dont have much time. 5 darn euros for 15 minutes. anyway, im soon gonna go on a canal tour here in amsterdam, im having a ton of fun! so far the bus rides have been pretty fun since there is a lot of people to talk with. i have had tons of new foods (i even tried the escargo, which is surprisingly ok). So far my favorite city has been Paris, and the Hiltons have been very nice too, ezpecially the Hitlon Arc de Triumph, which is spectacular. I have taken about 120 pics on my camera so far, but only 5 have me in them, which are the only ones my mom really cares about, she says i should just buy postcards of things that i dont have a picture of me in. i bought a whole bunch (maybe like 20) but only have afew peoples addresses that i know, so i guess ill keep the rest for myself. only thing im not looking forward to is the long airplane ride ahead. The tour went by very quickly. only today and tomorrows concert and then the next day is flying home. met a bunch of people who i didnt know from before. hope everything is going well in the states. gotta go!

						   well, thankfully i didnt have to go to that music thing that i explained in the previous post, and so i got to check out the new tv, and i got to watch Gladiator (for the first time) which was a great movie. I loved it. Besides the greusome stuff which really isnt that bad now, after watching the other movies i have seen this past two weeks, there is a lot of thrill and excitement in it, and it is just amazing, cant really put it in words at the moment. aside from the movie and the new tv and the games and stuff, nothing else is going on besides the party next door and me having to do my practice and waiting for tomorrow...which nothing is happening in either...so ill see what comes my way.  
hmm...nothing to do besides make a record of all my DVDs....nothing else to do around here....hah

						   you know what really sucks? firstly, i have the head of school as my advanced english teacher...i just found out a couple days ago, and i just ordered all the books. If only i was in normal english II, which has the teacher i was hoping to have, who is a lot cooler and not as strict at all as the head of school, who is extremely strict, since we had him for one class in religion last year as a sub. Now that thats off my chest....another thing that sucks....yesterday i had to go with my mom and youngest brother and his annoying friend to Costco, and on the way had to pick up some Lithuanian girl whose living this summer with a Lithuanian teacher (who used to be my teacher for a piece that i had to play). So i walked up to the door, and the Lithuanian teacher asked me if i could go to some stupid music at menlo festival concert...which was at 3 tomorrow (which is today unfortunatly), and i off the top of my head came up with the lame excuse of "well, i dont know becuase i have lots of movies that we rented to watch tomorrow....". yes, i know, it s pretty lame and probably in her eyes stupid becuase she could care less about movies that i rented....anyway, so i finally say after some awkward silence that i might be available. i asked how long i would be gone, she said about 40 minutes, then paused, and then said to get there. ok, so the concert is about an hour long, and it takes about 80 minutes to get there and back. well, what a great way to enjoy my saturday, spend a nice 2 hours and a half riding in a car and watching a concert with some Lithuanian teacher. at the same time, my neighbor is getting a "big" screen tv (it would be more accurate to say "bigger" screen tv). and the time to be watching it is today at 3, which is the time im watching a stupid concert...oh well.
  
things are a tiny bit better and someways worse with my middle bro and sister gone. first of all, the noise level and annoyance level is very low. secondly, i have to do some easy yet teadious things around the house that waste my time, but then again, their easy. I have been left alone a lot more than i thought i would be....besides having to empty the dish waaher and clean and make my bed. Yesterday i went and rente another batch of movies, and found out that i have rented (or the account has rented (which is 95% me renting and 5% other family members renting)) a little over 200 movies...anyway, so i returned 21 Grams and Silence of the Lambs (which wasnt that scary afterall, more disturbing) and Pretty Dirty Things and 13 going on 30 and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (which i didnt watch along with the one before that ) and Greese (which i havent seen nor did see yesterday). I got Gladiator (meant for the big screen, and another one i havent seen), Austin Powers 1 (for littlest bro), Stagmata (a scary and disturbing one that i might not watch) and The Whole Ten Yards (which i watched last night and turned out to be pretty good, review coming later, after Manchurian Candidate and Monster's Ball).
  
im gonne post a list of all my DVDs....just for the heck of it. and i might update my classical cd collection list later. how pathetic i am...humph

21 Grams is a mix of different stories that gradually come together into a very powerful tale of tragedy (and a lot of it). Now when i say gradually, i mean gradually. The movie is a little over 2 hours long, and it takes a good hour to finally get a grip on things. The movie is as if the filmakers took 75 different scenes from random points on the storyline, all about 3 minuters in length, and jumbled them all together into one messy clump. I know that sounds reaally bad, but it actually isnt once you have figured out that it is what it is. For people that need a more linear storyline and more explanation, the first half of the movie will be way over your head. It took me a solid 30 minutes of mixed up scenes to really understand who is who and when is which scene happening. I was forced to ask myself several times, "is this in the present?", "is this is the past?" and "is this going to happen?." Now, im not saying that you will definetly have a hard time figuring the movie out, but it will at least seem strange for a bit.
  
21 Grams at first is jumping backwards and forwards in time and jumps from character to character in a big frenzy. But sooner or later, from what seems to be a crazy approach to a movie, a pattern starts to come out. These "random" scenes are all pointing and narrowing down to key scenes and moments where they all converge into a somewhat linear plot. By the end of the movie, everything is pieced together and everything that was supposed to be expressed has been with amazing acting. Besides the jumble at the beginning (which once you have seen it doesnt seem all too bad, but a pretty good way of getting the audiences attention), the acting and storyline was incredible. 21 Grams is a film that will keep you thinking about it for a good amount of time. I give it an 8 out of 10.

Magnolia is a three hour long movie which features several mini-plots (or mini movies almost). Throughout the whole movie, these storylines go on and occasionally interconnect with one another. This makes the movie verryy hard to follow at somepoints. When this interconnecting and mixing actually works out, it is wonderful and amazing. at some points, the plots are so far from each other that you can get pretty annoyed, but if you hold through, and keep everything fresh in your head, and not forget anything, you will love it, or almost love it.
  
In order to understand anything in Magnolia, you have to remember the characters. Throughout the movie, the "leaves and branches" of all these characters and their stories start to come together and make sense. Another thing is how different the scenes are, which kinda keep you at the edge of your seat, at least at the interesting parts. Some scenes are long and unbroken with slow proggression, and some are really fast with many closeups and quick cuts. This is just one of the many details of the movie that keep it from being a loong and confusing wreck.
  
So, Magnolia is a movie about chance. In the beginning there are three different crazy, yet true, stories of almost unbelieveable things happening. The point of the three stories is that no matter how crazy or strange or how freaky some happening might be, its all because of chance. So for the next 150 minutes, the movie expands upon that idea, except with many different storied which are a lot longer and more complicated and complex than the first three. Overall, the movie makes you think, and wonder about different things. Its not a movie which you can watch and just switch right away to another one. It takes a moment to sort out everything that has happened and realize the importance, at least, it took me a while to figure it out. I guess it would help to view it again ( maybe even twice to really understand it ), but its one hell of a long movie to need to watch again. And not only is it 3 hours, but its a long three hours, as in theres not much that happens. Its not a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Its more of a sit back and try to understand it movie. I give it a 9 out of 10.

						   just got the pics from Ofoto, and they are awesome. for a nice $25 i got 6 great looking 8"x10"s and 2 5"x7"s and 4 wallet sized pics from the euro tour. wonderful. i gotta frame some of the 8"x10"s and hopefully i can get them to go into my room, while mom is hoping for two of them to go into the library. anyway, i had my first lesson in a month, which went ok. im still not sure what the requirements this season for YO seating auditions are, so im assuming there is a solo piece and stuff needed, until i get the official word from someone or something (presumably a flyer).
  
My sister and middle brother are going to FL, finally. I actually wanted to see them after my venturing around the world, but now im almost getting used to them, so i dont mind them going away for a good 9 days or so. They are frantically packing since they gotta go at 7 tomorrow morning. Might get kinda lonely now that i think about it with a nine year old (my youngest brother) all day, but hopefully he will be occupied with his little friends that come over to play videogames...
  
Last night i watched Gothika, which is a pretty scary movie. I got to admit, im not all too fond of scary movies, and believe it or not, sometimes they get to my head. But it wasnt that scary. More suspense and thrilling, and scary too. i also rented 21 Grams, which i havent watched at all yet, Silence of the Lambs, which i will watch with the neighbor down the street when she gets her big screen tv, and Monster's Ball, which i heard was good but havent watched yet. These are all due friday at 8, so i have time. My sister rented Grease, which i have never seen, but maybe will if i have time. Silence of the Lambs is supposedly extreeemmeellyy scary....so im not sure what ill do after watching that. I also have been ordering a lot of stuff from this practically free giveaway DVDS site, which i have gotten 6 DVDs from so far, for a whopping 2 dollars and some cents. there is a catch though. I gotta order 5 more dvds at "normal" price (which is pretty cheap compared to stores) in the next 2 years. So today i ordered 6 more in another name but on the same credit card, and i realized that as long as its the same credit card i gotta order 5 more at normal price in the next 2 years. so in all, i gotta get 10 DVDs from the site at "normal" (about 10 to 20 dollars) price in the next 2 years....which isnt bad, considering that i got 12 DVDs for 5 almost 5 dollars.
  
so, besides all the movies and practicing, i got tons of cleaning and reading to do. One good thing is that i ordered a ton of new cds for my "collection". i think about 15 in all (almost 200 dollars worth). good thing i got my own credit card. (:

						   this past week i have watched probably the most i have ever in one week, not just movies at the movies, but renting movies aswell. its actually really fun, except that theres almost no time to watch all of them. Today i watched The Manchurian Candidate, most of the beginning of Notting Hill, and some of Magnolia (now we are about half way through it). We finished EuroTrip last night and took it back today and got 21 Grams, which is due Thursday, and we havent watched any of it. Magnolia and Notting Hill and My Best Friends Wedding are due tomorrow at 12, so we gotta watch those tomorrow morning. I saw the Village and The Bourne Supremacy also this week. Im hoping to rent Fight Club soon after we get rid of the ones we have. besides movies, there has been a lot of practicing and cleaning going on. my mom seems to bet into a bitchier and bitchier mood everyday...im getting reaalllyyy tired of this Friday Hotel gig. besides that we went to the YMCA at about 8 and did some gym stuff, and then checked out the pool and did some laps and played and stuff. now my eyes sting like hell and my dad has just rampaged into my room after i was supposedly "going to bed". luckily i heard him coming down the stairs. he gave me a little "be more good" speach, probably because my mom just told him upstairs about todays little fiasco this morning with the burner...well, im in bed and its about 9 in the morning and she pops the door open and yells "erik, get up and eat your breakfast which is ready right now...and then go do your practice, etc. ". so i get up and find my food on the stove under some foil, so i figure that everythings off (i didnt really think about it becuase it is always off anyways if moms not there) and eat my breakfast and get to the millions of things my mom wanted me to do. so she comes home and tells me to get all the crap out of the car (she went shopping) and then she comes out yelling that the burner is still on (low enough that my French toast wouldnt burn) and that im very irresponsible and all that jazz.....so im figuring that the days plans are screwed and i might as well go and twiddle my thumbs....but luckily my sister and her friend from Lithuania want to go see a movie so my mom lets me and some people go too. anyway, so thats what started the whole grumpy and bitchy attitude for the day.

						   besides having to go to church and acolyting and stuff, today was a pretty fun and free day. the plan was to get up at 7:45 and get down the street to a neighbors house by 8 to watch the movie Magnolia, which we were trying to do the night before before my brother and i were rudely interrupted by an unwanted phone call from my mom telling us that it was time to do some practice and that the place was being "locked up". and it was 9:00 pm....and i thought it was summer vacation...anyway, so my brother came in at about 8 all ready to go and i said screw it and so that was that, and we woke up a nice hour and a half later for breakfast and church.
  
so after church our plan was to go downtown and explore, so because i knew that wasnt gonna fly with my parents (very slim chance that we could have if i explained exactly what we were going to do) i decided to just go to my dad and tell him that the three of us were gonna explore a bit for a couple of hours. ok. so we go downtown and check out the Apple store and by some stuff at Virgin and eat and stuff. not too bad.
  
so we come home and watch EuroTrip, which was somewhat fullfilling. not a very complicated and meaningful movie but it did give plenty of nudity, swearing, comedy and whatnot. thinking about expanding the horizons of our explorations, maybe to Sausalito....i dont know what to say to the parents about that....we'll see

This movie was pretty good. After watching it i wasnt too pleased about it but thats only because i had high expectations for it. Now that i look at it as just a normal movie it isnt too bad. Overall Anchorman is a good movie.
 
 
The movie is about the behind the scenes action at a news station. It is not a serious movie at all. Anchorman is more of a silly and over-the-top movie than i expected. Yes there are some funny parts, but most of it is just sillyness and lame jokes mixed into a comical environment. Will Ferrel is the perfect man for the part of Ron. Like his roles in Elf and Old School, he is just the type of silly and somewhat comical guy for the part. Besides the weird scenes and somewhat awkward jokes and over the top silliness, Anchorman does have its hilarious and pretty funny parts. I give it a 7 out of 10.
