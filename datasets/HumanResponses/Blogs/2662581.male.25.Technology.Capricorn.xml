      Living with Ceylinco is very hard. But I enjoy all their dissisions and take them as challenges. That makes me growing in the IT market place.  In the other hand, Microsoft is very good company to work. (not because of the salary)! The man who was appointed as the country manager is a super cool guy.  He does have YOUNG BLOOD ! (not the old style cnt, cnti, cmt etc;)   Best of luck to him !

      A cool tip from a fellow MVP  ASP.Net Server Control can be broadly classified into 4 categories...  1. Intrinsic Controls -These controls correspond to their HTMLcounterpart... eg Textbox control, Button control 2. Data-Centric Controls - These controls are used for data display,binding, modification purposes... They bind to various data sources... e.g..DataGrid control 3. RichControls - Usually do not have HTML counterparts... These areusually composite controls which in themselves contain other controls...e.g. Calendar control 4. Validation Controls - As the name suggest they are used forvalidation purposes and can validate many type of user inputs.... e.g.RegularExpressionValidator  &nbsp;

      Found a good link. Check this out ! I do beleive the author too. Coz same thing happend to me !   The real surprise with Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 isn't potential compatibility issues, but the mayhem that can occur when SP2 is downloaded onto a system.  CRN Test Center engineers evaluated a release candidate two (RC2) version of SP2, and upon completion of the install on three out of five systems, the machines blue-screened. A message stated that "winserv" was missing. The blue screen occurred on both Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel platforms, and all systems were running Windows XP Pro with Service Pack 1 installed. Every possible avenue to get back into Windows failed.  To remedy the problem, CRN Test Center engineers reached out to Microsoft. The company provided instructions on how to work around the blue screen and uninstall SP2, but it didn't answer questions on what causes the blue screen or the specific systems that may be affected. Microsoft recommended using the Windows XP recovery console to boot the system and then accessing the "%windir%\$NtServicePackUninstall$\spuninst" folder.  Once in the folder, engineers had to rename "spuninst.txt" to "spuninst.bat" and execute the batch command "batch spuninst.bat." When that process was completed, a rollback of the Service Pack file should have occurred. That didn't happen. So the batch file had to be executed a second time, and then access to Windows XP was restored--but with some caveats. Once back in the Windows operating system, Test Center engineers had to open the registry and set "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RpcSs\ObjectName" to "LocalSystem." Next, engineers executed the "windir%\$NtServicePackUninstall$\spuninst\spuninst.exe," which prompted additional rollback changes to the registry.  After that process finished, some interesting events occurred. The rollback process uninstalled every device that existed in the PC. Network cards, video cards and all system resources were uninstalled. The PC was able to recover all of the uninstalled items, except one, upon a reboot. The graphics card, the Matrox Millennium P650, couldn't be recovered. Engineers tried to reinstall the drivers but, oddly enough, the Matrox folder was erased from the system and unable to be recovered. The only way to correct the problem was to go to Matrox's Web site and download the drivers from the support page.

      PC World Says,.......  Microsoft Launches New Shopping Site   Windows Marketplace will be advertised in XP's Start Menu, IE browser.  Joris Evers, IDG News Service Monday, July 12, 2004 Microsoft is working on a new shopping Web site for software, hardware, and peripherals that it plans to advertise in the Windows XP Start Menu and the Internet Explorer Web browser.       Advertisement                Called "Windows Marketplace," the Web site is slated to go live for U.S. Windows users by year's end, according to Microsoft, which plans to officially announce the online store on Monday at its Worldwide Partner Conference in Toronto.  The Windows Marketplace will be a way for Microsoft partners to peddle their wares to the millions of Windows users, the Redmond, Washington-based software vendor says in a statement.  Providers that are expected to sell their products through the store include Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Circuit City Stores, Buy.com, and Best Buy Company, according to Microsoft. Products that have gained a "Designed for Windows" logo will be easier to find on the Web store through a special search filter, the software maker says.   Built-In Links Aside from advertising the online store in Windows, Microsoft plans to link to the site from its online properties. The link in Internet Explorer will be made through Windows XP Service Pack 2, which is expected out in the coming weeks. Also, the Start Menu link that currently points to the Windows Catalog will likely redirect to the Windows Marketplace in the future, a Microsoft spokesperson says.  The U.S. version of the Windows Marketplace will be maintained by online publishing company CNet Networks, which will provide product and pricing information for over 100,000 products. Software downloads will be offered through CNet's Download.com Web site, according to Microsoft.  Vendors who currently have a merchant relationship with CNet will be automatically included on the Windows Marketplace, as will products with that have been granted the designed for Windows logo, Microsoft said. Details on the relationship between Microsoft and CNet were not released.  Windows Marketplace is a U.S.-only initiative for now, however plans for international expansion are in the works, the spokesperson says.

      My main server these days runs Small Business Server 2003, as well as Exchange, since it’s a part of the package. I haven’t yet installed Exchange 2003 SP1, so I’m glad to have caught this relevant update before moving to Exchange SP1. There are only a couple of minor glitches, but one is certainly notable. The monitoring tools in SBS will bark about Store.exe (the main Exchange message store service) chewing up vast amounts of memory. It does eat memory, to be sure, but it’s not generally anything that will endanger the health of the server since it’s pretty good about allowing other processes to use RAM when needed. The typical pile hoarded by Exchange 2003 after SP1 will appear to increase a bit, which is actually by design, as explained by Evan Dodds on his Exchange blog. It’s simply a matter of reporting… which comes back to the reason for this update to begin with. Nice little circle, eh?  Just as an example, my SBS box has 2GB of RAM at present, over 400MB of which (prior to Exch2K3 SP1) is being utilized by the Store.exe process. That sounds like a lot, particularly given the fact that there are less than a half dozen mailboxes. Welcome to Exchange’s memory footprint. If I look at the VM Size in Task Manager, however, it reports about 30MB. The rest should simply be a Jet database cache, which is fine as long as it plays nice with other services. The problem with this perception is that it’s not always an illusion. Keep an eye on your own server’s RAM needs, and it might not be a bad idea to launch something memory-intensive once in a while just to see how Exchange will react (with the usual mention of mandatory backups and preferably in a test environment).   If you do find that RAM is an issue, the /3GB switch can be used in the BOOT.INI file to give Exchange more virtual address space to work with. This helps avoid fragmentation of the address space in the event of a busy server that appears to have plenty of RAM otherwise. Note that Exchange 2000 and SBS 2000 do behave a bit differently, and overall, my impression is that the 2003 versions handle memory noticeably better. Your mileage will likely vary heavily.

      Do I Really Need XP SP2? 07.08.2004 @ 12:19 PM PT | Fogarty | Google It   By Matt Hartley  Welcome to “Just Ask Matt!” - The IT industry’s answer to the help column, only slightly more medicated. Today, Don writes:   My question is this: Do I really need to install XP service pack 2? My 2 computers sit behind a Netgear router. I have Zone Alarm on one and Norton Firewall on the other. Both run Norton AntiVirus on an XP Pro install. I’ve read the SP2 preamble and I really can’t see any added value in applying this upgrade. Whaddaya think? Thanks!  Well Don, if you want to run Windows XP and you want it to be as secure as it can possibly be, then, yes, you need it. Let me explain why. Microsoft has put together a bunch of patches, updates, and other needed goodies for Windows XP users. While I have not really studied a whole bunch on what it does to a PC after installation (Problems, bugs, etc.), I imagine it will be a similar install to what we got with SP1.  Some things to make sure to do:   Create a system restore point. While I am sure that it will install fine, this never hurts.  If it prompts you with the option to archive old system files, go ahead and do it. Along with the system restore point, this can come in handy if something goes horribly wrong with the update to SP2.  Good luck!

      Microsoft to pitch security as 'competitive advantage'      Microsoft will pitch security as a "competitive advantage" at its worldwide partner conference in Toronto next week, but it may be a tough sell to attendees who are still waiting for the software maker to deliver on some of last year's security-related promises.  Microsoft's second annual Worldwide Partner Conference is focused on helping its partners to sell more Microsoft products.  Attendees at last year's event welcomed Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer addressed head-on some of the security challenges the software maker faces and outlined steps it said it would take to address them.  However, Microsoft has yet to deliver on most of the promises Ballmer made. For example, customers are still waiting for a single patching experience and an update to the Software Update Services (SUS) patch management tool, both of which Ballmer said would be out in the first half of 2004, and both of which have been delayed.  Additionally, Ballmer promoted the security enhancements in Service Pack 2 for Windows XP. That update was scheduled to be released in the first half of the year but has also been delayed and is now expected some time in the third quarter.  As a result, many of Microsoft's partners will come to Toronto with the same concerns about security that they had last year, said Paul DeGroot, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft. The concerns may have even grown because of the recent attacks on Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser, he said.  "There have been enough fires between now and last year's Worldwide Partner Conference; security is still going to be a preoccupation for partners," DeGroot said. "The things that Ballmer promised progress on haven't been achieved."  IDC research director Marilyn Carr agreed. "You can expect to hear the same issues tabled this year, as they have not gone away," she said.  Partners, just like end-users, want Microsoft to make it less of a headache to keep up with security patches, she said.  Microsoft has planned 10 sessions in a special security breakout track at the event. The introduction to the track on Microsoft's website makes it seem as though the supplier believed its security challenges are a thing of the past.  "Clearly security has become a competitive advantage as we engage with our mutual customers," it said.  Ballmer is set to address the partner audience on the final day of the conference. He will be joined on stage by Mike Nash, head of Microsoft's Security Business and Technology Unit.  Partners come to the event looking for guidance on Microsoft's strategy and for information that will make it easier for them to sell their products. It includes keynote speeches, breakout sessions and hands-on labs, as well as an extensive opportunity to network with other partners and Microsoft experts.  Over 5,000 paid attendees have registered this year, about 20 percent more than last year, according to Microsoft. Tracks that include some of the sessions include sales and marketing, business leadership, application platform opportunities and vertical markets.  Aside from security, another challenge for Microsoft is persuading users to upgrade to the latest versions of its software. Microsoft sells most of its software through its partners, so it is important for it to give them the right training. Sessions have been planned on moving customers from Windows NT 4.0 and Exchange 5.5 to newer editions of those products.  On the desktop, Microsoft has made it a priority to sell more copies of Office 2003 and Windows XP. At the event it will discuss its latest "desktop deployment initiative" and a tool called the "solution accelerator for business desktop deployment" to make it easier for partners to deliver systems with those products.  This year's partner conference will be the second event to combine Microsoft's "traditional" partners with those that it inherited when it bought Great Plains and Navision, applications suppliers that are now part of Microsoft Business Solutions (MBS).   Microsoft has also been consolidating its various partner programmes into a single, global Microsoft Partner Programme, announced in October. The programme went into effect in January and will be implemented in phases through 2005. MBS partners started to join this month, and the transition has not gone completely smoothly.  "Microsoft is at a very transitional stage," Directions on Microsoft's DeGroot said of the supplier's partner organisation.  "I expect them to announce a few additional services for partners at the conference, but I think they are in a situation where they probably don't want to significantly tweak the partner programme."  Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference starts on 10 July.

      A good article from a fellow MVP.  This is just a small little thought, which I thought, can be shared... Whenwe try to access data from a table in DataSet many a times we have to usethe name of the columns... We have multiple Datagrids bound to each tableand many other controls of your page also access data from these tables...Now, just in case your column name changes in the table you would want tohave minimum impact on the stuff that you have to change...As a solution to this you can have DataDefinition class... This class canjust return back the name of the columns as properties, you can define theselight weight classes if you have less number of tables to be accessed... Inany case if you do not follow this approach then it is always advisable tohave constants declared at a common location and store your column names inthere....You can later use either these constants or light weight classes to get thecolumn names...PS: Do note that by introducing such things you can make your design moremaintainable but sometimes loose on performance... Take decisions on thebasis of what is ideal for your situation... Don't sue a poor fella like mefor suggesting, you anyways won't get much... :-) Vishal JoshiMicrosoft MVP .Net
