      The last time I attempted to publish to this here blog nuthin' happened!  I spent an entire 15 minutes of my life typing words of brilliance that I wanted to share with the world.  Now, today because I have nothing sagacious and earth shattering to share, publishing will be just fine and this will be the most visible post here on my brand new blog.  So now I shall click "publish" and see if this works.  If it does work out, I feel compelled to say something deep...sooooo...."where you are is exactly where you are supposed to be."  How's that? :-)

      It's July 4th here in America land.  You know, I do love this country so much.  Traveling around the world let's me know just how lucky I am to be living here.  While I was in The Congo, I saw poverty and isolation that is hard to imagine... That being said, I am increasingly confused, conflicted, careful and cautious as hell as we are currently living under the empire of King George Bush the Second.  Yikes.  Everyday seems to be bring some scary new revelation -- more soldiers die in Iraq, the economy stalls, Bush vacations, and on and on.  But war is nothing new.  We human types seem to get our jollys from killing each other en masse every few years.  Somehow we think it "fixes" things.  Well, I guess without The Civil War here in the U.S. I wouldn't be typing this right now on my trusty PC - hence, the conflict in my sometimes way too active mind.    On this July 4th, when I think back to 1776 and what the majority of my ancestors were doing, I see brown women slaving - literally! - over a hot coal stove fixing the fixins for the masser and his genteel, well-bread and awesomely lovely slave- holding family.  I see brown men in the fields bent over picking the cotton that they will never wear.  I wonder if they heard those words we celebrate "we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."  Man oh man...it was "self-evident" to our Founding Fathers...maybe they were more confused and conflicted than I was.  Oh yes, but it did say _men_ and I guess chattel slave-like folks don't count.  Pardon my cynicism.  I think the Declaration of Independence is one of the coolest and most poignant documents ever created -- I sure just wished the folks who wrote it believed what they wrote down in their  souls.   Maybe then everyone other than white upper class land-owning males would be "created equal."    Sometimes I think God must just be scratching his head at all our madness and mayhem.

      OK...I am missing something.  We live in a country that is focused on fighting for the rights of others...heck, we continue to send millions/billions a month to Iraq to ensure that the citizens have "liberty and justice for all" (more on that later).  Yet, just down the road a bit from the Middle East, many many many people in The Sudan are suffering beyond measure.  There is extreme "ethnic cleansing"  happening as I type, yet the voices of freedom on this end are strangely quiet.  Well, I must give it to Colin Powell that he has recently recognized what is happening in this truly godforsaken land, and he is partnering with Kofi Annan, but I don't see images of the dying plastered on my TV set every evening at 6:00pm.  I should see these images.  I should be reading about the outrage we as a society are feeling.  Maybe if the Sudan would discover oil or the people dying would all of a sudden grow blonde hair, we could rally the troups - literally and figutarively.      Here is a recent article on what is happening(printed here without permission):    Burning, rape and death: Darfur's frightened villages recount their ordeal  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   [ Latest News From Sudan At Sudan.Net ]  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  News Article by AP posted on July 01, 2004 at 20:19:00: EST (-5 GMT)  Burning, rape and death: Darfur's frightened villages recount their ordeal  EL-FASHIR, Sudan (AP) -- First come the airplanes. Then the horsemen who burn, rape and kill.  Over and over, terrified villagers told the same story Thursday as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan got a firsthand look at the crisis engulfing Sudan's Darfur region.  Annan, accompanied by government ministers and senior U.N. staff, toured one of the 137 camps where some of the 1 million people chased from their homes over the past 16 months have sought shelter.  Sitting on mats shaded by trees, he chatted with camp elders and women who described the waves of attacks humanitarian workers have likened to ethnic cleansing.  Human rights groups accuse the Sudanese government of backing militias of Arab herders, known as the Janjaweed, in a campaign to forcibly remove African farming communities from the vast western region where they have coexisted, and in some cases intermarried, for centuries. Camp residents echoed their accounts Thursday.  "First the planes were flying over us and bombing us. Then the Janjaweed came," said a 20-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Zahara. "They started to shoot and burn. They took all our belongings. They took men and slit their throats with swords. The women they took as concubines."  Zahara, a mother of four, lost her parents in the panic and has no idea what happened to them. She is now among the estimated 12,000 people living in makeshift shelters of branches and plastic sheeting at Zam Zam camp, just south of the North Darfur town of El-Fashir.  Here, at least, there have been no attacks, residents said. But women say they don't dare venture out for fear of meeting the militias they say regularly abduct and rape African women and girls.  Annan -- who is on a three-week tour to the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Europe -- has raised the possibility of sending in international troops if Sudan's government can't safeguard its people in Darfur. In a meeting with Sudanese Cabinet ministers Wednesday, he said he wanted to see progress in the next 24-48 hours in resolving the conflict, which has killed up to 30,000 people and left some 2 million in desperate need of aid.  The United States called on the United Nations to impose an arms embargo and travel ban on the Arab militias in a draft resolution submitted Wednesday to coincide with a visit to Darfur by Secretary of State Colin Powell. Powell presented the Sudanese government with a timetable to implement its promises to disarm the militias, lift restrictions on humanitarian workers and negotiate a settlement to the 16-month uprising.  The Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Army, two groups drawn from the region's African tribes, took up arms in February 2003 over what they call unjust treatment by the government in their struggle with their Arab countrymen in Darfur. A cease-fire was signed April 8, but both sides accuse each other of violations.  The rebel movements also are confronting Arab militias blamed by humanitarian groups for attacks that have razed hundreds of villages in the area.  The government denies any complicity in the militia attacks and says the warring sides are clashing over land and scarce water resources.  "The government did not use the Janjaweed or ask them to come in (the conflict)," Osman Keber, governor of North Darfur, told Annan on Thursday. "We do not deny that they did a lot of atrocities, but they came by their own agenda."  He underscored that rebels are also committing abuses and reiterated the government's pledge to improve security and disarm all armed groups.  In their talks with Annan, Cabinet members said the government planned to double the number of national police in the region to 6,000.  Annan welcomed this commitment Wednesday, saying: "I think we are all agreed ... without security, the people are not going to go back to their villages."  "I am happy to hear that the government accepts its responsibility for protection," he said.  But for the villagers sheltering at Zam Zam, the news was no consolation.  "The ones who hit us with planes, we don't trust them," said 19-year-old Sakina Mohammed Idris.  She said she was among 42 girls captured in her village by turbaned raiders and forced on a 21-day journey on foot through the desert. Along the way, the women were raped. When the militiamen tired of them, they were released.  "They spoiled me three times," she said bitterly.  While the governor insisted stability is returning to the north of the region, humanitarian workers said attacks continue, particularly in the west.  Over the past week, hundreds of desperate refugees congregated at another site near El-Fashir, hoping for assistance. But when Annan arrived to meet with them Wednesday, the settlement was deserted. Only their donkeys remained.  Social Affairs Minister Ahnoun Mohammed Ebrahim pointed to heavy flooding in the area and said the refugees had been moved overnight to a better camp already serviced by U.N. agencies and aid groups. But U.N. officials said that place was already overcrowded and the refugees were certain to be turned away.  A U.N. spokesman in New York said humanitarian workers were invesigating the disappearance of about 5,000 refugees from the site.

      Well, my first attempt at this and I just erased three paragraphs of absolute brilliance, and since my muse has since flown away, I shall just say - howdy to all!  I look forward to sharing my thoughts with the world -- or the three other people who will be reading. :-)  I've got opinions and I gotta say 'em!  See you in cyberland.
