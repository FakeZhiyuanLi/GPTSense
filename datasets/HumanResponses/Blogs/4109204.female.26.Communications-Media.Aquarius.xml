       My friend Matt and I always make fun of jocks who "assign" the day of the week to the listener! Our competition, 98Q, does this allll the time. I find it completely irritating. (Everything about 98Q is completely irritating!) Anyway, Heartman is the worst offender. For example, he'll say: "It's your favorite Heartman, a-go-go, on your Friday!" Matt will say, "Oh, I didn't know it was MY Friday!" LOLOL! And I'm not even kidding about the "a-go-go" and the "your favorite Heartman!" He really does say that! Now THAT'S quality radio! *sarcasm*  Okay, I know I'm not the best jock in the world, but can't you find  anything  more compelling to talk about than the day of the week? I'd rather hear them talk about Jessica Simpson's socks or something. Even THAT would be more compelling. But I'm really not complaining! If they want to suck, by all means--let them suck! I would never tell them NOT to do those irritating things...because if they suck, it helps us! LOL!  Let's visit some other annoying jock-isms while we're on the subject, shall we? Here's another one that drives me up the wall! "Here's the new one by Kelly Clarkson! It's Breakaway FROM 98Q!" It's  ON  98Q, you jackass!  Not  FROM  98Q! Now, if you were talking about a PRIZE, then it would be FROM. For example, "Make sure you come down to the Bridgewater Fair this weekend to win a $3000 diamond with a custom setting  FROM  the New Y105!"  I'm not even gonna go into their crappy phoners and the fascinating converstations that their jocks have with the interns--on the air--about the most boring and non-topical things in the world! Oh, and don't get me started on their 2-1/2 minute long drops from remotes! 98Q sucks some serious ass and they get freakin' 11 shares simply by default; because they come in everywhere. If we fix our signal issues, we can dominate Danbury. And I can't wait for that! It'll be OUR day...whichever day of the week it happens to be! Heheh.

       ...LITERALLY! Just stick it right in my eye!!! I'm SO done!  I live in a world where a creepy, annoying guy has gotten a full-time radio gig over perfectly qualified applicants--WHO ACTUALLY SOUND GOOD! The whole thing just bugs the crap out of me! It's a long story, and very complicated. But you have to know this idiot to understand why I'm so pissed off! Not only is he annoying and creepy, but he's also a liar. And he'll lie to make himself look good. It's so fucked up. No-one in the building can stand him! Oh, except of course the new boss who even considered hiring him in the first place! The old one NEVER would have allowed this to happen--EVER! And the only reason he has a job in radio is because of his daddy. (Not that there's anything wrong with that--if you actually have talent!!! BUT HE DOESN'T!)    But the thing that REALLLLY pisses me off is that several of the girls in the building went to management and expressed their concern with how he acts around us. In other words, he borderline sexually harasses all the females in the building. And management not only stuck up for him, BUT THEY HIRED HIM!!! It's so wrong! There are way more talented people who could have gotten the job that WOULDN'T stare and lurk and follow and touch! EW! He's the type of guy who will tell everyone you're his girlfriend if you just say hi to him. He pretty much tries too hard to get people to like him. And he thinks he's funny! Say I'm sitting in the production room putting spots into the system. He'll come in and go, "Let me guess, production work, huh? Ha ha ha!" It's like, "No shit, Sherlock!" Ugh, and he has this fucking annoying laugh!       He's so nasty! I can't stand listening to him! His voice makes me cringe! He makes me want to change the station! And if THAT'S what they want to have the listeners do, fine! Maybe then they'll learn. And what will he do at remotes? Management says they had him do a "practice remote." HOW THE FUCK DO YOU DO A "PRACTICE REMOTE???" Gimme a break! He's gonna scare away our listeners!       And I'll just sit back and say, "I TOLD YOU SO!"      Seacrest, OUT!

          I'm a big fan of song lyrics!  So, I've decided that every so often, I'll post a blog with the lyrics of a song that describe my mood.    "Heaven" by Los Lonely Boys 	     Save me from this prison  	Lord help me get away  	Cause only you can save me now  	From this misery  	Cause I’ve been lost in my own place  	And I’m getting’ weary  	How far is heaven  	And I know I need to change  	My ways of livin’  	How far is heaven, Lord can you tell me  	Cause I’ve been locked up way too long  	In this crazy world, how far is heaven  	I just keep on prayin’ Lord  	Just keep on livin’, how far is heaven  	Lord can you tell me, how far is heaven  	I just got to know how far, how far is heaven  	Lord can you tell me  	(translated from Spanish)  	(You that's in a higher place  	Send me down a blessing)  	Cause I know there’s a better place  	Than this place I’m livin’, how far is heaven  	And I just got to have some faith  	And just keep on giving, how far is heaven  	I just wanna know how far   GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!

       Do you ever get the urge to just drive and see where you end up? I always think of doing that when I'm in the car. I wish I was more spontaneous. I feel tied down right now. I don't have the money to travel and I'm always working. I'm really itching to leave. There's so much more beyond this boring state. There's a whole country out there! With tons of opportunities and new people! And hot guys! (I'm convinced that in order to find a quality man, I  have  to leave the state of Connecticut!! Here, they're either taken, gay, players, creepy stalker types, too young/old, just plain icky, or STUPID! Or they take the time to pursue  ME , then proceed to waste  MY  time with the "I-just-wanna-be-friends" crap!! Screw that. What's the point?)      But I'm getting so bored here. I'm tired of living on crappy money--never having enough to do things that I want to do. I'm tired of feeling guilty when I  DO  spend it on something fun, the occasional outfit, or when I go out to eat (which is ALWAYS!) I want to pay off my bills, get out of debt and live comfortably! (Of course, I'll be rich when I'm famous, but in the meantime, some pocket change would be nice!) I want to be able to buy great gifts for my friends for birthdays/showers/Christmas, etc. I  need  something else in my life. There's like this giant puzzle piece missing and I need to fill it. I'm ready to get up off my lazy ass and find what it is I need. I love what I do for a living. But I'm not so sure I want to continue doing it here...and there are several reasons for that, which I don't want to get into right now.       The bottom line is that I need to move on. I'm young, I'm single, and I don't have kids! I have the luxury of being able to pick up and leave if I want! I don't have to worry about leaving behind a stupid boyfriend or husband or uprooting children from their school and friends. (The cats will get pissed, but they'll have to adjust). I'd miss my family and friends, but there are phones, email, and airlines! I think I'm ready to try something new. I need to do this for myself. So, don't be surprised if I leave sometime soon. And please don't take it personal--it's not like you smell or anything! Heheh.            "I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd. You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud. It's my life. It's now or never. I ain't gonna live forever. I just wanna live while I'm alive." -Bon Jovi

       The stress of my life is owing money and not having enough to pay off what I owe! I cannot WAIT until I get the residuals from the movie I co-wrote with Liz. Being famous will solve ALL of my financial problems! And it'll be even more fun when I can tell the creditors to kiss my ass! Oh, and I will! Especially one collection agency out of Georgia called National Asset Management. If you ever cross paths with these bastards, take caution! They are horrible!  Here's how it all started. I joined a debt consolidation program last November. (Yes, there are stories that they are sometimes a scam, but I did my homework and mine is legitimate. To protect my privacy, I'd rather not say which one. If you want a referral, ask and I'll tell. I'd be happy to promote them). Anyway, I've got four credit cards consolidated on there; totaling about 7 grand. That's not nearly as bad as some people's credit card debt can be! It feels like a lot, but compared to people I know who owe 20 grand, I don't feel so bad. My student loans though--those are another story. But back to this one.  Apparently, my Capital One Account had gone to collections at some point, and so began my fiasco with National Asset Management! This wicked woman was constantly calling and harassing me. She was rude to my roommate, she yelled at me--she once scoffed at me! She was just awful! Now, I  know  it's their job to get people to pay their debt, but yelling at me and pissing me off isn't going to help the money to GROW OUT OF MY ASS TO PAY THEM! I was fully aware that I owed them money! And EVERY SINGLE TIME I talked to them, I told them that I belong to a consolidation program! But each time, they would try to tell me that I was being victimized by the program! They kept telling me that my balance wasn't going down and that the late fees and over-limit fees were still piling up, and that my consolidation was probably a scam.  It took me countless phone calls to them AND my consolidation company for me to figure out that National Asset Management simply did not accept electronic payments. The problem was simply a payment due date. My monthly consolidation payment comes directly out of my checking account. They have to process that, and then MAIL a payment to N.A.M. Twenty-one days must be allowed for all of that to occur, and the reason why the late fees kept happening was because the payment due date didn't coincide with those 21 days.  Imagine that! ALL THEY HAD TO TELL ME WAS TO CHANGE MY DUE DATE TO THE 7TH OF EVERY MONTH! They wasted months of their viciousness to try to trick me into paying THEM directly. I feel like I completely outsmarted them! When I made that final phone call and the woman (a different, less volatile one) didn't argue with me, I felt like I had finally won! And the best part is, I filed a complaint against them with the Better Business Bureau!  People who owe money don't deserve the stress I went through to figure this out. If they had told me what I needed to do from Day One, I wouldn't have gotten so angry to the point of filing a complaint against them.  So the moral of the story is: If you belong to a debt consolidation company and National Asset Management starts harassing you, beat them to the punch and tell them to change the due date! THAT'S ALL! BATTLE WON! (Or let them piss you off and file a BBB complaint! The more, the better! Maybe they'll learn!)

       Yes, they call me that for a reason. I'm all about pedal to the metal! BRING IT ON! All you slow drivers--move out of my way! I get SO mad when people try to pass me! It's, like, I feel like I'm losing or something. I suppose there actually is a Monica Geller-esque competitive side of me. Unfortunately, it shows itself in one of the most unsafe forms! But being a chick comes in handy when a cop pulls you over for speeding!       Like what happened to me tonight!      Picture this: I'm on my way home from working at the mall, happily driving--rather quickly--down I-84. I was relieved to have made it to my car safely after the creepy guy in the orange socks distributing phone books saw where I parked and came into my store twice during my shift. EW! He was so weird! He looked like that scummy Brian Mitchell guy--the one who kidnapped Elizabeth Smart! He was so freaky! And I never do this, but I had Mall Security escort me out! I was a little paranoid. But it's better to be safe than dead!  So anyway...I'm cruisin' down 84, I get on to Super 7, and there's some idiot on my ass! He keeps following me! I change lanes a few times. He changes with me. Immediately, I'm thinking the worst, "EW! It's the guy in the orange socks! He's following me!" But then the red and blue lights come on. Aw, shit. Busted.    I sit there like a good girl with my hands on the wheel. He comes over to my window and DAMN! He was one of the hottest cops I have ever seen! And he says, "Ya know how fast you were going?" And I'm like (playing dumb), "Oh, sorry Officer, was I speeding?" And he laughs and says, "Were you speeding?? Do you know how fast you were going?" And I lied and said, "80?" And he's like, "No, you were going 90!" But he had this smirk on his face the whole time! Almost like he wanted to congratulate me for going that fast! It was rather strange! So, I said, "I'm sorry, I'm just tired and I want to get home from work." He asks where I work, I tell him. Then he looks at my license--doesn't even ask for my registration or insurance--and says, "Oh, you live in New Milford. Okay." Then he sees my birthdate and says, "'78, huh? Just slow down, all right?"        I swear, he flirted more than reprimanding me! He had a dimple and the prettiest green eyes ever! Wow! He was SO hot! If he wanted to reprimand me, I wouldn't have argued if it came in the form of handcuffs! And I'm so glad to be a chick right now, because guaranteed--if I had a penis--I'd be writing out a check for that $275 ticket!

             What's a "Coxquehanna" one might ask?  I've already addressed this issue in my other blog at MySpace.com, but I felt that it needed to be revisited because it pisses me off OH SO MUCHLY!  If you're a radio-geek and you frequent the message boards at Radio-Info.com, you'll learn that it's not an it...he's actually a "he." Coxquehanna--uniquely formed by conjoining the two names of radio companies, Cox and Susquehanna--is the username of this cocky, know-it-all kid who needs to get a life!  As far as I know, he's never worked a day in his life in the radio industry! Nor does he understand the fact that Arbitron's 12+ numbers mean NOTHING! He's just someone who thrives on pretending that he knows everything and getting the last word. And he also constantly hates on the company that I work for and my particular station!  He claims that Cumulus "didn't know what they were thinking by flipping our format to Hot AC and that WDBY was DOA, and there's no hope for it...blah blah blah." It's really annoying! HELLO? Look at our target demos! We've done pretty good considering we've got signal issues in Danbury and we're not even two years old yet! (Not to mention that it's a widely known fact amongst radio people everywhere that Arbitron is never completely accurate!) And since when is HE the CEO of Cumulus?? What gives him the right to determine that we are a failure!? He is basing it on nothing other than his opinion of the company and the 12+ numbers!  I'd love to tell this kid to grow up, get a job in radio, and to shut his pie hole and mind his own beeswax. It's just not worth it, though. He always needs to have the last word. And I try to hold it in and remain professional on those boards. I did go off on him once b/c I just couldn't hold back any longer! But he burns my biscuits like you wouldn't believe!!! When you work hard to establish a new radio station and some pompous kid constantly berates it, YOU GET PISSED!  If you know this kid, kick his ass for me!! I'll bet he's the type who is all talk online, but if you get him in person, you could throw him in a locker and steal his lunch money! Can I help? I'll run his boxers up the flag pole!

       I'm so indecisive today. Well, I guess I always am. I'm in a writing mood, but I don't know what I really want to write about. Sooo, here I am--cursor blinking--and I'm at a loss for words for once. That rarely happens. I mean, I do TALK for a living.  This will be my fourth day straight working at the mall; the third day straight going right from the station to the mall. Vacation last week wasn't long enough!! I think I'm beginning to wear myself out. But I need the money and I love my social life, so I'm willing to sacrifice some R&amp;R to make a buck or do something fun! Plus, summer will be over soon. Opportunites for those outdoor activities are becoming few and far between as the August pages of my planner begin filling up. Pretty soon it's gonna get cold and crappy out! It's August already, which means it's going to be September soon, then it's gonna be Halloween and then WINTER! GRRR!  I hate, HATE winter SO MUCH! Why do the summer months always FLY and the winter months draaaaaag like a freakin' 87-year-old man in a Buick going 49 MPH in the left lane with his blinker on!? I get depressed just thinking about the cold, lonely darkness of it. I really think I have Seasonal Affective Disorder. I haven't been officially diagnosed, but just over the last couple years, I get kinda bummed out in the winter. I'm ready to pull a Lou Milano and move to Florida. He was smart. And he beat me to it.  I just can't stand the thought of freezing my ass off just to walk from my house to the car. Okay, maybe the snow is pretty for, like, a minute, but it ain't pretty anymore when I gotta clean it off my windshield! Then my jeans getting all wet from stepping in mounds of it! Oh, and then when it decides to ruin my plans! That pisses me off! And it always seems to snow when I have somewhere to go--like work! And the radio still has to be on when it snows, so I can't call out! And God forbid the mall closes! (I'm gonna take that up with the marketing director...MATT! LOL!)  I really would like to be a recluse when it snows. I'd love to be like a bear and hybernate all winter! I'll wake up for Christmas and my birthday, but that's about it. Otherwise, just wake me up in April. Screw it, I'm gonna move to Florida. Or California. Somewhere warm. I don't know, I'm too indecisive.

       Alone in a crowd:  No, it's not an oxymoron.  Well, I suppose it is.  But have you ever been in a situation where you're in a large crowd and something happens that just totally makes you feel as if you're all alone in the world?  I sure as hell felt like that last night.  I was at this club which I frequent quite often.  And I had a great time with my girls, as usual.  But there always has to be drama with a guy.  And I don't know why I do this to myself, but I do.  It's my own stupid fault.  Rewind.  Stop.  Playback.  Here's the thing.  You need the background before I go on.  The extremely condensed version of the story.  I've been drooling over this guy for, like, 3 1/2 years now, and it's kind of sad because I can't get over him.  Trust me, I've tried.  And there have been other guys that have come and gone during this time, but he is THE ONE that I want.  Plain and simple, end of story.  Maybe I'm being stubborn.  Maybe I'm being childish, immature and just plain naiive, but that's just the way it is.  I'm crazy about him.  We have so much in common!!  And there are all these little things that have happened with him that lead me to believe that it COULD happen someday.  I don't want to get into it right now because I'll be here all night.  But trust me, he knows I exist--I know that much.  It's hard to tell you specifics without revealing his identity.  Let's just say that we're friends at least.     I know I should just suck it up and tell him how I feel, but I can't do that!  'Cause then, like, ohmigod--he'll know I have, like, the hugest crush on him!  Seriously though.  If I DON'T tell him, there's always the possibility that maybe something can eventually happen.  But if I tell him, I'm afraid I'll get rejected and that chance will no longer exist.   Now, where was I?  Oh yes, so I'm at the club last night.  He was there, too.  I had had a few drinks.  I wasn't totally hammered, but I had a nice buzz.  I had talked to him earlier in the night.  But then there he was--sitting on the steps near the ladies room!  *sigh*  He's so dreamy!  LOL!  So I decided to test him.  I wanted to see if he would acknowledge me if I pretended that I didn't know he was there.  So, I get in the bathroom line.  (Ladies' room lines will be a topic for another night!)  And I'm right in front of him...making like I didn't see him.  A couple seconds go by, which felt like hours, and he finally goes, "Lisa ****!"  He always calls me by my first AND last name, or just my last name, or my initials.  And he used to make up all these horrible nick-names for me, which HE thinks are absolutely hysterical!  (I just think they're cute b/c HE made them up!) Oh, good Lord, that's just sad!  But yes.  So, I'm like, "OH HI!"  (My acting skills came in handy for pretending like I was surprised to see him sitting there!  Heheh).   So, we're talking about work and stuff--ya know, the lame small talk.  And mind you, I HATE trying to talk to someone in a club.  It's always like, "Hi, how are you?"  "WHAT DID YOU SAY?"  "I SAID HOW ARE YOU?"  You know the drill.  Anyway, at one point, we had the eye contact!  I love the eye contact!  Then, he makes it a point to pick some lint or something off my skirt.  (And I swear I caught him look me up and down a couple times!)  So, there I am, in mid-sentence when he says, "Oh, I want you to meet my girlfriend!"   My heart just stopped.  I suddenly felt like I was back in 9th grade, horrified to find out that the oh-so-cute Student Council President was dating a pretty little cheerleader.  To make matters worse, this girl was beautiful!  And I'm not a bitch, so of course I shook her hand (and I mean I really shook it--I'll discuss girls with "fish hands" another day!)  And she even had a normal name that I can't make fun of!   That made it EVEN worse!  His last girlfriend was named after freakin' weather!  And she wasn't drop dead gorgeous, either.  I've never felt too threatened by any of his girlfriends before.  It's like I always knew they wouldn't last and I'd still have my chance.  But I'm worried about this one!  Granted I talked to her for 3 seconds, but I'm just paranoid.  They're gonna get married and I'll lose him forever.    Oh yeah, so then he says, "So, what were you saying?"  Well, I had totally lost my whole train of thought!  I just kinda stammered, "I don't remember," and walked away.  Suddenly, I felt like I was all alone.  The walls were caving in on me, the whole club seemed like it was pointing and laughing at me, my friends were nowhere to be found, and my whole world came crashing down!   I was all alone in the crowd.
