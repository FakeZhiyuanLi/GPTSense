						   Welcome everyone to the newest medium of both public debate and ridicule. Welcome to my Blog that I humbly have entitled "Uncommon Sense."   While I originally wanted my space in the Blog World to be entitled Common Sense (named after Thomas Paine's Common Sense); unfortunately for me, the name was already taken. However, thanks to my ever trusty thesaurus I came up with the name of "Unusual Sense". (Note: To the descendants of Thomas Paine, I mean utterly no disrespect, whatsoever.)  To continue, I have created "Unusual Sense" with one purpose in mind. And, that would be the same as all the other "blogger" in cyberspace, and that is to voice my opinion on whatever I damn well please, based upon whatever my crazy direction my thinking is leading me too on any particular day. Oh by the way, thanks again Al Gore for the internet, and giving me this honor to be able to speak my mind. Do you think you can come by my house sometime?  Because I am just one of the common folk just as most everyone else, my voice seems to get drowned out by some other higher authority. As such an example, in the act of my voting, my voice is usually drowned out by the "huddled masses;" at home, by my wife and two dogs.   To continue, as this is "my own damn space" in the world, needless to say, I really don't want either your time, and most importantly my time.   As this is June 21, 2004,(the first day of summer)it is notable to make reference to one historical moment which has occurred today. That historical moment was when Pilot Mike Melvill took SpaceShipOne 62.2 miles above Earth, just a little more than 400 feet above the distance considered to be the boundary of space. SpaceShipOne is the first privately financed manned space flight. On a personal note, for whatever my opinion means, I think that this is a very significant moment which is parallel to the first flight of the Wright Brothers in Kittyhawk. Congratulations to all of SpaceShipOne. It is nice to see some human endeavor applied to something worthwhile and productive, hopefully for all concerned.   Regrettably, as other voices always seem to drown out the minority, so too does this historic moment and newsworthy event. At the time of this writing, news of Iraqi insurgents gunning down four US Marines has not topped out as the leading headline in today's news. As so this ongoing sense of insanity continues...  It is a shame to think how our endeavors and strengths such as SpaceShipOne has demonstrated, can be so quickly dissipated by the continued majority voices of insanity which seems not only to headlight our news, but also headlights our lives.   I am not going to profess supreme knowledge of one religion over another, hardly that at all. As an unenthusiastic Lutheran, who reformed from my Catholic ways, mostly because I was tired of carrying the guilt; I personally find it not only demeaning but outright damning, to enforce my own beliefs all in the name of whatever deity is handy; via threats, intimidation, guilt, fear and /or death because my beliefs are all right, and everyone else's is wrong. Hence my reform from the Catholic movement...  For those of you who profess such supreme authority in the name of whatever belief your choosing, make an ATTEMPT to try to live up to such supreme ideology and beliefs.   I am personally getting rather tired of seeing how far our human endeavors and strengths have taken us.   I personally look forward to continuing this blog. It's kind of nice to be able to speak my piece. Secondly too, as my wife and I seem to have to widely divergent opinions and thoughts about the latest news and their implications, it's nice to know that at least here, I can get the last word in.
