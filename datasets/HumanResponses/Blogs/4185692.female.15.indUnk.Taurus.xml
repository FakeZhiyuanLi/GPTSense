      We went shopping this afternoon. At Eckards I bought some new whitening toothpaste (yesterday Mom bought some whitening gel that i'm going to be using daily, too). We also bought some new facial cleansing pads. Then we shopped for about three hours at the Mall. I found a poncho. It's really pretty. Pink, of course. A sort of peachy pink. I also got a black t-shirt. I look good in black. I'm going to wear black to the banquet this year. I tried on a black dress in Parisian. It was short and nearly sleeveless and extremely tight. i'd never wear that in RL, but it made me look like some famous actress going to the Oscars. Gosh that thing was short. I'd have to work out two hours a day for weeks to wear it anywhere. Mom probably wouldn't let me, though. Someday, i'm going to buy a dress like that and go out for a night and party. I bet Sarah would go w/ me. That would be fun and different. Maybe i'll do that in Europe. Yep. Sounds like a plan. Anyway, I've got a few more chores to do before dinner.

      WHY DO PEOPLE WORSHIP ME?! I'm not something special! All I do is be nice to people, treat them like they mean something, and next thing you know, they're following me around, or, worse, they're parents fall in love with me and start pushing their kids to hang out with me more, or encourage their kid's worshipping attitude. It drives me nuts! Yankees are crazy. Or... these in-between Yanks and Southerners that live in Nashville. People in Mobile didn't do this. I'd be nice and get cuss words as a response. Not that i liked it better, but sometimes i wish i had all-out enemies instead of "ministries" (ppl i have to be nice to despite the things they do that drive me nuts). I don't want my friends to worship me. Bailey doesn't worship me! Marc doesn't think i'm an angel or anything. Sure, they love me and are there for me, but unless I need them to be something for me to lean on, they don't breath down my neck with concern. I may be unstable and all, but i'll let you know when i need help with something. Directly or indirectly, i'll let you know... Otherwise, i wish ppl would just lay off and if you must watch me, do it from a distance.......

      I had every right to be scared. This file system is a nightmare.... *shudder* It's HUGE and it's not like i can just put everything under his or her name, either. He has to be classified under "investments" or "insurance" or whatever. I'm totally lost and i've had it explained a few times, and still don't get it. This is horrible. I think i'll go  home and cry. Ugh..... Well, i wanted to post a really great latin translator site here so i can easily find it later. I need to e-mail bailey and ask her a few questions, too... stupid latin... i cannot wait for lunch break. http://archives.nd.edu/latgramm.htm

      Why can't i actually succeed in being mean to someone? I mean, i know this is probably a weird thing to wish for, but even when i AM about as mean as i can be to someone without throwing out all social manners, for a long while, they STILL think i'm nice!!!! Like, the other day mom talked to Mrs. Weaver. Her daughter (Caitlin) went to New Song w/ me for a while. At first, i hated Caitlin. So, i was about as rude to her as i could manage. And, after she leant me a few very cool books, i sorta warmed up to her and she wasn't so bad anymore... So, we're friends but she's going to a new school, and she told her Mom that she'd met a girl who was almost as sweet as Kathleen at her school. I was like "WHAT?! I figured i'd at least have some taint on my reputation." Bleh. I've done the same to Courtney and she's STILL talking to me over IM. She's so... SHALLOW! Mom even noted it today, she said "Courtney seems really immature. Especially in the way she handles things..." I was like "Tell me about it....." *rolls eyes* I guess she's okay to talk to every century or so, but other than that she's yet another person hanging onto me for reasons i can't fathom... Oh well. There are some pretty delicious smells coming from the kitchen right about now. Dinner is going to be good tonight. I slipped a note saying "have a nice day" in Andrew's backpack before we left school... i wonder if he's found it, yet. :/

      Yep. That's all i've been doing for the past two days. That and listening to music on my new CD player. I LOVE IT! It's awesome! I think i'll carry it around forever. :-D I hate algebra 2. It's so confusing. It rarely, if EVER makes sense to me. I just don't get it. And half the time i'll lie and say I do get it just so we can put the book down sooner and be off to something else. stupid math. I love hank the cowdog. I'm going to join his security force and get a Hank poster for my room. :-D Mom is reading Old Yeller aloud. Of all the stories my brother has to read this year, they pick Old Yeller. Looks like i'll be having nightmares tonight.... Just what i needed...... more nightmares.

      Went to see princess diaries 2 today! what a funny movie! And Mimi and Pop gave me this really really cool pink pillow that's comfy and squishy and makes you look like a mushroom if you put in on your head, and i bought a portable cd player this afternoon and it's gorgeous and sounds awesome and life is wonderful. nothing like gifts shopping and laughter to make a perfect day. *happy sigh*  "I look like a moose." "But a very very cute moose! You make all the boy mooses go 'WHUUUUUUUUH" "What?!" "WHUUUUUUUUUUUUH"

      I really didn't do anything today. Except some vacuming and making this awesome dessert that tastes like it's straight from heaven. (Well, almost.) I also finished another book today. The heroine and her friends triumphed(sp?), of course, though she lost friends and blood in the process. Sometimes i wished i lived in that world, instead of ours. At least those people have purpose. They have enemies they can see and feel and they know how to fight. They have adventures, and amazing friends. Not that I don't have amazing friends. I must admit, my friends are most definately cooler. I guess my life isn't so bad. Except i don't have adventures. And i don't have enemies that are easy to fight. They're all sneaky tormentors that are often on the winning side of the battle. Perhaps i'll go outside and swing and stare at the stars and wish i could fly into them. Maybe that'll clear my head some.

           I just finished the third book in the series Bailey has leant me.      I JUST SAW THE SWEDISH OLYMPIANS! Lots of blonde hair in that group. ;-) hehe. I wish them well in the competitions.      I wonder what it'd be like to actually be able to talk to animals. I always talk to Scout like he understands me. I love that cat. Dad says someday I'll be off at college and Scout will be at home w/ him and Mom and Melanie and Robert. Well, Melanie for two years then she'd go off to college, too. I guess after college i'll find an apartment and move Scout in with me. I'll miss tha cat. Thank heavens that's three years away. I can't believe it... I feel so old.

      So far today has been uneventful, really... Mimi and Pop are coming over for the day tomorrow before they set off again on yet another trip. Michael T. came over today to pick up the geometry solutions manual i used last year. Yesterday Andrew was nearly in a wreck. I'm glad he's not hurt. God was with him, as always. I'm off to read some more. I love these books.

           I'm back from school. The first day went well, i guess. I had all my assignments there and ready, and I didn't have any trouble on quizzes or whatever, though i was a bit lost through most of algebra 2... :/ That was to be expected, though. From the looks of it, Algbra 2 is only going to get harder, and having trouble w/ it this early is, to say the least, a BAD thing.      Bailey brought the books! YAY!!! I have something fun to READ! *beams* I'm happy!      Lunch was interesting... I sat down, and Andrew put his backpack next to my seat, but while he was in line a dozen other teens i know - i won't list them all- came up and filled up the table, so he ended up sitting at the other end w/Margaret, Melanie, and Bailey. I wasn't all that cheerful today. I was really tired and feeling kinda sick most of the time. Nowdays i get about 10 hours of sleep, and by 1PM i'm so worn out i need a nap, and i'm not even doing anything strenuous... It's strange.      I'm deturmined to loose weight and look good (jessica simpson's stomach) by next summer. I have decided it will be easier just to leave from here in Nashville instead of ditching a group in Europe. This means my trip will probably happen early summer, instead of late summer, which is good for two reasons: More time to work it all out and get the parents calmed down once i'm back, and it won't interrupt school. I have to find an all-day activity that doesn't involve other ppl i know that is planned ahead of time, long enough for me to schedule flights for that day and my parents not find out about it until i'm halfway across the atlantic. By the time that day arrives i'll be frantic with fear. Besides, i'll have all the money i'd saved to spend on that trip BEFORE i'd turned it all in to whoever i was planning on going to europe with. After all, i must keep up appearances!

      Well, the dreaded day has arrived. I'm going to try and take it one hour at a time. I've got my CD player and a few of my fave CDs (and most of the money i'll use to buy a new one). I've got all my books and homework... Summer is officially over. I guess Peter Pan doesn't exist, though I'd want more than anything to live in Neverland. Andrew says even if i could go he wouldn't let me. I've got a LOT of preparation to do for next summer. I'll need not only the money to get me TO Europe, but i've got TONS of research to do so i can get from one airport to the next without getting lost. I actually think it'd be easier if i just started here in Nashville and got to Atlanta, from there to London, and from there to my destination. That will probably end up costing more than 3000 in airfairs. To make things less complicated i'm not going to carry more than one bag, and i'll carry my cash in a moneybelt - because there will be lots of cash. I'll need it for buying new clothes to last me once i get there and for little things like food and stuff. I think my room is already taken care of though i'll have to check on that. Actually starting in Europe (like in an airport with a group of ppl i'm on a missions trip w/) might be harder than telling Mom and Dad i'll be gone ALL day then ditching them. If i time it right i could be over the Atlantic ocean before they find out i'm gone. I wonder how long a flight from Nashville to Atlanta is.... I should make a to-do list about all this. much easier if i could check things off as i complete them.

      I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL TOMORROW! I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL TOMORROW! I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL TOMORROW! I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL TOMORROW! My first check on my Algebra 2 work said 75%, and i'll probably be up til 11 working on it. I hate latin, i made a C in it last year, and that's was barely. I'm sure that y'all know i failed Algebra 1, and this World Lit. w/ Mrs. Whitver is gonna be like living on Tatooine without shelter. The sylabus says Honors Biology is a really hard class, too, even though i've always enjoyed science. I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL! I HATE school! Even lunchtime is horrid because all it is for me is a stage, and right now i'm too tired to act. Not to mention MOM will be at school this year and that means countless hours discussing how i handled this situation and how that person said that to so-and-so and i should avoid whats-his-face and that other person has problems with whatever. I can't handle that! And if i ask her not to do that, her answer is "i'm your mother! That's my job." She's really been getting on my nerves today. Well, i'm off to church.

      Marc is right, i AM an extrovert, and i'm still a baby when it comes to things i don't understand. I have yet to grasp the concept that it's okay if people do things differently. I tend to get frustrated and mad when there's something I don't get, like the Andrew/Margaret thing. That just screamed of wrongness to me. It went completely against what i'd been taught about self-image, and taking care of the way you look in other people's eyes. I'm not saying that we should strive to make everyone love us, I just know that you'll have more success in general if you have the right image. Maybe I care too much about what others think, but I do want to have ppl's approval. Some people won't ever give me that, I know, but i'd like to be someone that people like my pastors and teachers and adults in general approve of. (That's almost a joke. Of all the people on the planet, i'd never trust an adult with my secrets and yet i want their approval?! That wreaks of my Mom's doing, i think) This often results in meeting new teens who have similar values to mine, like Michal, Brianna, and Bailey. Then i run into someone like Alli, and Josiel, and my response is to pull away from them. I'd NEVER share my secrets with those two. Not because i think they're untrustworthy, but they don't dress like me, don't act like me, don't talk like me, don't hang out with my croud. I have yet to start thinking, or, more like believing, that it's okay that they're different... I mean, who would want to wear such un-fiminine(sp?) clothes? Of all my faults, this gets in my way the most, but I could probably step back and not care at all because I have friends that ARE like me, and don't really need ppl who aren't, yet. (at least not at school.)

           Good Morning! I'm starting a new blog because my other one messed up and i'm not sure how to fix it... :/ I titled this "Mind of a Princess?" cause i'm not sure i HAVE the mind of a princess, even though I want to be a princess in everything I do. I doubt i'd be good dealing with press, though. I tend to tell more truth or lies depending on my mood. When i'm depressed, for some reason i tell the truth more easily. Seems kinda weird. Sometimes i'm confusing if i'm really acting, or if i actually do feel that way. I confuse myself. Do you have any idea what it's like to be at war with oneself all the time? Hard. Trust me.      I'm up really early because i'm off to babysit. I'm deturmined to finish all of my school work today, because we might be going to see Princess Diaries 2 (jumps with excitement) and Bailey would come with us so she can give me 3 new books to read! All of which i'm just itching to get my hands on. I'll swallow them all tomorrow if i'm done with my school. Well, almost all of them. Anyway, i'll be babysitting for another 9 hours today. They're good little boys, though, so i don't really mind. My biggest challenge is getting them to turn the Playstation OFF and watch TV or a movie. I'd really like to put on a movie this morning because they played Playsation for 3 hours straight yesterday morning. That can't be healthy. I understand one or maybe an hour and a half, but not THREE. I simply must limit them more. *sigh* i sound like my mother.      Marc rocks. I luv him. :) Dunno how i got so lucky to have a friend like him. He's awesome!      I'm surprisingly calm about Thursday. I still have enough time to get my school done, and the modivation to do it. If my headaches will cooperate and I can buy a new desk chair, i may be able to work through this year. I think i have ADD. Or, what they call Adult ADD. I'm not sure what the difference is. I can remember to do things and all, i just can't sit down and DO them for long periods of time. Say, over an hour. I have to take a break, usually up to half an hour before I feel I can sit back down again. I need to research this.
