      It's 10:03pm and I'm sitting at my desk, still working. I didn't partake of the oh-so-boring chicken salad at dinner time because, frankly, I'm sick to death of lettuce!!! I can suffer through tomatoes, cucumbers and beetroots with all the crumbled feta, sweetcorn and everything else. . . but the lettuce?  About 10 minutes ago I decided that my silent protest against the 'ghastly green stuff' was actually ridiculous, since I'm the only person in the house who cares enough to  do  anything about it if I don't eat dinner.  So I opened a can of split pea and ham soup. A hearty snack indeed.  I was almost at the end of the bowl of semi-yummy brownish-greenish stuff with orange and white lumps in it (by this time I'm wondering how badly I  really  hate lettuce) when a very 'not cool' thing happened.  I sneezed, mid-swallow.   So  not cool. So very, very not cool. Not that I feel the need to be cool in the cool sense, you understand. I mean not cool in the sense that it's just  wrong  to sneeze split pea and ham soup when you're sitting at a desk full of close to seven thousand dollars worth of Web spinning equipment and assorted electronic gizmos. Not cool in the sense that the cleanup job is quite literally a case of dismantling my entire set-up. I'll have to strip it down to the bare desk to make sure I don't leave a morsel of potato or carrot in some discreet hiding place, to rot away quietly and attract undesirable visitors in the process. Not to mention the fact that some items, keyboard for example bore most of the brunt. . . bloody typical that the one thing that's right under your nose when you sneeze is fully of crevices and moving parts.  Guess I'd better go and find some soapy water, a sponge and a case-load of Q-Tips.

      It's been a surprisingly acceptable Monday so far. . .   My printer returned the message I left on Friday afternoon about my brochures, in the form of an email which was waiting in my inbox when I arrived at my desk this morning. Apparently I now have to wait for further correspondence, while they decide what they can do.   I entered a fairly small verbal contract this morning, for a project I heard about a couple of weeks ago through an existing client. The timing couldn't be better since I'm on the verge of dropping a few hundred dollars on a new graphics card and the subject matter is pretty cool too, a thoroughbred horse farm. Unfortunately, a meeting is now planned for tomorrow afternoon to get the paperwork done (you didn't think I'd settle for  only  a verbal contract, did you?). I wish more people would settle for letting UPS do their job, instead of insisting on a 'face-to-face'.   I almost didn't, but I went for a 2K run at lunchtime. The snake I saw on the way to the trail almost put paid to the whole plan, but I decided that telling myself I  had  to run or it'd  get me  was a good incentive.  Now, here I sit banging away on the keyboard in yet another desperate attempt to accomplish substantial progress on the project I've been working on for what seems like a year. I'm so close I can see the finish line. . . no, really!

      Why has the fact that my  urlLink Dryliner  just ran out made me so mad??

      I consumed nothing but junk today.  A huge bag of lime and black pepper chips, five out of a pack of six apple strudels (that's pretty disgusting), four small tubes of the new variety of Starburst and a bottle of  urlLink pink juice .  I don't feel bad because I eat nothing but chicken salad all week and by Friday I'm usually craving sugar and carbs so badly it makes my head spin. Now I'm good to go for another five days.  The limoncello bottling ceremony took place this afternoon ( urlLink see first post ). I ended up with two-and-a-half Sobe bottles full of the fabulous stuff and took one round to my neighbours after leaving it in the ice-box for an hour to get happy. When I showed up there, they were snacking on what was left of the bowl of hot-wings I bestowed on them yesterday afteroon (did I tell you about that?).  Still haven't got around to removing the hornets' nest. Their little carcasses are hanging there like some macabre warning to all living hornets and it makes me feel sick to my stomach whenever I look at it. Mr. Nextdoor  did  say that he wanted to come and take it down and lacquer it, so his eldest daughter can take it to school. That happy event hasn't transpired yet and I keep forgetting to ask him if he still wants it.  My poor computer's all busted open in an effort to keep it from overheating while I continue to demand results from it. I think I'm only going to get away with dishing out this brutal treatment for another day or two at the most and then it's going to start sacrificing other pieces of itself in protest.  I have a not-too-pleasant phonecall to my printer and a 2K run to look forward to tomorrow. . . wonder what's left in the junk-food cupboard.

      I just finished brushing a full grocery bag-full of wool out of Kye, the eldest of our two Sibes (she's eight). The job's not even half done but she already looks so much better without chunks of sad fluff hanging off all over her. She must feel pretty good too, because now she's ripping around the back garden chasing Lani, who's fifteen months old.  Hmm. . . scratch that, it just started raining, they're both in and terrorising the entire household.

      George was allowed home from the hospital on Friday but he went back today for some blood tests. I can't help wondering why they didn't do those while he was in there overnight, to save the poor little mite from having to go backwards and forwards.  I am one step closer to actually refusing to take on clients who chose not to pay for a content management system, but still insist on making their own Web Site updates. The time I've expended on correcting mistakes in the last year would probably have paid for my dream trip to the Caymen Islands. . .  twice! . On second thoughts, the best solution is to bill the little devils, like I keep telling them I'm going to!  Oh, that list I made yesterday? I did make it to the home stretch on the client project and I can see the finish line today, but it's a slightly more painful process than it would have been if I had an operational video card.  Does anyone know if I'm causing damage to either my monitor or computer's remaining functional innards by forcing it to soldier on? I could use some good news on this.

      Wouldn't you know it? Before the end of the kind of day that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling, Sod's Law just had to come into play.  My graphics card died within the last hour and I now seem to be operating on some kind of inferior on-board thing. Every letter I type makes my monitor flicker ever so slightly, moving windows around the screen is like watching my Dad's old  urlLink Atari 2600 game console  and I can imagine being perfectly livid, not to mention half-blind, by the time I call it quits tonight.  The timing couldn't be worse, I just spent my last few hundred 'spare' dollars on the printing that arrived today! This is one of those vicious circle deals, to fix it I need to be able to work and I can't work properly until it's fixed!!  Maybe I'll just go watch that movie I rented last week.

      I  urlLink made a stranger smile  and my printing arrived, although the brochures will have to be redone because I'm not happy with them.  There's still time to accomplish a ton on the current client project, so I may still squeeze a third one of those goals out of today before it's over with.  I did get a huge happiness bonus in the form of an invitation to open a  urlLink Gmail  account! I'm a lucky, lucky girl. Those things aren't easy to come by and I wanted one  so  badly.  Huge  thanks to my 'Gmail Fairy'.  On a serious note, George is in hospital. My poor sister is at her wits end because last year, after a couple of misdiagnoses, they discovered that he had meningitis. I'm going to withold worrying myself into a frenzy because I'm sure he's going to be just fine, but they're 'keeping him in for observation'.

      Here's Friday! The slice of the week when it takes something pretty bloody awful to ruin your day.  Here's what I'm hoping for today and I'll compare notes with myself when it's over:    The missing parts of my barbecue to arrive   My new business cards and brochures to arrive   The overdue cheque from my client to arrive   To make home-stretch progress on my current client project   To do one thing that makes a stranger smile     What do you think the chances are of clearing that list. It'd be a hell of a good day if it happens.  Happy Friday everyone!

      It's thought that wolves have the most efficient sleep habits because they don't crash for hours like most animals, they nap frequently. Makes sense to me and I've always wished I was one of those people who can just sit in a chair and nap.  I put in a hell of a day workwise, plus my laundry basket is literally empty (and I mean  empty !) and my kitchen is spotless, even after cooking dinner. So I decided I deserved to sit in front of the TV for a few minutes after clearing away the dinner plates and turning on the dishwasher (love that thing!).  I sank into our fabulous old oversized leather recliner, pulled the lever, leaned back and that was it, I did it. I napped for just over half an hour and I feel more invigorated than I did when I woke up this morning after five-and-a-half comatose hours. I could almost put in another day like today, right now.  Almost .

      Just got a phonecall from my sister back home. She wanted to let me hear the sounds my newest nephew, Ted, was making. Ted (usually short for Edward but he's  actually  named Ted) is the three month old brother of George, who's about eighteen months.   I have yet to see even a picture of Ted (much to my disappointment and not for a lack of asking), but I met George in August when I went home for my sister's long-awaited marriage to her childhood sweetheart and partner for fifteen years, Barry. I've never been a 'baby person' for as long as I can remember. George changed that the moment I set eyes on him. It was strange to see my sister in the role of a mother but it seems to come to her effortlessly. Of course, I don't have the luxury of daily insight being six thousand miles away but all the news that comes from that side of the pond suggests that it's true.  I miss her.

      The weather sure isn't making it easy for me to resume my new (but on hold) lifestyle.   I won't be going running today. It's raining, I don't want to run in the rain.   In preparation for getting some long overdue work done, I absolutely promised myself yesterday that the only time I would step outside the house today, would be to go for a run. When you work from home, a day with no groceries needed, no errands to run and no promises to keep is a day with the potential for being highly productive and fruitful.  So here we go. . .

      Today I had an appointment downtown, which is a one hour bus-ride away from my house. I'd forgotten all about it until about 9 o'clock (an hour before I'd have to leave to walk to the bus stop) and even though I really didn't want to go, I was relieved that I'd remembered because it was one of those things you just want to get over with and then forget about.  Being directionally challenged and unable to find my way out of an elevator on a  good  day, the prospect of getting off a bus in an area of town that I have no knowledge of and then find an office building I've never been to was terrifying. Hubby's last-minute offer of a ride was made with such reluctance that I declined, preferring fear of the unknown to the thought of dealing with his disrespectful and insensitive demeanour when he's 'put out'. The fact that I had to go to this damned place was a nasty result of something  he  did, and not only am I the one left holding the bag but I'm holding it out in the cold!  I got home just after 4pm and tried waiting a while before making a much needed pot of coffee to see if  someone else  would do it, even if only out of guilt. That yielded pretty much the expected results but it was a fascinating experiment nonetheless... at least, that's what I'm going to tell myself to keep from throwing my desk through the window.  This day can go to hell.

      I  didn't have time   couldn't  chose not to go to the gym in favour of something that, considering it was raining, seemed far more enticing. I went to the tanning salon instead and enjoyed that bone-deep warm feeling for a full seven minutes. That may not sound like much but it was enough of a boost to make the rather grey weather seem not so miserable.  After arriving home I went through the usual ritual of starting up a fresh pot of java and then hubby and I went outside for a smoke. In an effort to escape the rain being blown directly into the only sheltered area in our back yard, we went around the side of the house. Evidence that we don't venture around there too often? A hornets nest the size of a softball on steroids. Yep, and hubby was standing right underneath it. Being 6ft 3in tall he was literally 4 inches away from having the nasty little beasts sitting right on his head. I'm going to try and get a picture of the house-on-our-house later when we venture out with the giant can of  urlLink Bug-B-Gone  we just picked up at the hardware store.

      When you bite your tongue, why is it that you seem to bite down and release with a speed and force far greater than that with which you were originally chewing, if in fact you were even chewing anything in the first place? It's as if your jaws know at that millionth of a second that your poor tongue is positioned perfectly and they think "I know it's there and I'm gonna  bite it !". There's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Forget slow motion, which is how most bad things seem to happen, this happens double-time, triple even.  Wait a sec, I think I actually drew blood. . .

      It's pretty disgusting when you have to blow dust and husky fur off your trainers to go for a run.  The cloud that floated off them made me realise that it's been about six weeks since I went to the gym and about four since my last run. That's not to say, of course, that I haven't vacuumed my floors in that amount of time, just that I dont tend to vacuum my trainers when I do. The point is... I've been a deliberate slob for long enough. There, I admit it. I thought about working out, I thought about going running, I simply chose not to because 'why should I? I'm recovering from a devastating experience'. I only joined the gym three months ago because I knew I was going to need mental and physical strength for what I was sure I was about to go through (big 'D' for those of you who are curious) and since that's probably not going to happen now, what the hell, right?   Wrong! The difference that every-other-day run and two hours three times a week at the gym made was nothing short of miraculous. I won't wax lyrical about the clearer mind, the more peaceful sleep or even the killer abs, I'll just say that now I've let it all go to hell I'm so bloody angry with myself, it's not even funny. So I blew the dust and fur off those trainers and almost died running a full 2K. It was midday too and I'm convinced that the later you leave it in the day, the less oxygen there is in the air because the sun burns it off, or something. Hubby laughs at me for thinking that, but either way my throat was ready to implode afterwards and I hope to goodness that Wednesday's attempt will be closer to where I left off - which incidentally was an almost-effortless almost-4K!!  Tomorrow's return to the gym will be interesting. I suppose I'll be back to square one there too, but that's the price you pay for making excuses!

      My neighbour just rang my doorbell and when I answered, he beckoned me excitedly to 'come and see'. I followed him round to the side of my house where his wife was standing triumphantly over a huge pile of weeds!  Now, I have to be careful here to  not  paint these people as interferring busy-bodies. They are without a doubt, two of the most friendly, interesting, fun and generous-spirited people I have ever met, if not  the  most.   They're barbecuing ribs this afternoon and while I was standing there, still mildly embarassed at the amount of crap they'd pulled from between the few plants that exist in my front garden, they broke into a tiff over which kind of marinade they'd use this time. This led to the observation that soon I'd be able to swap marinade recipes with them (like anything I'd come up with would ever be as good as their masterpieces) followed by more apologies about the missing barbecue parts. I'm amazed at how patient  I'm  managing to be over not being able to use my new barbecue yet, but I hope the bloody things arrive soon or  they'll  end up in therapy over it!  Here comes another attempt to accomplish something that will pay the bills...

      I'm starting to wonder if this was such a good idea.  In the last three days I have spent exactly 100% of the time I would usually spend working, jumping from one blog to another and at one point, becoming a little obsessive about that whole  urlLink Andy Kaufman  thing that exploded in a small way last week.  I'm not sure why, I've been keeping a blog for more than four years at another domain and  it  never had this effect. Possibly the fact that the other one was (and still is) a coding playground (it's a custom job, by me) and I never really considered throwing myself into the blogging culture has a lot to do with it, but I gotta tell ya... I'm getting all hooked and it's like a tub of  urlLink strawberry cheesecake icecream  on the table that you know you shouldn't eat... because I have to get some work done!

      I think I might just have the coolest neighbours on the planet. Mr. Nextdoor has just delivered a fresh plate of seafood potstickers and hot dipping sauce.  I cringed when he saw the box containing the as-yet-unassembled barbecue because his face fell with disappointment, but I assured him the parts would arrive this week (please!) and begged him not to worry about it any more.  So, the potstickers. Little parcels of delicious joy, cautiously waved over the dipping sauce. These folks need to write a book, open a restaurant,  something ! They are genius personified in the kitchen and I thank my lucky stars every time they send over a sample of whatever marvelous creation they've produced that day (which is almost every day!), that my house is next to theirs. If I had a tenth of their talent I think I'd weigh 500lb.

      Wow. I just re-read my last entry. In case you're curious, (and I guess if you're reading this, you might well be) everything's fine. So we'll call that last entry 'therapy' and move right along.  I went back to sleep and here it is, the middle of Saturday! It's stopped raining but the wind has pushed a section of my fence to the brink of falling down completely. That's going to have to be fixed  today  or I'll have two escaped huskies on my hands... or out of them, which ever way you look at it. So I guess a trip to the hardware store is on the cards.

      It's 6:30 on Saturday morning. It's raining for the first time in two weeks.  I went to bed no more than three-and-a-half hours ago, so tired I thought might never wake up and yet here I am, wide awake...   I've been through a small version of hell recently with a very traumatic personal problem relating to my spouse. It all started very quietly three years ago and had gradually escalated into a full-blown  situation  of almost devastating proportions. It came to an abrupt and explosive end on April 17th this year, accompanied by a promise that it would never happen again. That promise has been repeated twice since, but take it from me, those kinds of things are extremely difficult to recover from.   I still find myself looking for 'clues'. A habit that having been bored into the daily routine of my life since the Spring of 2001, is not easy to break. I'm suspicious of every answer to certain types of questions, even when my mind was a million miles away from everything that happened during the asking, as soon as he opens his mouth and answers I feel like I just hit a brick wall and start probing his offered response for some indication of anything that might be 'not quite right' and possibly needs more investigation.  You've probably guessed, one such occurrence just reared it's ugly head.   I never get a look at 6:30am on a Saturday, ever. It's normal for us to both sleep in until 10 or 10:30, but today life had a different plan for us. He has a serious back problem and sometimes the pain wakes him up and he finds it more comfortable to go downstairs and sleep on the couch. When I realised he wasn't there this morning I thought nothing of it until I came out of our ensuite bathroom and looked out the window, only to hear him open the door behind me and come in the room. When I turned around he was smiling brightly and waving at me energetically, our usual goofy greeting for each other. That's the first of three things this morning that jumped up and down and rang every alarm bell it could find. He never,  ever  comes back upstairs after he's gone down in the morning and he tends to play up on how tired he is when he didn't sleep well. This happy, wide-awakeness is the last thing I would have expected to see under these circumstances. The weird thing is that the alarm bells didn't actually start ringing then, they started after clue number two, which was this... concerned as usual about his wellbeing, I asked him what happened. True to form for someone who's hiding something and a complete diversion from what he would have usually done, which would be tell me how much his back hurts and wait for sympathy, he answered my question with an irrelevant and peculiar question of his own. "Did you think I was still there?". That was the brick wall, right there. Up until that second I had actually been quite excited about being so awake so early on a Saturday but now my mood had changed so fast it made my head spin. I told him "No, I can see you're not there, what happened?". Again, expecting that answer about his back, I was floored when he actually ignored the question completely and started talking to the huskies. Only after about a minute he finally said "I couldn't sleep", but it was too late.   So I went outside for a smoke (we both smoke, but never in the house - even when it's raining!) and I've been pondering the possibilities. One, he got up to check the text messages on his phone, two, worse, he made an early phonecall to catch  her  before she started work, three he was trolling through Internet porn (I have zero tollerance, but he chose to ask me out on a second date six years ago) and four, he got up, played with his  urlLink online racehorses , heard me get up and felt the way I did originally when I got up... pleased to be awake so early and even happier now that it was both of us.  He's gone back to bed. He went maybe 20 minutes ago and while I've been typing this I've been wondering whether I'll just trust that everything's ok and do the same, or look for something that will put my mind at rest. It'll probably be the latter. I think I have a right to prove to myself that he wasn't up to no good, so that I don't spend the rest of the weekend looking at him sideways.   Rome wasn't built in a day and you don't get over a cheating spouse in a month.

      I've been waiting for a couple of parts that were missing from the barbecue my neighbours (who are also my client) recently bought for me to say 'thanks' for some gratis work I did for them. The store it came from is a hell of a long way away from my house and since I don't drive, my only option was to call the 1-800 number on the manual and have the missing pieces couriered to me. I was hoping they'd arrive in time for the weekend so I could practise reducing perfectly good food to cinders, but no dice. Oh well, I think it'll rain this weekend anyway, so at least I have a good excuse to *not* stand outside to do my cooking.  So here comes Friday night and as usual there's nothing worth watching on TV. After the two nightly episodes of  urlLink 'The King of Queens'  finish at 7pm the viewing choices are pretty much abysmal, so I'll be watching a video I rented a couple of nights ago called  urlLink 'Mambo Italiano' . Looks pretty funny and it fits with the mild obsession I've developed recently with all things Italian. Don't ask, but if I keep up this blogging lark it'll probably become blatantly obvious, unless it wears off fairly quickly.

      Welcome to my new 'Blogger' blog. Without much ado I'll jump right in and get to the daily guff. . .  After waiting patiently for 40 days for the lemon zest to work it's magic, I finally mixed my infused vodka with sugar syrup to make my first batch of Limoncello.  I say 'first' because there's definitely a plan to make more. One taste last Summer and I've been haunted ever since.  I have a feeling that the small amount of raw cane sugar I had to replace one cup of white sugar with (because I don't keep much of the white stuff around) might force me to call this batch a 'special' because the syrup was a definite brownish colour, which completely removed the gorgeous vivid yellow of the vodka.  I filled three sterilised Sobe bottles with just a drop left over for tasting. . . and I mean a  drop . I literally had to hold my head back for about 20 seconds to drain it from the jug I'd been using but man! Was it ever worth it! Especially considering that now I have to (try to) wait another forty days to let the lemon get to work on the syrup.  Odds on making it to forty days with no 'mishaps'? I'd say save your money, but I've been known to exercise supreme self-discipline when the need arises.   The countdown begins. . .

      To keep everything current around here, a very quick rundown on some loose ends...  My client returned! He's fine... had just been away for an extended treatment and forgot to tell me.  I fired up the BBQ tonight for the first time and congratulate me, because there was no fire, no injuries and perfectly delicious food at the end of it.  I bought a cheap-and-nasty coffee maker today because I couldn't stand instant any longer and I can't go without until Friday (or longer!)... the instant coffee is actually preferable to what blubs out of the cheap-and-nasty job.   I think that's it...

      My coffee machine is in coffee-machine-hospital. I know, I know... but it's a good one and it had a three year warranty and I'm not about to chuck away $120. The coffee-machine-surgeon says it'll be Friday before a diagnosis is available and that if I need a replacement, it'll take two weeks!  That means, on the days I don't go out and therefore pass a coffee shop, I'll be running on fake brew... not so good (no offense,  urlLink Nescaf&eacute; ).  I'm extremely worried about one of my clients. Throughout his project (just over two weeks so far) I've spoken to him on a daily basis (except Sundays) and he didn't call this morning. Neither did he return my call just after lunch when I left a voicemail message for him. Why is this so worrying? Because he's very sick... he has a form of incurable but treatable blood cancer that he has to have dialysis for every week and he's also just finished three chemo sessions. We decided on Saturday that the Site I've built for him was probably  it  and that he'd sleep on it one more night.  I bought a kiddie-pool for Lani today. She'd already given me my money's worth within five minutes of hauling it through the door this afternoon. I wish I knew what it was about that garden hose but I guess all canines do it, it's just that she's so damned cute doing it! Seeing her attack the 'jet' setting while she's up to her knees in a paddling pool, jumping and bouncing around is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. The whole experience is amplified because at sisteen months old she's about a third the size she should be. A mini-husky, she stopped growing at seven months.  I checked one thing off my list of things I wanted to do this week, I painted the nails on my right hand. Also, I've reinitiated contact with an old prospect, so hopefully by the end of tomorrow I'll have one of the two new assignments I'm shooting for and I attempted via telephone to discuss compensation for the jeans but 'the manager's not back until Wednesday'...

      Now that I'm a lazy, unemployed bitch again, I've decided I'm going to catch up on some fun stuff...  I cannot  wait  to see  urlLink this movie . Personally, I thought the first one  rocked  and if the reviews are anything to go by, this one blows it out the window.  I  will  go to the tanning salon this week, despite the fact that the Canadian summer is pretty much here and tanning  inside  is a little unnecessary.  I will find  at least  two new assignments. Yes, that's fun... to me anyway. Rubbing them in a certain faithless someone's face will be enjoyable too.  I will demand to be compensated for the new jeans that were ruined by a flying bottle of top-coat at the beauty salon last week. After a sincerely valiant but unsuccessful attempt to save them I've decided that losing exactly half of my wearable bottom-halfs isn't acceptable. The fact that I bought them with money I was given as a gift makes it more important to replace them. Fun? Yes, when I go shopping for the replacement jeans.  I will paint the nails on my right hand. Nine times out of ten I paint the left hand and then start to panic when I think of all the stuff I  should  be doing instead. This week I'll finish the job... housework, cooking and web sites be damned.

      Not only have I finished two clients' Web Sites in the last month, I finished my own company's this evening.  I feel so tired I could just die and at the same time a huge sense of accomplishment... hubby's comments; "so what have you got to work on now?". When you know him like I do, that means; "so you've got no work left then?".  Yesterday I was battling with guilt pangs because of my master plan to go home, now... not so much, because here comes bully-boy again to keep me down by making me feel like a good-for-nothing burden.  Oh, the lottery ticket? $10.00... ten dollars. That'll buy my coffee at the airport.

      It's true...  I've become sooo boring! It occurs to me that the reason I have nothing to write about except work and buying groceries is that that's all I ever do!  I'm about to do it again for goodness sake!  Finished another assignment today and finally saw the finish line on my own company's Web Site. All in all it was a damned good day work-wise. I can't say I'm ever thrilled about speaking to clients on the weekend but the one I'm finishing up for now is truly delightful and he's so excited about his site that it's no effort and no trouble to talk to him.  It's crunch time again now though, I need another assignment to come in pretty quickly. Especially since one that I finished a couple of weeks back has turned out to be a gratis job and the three months of income it represented just flew out the window... or rather, it never even flew the window!  I've decided it's time now to take the last step towards taking my own business as seriously as I want everyone else to and put an end to freebies and deals, no exceptions.  Lani seems to have a bit of an infection in her fluffy little ear. I tricked her into letting me put some antibiotic ointment on it and I just hope to god that the fur grows back!  I'm going to buy her one of those hard plastic paddling pools because she just loves to try and dive head-first into her water bowl when you fire water into it with the garden hose. I can't help thinking a kiddie pool with floating balls and assorted other toys would provide hours of belly-laughs. God knows I could use a few of those.

      I bought a lottery ticket today and promised myself that if it was a winner, I'd pack my huskies and whatever belongings I want to keep 'just because' and haul the whole lot home to England.  I was convinced that because George's birthday was on one of the lines, it was a winner and I was on my way home.  Guess what... ?

      Today is a very, very bad day.  England were knocked out of Euro 2004 by Portugal today, in a game that went from a 1-1 full-time score, to 2-2 after overtime and ending up in a penalty shoot-out. It was bad news from the moment when our captain, David Beckham hoofed the first penalty shot six feet over the centre of the goal. After staying even for several kicks we missed one more and gave them a chance to claim the semi-final spot... in a move that seemed to be a slap in the chops for our boys, Portugal let  their goalie  stand in front of David James with a smug look on his face and take the shot that would end the game. Heartbreaking.  I'm still getting the new tattoo... out of pride!  I have nothing else to say.

      So it seems that as time goes on I'm getting worse at updating this thing. I used to find that sentence very annoying on other people's blogs, but now I get it.  So what's happened lately?   Remember the parts for the barbecue that were MIA and arrived just over a week ago? Out of the two parts that were missing, exactly  one  was in the box I'd waited so long for. It's starting to look like it'll be winter before I can start burning stuff outside.  I'm even more homesick than I was last time I posted. George apparently now asks Cheryl to phone me, just so he can blow me kisses and let me hear him driving his toy car around the living room. I'm an inch away from going back.  England trounced Croatia today with a blistering 4-2 victory in Euro 2004, sending them firmly into the quarter-finals and I'm thinking of having the George cross tattooed on the small of my back to celebrate.  I've been horrendously busy with work but both of the assignments I've been working on are about to come to a close at the same time... not a good situation from a cashflow point of view but luckily I have a couple or three good leads to follow up on.  I've heard nothing from the friend I had to give up. I'm hoping that's a good sign that things are working out on the home front. If you read this, know that I wish the best for you... and I miss you.  So I guess that's it in a nutshell, more frequent updates are planned... blah blah blah

       'Taurus April 19 - May 19   You may have some trouble communicating today, dear Taurus. It's as though something is distorting your perception of things.  Don't be surprised if, once evening comes, you feel like forgetting about everything and traveling to the other end of the world.  Tomorrow you'll see clearly again, but without a doubt there are adventures in store for you!'  You're not kidding.  In other news...  While I was browsing the rows of nail polish at the salon today a helpful assistant came over (as they do) to tell me (for the seven-hundredth time) about the fast drying top coat in the line that I buy. I explained that I already have some and then she dropped the one she'd picked up to show me.   My shoes, jeans and leather briefcase were all covered in the stuff. Remember I said 'fast drying'? Yeah...  I bought raspberries to make pavlova again.

      My head's spinning from the effect of the amount of work I have right now. I'm grateful, but it hasn't taken long for me to wish I could just find the time to take one day off. I mean seriously, don't forget I work all friggin' weekend too!  I lost a friend today. I think he's lost anyway, there's some trouble that's been hanging around his home for a long time and parties whose decisions must be respected have called an end to a three year friendship that was the closest I've ever come to a real one. I'm pretty fucking angry about one thing... my moral standards were called into question for a brief moment, it wasn't an accusation by a long shot, more a 'what if?', but that's enough to make me so angry that I could do  damage . Two reasons, first, the 'questioner' doesn't know me, if they did they'd know better. Second, the 'questioner' can kiss my fucking ass because they  are  guilty of what they alluded to me possibly doing if the circumstances were right.  Shortly after the conversation, my friend sent me a short email. All it said was 'What's up?' and I didn't reply. I promised the 'questioner' that I wouldn't have any further contact and since I've just been through the same sick fear myself I'd be a hypocrite to not respect their wishes. But now, my friend probably feels abandoned and angry and I can't do anything about it and that makes me feel like shit.  I need a sign.

      It's officially Monday already, I can hardly believe it...  I hate it when you start to realise all the things you were so sure you'd do at the weekend and that are still not done. For example, my barbecue is still in pieces in it's box, half of my bathroom door is still missing, there's still ice-cream in the freezer compartment and the weeds have laid claim to more than half of my back garden.  On a positive note, I made meringues. Yes, I piled them high with chopped strawberries and loaded them up with whipped cream and I just realised I should have taken a picture, because they truly were spectacular.  Got tons of work done today and still managed to find the time to brush both huskies and do my nails.

      It's never been this bad... ever.  I was supposed to meet Cheryl online again last night (this morning at about 2am) but she sent me a TXT saying she couldn't make it over to Mum's.  As I type, England has just lost 2-1 to France in a game that, until the three minutes of stoppage time at the end, we were winning 1-0 since the middle of the first half. Sickening.

      I missed another one...  I've come to the conclusion that the reason I've been skipping days is that I've been posting later and later during the day, therefore confusing myself as to whether the entry I just made was today's, or yesterday's.  My sister went to my parents' home yesterday morning to use their computer. Cheryl wanted me to see George and Ted, so she hauled the whole family, Barry included, to the house to sit in front of Mum's web cam and surprise the hell out of me. After talking to her and seeing the children, I spent the rest of the day homesick and must have had a subconcious desire to feel even worse, because I sat and watched President Reagan's funeral service. After Nancy took the Stars and Stripes and had to say her last goodbye... what can you say? Rest in peace, Mr. President.  As far as I can remember the only other thing worth mentioning from yesterday is that I finally picked up a new graphics card.  This morning I woke up at five-thirty and took the opportunity to make an early start on the huge pile of stuff I have to get through this weekend.  A high priority will be putting the barbecue together and I've had a craving for pavlova for three days, so I'll wear my 'Molly housewife' hat at some point to make that and I'll probably bake some cookies while I'm at it.  Can't forget to repair the bathroom door too!

      I hope the fact that this week I've missed my goal of at least daily posts isn't a taste of things to come. Yesterday would have been a good one too, so here goes with a catch-up...  The missing parts for the barbecue arrived! I have yet to find time to finish putting it together and I am still lacking a propane tank with which to fuel the beast. At this point it looks like it'll be the weekend before I have an opportunity to tell you if the first grilling session caused a three alarm fire.  My neighbours went fishing for the day and after their return and spending a few hours up to their knees in fish cuts and crab shells, they delivered two huge halibut fillets. I still can't decide how to prepare them while giving respect to the fact that they were swimming freely a very short while before I met them.  I finally picked up the new Web Cam and await an opportunity to test it. My good friend in the US of A had agreed to meet me online to do that last night but I got sidetracked by the fish delivery after dinner and then an invitation from hubby to watch the video I rented two weeks ago, which was still sitting untouched on the coffee table. The movie was good, but I feel like shit for letting  urlLink Matt  down.  The youngest of my two huskies got trapped in the bathroom just after midnight. I didn't know until went out to the kitchen to fill my coffee and heard the noise coming from upstairs. The poor little thing had clearly been frantic trying to escape, because she'd obviously been in and out of the toilet bowl at least once, scaled the wall on two sides of the room, tried on my white bathrobe, emptied the waste basket (looking for a key?) and made a valiant attempt to eat the door off.  Now to today...  One of my new clients, who I was 'introduced to' via email just last Friday, is what I call a 'rescue job'. Their limited understanding of everything involving their Web Site caused them to fall prey to two separate  shafters  and the result was a very ugly Web Site and a Domain Name that has never been attached to that Site since it was registered six months ago. To make matters worse, the buffoon who registered it phoned me today and accused  me  of making a mistake on the original registration!  I've got a long night ahead of me now. Having spent 60% of my day sending email and having phone conversations to clean up the disgraceful mess left behind by incompetent parties, there's a ton of source and graphics screaming to be created for two other open assignments.  I just hope the coffee pot can keep up.

      My office window looks out directly over our front yard towards the street. Today I watched as the potential new owner of the Jeep we drove to Vegas in to get married almost three years ago, drove it away. . . probably for good.  There aren't many things left here that don't remind me of something bad. Even my kitchen sink has an 'attachment'.  After a massively productive day today, I have an equally-masssively busy one to look forward to tomorrow. I can hardly believe I've gone from having not even a scrap of work, to having a full schedule in a period of no more than a week.  It'd be nice to squeeze in a quick tan to burn off some of the frazzled nerve-endings I've developed over the last couple of weeks but I'll have to play that by ear.  I miss my Mum already, she's only been gone two days and I probably wouldn't have spoken to her if she wasn't on holiday this week, but still. Knowing she's not 'across the screen' feels empty. Even emptier than the every-day kind of empty I'm used to.

      I was awake at 8:30 this morning. Before 9am I had had my morning smoke, checked my email and started the morning brew.  Hubby's still fast asleep upstairs. He woke up in the middle of the night and came downstairs to watch TV and eat a bowl of cereal. If his back's not playing up that means he's stressed out about something. I'm not sure exactly what he can possibly have to be stressed out about. Aparently he's 'made enough money in the last four years to not have to work for the next four' and all he does with his spare time (which is ALL of it) is play games, watch TV and read the paper.  Since we're apparently only married on paper, I'm not going to worry about it any more.  I have a good feeling about today, my workload is manageable and the sun's shining.   Coffee's ready! . . .

      I had one of those headaches today, that are so bad they make your head spin and your eyes water. I'd arrived at my desk just after 9am and had been there no more than 10 minutes when I decided my only option was to throw down a couple of Ibuprofen and go back to bed.  The next thing I knew it was ten-to-two in the afternoon. I hate that!  There was a pleasant surprise waiting on my desk, my reprinted brochures. They look even better than the original ones and they're spot on when I fold them. I just have to hope now, that they give me some love and bring at least one new assignment my way.  I spent a couple of hours on 'damage control' (losing four work hours requires an immediate remedy) in the form of a few calls to clients and a couple of emails and then realised that I had to go grocery shopping. The headache started to creep back so I fired up the java-machine and grabbed a quick shower while it was working it's magic. After I'd washed down another two tablets with a large mug of coffee, I made a quick scan of the fridge and headed out on foot to the grocery store.  I spent most of the journey wondering how any decent man can watch his wife rushing around like a chicken with it's head cut off after spending the morning sick in bed and not at least offer to drive her to the store and back when they need groceries. I guess that's what I get for marrying someone who has no concept of the term part-ner-ship. When I left the house he was sitting at his computer playing with his beloved online, imaginary horses. . . I'd trade lives with him any day of the week, even only for an hour.  Before I crossed the street to the store, I saw a man that's well known in our town. Don, that's his name, is homeless and has a friendly but sad-looking old white dog. He's the nicest homeless person I've ever met. You might wonder how many homeless people I've 'met', my answer is 'quite a few'. Don, is one that I believe made a choice at some point in his life, that aside, I see him as a neighbour. Usually, when you see Don and greet him, your 'How are you today, Don?' is answered with a refreshingly cheery 'Oh! couldn't be better, sunshine!'. I didn't get that response today. The response I got was 'I'm hungry'. It wasn't a guilt trip, I know Don better than that (I think). I believe he's an educated man and at the very least came from something far 'better' than one might assume.   While I was in the store buying my fresh chicken and locally grown hot-house tomatoes and cigarettes (that I always seem to be able to find money for), I decided to use the few dollars that I would have spent on a taxi to get home for something else. I picked up a package of chewy dog treats, a fresh, deli burrito, a bowl of fresh fruit salad and a chilled Iced Tea and walked back across the street to where Don was still sitting with his dog, Mr. Nick. He smiled his usual smiley greeting when he saw me walking towards him but he positively beamed when he took the packages from me. People know when you feel sorry for them and it embarrasses them, that's why they don't usually look directly at you. I don't feel sorry for Don and I think he knows that.  There's just something so beautiful about the look in a person's eye when you do something kind for them just because you want to. Try it.  When I got home, hubby was watching  urlLink Calgary  lose the  urlLink Stanley Cup . I made a big noise of starting a fresh pot of coffee with one hand and dinner with the other. . . I know, I know, men don't notice things like that, you're supposed to TELL them when you're pissed off. Trust me, in my house that doesn't work either. If I'm unhappy about something, he doesn't know why we're even together and our marriage is over (mental abuse, emotional abuse, passive aggressive, call it what you want). For the time being I'm just taking it day-by-day until light dawns on dim-witted skull (mine, not his) and shows the way. As long as 'the way' involves a fenced yard for the huskies I'll be ok.

      I just realised that I missed Saturday. . .  I considered fudging the date on a new post and making something up but that's just not honest. Apparently, being honest makes me a loser and hasn't done much for me except make me easier to shit on, but still, standards are standards.  Just thought I'd publicly recognise my omission.

      There was a voicemail waiting for me this morning from England, Cheryl had apparently called in the wee hours to let me hear something I've only heard stories about. My nephew, George, has a framed photograph of me beside his bed. Every day, Cheryl and Barry point to it and ask him who is in the picture because they say they never want him to forget me. Cheryl called last night because he was in the middle of his daily sing-song about the lady in the picture. That was the first time I'd ever heard him say my name. I think it broke my heart.  I am still Web-cam-less, despite making a concrete plan to remedy that situation today. I couldn't get the computer store on the phone to check they had them in stock so I assumed the owner had decided to take the day off. This is a small town, things like that happen here with no warning. No biggie, Mum's away for a week anyway and there's noone else that needs to see my mug plastered all over their monitor.  The fence is fixed! It's a mediochre job at best, not to mention a bloody eye-sore, but the huskies are safe now and I have some peace of mind the next time the wind picks up.  I pounded burger sized bruises into both of my palms this afternoon while I was working on my garden. Our lawn is neighboured by sloping planting beds on two sides and bordered by railway ties all the way around. Both the soil on the slopes and the bark mulch we covered it with when we built the place has gradually been washed down and had partially buried the ties and started to creep over them onto the grass. When you factor in the husky craters all over the lawn (they can dig like nothing I've ever seen), the whole thing just looked like a big mess. So I worked my way around the edges with a hand-trowel, re-exposing the ties and putting the soil back on it's own side, away from the lawn. There was a mountain of extra soil when I'd finished so I used that to fill the biggest holes in the lawn, the plan is to throw some grass-seed on the patches and cross my fingers.  ' urlLink Don't Say A Word ' is on TV tonight. I really wish I had some Strawberry Cheesecake ice-cream but I guess I can make do with  urlLink vanilla . . . especially if I bury it in chopped almonds and  urlLink Nutella .

      I phoned Cheryl just after midnight last night (around 8am back home) to wish her a happy birthday and was treated to a bonus, one-sided conversation with George and then Ted. That was all I needed to give me the courage to open the package that arrived from home yesterday, containing two photo CDs. Damn, they grow fast.  I stayed up all night working and didn't stop until about 6pm this evening. There's nothing like a bit of resentment mixed with a splash of anger and a few pots of coffee to keep the Sandman away.  Had a quick chat with my Mum on Messenger in the wee hours, she's finally got her Web cam hooked up again and now that she's taken my advice and ditched AOL it actually works. Now of course she's on to me to replace the one I broke months ago, when I do, it'll probably be with  urlLink this one . I thought about the funky new lollipop-looking thing but there are mixed reviews about the mechanical parts on it and the last thing I need is something else to piss me off.   It was good to see Mum sitting there, cradling one of her two little dogs. I think what she has are called Papillons, they're like Chihauhas only they have long hair. They're cute little things, brothers that she got from a rescue place and renamed Fudge and Treacle. My parents are going on holiday with my Aunt and Uncle (my Mum's sister and her husband) to a  urlLink villa in Spain  starting on June 7th, so I won't talk to them for a week now. That's pretty rough.  Half way through the day I was forced to snap out of my half-dead stupor to engage in a battle of wits with my printer. They tried to convince me that the fact that they didn't check to make sure the front and back of my brochure lined up before they printed the order was my fault and that I had to cover the cost of reprinting. Sorry guys, you need to get up pretty early in the morning to push stuff like that past me. New brochures are on the way. . . no charge.  Apparently we're finally fixing the fence tomorrow. It's only  urlLink been two weeks  since the damned thing almost blew over and released the hounds. Since we'll be right next door to my  urlLink computer dealer , I might just swing by and pick up that new Web cam, courtesy the remainder of Mum & Dad's birthday present. My desk is going to start looking like a Logitech showroom.  I have no idea why, but I just remembered the time that I set a USB hub on fire by plugging the wrong power adapter into it. . .

      It's my sister's birthday in two days, I haven't mailed her cards yet, she lives in England with the rest of my family.  I have to present a layout proposal to new client number 1 by the end of today. I was supposed to have spent yesterday preparing it but I couldn't because my father-in-law was here.  By the end of today, I have to fax a contract to new client number 2, along with a printable template to act as a guide when he's supplying content for his Web Site. I would have accomplished this easily if I wasn't going to have to spend all of today drafting the layout for new client number 1.  My brochures are still at the printers. These brochures have been customised for use  only  at a trade show being attended by a previous client, who insisted using some of their space for exhibiting a demonstration of their Web Site and my services. The show is taking place any day now (note to self: I should check on  which  day).  My fridge is empty.  I have to fit 2K run into my schedule today.   Last night I broke the source for the project I'm working on and now I have to find the mistake and fix it before I can finish the bloody thing.

      I've seen a huge increase in the number of leads I've been getting for assignments recently. I've been cautiously excited about it for a couple of weeks and wondering if it's all just a big tease.   If it is, the tease continues today because I've just heard from a company for whom I have done some sub-contract work in the past because they're trimming down the number of places they outsource to, to one. . . me.  Finally! This might turn into a full-time job after all.

      I hate it when your accountant calls, having completed your tax return and he gives you bad news.  The news I got wouldn't be half as bad if I hadn't just been cut off from the household's joint finances. Not that I was ever involved before (nor that the finances have ever been joint!), just that the regular cheque I have been receiving from hubby every two weeks to pay 'my share' of the bills since January this year because I lost an administrative contract last November, ceased to be forthcoming with effective last week.  Now, on top of bouncing between fury and disbelief and wondering how I will put dinner on the table after what we have in the fridge runs out any day now, I have to worry about where I'm going to find what Revenue Canada wants from me. It's actually a paltry amount, but under the circumstances it might as well be a fortune.  The visit from father-in-law was good. He's always full of stories that he obviously took great care to practice (with embellishments) to pass the time on the ferry-ride from Tsawwaassen. It seems that in the last three months he's been mugged by a group of three youths in Stanley Park and almost arrested for punching his lawyer, who recently slapped him with a $15,000 bill for the priviledge of letting his live-in girlfriend of twelve years rip off half his life savings to pay her gambling debts. I swear, this man's life is a soap opera.  We went out for lunch and dinner, and spent most of the rest of the day exhibiting the behaviour of huskies under fire from a garden hose.  As much as the short notice ticks me off, I'm always a little sad to see Ken go home.  Now I have to go and find something invoiceable to do.

      I hate spontaneous guests arriving at my house. I guess being a semi-recluse makes you view even a visiting relative as something of an invasion and when you're given twelve hours notice at 9pm, there suddenly seem to be a million things to do in preparation. Of course the late night notice doesn't even consider the fact that the visitee has to sleep, in addition to preparing for the visitor's arrival.  So my father-in-law will be here in less than an hour. I am up to my eyes in keeping the proverbial wolf from the door and I'm also a little  off  today after hearing hubby talking on the phone in our bedroom. From what I could hear from outside while I was smoking my morning cigarette, he seemed to be shouting. So I asked him when he came down if in fact he had been shouting at someone on the phone just now, thinking that would prompt him to tell me who he was talking to in our bedroom, 40 seconds after waking up. Nothing, nada. Just a flat 'no' to the question.  I think now that the meeting he went to yesterday (which lasted a total of one hour after dropping me off at mine) was bogus too. He came back with no information about it whatsoever, the only news he had was from one of his friends at the gym (the gym where  she  goes) and the guy who installed our satellite system.  Damn, now I only have ten minutes before the  arrival .

      I don't want to talk about the 'meeting' I had today, but since I've apparently started I guess I'll carry on. First of all it had to be postponed, so I took the opportunity to specify a different venue than the one we originally planned and chose a Starbucks inside my favourite shopping mall (more about that later).   By 1:27pm I was sitting outside in the sun, hiding behind my Wayfarers and looking out for a person that resembled the brief description I was given. The whole scenario was reminding me of a blind date I went on many years ago, until my mother-in-law called to enquire about whether the standard of her son's behaviour had improved lately. That'll bring you back to Earth from anywhere.  The meeting was, quite frankly a waste of time with absolutely nothing accomplished by the end of it, except perhaps making someone feel like they had something significant to do that day (men seem to reach an age when 'having a meeting' makes them feel very, very important). The coffee and carrot cake were fantastic, but contrary to what I had been led to believe, there was no-one present (other than myself) who understood what they were there to do. "I'm bringing all the content materials with me and I have your deposit cheque", is what I was told yesterday on the phone. What was flopped out onto the table at Starbucks was a manilla folder containing a page-for-page printout of someone else's Web Site, which the person sitting opposite me proceeded to deface with a word here and there in red gel-roller. I couldn't help thinking that he was under the impression there is only one Web Site on the Internet and everyone just uses it as a template to build their own. He told me right off the bat that he'd never been through this process before (I have to credit him for his honesty) and it seemed to me that he'd made a genuine effort to prepare himself by reading up and only succeeded in getting himself thoroughly confused and overwhelmed. I've seen it before and it's even more difficult to work with than someone who knows nothing and isn't afraid to step back and let you take the lead.  I made a conscious but discreet effort to not cause embarrassment or discomfort to this poor individual, who seemed to realise early on that he had put himself in front of someone who spoke another language to accomplish something he had no real comprehension of on behalf of his 'client'. Worse yet, there was no deposit cheque. . . "I should be able to get it Monday". Hmmm. . . "should". I gently explained that I needed a signed agreement accompanied by a deposit before I went any further and (again, credit where it's due) he accepted that statement gracefully.  So back to the convenient location of this 'meeting'. I breezed around a few of my favourite stores, which happen to be situated in a semi-direct path between the main entrance to the mall and Starbucks. After having thought abut it for weeks, I finally picked up one of those  urlLink Italian charm bracelets  that seem to be everywhere you turn lately. I also bought my first charm, an obvious choice for an English girl who's far from home and it made me smile, which dulled the aching nerves I was suffering from, due to the impending 'meeting'.  Ain't that a pretty thing? Thanks go to my parents, Jill and Gordon all the way over there in sunny Watford, because this is (part of) the birthday present I was supposed to buy for myself in April from the two of them.  I was surprised that  urlLink Hallmark  doesn't sell RSVP cards. They seem to have a card for every other occasion, they even have some bizarre non-occasion ones. I received an invitation to my cousin's wife's fortieth birthday party, to be staged in 'Harry's Bar' at  urlLink Watford Football Club . That's what I call classy, being invited to a family bash even though you're 6,000 miles away. Ruth (a fine Scottish lass) deserves a classy reply but Hallmark didn't come up with the goods, so I improvised and bought some gorgeous blank notecards instead. While I was there I couldn't resist a tiny ladybug fridge magnet. . . actually, three tiny ladybug fridge magnets, but who's counting.

      Every Wednesday our local video store charges a buck per movie and hubby and I usually pick up a couple every week.  This week he picked them up, 'Guilty By Association', with Morgan Freeman and ' urlLink Love Actually ', with Hugh Grant.  The Morgan Freeman one didn't surprise me since we're both fans of his, but hubby had forgotten that we'd rented it before and didn't watch more than five minutes before we turned it off due to the fact that we literally couldn't understand a word anyone was saying. I  was  surprised that he'd also picked 'Love Actually' though, because he's definitely not one to go and pick out a romantic comedy because they fall into the category of 'chick flicks'. Aside from that, he's not really into  love .  I haven't been impressed by movies that preach the existence of 'true love' or how wonderfully romantic men can be for a long time. I wasn't looking forward to seeing this one either but tonight we gathered the obligatory junk food and sat down to watch it.  Now, I'm not saying it wasn't a great movie, it really was. The problem was that there were several stories running through it about different characters' experiences with love and one of those characters was a middle-aged married man exchanging flirtatious attention with an attractive younger woman at his office. As the story developed he started lying to his wife and bought a gold necklace as a Christmas gift for the harlot (I say that because she  knew  he was married). His wife found the necklace by accident and she was so excited on Christmas morning when he handed her a gift-wrapped box... and devastated when she opened it and discovered it contained a CD.  That was when I couldn't concentrate any more on any of the other stories. All I could think was, 'replace the office with a gym, make the occasion a birthday ( hers  and  mine  were one month and a day apart) instead of Christmas and switch the necklace for a sexy little belly-button ring and that's exactly what happened to me'.  Of course, I knew all along the gift my husband had bought was for her, he never shops a month in advance of any special occasions, but I told his mother I wasn't going to mention that I knew about his purchase until after my birthday, to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope against hope that I was wrong. Of course, it turned out he didn't deserve the benefit of the doubt.  Anyway, at the end of the movie all of the characters were separately attending the same Christmas concert at a local school. After it's finished and everyone's leaving the hall, betrayed wife says to cheating husband 'So, what would you do if you were in my shoes?', cheating husband snaps back an annoyed 'What!?'... 'cause that's how they talk to you when all they can think about is the woman they wish they were with instead of you...  'What would you do if you were in my shoes and your husband bought a gold necklace and gave it to someone else at Christmas and you were wondering 'well what is it? Is it just sex... or worse, is it love?' Would you leave? Or would you stay, knowing every day for the rest of your life would be a little bit worse?'   I think those words will ring around my head for months. I couldn't bite my lip any longer and burst into tears.   But I got a nice, comforting pat on the shoulder for my pain.

      Today has a strange feeling about it. I can't explain it and I don't even know if it's a good strange, or a bad strange... I just sense something a little 'off kilter'.  There's not much that could wrong considering my plans for the day include waiting for decisions from clients, grocery shopping and catching up on a bit of housework but I can't shake this bizarre uneasiness.  I'm looking at the garbage can sitting at the bottom of my driveway, waiting to be emptied at some point today and I'm wondering... 'damn, did I throw something in there that I shouldn't have?'.   Did I forget someone's birthday? No, I don't think so.  Of course, those are just the negative possibilities. I already said I can't distinguish whether it's a good or bad feeling... maybe the lottery ticket I bought on Monday for tonight's draw will win big so I can go home and start  living .  Yesterday I spent a good four hours out in my yard in the blistering heat, pulling the out-of-control weeds from the vast expanse of land that some genius decided two years ago when we were building the house was best handled by covering it with bark mulch. There's still two days work out there before it's finished. Another example of what happens when people don't listen to me. Anyway, while I was out there, my next-door neighbours came out to their deck to tell me about the plans they have for the Caribbean cruise they're taking their three kids on in September. The first thing they mentioned was scuba-diving in Belize and I think I zoned out right after that. The thought of being underwater in the Mecca of scuba-diving, listening to my regulator and floating weightless despite the enormous weight on my back... the light flickering and sparkling in hazy, dancing beams reaching down from the surface... I haven't been diving in seven years.   Reality came crashing back in when Lani started yapping at the bulldog on the other side of the fence that divides my yard from my neighbours' and I suddenly realised how incredibly hot, tired and uncomfortable I was.  I need a holiday... badly.

      Wow! An update is long overdue here!   Aside from the fact that Summer is in full swing now, not much has happened or changed since my last entry.   I'm starting to feel the presence of my third wedding anniversary looming in the not-so-distant future and despite the fact that I can't help wondering what the fourth year will bring, I feel uncharacteristically numb about the subject.   Lani's ear is proving to be a very stubborn problem. It's healing and not causing her any discomfort, but it seems to be taking forever!   My parents have gone to their  urlLink villa in Spain  this week. They're going again in September with my sister and her family and then again in October with my aunt and uncle.   Would you believe I still don't have my coffee machine back?? You'd think that when you spend over $100 on a coffee machine the procedure for replacing it when it dies just one third of the way through it's warrantied life would be much quicker and easier. Apparently not becasue we've been without it for a month now and it's costing a fortune at the local java house. I could have bought a Starbucks franchise by now!    Some thoughts:      I hate Jace and Scott.  Hate them!    Holly is the worst kind of bimbo, one that actually  has  half a brain, but doesn't use it   I hope Drew can pull himself together and stay strong   I hope Marvin isn't as weak as he appeared to be tonight

      It's been a long time since I could sit at my desk on a Monday morning and think; 'I had a great weekend!'.  &nbsp;  On Friday I took the day off. It's been a long time since I've done it and it was well deserved. I&nbsp;walked to&nbsp;the bus stop with the intention of doing nothing more than&nbsp;going to my favourite shopping mall&nbsp;to&nbsp;buy a replacement for the pair of jeans that were ruined by a flying bottle of nail polish a couple of weeks ago. On the way I was overcome by what a beautiful day it was and I felt happy... actually happy. So during the five minutes or so that I was waiting for the bus I called  urlLink the salon  that's in the mall and made an appointment to get my hair done.  &nbsp;  I love that salon. It's got downtown class and the stylists to match. I've only been there a couple of times before to actually use their services, once for a spa session and once for a manicure, but every time I've been in there to buy products (many times!)&nbsp;I've been impressed by the examples of their work sitting atop the exiting clientele.  &nbsp;  It was a good day to get a new 'do'... my neighbours had a BBQ on Saturday that hubby and I had been invited to a month ago, they have a huge one every year and this was&nbsp;their second one since they moved from their farm in Mission and we each built our houses next to each other. I reminded hubby a few days ago that it was this weekend and he did what I expected him to do, said he didn't want to go and that&nbsp;I should just go by myself.  &nbsp;  So I planned to look gorgeous for my first solo social event since getting married. I killed the half an hour I had before my appointment with a tall latt&eacute; and a slow stroll through a couple of stores and then went to the salon. The cut &amp; blow-dry I went in there for turned into colour, highlights and a cut (three inches!!)&nbsp;&amp; blow-dry and I felt like a million dollars when I walked out carrying the obligatory selection of styling products.  &nbsp;  After flying around maybe half of the mall in record time to secure my new jeans and make a compulsory stop at  urlLink La Senza &nbsp;it was time to catch the bus home.  &nbsp;  Back on home turf I stopped at the grocery store for the weekend provisions and then went home. Hubby didn't notice (for the fourth time) that I'd had my hair done until I pointed it out half an hour after I walked through the door.  &nbsp;  I spent Saturday morning turning out a fantastic jumbo batch of hot wings for the BBQ (by special request) and hubby decided he was going to go after all, so we headed over there at about three-thirty. It was a blistering hot day and I think that contributed to the fact that only about a third of the people that my neighbours were expecting actually showed up. Still, it was a good time and it felt good to get out of the house and be around other people.  &nbsp;  Yesterday&nbsp;was a quiet day. I spent a few hours working on a semi-personal project I've had going for a full year (a light, web-based CRM application for freelancers) and we went to see  urlLink 'King Arthur' &nbsp;in the evening. It wasn't a&nbsp;horrible movie but I  was  disappointed. Considering it was by the same writer as 'Gladiator' and same director as 'Training Day', it was pretty average.  This  from the same man that produced 'Pirates of the Caribbean'?? And the music by Hans Zimmer ('Backdraft', 'Days of Thunder', 'Black Hawk Down', 'Pirates of the Caribbean', 'Green Card'... many, many others), I hardly noticed it. I wanted to like it, I really did... all I can say is, I didn't hate it with a passion.  &nbsp;  Here's Monday, I didn't win the lottery this weekend but the sun's shining and my hair  still  looks fabulous!

      Today, Lani had a 3 pm appointment with the vet to get her annual shots and I planned to have her ear checked while I was there. Vet appointments make me nervous when there's something other than regular checkup stuff to be attended to, because I hate the thought of something being 'wrong' with one of my girls.  While I was waiting for the appointment time to roll around, I did the usual... plough through a couple of pots of coffee, check email, make a couple of phonecalls.  Two very pleasant distractions arrived in the snail mail. One was a deposit cheque for a new assignment and the other was a notification that my entry in a photography contest had been chosen as a semi-finalist and had also been selected for publication in a book!  At two-thirty hubby and I headed off on foot to the vet's. Little Lani was so good on her leash, considering it was only her second trip outside her home environment. Once we got inside the vet's office though, she lived up to the reputation huskies have for being 'big babies' and kicked up such a fuss about having her inner-ear checked that the vet said judging by what he could see in the outer ear, there wasn't really any choice but to put her under anaesthetic to treat the problem and examine it properly. I agreed with him completely, Lani had leapt right off the examining table into my arms and hung on so tightly to one of them with her front legs that hubby had to pry her off, she had no intention of being tended to whatsoever. Rather than wait for him to make the decision about treatment based on his wallet, I subtly took control of the situation and went right along with the vet without even looking at hubby and left Lani there on the understanding that I'd pick her up 45 minutes later.  Outside the vets, hubby and I discussed the fact that we needed groceries and I suggested that we both just walk the block to the store and pick Lani up on the way home... 'I don't want to, you just go and I'll meet you at home'.  So at 3:30 I'd finished grocery shopping and went to the coffee shop for a Beanocino (like a Frappucino but better) while I waited for 3:50, when I could head back to the vet's and get my little one.  At 4 pm sharp I walked through the vet's door and waited anxiously until the lady standing at the desk with her cat had finished discussing the ins and outs of spaying with Kelly, the veterinary assistant.  My vet knows me very well. His name is Joe and he's so compassionate and patient with my questions and rather extreme protectiveness when it comes to my huskies. Before he brought Lani out he explained everything he'd done and told me that she was fine and that even if she'd let him look in her ear while she was awake, he wouldn't have been able to see anything because she has a slightly deformed piece of cartilage blocking the view into the inner ear. So it was a good on-the-spot decision to put her under and Joe clipped her nails while she was sleeping too.  So out came the mini-husky, all wobbly and soggy-eyed from the drops vets use to keep them moist while they're under. When she saw me she whined a little bit and then laid down right on top of my feet. Poor little thing... then she had to walk home with me.  The rest of the day was uneventful if you don't count watching Big Brother... what a jackass that Jase is... and don't even get me started on the ditzy blonde, the token 'guy magnet'.  I don't know why but I'm looking forward to tomorrow for the first time in a long time. I wonder what's coming...

      I think this deserves an entry of its own...  To my Danish friend, I know this was all probably a bit of a shock to you. It's a whole new side to the person you'd become friends with and the way you've 'rolled with it' and offered your love and support means a lot to me, thank you.  To the anonymous person who I really don't know; I have no idea if we're related, or if you really suspect that we might be, but the fact that you've taken the time to sit and write words of support and encouragement to someone who is likely a total stranger makes me wish I knew who you were. Thank you.

       'Taurus April 19 - May 19   It's possible that there is someone in your life that you took a chance on, and who has really disappointed you, dear Taurus. You were especially tolerant and patient, but now it's time to settle things once and for all and to put your cards on the table. Don't be afraid to do what you have to do to protect yourself and the people you love.'  ... I read that half an hour after listening to advice from a friend about seeing a lawyer.

      During the course of our six hour long conversation, walking up and down Kits beach the day we met in 1998, I told him there were three things I couldn't forgive in a relationship... cheating, lying and keeping secrets.  The joke's on me, I'm the idiot. I've let him do all three repeatedly for four years.  I don't think I'd started blogging yet back in February so I'll tell you now, Valentine's Day this year was the day after I discovered concrete, undeniable proof that he'd been cheating on me. I should clarify, my definition of cheating is the same as most people's, in that you don't have to have sex with someone other than your spouse to be a cheat. When you sneak around behind their back and lie about your 'friendship' with another person, you're cheating.  Two days ago he lied about  the other  worst thing he could possibly lie about... money. It wasn't the first time by a long shot. As soon as he opened his mouth I knew he was lying but I couldn't prove it until yesterday when I went into his office to fill his coffee (that's what I do, I fill his coffee) and found a letter under his desk, caught up in his computer cables, confirming exactly what I'd suspected. I picked it up (because that's what I do, I pick up after him), but when I realised what it was I put it back thinking it was better to let it go... again.  An $80,000.00 lie... I decided not to let it go this time, so today I went into his office and there it still was. I picked it up again, put it on his chair and as I walked through the living room where he was sitting watching TV, told him I'd found 'a letter' and where he could find it.  I went upstairs and cleaned our bathroom (because that's what I do) and when I came downstairs about half an hour later he tried to use more transparent lies as an escape route. For the first time ever I stood up to him and let him know I didn't believe him.  So now here we are, the same situation we had on Valentine's day, we're not speaking and  he's  angry with  me . I still can't fathom what it is that he thinks he's angry about when  he  break one of our marriage vows but that's what happens every time. The worst part is that he won't leave because he can't be away from his precious computer and his online horseracing game. I have nowhere to go so I'm stuck in this sick mess and gradually finding it harder to be as strong as I need to be if I'm going to gut it out and not leave empty-handed again.   Starting over is hard enough when you walk away from  everything  without taking what you're fairly entitled to, starting over for the  third  time when you're in your mid-thirties is just plain frightening... especially when you suffer from chronic depression and you're six thousand miles away from home.

      ... and I sincerely hope you do, for god's sake  urlLink buy this book .  The author is English, so you're guaranteed a dry, pithy sense of humour and despite not knowing the first thing about operating a boat or fixing one that seems to constantly have something wrong with it, I laughed pretty much from the first page to the last.  You should thank me, I'm doing you a favour!
