      Hopes and dreams.. hopes and dreams.&nbsp; Hehe.   My dear friend and partner in the destruction of the Circle - who I will call The Reluctant Kiri (anonymity is soo mysterious) - decided to fulfill her Hopes and Dreams of making a story she's had for a few years come to life.&nbsp; The budget?&nbsp;A full tank of gas equivalent to PhP 1200.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It took only two scoops of chico ice cream&nbsp;at Pepato for The Reluctant Kiri to finally confess her vision to me (we should be grateful to that odd brown fruit).&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a simple, lovely idea based on painful hopes and&nbsp;too many kilig movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duration between the conception of&nbsp;the idea and the time it took for her to tell me (years!) as well as the forced casualness of the atmosphere it was revealed in were all signs of a confession.&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't have to say it; I knew it was personal.&nbsp;&nbsp;That meant&nbsp;it had to be done.  After three days of planning (with coffee and movie breaks in between), the day to shoot came.&nbsp;  As first-time filmmakers/producers/actors, we all tried to grapple with&nbsp;our awkwardness&nbsp;in front and behind the camera.&nbsp; None of us had any real credentials after all (except maybe for the lead actor, X).&nbsp; I could have taken the filmmaker's 'advice' and said, "You know, it's in my  blooood..."&nbsp; , but that's just plain inside-the-circle bullcrap.&nbsp; Hilarious, yes.&nbsp; Legit?&nbsp; Never.  The only person who came off as a natural was our bakeshop janitor, Three, who proved he was professional enough to take a swing of a dirty walis at his face.  I won't go into the details of what happened and how it went.&nbsp; I'll leave the filmmaker to&nbsp;do that in&nbsp;her blog (she might kill me as it is for revealing this much).&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only go so&nbsp;far as to say that as a first-timer, I was stunned.&nbsp; It's amazing how a person's vision can suddenly come to life right before your very eyes.&nbsp; Every frame was straight out of a person's portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched giddily as the tension between the two characters brewed.&nbsp; As we trudged back to the car, I could feel my veins tingling.&nbsp; It was the realization of somebody's  idea  and I had witnessed it all.&nbsp;   Of course, The Reluctant Kiri tried her very best to seem nonchalant and unaffected (good job, by the way).&nbsp;   I'm sure she feels that the film, being so personal, will expose her later on and come back to haunt her.&nbsp; I don't think it's a problem.&nbsp; Lars von Trier feels the same way about his first film (a short called  The Orchid Gardener ).&nbsp; In the May-June 2002 issue of FILM, a magazine published by the Danish Film Institute, Trier says, "I haven't seen it ( The Orchid Gardener ) in a long time, and it's excruciating to watch it because I've exposed myself in it.&nbsp; As the years go by you become better at not exposing yourself quite as much, at exposing yourself only as much as is required."  So you see, Kiri?&nbsp; This is the beginning of a life-long commitment.&nbsp; You have to follow it up with another film to justify the first.&nbsp; Hehe.  It's not so simple - living out your dream; it's bound to jostle some unfamiliar feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because a vision is realized, it doesn't mean everything else will fall into place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's an incredibly inspiring&nbsp;start.&nbsp;   I like to think of it this way:&nbsp; A friend of mine shelled out money for a tank full of gas and now has everybody in the cast and crew emotionally covered at least for an entire year.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that isn't no-budget dreamweaving, I don't know what is.

      Even the most insouciant people in the world have moments of depth, though usually there are no real witnesses.&nbsp; Once, after a long night out with friends and people who liked to share intimate laughter with me as though we were friends, I drove to the neighborhood park for a cigarette.&nbsp; As I settled in the familiar warmth of my solitude (which I am so accustomed to),&nbsp;I realized no one would ever know the true stirrings in my loins - not the people I was with, not the ones who know me best, not the ones who've known me all my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I saw a patch of mongo seedlings growing next to a gnarly tree and realized that at that particular moment, they were the only witnesses to my confessions.&nbsp; I&nbsp; was delighted.&nbsp; It tickled me that some hours before, a curious&nbsp;kid had scattered the green seeds across the field, hoping that the next day, he would see little leaves sprouting from where the&nbsp;mung beans&nbsp;once were.&nbsp; How was he to know that some sad person had found hope in his little science project?  So much sadness comes with having no one to really talk to.&nbsp; There are always people around; we belong to a culture that thrives on company.&nbsp; But company is often as good as no company, as I've witnessed in hollow conversations, empty laughs and glazed glances.&nbsp; Underneath it all is&nbsp;a sadness that drives people like me to empty fields and vacant lots, hoping to find refuge and solace in a cigarette, and finding instead a patch of growing seeds.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

         ...and they taste good. &nbsp;      &nbsp;   Hear me out,  walang makausap  -- this act of humility and self-&nbsp;indulgence is for you.&nbsp;     &nbsp;     ( I'd also rather do this to keep in touch with you guys than to ever set an electronic foot in friendster.)        &nbsp;

      Everytime I step on the thick yellow line painted on the subway platform and the 1 or 9 train comes rushing towards me, I  feel like I'm going to get hit.  My stomach drops and my eyes shut slightly. The train speeds by like a furious silver bullet, aimed right at me, but always missing by an inch or so.  Then it slows down to a halt and I see my reflection on the dull metal walls. Sometimes I don't even recognize the person I see.  It's easy to get lost in your anonymity, in a sea of faces so unlike your own.  People hop in and out of the train and all I take with me are memories of faceless people listening to their iPods or reading the Times or The New York Post.  Sometimes I remember people who lose their balance and grab on to the slender silver pole, but I can never put a face to my recalls.  They become little details in the stories I like to tell, stories such as this.  Tender details from a fatalistic point of view.  In Manila, I lose myself too, but not as frequently.  Home always has people reminding you that you exist.  They're the same people that need you to remind them of their existence.  Here I depend on my dulled reflection from passing trains to tell me that I am here.  Perhaps I'd disappear without them.

      A graduate student at the Columbia School of Journalism burst into flames and disappeared today after performing a series of dull, brain-numbing reporting exercises for her Reporting and Writing I class at the university.  The student, identified as The Backroom Closet, 24, was last seen swivelling around in her chair in the computer lab of the Joseph Pulitzer Building, home to the School of Journalism.  "We had just finished doing drills on leads," said Trina Havenmayer, also a student at the J-School.  "She complained of a headache and was twirling around in her chair, pen in hand, when all of a sudden, she just burst into flames.  She was gone.  She disappeared."  Students and faculty at the J-school have since been abuzz with speculations of spontaneous combustion.  This phenomenon has no scientific basis but there have been reports of people spontaneously burning into flames that were documented in the past century.  Without any body however, no autopsies can be performed and no explanations can be made.  "This sort of thing is one of those pseudo-phenomena," said Dr. Lebowitz, professor at the Columbia Center for Medical Health.  "We have nothing to rely on but the accounts of people who saw it happen.  That's not exactly a scientific method of judging."    The student had apparently been complaining to her classmates about the monotony of the exercises and her detachment from all things that have to do with the hard news, the police said.    Asano Tadanobu, another student who was closest to The Backroom Closet at that time, said she had remarked that if she had to do anymore reporting exercises, she would implode.  "I guess she did,"  he said.

      I don't feel safe without him.  Somehow, he's always made me feel like nothing could hurt or harm me.   Now, without him, I'm exposed to all these things and people that impose themselves unto my existence.   As flexible as I am by nature, the thought of all these new concepts still terrifies me.  So I ease the fear by revealing to him a piece, a parcel of the things that have happened to me, hoping that by letting the truth slide, I open up my mind as well.  It's worked in the past and it continues to work again.  He knows, and that calms me.  Even if he is thousands of miles away, my protector has once again come to my rescue, saving me from the unknown and the unfamiliar.  I am so lucky.  In a way, he is, to quote our favorite beer-drinking National Artist Nick Joaquin, "my Manila".  He stands for home and for everything that is dear to me.  The familiar smell of his cheek - a mixture of cigarette smoke and freshly scrubbed skin - is a sweet reminder that I am right where I should be.  It's an intoxicating smell, one which reaches in my chest and pulls out my heart, leaving me raw and vulnerable and completely, stupidly in love.    I love him and I love home.  They stand for the same thing.  The same overwhelming scents and the same comforting touch.  How am I going to get by without either one of both?

      From the second floor where my bedroom is, I can hear everything.  Too close to the ground and facing the street.  No longer do I need a nightlight.  All I have to do is flick the switch and my room is flooded with the yellow glow of the lamp post from across.  I have three windows.  Should I decided to keep them shut, then I am closed off to the world outside, the proverbial catterpillar lying safe in her cocoon.  But I like to know what's going on.  It makes me feel safe.  So I unlock all the hatches and pull the glass windows up, and the sounds roll in like a tidal wave.     Right below my bedroom window, there is a grotesquely overweight black lady yelling in French at her toddler.  The little boy's face contorts into a disfigured display of emotion as he screams in between choked sobs and pinched phrases.  "C'est..hic...Mama...hic...no, mama.."   Tried words spill randomly from his tiny mouth, already covered in tears and mucus.  The fat lady continues to yell.  At night, I lay awake listening to the howl and whine of the numerous firetrucks and ambulances skittling up Amsterdam Avenue.  Each truck with a destination; why so many of them are needed in the dead of the night I have no clue, but people call for them anyway.  I suppose accidents are most likely to happen when you anticipate rest.  The sirens wail with conviction, then fade as the trucks extend into the distance.    Some other nights, I hear the audible murmurs of people conversing in the room below.  I can never make out the words.  They are often muffled versions of what I imagine to be arguments, confessions, damned invitations.  I try to make out their faces by tracing a picture in my head with the tones and melodies of each uttered word.  They seem lovely.  A drunken laugh, a worried cough.  People moving things in a lamp-lit street, moving and shuffling, arranging and rearranging.  Everyone in this city coming and going.  These are the sounds I will have to live with for 10 months of my life.
