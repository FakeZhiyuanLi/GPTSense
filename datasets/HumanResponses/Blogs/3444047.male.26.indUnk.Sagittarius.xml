      They have sex and nine months later, we're spit out. Yes, they are called parents. Some are kind and caring and really are interested in their kids' lives. Others are self-centered and couldn't give a crap what went on with their kids. How are mine characterized? They have worked their way all over the spectrum. At one time, they are so loving and caring and just couldn't get enough of hearing great things happening. Next time you hear from them, you get the feeling that you could fart in the phone and get more of a response. I think I may try that the next time I speak with them.  My Mom used to be the one that really seemed to care what went on with me. She was the one that would take the time to sit with me after a long day at school and talk about what had gone on that day and what I had learned and what I was planning on doing with what I had learned. I was so driven by her to do my best and get the heck out of town and make something of myself. I did and then the talks stopped and I was left by the wayside of life. I live my own life now and have no care for what others may think. I guess that is somewhat of a lie. I do care what people perceive me to be, but what I finally do with my life....that is my own concern. My Dad....that is another blog in itself. That is somethign that I could write a nationwide best seller about. He was the one in the house that had to have everything his way. If it wasn't, then you were almost banished from his kingdom. I have always refered to him as being Satan in carnate. Do you think that is where I got my Satanistic ways from? If I got anything from that ass, it was some of his temper. I have kind of a quick release temper that snaps at the most inopportune times. Just ask my partner and various friends. Each have seen it at least once. I like to think that I have a touch of Julia Sugarbaker in me. I will write more later about my incredibly horrible relationship with my , umm, dad. For the most part, I guess my main thing about parents is that they tend to but in where they shouldn't. Take for instance...the insistant urge of my mom and dad to stick their noses in my siter's life and screw around with her divorce. Stay back you beasts and deal with your own lives and leave others alone. Seems like they only stick their ugly noses into our lives when something may bring about a negative outlook on them. Well, tough. One is getting a divorce, one is gay and married to a man, and the other is the spoiled brat that gets what he wants. Sounds like a normal family from Americana to me! How 'bout it?

      As I was driving home from work today, I realized just how much Atlanta drivers get on my last nerve. I realize that there are a lot of people that drive like I do (trying to take others feelings and concerns into consideration) and try to be polite and safe. But there are tons others that only want what is best for them on the road. Take this for example....the reason for going off.....I am on I-285 and am trying to get to Peachtree Industrial Blvd (PIB). I get onto the interstate at Chamblee-Tucker (which the intersection of Chamblee-Tucker itself deserves a blog of its on) and continue on towards the PIB exit. I reach a long line of cars waiting to do the same thing. However, these ignorant drivers, not thinking about how long we had been sitting there to get our turn to exit, swooped in front of the line or did their best to cut in and take their place in the race. This one lady was so determined to get in front of me. When she saw that Satan was sitting behind my wheel, she kindly got behind me. I was in no mood to put up with this crap. Another lady tried to get in front of me with her sports car and I almost slung my door open and pitched a bitch through her window. Satan grabbed his pitch fork and politely showed her that she had best not try anything stupid or I was going to sentence her straight to hell. And I would have if I could have reached her throat. When we finally got to the exit, the only thing that was holding up the line of cars was that someone had gotten stopped by a police officer. I mean, folks, is it so darn important to see what people might be getting stopped for? If you drive correctly and you don't act like a complete fool, you won't be in their place. It is as if people need some kind of lesson from the person getting stopped. It would tickle me to absolute death if someone looked at the cop and said, "Excuss me while I make this sign.....'PLEASE DON'T DRIVE OVER THE SPEED LIMIT. I DID AND LOOK AT ME.'" It is almost as bad as if Aunt Bee's underwear fell down while she was walking down the street. Everyone turns around to see if they are colored or if they have flowers on them.  I just want to let people know that if you are driving along and see a police car, don't let that strike terror in your soul and almost stop in the road. It isn't you that the cops are after. They already have the one that screwed up.  And don't be such a darn nosey person and try to smash your nose against the window, trying to see everything happening. It just isn't anything that you need to be worried about. And if you choose to cut in front of me...aka-Satan Driver...I will let you know exactly how I feel. The interstate system has not seen my wrath, nor has Atlanta heard the evilness that will spew forth from my lips. I will just try to listen to calming heavy metal music and bite my forked tounge.

      During my 26 years on this earth, I have become attached to certain shows. I started watching some as a child and I have become so familiar with the charaters that I feel they are a part of my own family. Take for instance, Days of Our Lives. The show has been around since the 60's and thousands of people have fallen in love with it. One of the worlds most loved women, Frances Reid, plays Alice Horton, the matriarch of the Horton family. She outlived her loving husband Tom Horton (McDonald Carey). Although having to watch the pain and heartache her children have been put through, Alice has always kept a smile and loving heart. She has guided her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren through rough times in their lives and has given them advise that I sometimes wish my parents and grandparents would have given me. It is funny how you tend to live your live through others, even if they are fictitious.  I have so many memories of DAYS. I used to sit in the livingroom floor and watch the TV as Mom was cooking or washing dishes. I remember watching as Bo swept Hope off her feet at the church before she married Larry Welch. The sounds of the motorcycle roaring down the road while "I need a hero..." plays in the background. That was when the soap was in  it's great days. It was also very good when Patch and Kayla were on the show. You also remember where these people lived. I like the basement apartment where Patch and Kayla lived for a while. I think Eugene lived there once too. And the place where Shawn D and Belle are living, that was (if I am not mistaken) where Bo and Hope once lived.  There seems to be so many people that have been forgotten also. Like the Salem Strangler, who was actually Jack Kositchek, played by Jack Coleman, who also played Stevn Carington on Dynasty. He killed Mary back in the early 80's. She went into the parking lot and was murdered, only after being chased around inside. This is where the coolest thing to me, as a child, happend. The Strangler, being the wise and mystical character that he was, hid in a painting where no one could have ever found him! That was terrific. Maybe the producers, writers, and directers need to look back on this glorious time in DAYS history and learn something about making the soap intersting.
