      I need to get the fuck out of the US of A this weekend.  In honor of 'merika's birthday, I'm going to Canada.  This is one of the best ideas I've had in a really, really long time.  So good that celebrating the 4th in Canada may, just may, become an annual event.    What's my point?  I don't really have one, but if you know any good places in Vancouver that are not to be missed I need to know about them, like NOW.  So go on, tell me where I should go.  I'm anxiously awaiting your suggestions.

      Yesterday I wore a new skirt.  A skirt that I bought a couple weeks ago in downtown when I went shopping because I was too drunk to drive home after visiting Von's with some coworkers, a skirt that I realized was too long for me two days ago when I tried it on at home, a skirt that although I was not then drunk decided instead of returning I would shorten with only a pair of scissor and no needle or thread, a skirt that despite the fact that it ends with fraying and raw edges and nothing else looks pretty kick ass.  Man, I  love  that the 80s are back!  And ever since I attacked my new skirt a couple nights ago, my scissors can't stop yammering on and on about what a great team we'd make.  Asking me for old sweatshirts and t-shirts, saying that when she's done taking it out on that sweater or this sweatshirt, Tootie's gonna be so jealous and Rickie Schroder's gonna wanna be my steady.  And all I can think is gag me with a spoon.  Like totally.  P.S.  I finally caved in and joined the darkside (and by darkside I mean ProClub).  That's right.  I'm officially a total yuppie sell out.  Now the only thing that's missing is a SUV and becoming a Republican.  Sure I say NEVER  now , but I use to say that about THE CLUB.  Dunt-dunt-daaaaaa!

      Growing up my mom was always buying me pink clothes. Being a typical kid I hated almost any article of clothing my mom picked out for me, but especially anything pink. I remember one item of clothing particularly well, a pink corduroy skirt overall outfit. I hated this outfit so much that I made a point of telling my mom she was forbidden from buying me anything else in the realm of pinkness which included red and purple. Anyways, looking back now it’s odd because if I look at the last 10 things I've purchased clothing-wise I'd say the majority are PINK! And to be honest, I have to say right now my favorite color is PINK! I love PINK! If pink was a guy I would totally ask him to marry me. Simply put, I can't get enough PINK!   Clothing items I own that are pink:     Light pink capri pants (What the hell was I thinking? And yet I can’t stop wearing them. Man, I’m a dork.)   Light pink and black a-line skirt with flowers (Retroville baby. All the way!)   Light pink chunky cotton sweater (The comfiest damn sweater EVER.)   Hot pink cardigan sweater   Pink corduroy a-line skirt (Interesting side note: I hated corduroy as a kid as well. I’m still a little wary of it.)   Pink and cream toille a-line skirt   Various flower pins in various shades of pink    I'm sure there are more but a) I'm getting bored with listing them b) you don't really care anyways and c) I believe I've made my point.   Actually the more that I think about it maybe I love pink so much now because I hated it that much way back when because I also couldn't stand turtleneck sweaters and now every fall I get giddy when it's time to pull out the turtleneck sweaters and start cycling them through my wardrobe in heavy rotation.   P.S. I'm wearing a HOT PINK cardigan right now. Gawd, I'm such a girl.   P.P.S. Yup, I've got a pink turtleneck sweater as well.   P.P.P.S. Nope, I don't have a pink corduroy sweater. Well not yet anyways.   P.P.P.S. Let's call this my  urlLink Totally Out There Tuesday  post even though I completely forgot about wanting to do that until after I posted this. Oops! Next week, next week.

      I've got nothing but love for you people.   urlLink Enjoy !  That's right.  I'm risking fines and imprisionment, sacrificing my freedom and reputation, just to spread the joy. C'mon, admit it. You watched that show too and loved every minute of it just as much as I did.   What?  You don't know what I'm talking about???  Greatest American Hero?  Here's a quick recap of the coolest/crappiest TV show ever: Ralph Hinkley was minding his own business, when his car mysteriously drove itself out into the desert. A startled Ralph was soon visited by aliens, who had decided to endow him with superhuman powers to fight the battle against injustice and crime. To this end, they gave him a special suit and an instruction manual. Unfortunately, Ralph manages to lose the instruction manual, and the aliens have a nasty habit of never being around when you need them.   You're welcome.

      Saturday afternoon I treated my parents to a live taping of  urlLink Prarie Home Companion  at Marymoor Park in Redmond.  Then just to balance things out I went downtown to see F9/11. I'm suprised to admit that I enjoyed Bowling for Columbine more than Moore's latest offering.  In other news, I have this sudden urge to run out to the store and find me a shirt which reads "Closed Mondays".  By the way, what are you doing here?  Don't you realize you could be reading much, much more amusing stuff like  urlLink this ?  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go.  P.S.  This post is going nowhere fast.  Goodbye.

       Songs that make me want to crawl under the covers, curl up in a ball and cry my heart out:   The Cure's "Friday I'm in love", "Just Like Heaven", "Pictures of You" and "Lovesong"  Peter Gabriel's "Solsbury Hill" and anything else off the Vanilla Sky soundtrack  The entire album of Sting's Ten Summoner's Tales  Elton John's "I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues"  Coldplay's "Warning Sign"  Diana Krall's "I'm Thru With Love"   Songs that remind me I should stop dwelling on my misery and start moving on already:   Modest Mouse's "Float On"  Franz Ferdinand's "Come On Home"  The Clash's "Should I Stay Or Should I Go"  Coldplay's "Everythings Not Lost"  Oh, who am I kidding?  ALL those songs make me want to crawl under the covers and cry. Some days are just like that I suppose.  Note to self: I've got bad news for you.  You need to permanently remove all Coldplay tracks from iTunes.  Sitting at work and suddently becoming all teary, runny nosed and red faced simply isn't going to work.  Ever.

      (and that will most likely leave you scratching your head wondering why):  Asking Jason if he thinks I should dye my hair back to the original color, him responding with, "No, you should dye it bright red", me replying with, "No, you should do that"  and then hearing him respond with, "I don't want to be  that  fat guy".   Asking me how to spell something. I always have to fight the urge to shout out F7, because honestly, that's the only way I can properly spell anything...well, that or with the aid of  urlLink dictionary.com .  And yes, I can bearly do math without a computer.  Long division?  Don't even go there.  That's what machines are for!  God Bless 'Merka!  Uttering the phrase, "Boooyaaaaa!".  Second only, of course, to someone screaming, "Khaaaaan!".   Saying absolutely anything to me after I've had a sip of wine.  No matter what you said, I'll find something intriguing and amusing in it -- humorous and charming.  It can't be helped.  That wine goes straight to my head EVERY SINGLE TIME.   Referring to me by my work title.  I'm no snob but that's the title they gave me.  Given the choice, I would have picked "VP of BS" but there were already five other people at my company occupying that position so it probably wouldn't have worked out anyways.

      I've got tons of topics that I could amuse myself ranting about however in doing so I would only be distracting myself from all the tasks that are on deadline today and can no longer be ignored.  And as much as I love procrastinating I know today my tasks must actually be completed (and not just started as I'm so fond of doing); the least of which is reporting the fresh dent on my beautiful Passat's bumper caused by someone in an SUV backing into my car WHILE IT WAS PARKED.  But I digress...without further ado I believe introductions are in order.  Nose, grindstone.  Grindstone, nose.

      I'm not the first to say this and I certainly won't be the last but the older I get the more I appreciate the wisdom of others.  If there's one thing I've realized as I've aged, it's that the older I get, the less I know.  Don't get me wrong, I don't long for the certainity of youth any more because I realize now the fearless attitude that I could do no wrong and knew better than most was built on a rock solid foundation of my own ignorance.  But I do long for the words and wit of others to confirm my feelings and help me express the importance of what really matters in life.  Today this quote is speaking to me like no other.     "Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours."   I solidly believe that if you focus on the first, you won't have to worry about the second.  Be a true friend and you'll always find yourself surrounded with love and hope.  And luckily for me sometimes even when you are reckless with someone's heart, love still finds its way back to you.  I know that I've got more love and friendship and hope tham I honestly deserve, but I'll take it.  Sure, I'm still secretly hoping for Ctrl Z functionality in my life, but until then I guess I'll just have to learn from my mistakes and be thankful for the forgiveness of others.   Note to self: Be kind to others and stop fucking up so royally.   And on a lighter note, if you'd rather just read a comical spoof of this and the rest of the "Kurt Vonnegut Commencement Address", go  urlLink here .

      Who's the idiot who decided the cd eject button on a computer box should be BELOW the drawer?  Sure that's fine when you're opening it, but when you're closing it you have to reach around the drawer to get to the button.  Why the fuck hasn't anyone changed the design?  I mean, seriously, how difficult would it be to move the damn button up one inch?  I'm sure the designers are worried that I, the American public, will no longer be able to find the damn button if they move it one whole inch, but trust me on this one, no one will die if they can't find the button and if they do they deserve to anyways.  I mean, really...c'mon people!  This is 'merka and in 'merka we gotta get things done and having to reach around to get to the button just isn't doin' it for me anymore.  And since I'm just a lazy 'merikan  I need help so help me out and move the damn button ABOVE the CD drawer on my computer box and no one gets hurt, okay?

      A word to the less than wise (and yes, that most certainly includes me).  Do not check your email while intoxicated.  More importantly, do not reply to your email while intoxicated.  And when you do reply (which is bound to happen since all your filters have been disengaged by all the alcohol you've just consumed) 1) destroy all evidence of the reply, 2)deny to it to those involved and 3)find faithful friends to back up your soon-to-be blatantly false alibi of not having the opporunity nor the inclination to send such an email.  From little 'ol me?   Life should come with Ctrl Z functionality.  Seriously God, if I had that power I wouldn't abuse it by doing things like organizing world peace or stopping atrocities.  I'd only use it for frivolous things like going back in time to stop drunken email sending or drunken cell phone calling or other drunken activities that I normally wouldn't be engaged in had alcohol not been involved.  Honest!  So what do you say big guy?  I'm game if you are.  Oh, and what the heck?  Since I'm asking for stuff from you, and seeing as how it's been so long since you've given me any sort of sign in response to any of the many MANY questions I've been pondering lately, how's about some free cable? You know, so I can watch more of  urlLink this .  Peace out big G.

      Dear Network Admin,  You're the best!  Seriously!  I love it when I don't have access to my work email because, after all, who saves work related stuff in their work email account anyways?  Scrambling around trying to view and move information out of Outlook before it crashes once again is the kind of stuff that I live for!  Also, if we could repeat that one day a couple months ago when all of our applications were inaccesible for over 8 hours that would be amazing. One day just wasn't enough for me.  Being at your mercy while desperately waiting all day long for you to restore our computer system totally ruled!  Now, if only you could also try and make sure the website goes down a little bit more frequently than once a week?  I know that's a lot to ask, you being so busy making sure all our other systems are unstable and crash conistently, but I wouldn't be asking unless I knew you could do it.  I believe!  So, step it up Mister!  Because if there's one thing you've taught me, it's that you should only give people a little bit less than what they actually need because when you do finally give them the full amount of what they need, they'll be singing and dancing your praises left and right.  Let's hear it for mediocrity at its finest!  Whoo-hoo!   P.S. Turn off those lights, stop talking so loud and go get me a cheeseburger.  Adoringly Yours, Sprizee

      or overheard someone say or heard in a presentation (Oh, and in case I didn't mention this before now, these are all going to be  completely  random and possibly even out of context):  During a presenation the VP of Sales at my company (which shall remain nameless) said the following: "Our feets is in it."  Brillant!  We should start using that as our tagline.  But of course we'd also need to change all our phones to ring (or should I say whistle) to the tune of Dixie. You know, just like the General Lee on Duke's of Hazard.  Man, they just don't make quality TV like they use to.  That's genius.  Pure genius!  Me: "I completely forgot to eat lunch today." Misty (in disbelief): "Really???  I'm  always  thinking about my next meal."  Me: "Correction.  It was an  unofficial  Paddlewacker award."  Boss at my company (which shall remain nameless. Are you catching on yet?) said the following to me after telling me he didn't want to give me any details but I know he's going to totally knit pick every single last God Damn detail once he sees the final project: [Blah, blah, blah...talking in general terms.  Some bull shit about how we should do it right, do it correctly and do it correctly right now. What the hell does that mean anyways?]..."To me it's a no brainer."  Yes, to you it's a no brainer but that's because you live inside of that no brain head of yours.  I have no idea what the fuck is going on inside there so help me out and offer up at least a few details already!   Tom at my company (that's right, which shall remain nameless): "Dibs on a one of those dolls."  In Tom's defense, the dolls were pretty kick ass and some might even argue the most masculine doll ever invented.  I may just have to run out and get  urlLink one  for my husband.

      Dido, you couldn't have said  urlLink it  any better.  And now, on a completely unrelated note, a quick weekend recap:  Spent Saturday visiting the folks on the other side of the water.  Sunday was filled with ferry riding, downtown waterfront pier walking, laughing and pointing at people waiting to board a cruise ship, drinking Cosmopolitians, sampling the Mac 'n Cheese at The Blue Onion Bistro with Rachel and the rest of the gang and later that evening a birthday get together for Amie up at Elysian Brewing Company and Public House on Capitol Hill.    I'll just keep right on pretending you care about all the mundane details of my life.  Deep down inside you really do care, right? Who's with me on this one?  Unemployed guy who's never met me and doesn't know what to do with his life or why the hell he's reading this, you're with me right?   That's what I'll keep telling myself.  You don't want to be responsible for changing my mind on this one, trust me.

      I want to be kissed passionately.  I want to scream at the top of my lungs.  I want to cry big salty tears.  I want you to leave me alone.  I want to listen to the same song over and over again.  I want to fuck incessantly.  I want a chocolate milkshake.  I want to go for a run.  I don't want to deal with the world, my job or life in general.  I want to be held down.  I want to punch you.  I want you to let me go.  I want you to fight for me.  I want to live my life.  I want to know you care.  I want you to hear me.  I don't want to have to say a word.  I want to run away.  I want to stay right here.  I want to go back in time and do it all over again.  I want to howl.  I don't want to think about that right now.

      All I can think about is soon I will be leaving the office and this will inevitably lead to me sitting on 520 in traffic - parking lot style, slow moving, frustration city traffic. I fucking hate traffic. STUPID. FUCKING. TRAFFIC.  Things I'd rather do besides sit in traffic:  Run (I went running at 5:20 thinking when I got back at 6:20 the traffic would be gone.  No such luck.)  Work (By work, I mean sit in front of my computer and write personal email to my friends.)  Be forced to write without the use of parenthesis.  (One, have you noticed how much I use parenthesis, and two I don't think that's physically possible.  I might just spontaneously combust or something if I am forbidden from using the lovely and amazing (and not to mention versitile!) parenthesis.)  Have my heart broken (I take that one back.  Maybe traffic isn't so bad after all.)

      I don't know and I don't care.  And I'm going to totally kick ass at Jeopardy tonight.  I can just feel it.  And by kick ass I mean shout answers louder (and perhaps quicker but probably mostly just louder) in the general direction of the TV.  90210!  Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez!  WWII!  Ha!  IN. YOUR. FACE.  And by shout answers I don't necessarily mean the  correct answer  but to make up for that one tiny, little flaw I'll make sure to make them really, really loud "answers".

      Things have been very confusing lately.  I've hurt people that don't deserve it.  I've lost sleep over things I've done.  I've felt ripples of guilt, joy, exhaustion, pain, love and hate frequently and often.   I'm not sure exactly where I got so far off the right path to end up here, but here definitely isn't where I ever planned on being.    It's time I started being clearer about things.    I love my husband and I need him to know how much admire him for being so understanding, so unconditionally loving and for NEVER EVER letting me doubt his love for me.    He should totally get to be president (I'd vote for him) or at the very least get some sort of medal for all the crap he has to put up with including but not limited to the following:    My mood swings  Attempting to understand or at least not be completely annoyed by my fickleness  Constantly reminding me to keep my job in perspective  Helping me silk screen shirts that I never should have been silkscreening in the first place this weekend  Picking up after me like the "best damn maid service ever"  Visiting my crazy family with me on occasion  Watching one episode of Dawson's Creek with me and not leaving the room in complete disgust  Not giving me a lecture every time I come home with another bag of clothes that I don't need especially when half the clothes I own are lying on the floor of our "office" (HEY, can I help it if all my clothes no longer fit in my closet anymore?  I guess I could stop buying more  god damn clothes .)  SEE?   That  is why my husband is so great!

      Try to smell my face before I finish washing it.  Yes I understand my face has a lovely smell after it's washed like sunshine and rainbows and fresh flowers all rolled into one glorious scent but hello?  I'm trying to work here.  Not know where I put my Adidas running shoes, my black leather belt or my Banana Republic Khakis (No, not  those  khakis.  Yes I know those are Banana Republic too but those aren't the ones I'm looking for.)  I mean honestly somebody needs to keep track of my stuff.  Lord knows I'm no good at it.  Decide to go looking for an obscure audio tape that's buried somewhere deep in the storage unit even though you know that means you'll have to move everything out and I'll have to assist you and we'll both end up at the bottom of a big pile of junk. Junk that I don't even want to think about what to do with right now.  Thanks A LOT!  Insist that I order company logoed shirts from India because we can get a great price.  Sure the company got a great price but my shirt is five sizes too big for me and makes me look like I'm seven and decided it would be a good idea to wear my dad's shirt to school today.  The only way I'm going to look semi-presentable in this tent will be through the creative use of fabric origami and LOTS of safety pins. Look Buddy, I'm the Marketing Executive, so next time I'll be ordering from Lands End where the sizes are consistent, thank you very much!

      The hottest scene EVER has to be the one between Harrision Ford and Sean Young in Bladerunner.

Young Harrision Ford, I'm yours for the taking.   Old Harrision Ford, however, I'm going to have to ask you to step off.  That's right.  You heard me correctly. STEP. OFF.

      Band-Aids are a great invention.  I love putting on a fresh Band-Aid and yes, I realize that  technically  I should be saying bandages because Band-Aids is a copyrighted term, but people that point that out are the same types of people that point out it’s not a Klennex, it’s a tissue.  Oh yea?  Well, your not technically a dictionary, but you sure are a dork (and I should know because it takes one to know one).  No one wants to hear it buddy.  Anyways, like I was saying Band-Aids© are a great invention and I love them (except the plastic ones).  Plastic Band-Aids©, you can go to hell.    Seriously.  STOP. WASTING. MY. TIME.    You’re not fooling anyone.  If you’re not made of fabric, don’t even think of coming near my body because I know your kind.  Your kind is the type that will only stick for about 15 minutes and then begin your rapid plot of peeling off my body, annoyingly so.  I know you’re the only ones left in my company’s first aid kit because other people who shall remain unknown to me (Cowards! Hang your head in shame!) already took all the good fabric Band-Aids©.  I know you are a waste of my time, my coworker's time and a complete and utter waste of space in our first aid kit.  I’ve got half a mind to throw each and every one of your sorry little flimsy plastic souls away in a defiant standing of my ground, you know, the one in which I tell you and all your sub par peeling friends to kiss my ass.  But that would be all too easy.  Instead I’ll leave you where you are and wait for my coworkers to discover how annoying you little plastic bastard can be.  That’ll teach ‘em...or something like that.    Sorry, this may just be the worst post ever. It had potential right?  Humor me, ok?  But somewhere towards the end it all fell apart.  If only I wasn’t such a lazy brat, I might have had the heart to pull it together.    Too bad this isn’t a choose your own adventure.  My brainpower is severely deficient today.

      I found out this morning that  urlLink Keane  is going to be playing at the  urlLink Showbox in September .  I promised myself I'd never return to that death trap of a club but I'm breaking my own rule in light of this new information.  I don't have much more to say, but I'm also posting this because I'm sick of staring at the last post.  So on that note, let me just also say that I've haven't been listening to Keane's Hopes and Fears lately much, not because I don't really like it (because I do, honest!), but more because it has the same effect on me as listening to Coldplay.  It makes me reflective and melancholy and I'm trying really, really hard to just be happy and live in the moment.  At times, that's easier said than done.  At any rate, a good girlfriend called last night unexpectedly.  She wanted to go out for drinks but pathetic little ol' me was already in my pjs by 10.30 last night. So we just chatted for a while.  It's friends like that help you keep things in perspective.    Note to self: Buck up!  Snap out of it!  Pull yourself together girl!  Oh, and keep it up with all that Pink!....um, maybe not.  Oh, and my favorite song by Keane?  Why, that would have to be Bedshaped but the whole album is good.  And for the record I don't think they sound anything like Coldplay, just have the same kind of lilting, melancholy feel.

      Missing someone who doesn't miss you.  A memory sparked by some seemingly ordinary event that tugs on your heart and starts a chain reaction that leaves you with only a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach and a numb void of regret and confusion about the future.  Wondering when the tears will finally stop.  Thinking that perhaps they never will.

      I can't think.  I can't function like this.  The  urlLink office mate  is fine, but trying to wrap my brain around Offshore Outsourcing and write an article on it while listening to her interview someone over the phone simply isn't going to work EVER.  This situation decidedly stinks.  At one point, I realized I was plugging my ears with my hands and trying to type at the same time.  Dude, I'm pathetic...yet too lazy to walk down to my car to get my headphones...which I guess makes me even more pathetic (if that's possible).    When's recess?

      I just realized my company pays someone to come in to water the plants.  That is all.  That is all she does.  Sure, I’ve seen her in the office before but I never really thought about this before now.  Why the fuck do we need to pay someone to water the fucking plants?    Excuse me.  Perhaps I should have prefaced my rant with the following facts.  Fact #1: My office has 20 people.  Fact #2: We only have 5 plants.  Fact #3: There is no three.  My office only has 20 fucking people and 5 fucking plants!    Why the hell are we paying someone outside of those 20 people to water those plants???  Hey, if the owner really has a thing for giving money to the Plant Lady, then I’ll step up.  I can be the Plant Lady for my office because, after all, lord knows I could use another source of income on the salary they pay me.    Seriously.  Next time I see the Plant Lady I’m going to kick her in shins, grab the watering can, steal that $20 in her pocket that’s rightfully mine and send her packing.  And that, my friends, is the kind of justice I hand out on a daily basis (in my head).   P.S. Attention person who found my site based on the following google search: "your * fist in your mouth", You scare me.  I hope you've already vacated the premises.  Seriously.  Are you still here?

      The weekend highlights  Friday was spent at Blue C Sushi enjoying Happy Hour and at El Camino enjoying more food, drinks and a wicked Coconut Cake desert that is not to be missed.  Truly.  Saturday was spent at Seahawks Stadium watching Chelsea kick the crap out of Celtic.  Too bad it was so fucking  urlLink hot  that I could barely even remember my first name, let alone where the car was parked or how to operate my point and shoot camera.  Sunday was spend in glorious, wonderful, beautiful Ballard gazing at young families with dogs and old people with character, real honest "been liv'n in this neighborhood for over 40 years and if you weren't the dumb ass who stopped looking for a house to buy months ago you'd have a chance to steal it out from under me once I kick the bucket" kind of folks.  Man, it makes me want to throw my hands up in the air, flip off Europe, kiss my travel plans goodbye and settle down with a little, rotten, dilapidated 300k house in dire need of a fix'n.  I'd enclose it with a white picket fence... and a lot of love .  But I digress.  Without further ado...Internet, Ballard Photos.  Ballard Photos, Internet.

      I don't know what you want from me!  Do I need to sacrifice something?  Why don't you just leave me alone, mean and wicked  urlLink God of Horrible Mondays !  Seriously.  You miserable bitch.  I know you're "all powerful" and still "very much having your way with me" and "don't care whether or not I become insane" and "your sole purpose on this earth is to aggravate me to no end" but seriously, could you pretty please with sugar on top step the fuck off?  Today,  this  Monday, you've gone too far.    My computer crashed, I spilled juice on myself, and the first 3 computers in the training center that I attempted to logon to each had their own special problem.  Computer #1 worked just fine but danged if I didn't check to make sure it had a mouse before I started to use it.  I know lots of keyboard equivalents but those only got me so far.  No mouse equals me having to find another computer to use.  Computer #2 had a mouse, and I know because I double checked before I started it up, however it didn't have an Internet connection and anybody who's anyone knows that you can't work on a computer without an Internet connection.  You might as well just get out the old pen and paper if you don't have an Internet connection.  No Internet connection equals me having to find another computer.  I cauticously approached Computer #3 making sure it had both a mouse and an Internet connection.  Then I realized some of the keys on the keyboard didn't work.  A semi-functioning keyboard on Computer #3 equals me about to lose all sense of sanity.   After wasting a good two hours accomplishing approximately nothing, the Network guy came over to let me know my computer was functioning once again and also he had given me a much larger memory card.  You hear that?  I got something good out of it, so take that you stupid {insert mean degoratory slur right here} God of Horrible Mondays!  P.S.  I just rotated my computer monitor after typing the above and smashed my pinkie between the 400lb. monitor and the stand.    Yea, that sounds about right.

      you know, right after the listing for "make sure all comments I leave on this blog are  relevant * to the post"...

Yea, I know.  *Yawn*  If anyone has time burning a hole in their calendar and they want to do some freelance** work, let me know.    *References to David Hasselhoff are  always  relevant to any post.  **Let me break that down for you.  That's "free", as in I'm not going to pay you for your work and "lance", as in I'll find a guy named Lance that will thank you for your assistance on my little project.  Don't all rush me at once.  Rest assured I will give thoughtful and careful consideration to each and every relevant article received (yes, of course that includes David Hasselhoff articles although for the record I would prefer you just do my work for me and send me an Offshore Outsourcing story, thank you very much).

      What?  No, I'm not getting fired and I didn't quit my job.  I'm still gainfully employed.  It's just that my whole office is moving around and I'm unhappy to report I'm moving out of my lovely little personal office with windows (that open! two of them!) into a new slightly larger office (hooray!) that I'll have to share with another person (boo!).  I'm hoping my office mate and I will get on well. After all, she seems pleasant enough.  I just she hopes enjoys listening to Justin Timberlake, The Pixies, Michael Buble, The Cure, and Franz Ferninand at nausea, otherwise we're going to run into some major issues, namely, me becoming very grumpy.    Oh well, we're the same age which is cool.  No one wants to share an office with someone twice their age.  She's tall, blond and skinny as a toothpick.  And did I mention she's German and has quite the accent?  Guys seem to really dig that accent!  I think they start playing a Nazi dominatrix fantasy in their head whenever she opens up her mouth.  I don't think I have to tell you that no one should have to share an office with that kind of a girl.  It's just not fair to have to deal with an office mate who's hotter than yourself on a daily basis.    The only glimmer of hope for me in an otherwise which is certain to be bleak office existence moving forward will revolve around if previously mentioned guys in my office start replacing the Nazi fantasy with a lesbian fantasy about the 2 of us.  Nah, I'm screwed.  Plus, no more blasting whatever music I want to listen to whenever I want to listen to it.  This sharing thing decidedly stinks.  Clearly, I am an only child.

      That's the sound me throwing in the towel, admitting defeat, jumping on the band wagon (the one with all those screaming pre-teen girls) and grooving to tunes of Mr. Justin Timberlake.  Double take not necessary.  You heard right people.  I'm admiting I LIKE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE'S JUSTIFIED. A LOT.  A scary thought, I know.  Hey, you're not the only scared one here.  I'm scared too. Hold me?    Hopefully the following information will make this pill a little easier to swallow.  (It won't, but for my sake, just play along.)  I never was able to distinguish between N'Sync and The Backstreet Boys and I still don't know which one Justin belongs to.   Don't do it people!  I don't want to see any comments clarifying that issue.     The point is, I don't know which band he belongs to and further more I don't care.  N'Sync and The Backstreet Boys both suck.  Mr. JT, on the other hand, kicks some serious ass and I'm offering up some major props to him for a) not lip syncing on his debut album and/or in concert and b) for making Justified in a style reminiscent of Michael Jackson's  Off The Wall , you know, before Michael went all wack and started hanging out with little boys way too much and looking like a white woman.    The sad thing is now that I've mentioned Michael Jackson, I have this horrible sinking feeling that all the comments are going to revolve around him, which we all know is only going to quickly lead to things that are most certainly sick and perverse.   Again, I must ask that you people muster up a little restraint.  Any monkey can make snide remarks about Michael "Likes Little Boys" Jackson.   Screw it.  Who am I to speak?  I just admited I like a former boy band star.  That, people, leaves me with approximately zero latitude in which to pass judgements and/or offer up suggestions on what is and is not acceptable behavior here or any place else for that matter.    So, in summary, I say, give Mr. JT a chance or as Justin says in  Rock Your Body, "Don't be so quick to walk away"...   P.S. Britney Spears is an talentless lip syncing bitch who should go straight to hell, without passing go or collecting $200.  Justin, clearly, can do much better.

      I’m wary of anyone who doesn’t enjoy, not just appreciate but truly  enjoy , Bob Marley’s music.  Or maybe it's just that Bob reminds me of Hawaii because I listened to Bob non-stop while in Maui.  I probably could have been listening to country music, and loved it just as much, because Hawaii is just that magical.  Hawaii, let's run away together, k?  Holy Crap!  Did I just make a country music reference?  There's no place left to go but up...and for the record, I HATE COUNTRY MUSIC.  If you choose to drive in front of me and we are in the left hand lane on a freeway (otherwise know as the FAST lane) and you also choose to drive at a speed LESS than the speed limit I will forever hate you.  That, and you’ll cause my blood pressure to boil over to a temperature on a cartoon thermometer labeled "crazy mad".  I’m just one more idiot driver away from going insane people.  I am NOT to be messed with today.  Seriously.  I'm currently trying to figure out ways in which to convince my company to send me to India for a month to "work" this fall.  I need me some travel'n and I'm not above making up reasons why I need to visit our India office.  If you've got any semi-credible reasons you think I can use, please send them my way.  I may get stuck paying for my plane ticket, but I'm okay with that since I know the company will be paying for everything else (of course, that's complete crap since you can stay in a 5 star hotel in India and eat like a king for less than $5 a day but whatever).  I'm desperate to travel without quiting my job so I'm seriously considering it.    What about Europe you ask?  I'm thinking next spring of 2005 instead of this fall.  I've been known to change my mind once or twice before.  Then there's the I'd rather not quit my job if I don't have to aspect of things.  Somehow I've become addicted to being able to feed, cloth and shelter myself.  I know, it's silly.  Stupid reality.  Why must you taunt me!  I have a subscription to the Christian Science Monitor.  No, I’m not a Christian Scientist and here’s why.  I’ll never be able to give up my preoccupation with silly things like going to the doctor and taking medicine when I’m sick.  I’m odd like that.  It’s just an excellent newspaper.  You can read it for free online at  urlLink www.csmonitor.com .  I’d love to go camping this weekend but I’ve already got plans to see The Celtic vs. Chelsea soccer game at Seahawks Stadium on Saturday which is going to totally kick! (No phun intended.  What?  That phun was  totally  intended.  Ha!).   urlLink Some people  have way too much free time on their hands.  (Right, like I’m one to talk.)  Which reminds me, I didn’t make any New Years Resolutions because a) I’m lazy b) I’m lazy and c) did I mention that I’m lazy?  But while up in Vancouver I bought some stickers in Chinatown and I briefly thought about making a Midyears Resolution to use more stickers.  Unfortunately, in case you hadn’t heard, I’m lazy, so, needless to say, that never went anywhere.  By the way, the stickers that I bought in Chinatown, they’re still sitting in my yet to be unpacked bag.  I  told  you I was lazy.

      Dear Mr. ProClub,  You are charging me a ridiculous monthly fee to be a member of your prestigious little club (an amount which shall remain a mystery in order to protect the stupid, namely me).  And since I am a member of said pompous club, I see it as my personal duty to inform you that I think it's total crap that you don't have a nap room.  And you call yourself a health club!  Shame on you.    Hurry up and get that nap room built.  You don't think I joined so that I could get into shape do you?  Don't be silly.  I simply don't deal well sitting on 520 in traffic.  People who drive in the fast lane going 10 mph under the speed limit make me a little road ragey; same thing with just sitting on 520 parking lot style.  I get a little postal, if you know what I mean.  So get mov'n. The nap room isn't going to build itself.  Sincerely, Sprizee  P.S. If you see some girl in the spa passed out in exhaustion from another grueling day at work, let her be.  She is, most certainly, NOT to be disturbed.  P.S.S Here's my  urlLink Totally Out There Tuesday  post...If things don't start looking up in the next 10 minutes, I'm going to have to resort to propping my eyelids open with paperclips.   Just between you and me, I'm not looking forward to that eventuality.   P.S.S.S. Happy Birthday  urlLink Deron .  I still think you're a punk.

      Last time I handed out points to my friends, if I  urlLink remember  correctly, Deron walked away with 75 big ones.   Since then the following has occured.    He asked me,  repeatedly mind you , to invite him to a bbq.  I obliged.  He accepted.  I doublechecked the date with him.  Again, he confirmed it.    Then he cancelled on me.    So listen up Deron!  You gave me a lame excuse. Move back 2 spaces, lose a turn and deduct 500 points.  That is all.  P.S. Wanna play poker?   Update :  It's official.

      I just downed a bottle of beer* at work for lunch.  The  urlLink God of Horrible Mondays  is still very much alive, kicking and having her way with me.  This weekend, I went over to Port Orchard to help one of my family members move lots of heavy furniture.  I've very, very tired and sore, sore, sore but as J-Dog will have you know, in family,  urlLink no one gets left behind .  {Insert his man tears here.}  Sunday the bbq on my roof deck quickly turned into a poker tournament in which I rapidly schooled everyone and dubbed myself "Poker Player Who Is Guaranteed To Shamelessly Take All Your Money And Leave You Huddled On The Floor In The Fetal Position In A Puddle Of Your Own Drool and/or Tears".  Trust me, it'll never be just "or".  It'll ALWAYS be "AND".  Too bad there wasn't any real money involved.  Next time people JUST. YOU. WAIT.  I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever write an actual post again or just keep listing random crap.   Guess I'll just have to wait and see.  I have a farmer's suntan from sitting ouside most of yesturday in a short sleeved shirt.  Needless to say, it's not a good look.  *Technically, it was a  root beer  but if it helps, I pretended like it was just a beer even though it clearly was not.    I know, that doesn't help.

      My office got Chinese food for lunch yesturday and I'm not ashamed to say I took more than my fair share of fortune cookies.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Last night I watched Celebrity Poker Showdown after downing a Strongbow at the Ravenna Ale House&nbsp;in less than 10 minutes.&nbsp; We had to keep turning the tv volume up higher and higher&nbsp;to drown out our conversation so we could catch all conversation and commentary&nbsp;on the tv.&nbsp; I don't know why we didn't realize we&nbsp;could&nbsp;just shut the fuck up.&nbsp; Oh, yes I do...because we were all drunk.  &nbsp;  This morning I didn't get in the office until 10am.  &nbsp;  My skirt is way too fucking short, however, I didn't realize this until I sat down in my car and by then I was way too late and much too lazy to go back to my apt and change into something else.&nbsp; I am, however, proud to report I'm not sporting an ounce of Pink! today.  &nbsp;  I've probably done about 5 minutes of work since I got in this morning.  &nbsp;  I'll probably only do one full hour of work by the time I leave this evening.  &nbsp;  Then I'm going to the gym to run like I've never run before (for the first 5 minutes, then I'll run for about 15 more minutes until I get bored with it and stop).  &nbsp;  This&nbsp;may just be my worst post ever.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm bored.&nbsp; Entertain me with a comment...or 10.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm in dire need of some caffeine, a vacation and a crew of people to keep me in line.

Those shoes on my feet were purchased in Chinatown for $5 after the shoes that I had purchased the previous day for over $100 in Vancouver had left my feet severely blistered.  Why do I always insist on lying to myself, rationalizing $140 Canadian will only work out to $6 US and a couple packs of Chicklets?  Yes, the exchange is in my favor but not  that much  in my favor.  The bags in my hand are from Starbucks and one of the many clothing euro-trash clothing stores we encountered on our journey where I purchased a sweater I didn't need, among other things.  Allegedly.  Here are a few of the places where much damage was done (allegedly):   urlLink Blue Ruby's    urlLink Mexx    urlLink Zara   Number of Pink! items purchased: 1 Pink!

      I judge my friends based on a simple, yet elegant, point system.  After all, I'm nothing, if not fair.   urlLink Headstart for Happiness  gets 500 points because, knowing full well that I don't have cable, she offered to tape  I love the 90s  just for me.  Now that's what I call a dedicated friend!  (and also, because she sends me emails that literally make me laugh out loud every single day, like this one..."I just went to the record store and bought this really cool LP, but I left it in the sun in my car, and it got wharped.  Fuck my existence!")   urlLink Steve  gets 125 points because he ripped me a copy of Kathy Griffith's  urlLink The D-List  which I watched last night and basically peed myself laughing more than I've laughed in quite a while.  My sides hurt. I WANT MORE!   urlLink J-Dog  gets 225 points for entertaining me on a daily basis with funny observations on his blog.  Oh, and also for making some uber cool mixed CDs, all completely legal and fully licensed, of course. (wink, wink)  Deron gets 75 points for giving me the hot tip to not rush right out and buy tickets for  urlLink The Cure/Interpol Show at The Gorge .  He said they'd probably go on sale 2 for 1 unless it completely sold out, which last time I checked was bound to happen in approximately never.  Well, what do you know?  Yesturday tickets were 2 for 1!  I guess that means it's my turn to bring the black face paint.  The Dork Squad (you know who you are) gets 475 points for causing my eyes to roll back in my head and making me laugh  simultaneously .  And for making sure I'm never thirsty, and providing me with hours and hours of crazy music to listen/dance to...for fremont fair wandering, vancouver stubbling, starbucks frapaccino walking, amsterdam cafe loitering, lake stevens bbq'ing, just no doubt these kind of friends are priceless, good times.  I don't, however, keep a running tally because  that  would not be fair and  also  because I've got a very short term kind of memory.

       urlLink     That's me (more specifically, my backside), so this photo is really a tribute, if you will, to Stephen's  urlLink post  about his ass.  Then again, what isn't?  Click on me to be magically whisked away to a new place where you'll be able to view lots and lots of boring photos that you could care less about.  Or maybe not?  Let's see!  Or you can just view these professionaly taken  urlLink photos .    Hey, I aim to please.    You're welcome.

      I can sum up George W. Bush's presidency in five words:    "Liar, liar pants on fire"    What five words would you choose to sum it up?  P.S.  "His ass needs to go"  was a close second.  P.S.S.  "Not gonna be fooled again"  was a distant third.

      and literature since 7-11 (the date, not the store)  But more on that later, first things first.   The God of Horrible Mondays is still having her way with me.  I tried to login to my hotmail account this morning, only to find out that apparently, "This server is too busy."  Oh, you mean  this server , the one which I'm trying to access to view my what I'm sure can only be described as very important email, you know, like "Get out of the doghouse! Buy 12 roses and get 12 free!" from 1-800-FLOWERS.  Great!  Now what the hell am I suppose to do for the next 8 hours to keep myself entertained?    Actually, if I'm really going to be honest, I can't blame her for this one.  Hotmail goes down ALL THE TIME.  I think once it even went down because I sneezed too loudly.    Hotmail, you can go to hell.  And now that MSN messenger no longer forces you to use a Microsoft email account, I'm even more inclined to ditch hotmail all together.  However, switching to another email address would require notifying my friends of the change, and some work, all be it minor work (it's still work none the less), work which I'm not looking forward to doing and therefore I'm sure I'll just stick with hotmail for now because let's face it, I'm pretty damn lazy.    Regardless, I don't like hotmail. Not. One. Bit.  I won't even mention the "feature" within hotmail where when you click on a link in your email it causes the link to redirect thru a hotmail.com URL. Those bastards!     At any rate, here's that quick weekend recap you've been no doubt waiting for all day long...  Friday night was spent at Pies and Pints in Roosevelt and later on at the newly renovated Ravenna Tavern.  I think I'm going to start frequenting this joint more often seeing as how they have Strongbow and Boddingtons on tap.  Oh Strongbow, how I love you, let me count the ways...one, yummy...two, yummy...three, yummy...four, yu...well, you get the point.  Saturday was filled with bbqs in Lake Stevens (okay, just one really) and then dinner later that evening at some Italian place in Roosevelt, the name of which currently eludes me...Olympia's?...where I dined with G.W.'s number one supporter among others.    Sunday I finally carted my ass down to the new Central branch library in downtown.  Innovative architecture, free books, maps, CDs, and DVDs - What more could a girl ask for?  Good gawd almighty, I think I've found my new santuary.  I'm pretty much considering my new library card an all access pass to claim any and all spots in the library as my personal domain and start the move in of my bed and tv and couch and such.  Finally, my tax dollars went towards something that I'll actually be able to use!  P.S. Who wants to take bets about which pictures will get posted first, Vancouver or the Seattle Public Library shots?  You fools.  It's a trick question.  I'll never get around to posting either.  No, kidding again.  What, you thought I was serious?  Don't be silly.  Hopefully I'll get around to posting one or the other (or both!) soon.  My fingers may be crossed .  Until then, you can always go  urlLink here .

      So last night I went over to  urlLink Headstart for Happiness 's house to watch me some poker courtesy of Bravo! and what I would affectionately refer to as some semi-celebrities.  The Cast:   Richard Kind   Deep down I know you're not the lovable harmless big guy that you try to pass yourself off as.  I know  you're really a big jerk and someone that shouldn't be left alone in a room with children under the age of 12.  And that thing about being able to fit your  entire  fist in your mouth...well, that's just down right creepy.   Jerry O'Connell   I remember you from Stand By Me with your chubby little cheeks and rolls of fat.  You were so sweet and harmless but now, my friend, you have turned frat boy -  all the way  and it's pretty immature and annoying.  I'm not even going to mention that you were in that crap they called a movie, Kangaroo Jack.  That said, I wouldn't kick you out of the bed.  Call me!   Jennie Garth   I grew up right along side you.  You dated Dylan and Brandon and I daydreamed about being just as cool and slutty as you.  But now I've come to my senses.  You're too pretty.  I hate you.  Go away. 9-0-2-1-NOOOooooooo!  Don't give me that look.      Willie Garson   Who? Sex in the City?   Sorry, I don't have HBO.   Apparently, my intellectual growth has been severely stunted due a lack of Sex in the City viewing.  I'm not opposed being adopted as a charity case.  Please send DVDs or money now.  Preferrably money.       Dave Navarro   Please, please, please for the love of God would you please do us all a favor and shave off that beard.  It's way too fuzzy.  Beards aren't meant to be fuzzy at least not in my book.  Other than that I think you rule, I mean you kicked ass at poker ...oh and then there's the marrying Carmen Electra thing.   I think I speak for everyone here when I say thank you from the bottom of my heart for preventing her from marrying Dennis Rodman more than once.  Hey, whatever happened to Dennis anyways?  Nevermind.  I don't want to know.  The Hosts:   Dave Foley   Kids in the Hall would be enough to forever keep you in the book of cool however you're still as funny as ever (despite being on NewsRadio.   I'm sorry but for the most part that show sucked ).  Plus you're Canadian!  Dude, you rule and you know it.     Phil Gordon   Looking for a new protege?  I'm your girl.   If anyone out there knows how tall Phil is I NEED to know.  From what I could tell from the TV he looked a good foot taller than everyone else.  I'm thinking dating someone that tall could have some serious advantages.  I wouldn't mind seeing Phil's poker face if you know what I mean... and I think you do.

      I’m happy to report that I ran into my  urlLink perspective  while on holiday in Vancouver, BC.  We had quite the time too!  Who knew I’d have to go ALL THE WAY to a foreign country to find him, but that’s where he was--on a sugary caffeine high, continuously medicating himself with heavy doses of alcohol and shopping.  Now that’s someone with the right sorts of priorities!    And we’ve come to agreement.  He’s sticking with me, at least for a while,  thank the lawd , as long as I stick with the plan we’ve agreed upon.  THE PLAN  Cut out all the Coldplay, Keane, Cure, and Vanilla Sky from my listening diet until further notice.  Replace with heavy doses of Franz Ferdinand.     Have more bbqs on the roof of my apartment building.     Spend more time with my close friends.     Take lots of mini weekend vacations this summer to places including but not limited to the following: Portland, OR; Victoria, BC; Eastern Washington; More suggestions are welcome…    Get up the nerve to ask for 2 months off of work by,  and this is vital,  next week so I can travel around Europe this fall.  And when they laugh in my face and ask me if I’m joking, stand strong and be willing to quit.  Sure, this job is pretty cool but I think you and I both know that going to Europe this fall would be much MUCH cooler.   Wish me luck.

      I don’t think I need to tell you that  urlLink this movie  has the potential to kick some serious ass.    Johhny Depp, beautifully weird ass sets, over-the-top makeup, and David Kelly (Remember him from Waking Ned Devine… No?  Okay fine! No more obscure references for you! )  Tim Burton, you never cease to amaze me (except for that one time with Big Fish).  Big Fish, you can go to hell.   I know, everyone else liked it, and as much as I wanted to like it I DIDN’T.  Let’s face it.  That film sucked ass.  I thought it was boring, but worse not only boring but boring and stupid…and that sucks, I mean that  really sucks  and makes absolutely no sense because it had all the right ingredients for me to fall in love with it and true to form like everything else I’ve ever fallen in love with, commence stalking, twenty-four seven three sixty five.    I mean, I love Ewan McGregor, I love Tim Burton sets and I love every other Tim Burton film, including the ones that everybody else complains about like Batman and Legend of Sleepy Hollow, but while watching Big Fish in the theater I wanted to die because I was so bored out of my mind.  I leaned over to my friend and whispered I was going to need a couple more drinks to finish watching the movie and I had already had two and if you know anything about me (which you probably don’t so I better explain) then you know that at the mere glance at a glass of wine my cheek flush red, I start to get dizzy and I begin to slur my words.  I’m what you’d call a cheap date.  At any rate, Mad props to Tim Burton AND his artistic genius, despite Big Fish sucking more ass than any other film has ever sucked ass before and yes, I  do  believe porn should be included in that countdown because Big Fish would still win.  Hands down.  So in summary.   Big Fish = Bad   Tim Burton = Good   But wait, since Tim Burton directed Big Fish that means Tim Burton = Big Fish which would imply that Big Fish = Good and Tim Burton = Bad?    Fuck, now I’m all confused.  Move along, nothing to see here.

      This weekend I had an epiphany of the shoe variety.  I figured out that the one thing that’s missing in my life (besides a job that includes 3 day weekends 4 times a month) is some comfy black leather Mary Janes.  I know, I know…I don’t even want to hear it, so don’t start.  Hey, what did I just say?   Seriously, stop.   First  urlLink the Pink! thing  and now  this .  What the hell is up with me?  Wait, don’t answer that.  I don't think the world is ready for this much cuteness. I know I'm not.   Yet. Can't. Stop.

      In spite of the fact that it  technically  is Tuesday today, I know it was you this morning, you know, putting thoughts in my head about excuses I could use to call in sick, like say...I'm "sick"...or my car won't start...or the good ol'standby of I'll be working from home today (okay technically this isn't "calling in sick" but still, no work, therefore it still counts).  But I resisted and got my ass out of bed.    I begrudgingly hopped in the shower.  Self,  I said to myself , the God of Horrible Mondays, ain't got noth'n on you.  You're invinsible!  You go girl!    But damn if the God of Horrible Mondays isn't a vindictive bitch because no sooner had I doused myself with water and soap that I heard the fire alarm going off.  I tried to ignore it for a couple minutes but apparently everyone was evacuating the building because there was indeed a fire.    So dripping and naked I hurriedly put on a few clothes and ran out the door.  There I stood cold and wet.  Then the fireman gave us the all clear and let us go back in the building because  apparently  there was no fucking fire to begin with.    Damn you God of Horrible Mondays.  You're good.  A little too good.    I will never doubt your powers again.

Remind me again why I agreed to leave for BC at 8am ON A SATURDAY?    Oh and if you see my perspective running around, not playing nice with others and knocking children down, will you please, please, please have him give me a call.  He doesn't know it yet but he needs me just as much as I need him.  Perspective is quite the swell fellow, that is, when he's with you.

      All I asked for were some simple  urlLink suggestions  on where to go while visiting Vancouver, BC.  And the results?  Not a one.  Fine, be that way!  I know you're out there people.  It can't possibly be that you don't have any suggestions, can it?  Well, don't worry.  I didn't really want your stupid suggestions anyway.  And another thing!  Don't expect to see any photos or hear any wild tales about all the debauchery that was had this weekend.  I'm keeping it all to myself.    SERVES. YOU. RIGHT.   I'm sorry. I was upset.  I take it back.  I didn't really mean it.   So...any suggestions?  C'mon, don't make me beg.  It won't be pretty.

      So I went to google.com with hopes that I'd see a "Canada Day" version of the Google logo, you know, it being CANDADA DAY and all but no...no suck luck.  I'm sure they'll have a Fourth of July version (insert eye rolling here).  Listen up Google.  You can suck it.  I hate you.  P.S.  You still kick ass for searches.  P.P.S  I didn't really mean it.  I love you Google.  More than you'll ever know.  Who do those Canadians think they are anyways?   What's that Canada?  shhh...no, I didn't mean it, now keep it down before Google hears us...   P.P.P.S  Think you can hook me up with one of those gmail accounts?

      Okay folks.  It's time to face the challenge front and center right  urlLink here .  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go!  Bonus points if you can somehow manage to combine a starter, entree and desert all from the same section.  Don't know what the hell I'm talking about?  Well, that's because you didn't listen the first time and just go  urlLink here  already.  Now go!  P.S. If that doesn't float your boat,  urlLink Nordy's is having a huge sale .  If one were so inclined they could buy lots of cute skirts and shirts for cheap, well comparatively cheap...not that I'm so inclined...even though I totally am.  I'm a bad, bad girl.

      So last Saturday while en route to a free travel class up in Edmonds put on by none other than  urlLink Rick Steves  I drove by the mother of all pancake houses.  Lordy, lordy.  I had the best sourdough  urlLink pancakes  EVER.  Hold the maple.  Pass the butter.   urlLink    You know it's good when there's an ambulance hauling away an old person out front.  That's how I wanna go out.    Seriously, there were TWO ambulances and they really were hauling some old person out.  I had to sneak this photo on the sly because his wife or sister or whatever was outside the ambulance and I didn't want to be completely insensitive just snapping away in the face of tragedy.  I think did a pretty good job framing considering that I didn't have time to look through the viewfinder or even steady the camera.  Bravo to me.  Give me my props.

      My friend Danny bought himself a house this weekend.  I, for one, didn't even realize he was in looking until I was invited to dinner at his current rental house in celebration.  Man, can that boy cook!  I don't think I need to tell you that it totally rocks to have a friend who is a professional chef.      It's fair to say I'm coveting  urlLink his purchase  so fiercely, I could very well be solely responsible for the weather heating up to a near 90 degree misery today.   Lessons learned this weekend:  1) Mustard is best summed up simply "spice and funk" as in "Would you like some  spice and funk  on your dog or are you completely lame and going to cover it in ketcup?"  2) Spagetti Squash is appropriately named because once cooked the squash seperates into spagetti like threads of goodness.  3) When you call your friend on your cellphone and get her voicemail and leave her a message telling her to call you back if she wants to come over and join the party you shouldn't, I repeat SHOULD NOT, then put your cellphone back in your purse and return to the other room.  Otherwise, if she does call back (which she will) you won't get the message until right before you leave as you're picking up your purse on the way out the door and by then, obviously, it's too late.  Sorry Misty!  4) When traveling in Europe, it's best to  urlLink pack light .  I was so struggling with this one until I came to the realization that I would either have to carry around whatever I needed or buy it there.  Dude!  I'm all about buying it there.   5) If you go to REI expecting to find practical shoes for walking around Europe that are also cute, you're going to be sorely dissappointed.  REI doesn't do cute.  6) Bǿrn makes a  urlLink shoe they call Jeopardy .  Come to mama.

I still stand behind that rant 110%, even though, if I'm going to be honest, I think it's mentally defective when people say they're standing behind something above and beyond the full capacity of 100%, you know, just to prove how committed they are to something...but what can I say?  I'm an enigma.    The point is  urlLink Lee  posted this killer picture of the  urlLink Plant Lady at The Seattle Library .  Now  THAT  is a Plant Lady I could get behind!

      Two Things.  Quickly.    One. I just heard a song on the  urlLink KEXP  by The Killers called Smile Like You Mean It and it makes me want to run out and buy the whole album, Hot Fuss.    Two.  When I got to work I immediately tried to search for this song on  urlLink allmusic.com  and was surprised to see they had changed the format.  Now, apparently, you have to login to access the information (slightly annoying) but once logged in you have access to more functionality (awesome!), including sample tracks (double awesome!).

      I just spent a good 15 minutes roaming around my office building with the sales labtop hoisted high above my head desperately looking for a decent WiFi signal.  I finally found one in the hallway that converges at 3, count 'em three!, doors.  I figured I could just sneak into one of those offices and be okay, but nooooooo, the labtop wasn't having any of that because as soon as I sat down like a normal person at a desk the signal dropped back down to low.  Screw it.  I'll just work on something else.  Besides I really wasn't planning on getting anything done today anyways.  I mean, what do they expect?  Serving me up spiked punch with lunch!  Seriously, that's like a free pass with "No work required by you shall be completed today" written ALL OVER IT (in crayons no less!).  Note to self: Don't put the sales labtop briefcase right by your chair or you'll trip over it (again).  Yeah that, or simply don't drink at work.  As if.  P.S. I just emailed myself the article I've been working on for going on two plus weeks now with the following subject line:  "YOU MUST WORK ON THIS!  NO, I'M SERIOUS! :("     Man, I'm pathetic.  It's so not going to happen.

      Here I am once again.  Trapped in the same vicious cycle of sleeplessness and worrying and thinking TOO DAMN MUCH.  Kids, don't try this at home.  No matter what your parents and teachers and friends and the government tells you, ESPECIALLY the government, thinking is normally not very productive.  In fact, thinking is totally overrated.  Think about how much people could get accomplished if they just stopped thinking about stuff so much and starting actually doing all that stuff they've been thinking about.  Yes, yes, I realize I just asked you to think about that.  I'm quite the conundrum, aren't I?  Anyways, I don't really believe thinking is overrated.  My point is my body is tired but my mind is too busy thinking to respond properly.  I thought I'd be able to think of something witty to wrap this up, but I can't because the irony is I'm tired and therefore unable to think properly yet not tired enough to stop all thinking and just go to bed already.  Whatever.  Goodnight.    Clearly I'll be up for at least another hour thinking about how much this post stinks among other things.  Life's rough.  [sigh]

Apparently those that live on the dole get to go on long extended vacations, sleep in until noon, watch all the cable they want and often wait until 10.30pm (on weekdays!) to call people up and invite them out for cocktails.    I wish I was liv'n on the dole.

       urlLink    Today is Danny's birthday.  Last  night, in honor of the occasion we dined at The Palace Kitchen.   urlLink    I* am coveting Danny's birthday presents so fiercely my glare quite possibly ignited a forest fire; perhaps even multiple forest fires.  But seriously, who doesn't love birthday presents.  Give them to  me !  All of them!   urlLink    Because there was some serious drinking involved, it kind of slipped my mind that I should get at least one good group shot.  As you can see this didn't happened.  By the way, don't ask.  I have  no  idea.   urlLink    Apparently after a cosmo and a couple glasses of red wine I like to tap dance in the street.   urlLink    What a bunch of asses!   Okay, that was bad I realize but how could I resist?    urlLink    And, of course, the manatory obligatory shot of my feet.  Once we finished up dinner and after much drunken debating in the street, it was decided we would meet up at Aaron's house and drown ourselves in his yummy hot tub. While we did indeed soak in said tub, few pictures were taken there mostly because we were preoccupied by all the drinking.  That, and we were in a hot tub and I don't know if you've heard or not but electronics and water decidedly do not mix.  We did, however, figure out that mixing Gatorade with Vodka isn't half bad (according to some).  I passed on that though.  I've already got my quota of retardolites thank you very much.   I could tell what happened on into the wee hours of the morning, but then I'd have to kill you or rather if I told you, most likely, you'd die...of boredom.  Let's just say the conversation included an angry drunken debate about football players and their worth or lack thereof depending on your perspective, the Democratic Convention, Justin Timberlake and plans around our trip to Europe among other things**.    *I am the one in Pink! suprise, suprise. **I wish I was being coy.  I'm not.  I really don't remember what else we talked about but I'm sure it was very, very funny.  Truly.  My friends are quite funny but because I don't remember any specifics you're just going to have to trust me on this one.
