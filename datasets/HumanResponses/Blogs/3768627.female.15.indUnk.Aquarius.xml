      My first step into the world of Blogger.  My livejournal is just to read and comment on others.  This...this is me.  My hopes...  My fears...  My dreams...  Once before I tried to trust, and found my dreams shattered.  Even as the glass rose exploded outwards, glass shards flying everywhere, glittering in the light till it seems a thousand stars fell from the sky...  I found it beautiful.  And now, once more, I set forth my hopes and dreams. Intact they are wonderous, in progress they gleam, and broken they are beautiful.  Help them break or help them grow, that is your choice.  If I could have only one thing, it would be the power to change. People will not agree with me; in fact, most people do not. But if one thing could happen, it would be everyone who reads this learns something. They may not agree with my views. But I hope they take away an increased understanding of another person's perspective.

      I just wanted to say thank you...    Took a good hard look at myself today.    Despite the fact that I’ve been with Sothis all weekend, I’ve felt horribly alone. I’ve been feeling ill. And worthless. And even as life looks better for me, even as I’m gaining these new friends and supporters, I’m being pulled down into a vortex of despair.    And it’s of my own making.    Everything’s weighing down on me. I’ve taken on so much. Did I really think I could do it all? I can’t seem to find the time or energy to work on anything, and there’s so much I’ve devoted time to. I seem to be lurking on messengers and chatting,a nd that’s all I do anymore.    My two Pern RPGs, EvenStar and Fallen Stars. They’re both wonderful places, wonderful people. Last few months it’s been post post post, lots of stories coming out, especially ebtween me and Jade and me and Heather and me and Sunrose. They’re three amazing ladies, and Michele’s been awesome too. Through July, though, it’s been blah, don’t want to post. I’m letting them all down...    Then there are the projects I’m working on. Warped is kind of dead, and I’m not ploting to help with it, I just haveta tell iPenguin. Now Ilathid... Ilathid is an incredible game, incredible. And I have a pretty good role in it too. Important enough for me. I’m so glad Sivrehn let me in. He’s such a nice person, helping me whenever I’m down, cutting me a lot of slack. i wish I could give more to the project.    Then there’s Avriga. I love it dearly. The places and peoples and...it’s becoming my world, slowly. I’ve sunk so much into this, used everything I’ve got. Am combining the mythologies of so many of my previous stories, giving it a richness and a broadness (I hope) that it deserves.    But it’s also been my downfall. I threw so much into it that the fight I had with a certain person sapped me. I hated what it did to me. I can take criticism of the story for an actual problem, but not for something based soly on a biased, extremist belief. i know many people who hold the same/similar beliefs and weren’t as judgemental and biased. And they didn’t shove their beliefs down my throat.    I was wrecked by that incident. I’m not sure if I’m fully over it, or if I’m ever going to be fully over it. But I’m writing for Avriga again, which is a good thing. It no longer really hurts to read the writings. There are still times when I can’t continue with the story, but they are few and far between. I’m determined not to let this universe die.    Then of course there’s the most important thing. All of you. The Myst community. The Lysts, DPWR, MC, and CC have so many wonderful people there. They’re supportive. They’re communicative. They’re people I can laugh with, debate with, and share myself with. And I know they’ll understand.    They’re becoming my world.    For so long I’ve been trying to keep my on and off-line worlds from converging. In real life I’d be one person, and online I’d be Capella (or Yoake, for the Pernese gang). But lately it’s been so hard to keep them seperate.    The line’s blurring until I don’t know who I am at any given time anymore.    At first it unnerved me, but then I realized ikt’s okay. Why should I be keeping my two lives seperate? Why should I act like one person in real life and be a completely different person on the net?    Okay, so maybe my deliberate harshness and coldness in real life is based on my circumstances, and it’s what I have to do to make it. But what would happen if I let that Elyse go? What if I blended her with the hyper-er, looser, more outgoing and talkative and hyper and more sensitive and caring and a (kind of) better person, Capella, that I am online?    Whenever I’m chatting with people from the Myst communities, an awful lot of them compliment me. Say how much they like my works, how nice I am, how considerate, how much fun I am to talk to, etc. It’s a strange feeling, because I never get that in real life. I’m sure they’d hate the person I am in real life. But they seem to like the me I am on the internet (who’s closer to the true me than my ‘real’ me).    There have been times I’ve felt like nothing’s going to go right and felt like doing something drastic. But someone always signs on or messanges me around then. and they’ll say something, and I’ll realize that hey, it’s not so bad after all.    This community’s given me so much. A place to discuss, debate, and share without anyone being autiomatically prejudiced. A place where I can be accepted as who I am, instad of what I look like  and where I fit in an artificial social hierarchy. A place where I can belong when I don’t have one in real life.    And there are a few special people I want to thank (not by name, but I think they’ll know who they are). A crazy-n-fun person, a musician, a dreamer, a writer, a programmer, a fellow (decent) compy geek, and a real life friend. For believing in me, for encouraging me,  for giving me a reason to go on, and for slapping me when I need it.    Thank you ALL, and I love you all.
