      I don't know exactly what Wombok is. This the limit of my understanding so far:  1) It's some sort of green vegetable, possibly similar to cabbage. 2) There's a big box of it sitting outside my door. I know it's Wombok because it says so on the box. 3) After a few days, it smells quite unpleasant.   The Chinese students that live in the apartment next door must have some kind of use for it. I'm assuming that if it was rubbish they would take it downstairs to the bin. In the six days it's been sitting in the hallway, though, it has not been tended to in any way, as far as I can tell - it just sits there, rotting, ignored by all (except, of course, me). I could throw it away myself, but that would be an admission of defeat. The Wombok must not win.

      Since this is my first post ever, I'm going to share a little bit about myself. You know, so you can get to know me. I live in the city of Brisbane, Australia, and find it quite satisfactory here. I am 22 years old and thus in the prime of my life, which is a slightly depressing thought. I live with my girlfriend in a small apartment in the city, and eke out a comfortable but modest living as a debt collector. I ring people and tell them to pay their debts, they yell at me, I collect my pay cheque, and I go home. My girlfriend is studying to be a clever scientist (a proper scientist, not a 'social' scientist like my degree says). Hopefully it will be a while before she realises she's too good for me. My mum thinks I'm handsome, but then she also thinks my dad's handsome. My mum is probably wrong, but that doesn't matter because I have reasonably good self-esteem. I like curry, among other things. Today I'm not at work because I'm sick, so I'm going to go and eat some toast and then have a lie down.

      Last night, Kristina and I stayed up decorating the wall in our living room with photos from our time in Montreal. That's where we met (more accurately, we met on a plane somewhere in between Vancouver and Montreal). We were both going on a study abroad program - her from Adelaide University, me from University of Queensland - and we were both going to McGill University. Well, over the next couple of months, one thing led to another, we ended up moving in together, and so on. Just a crazy little thing called love, I guess. But that year in Montreal, 2001, was all a great big adventure, and I can't wait to go back. We've got a big trip planned at the end of this year, if all goes well. Long live the snows of a French Canadian winter!

      Have you ever seen a yowie? I haven't, but I have undertaken some cursory research on the subject on the Internet. From what I understand, yowies are like sasquatches or yetis - giant man-like apes that lurk in forests and mountains, leave great big footprints behind and are sometimes seen by park rangers and hillbilles, but have never been proven to exist. Nobody really knows exactly what yowies are or what they do, only that they seem to be a mysterious species preserved since ancient times, untouched by human progress. Like the Governor-General. Yowies, however, are also said to be covered from head to toe with coarse hair, emit a foul odour and have a voracious sexual appetite. Kind of like your mama.

      On Friday night, I was out with my girlfriend Kristina and two friends, John and Brenda. As is the fashion among today's young people, we were drinking. We ended up at a small, trendy bar called the Bowery, and were happily enjoying the atmosphere when a very drunk fellow approached our table. Let's call hin 'Dan Lightfoot', because that's his name. 'Dan' introduced himself by saying "I'm very rich and famous", over and over again. Eventually, satisfied that none of us had the faintest clue who he was, he informed us that he was a famous fashion designer. He then began to unbutton his shirt and gyrate in front of us, periodically taking swigs from a bottle of champagne. We watched this little show for a while, as Dan's female companion (obviously just a friend, possibly some sort of fashion editor or something) draped herself over several young men in the bar. She was wearing quite a nice fur coat and seemed to be just as drunk as our new friend 'Dan'. It was well into the wee hours of Saturday morning by now, and we decided that going home was probably the best option. John and Brenda decided to stay, and as we left they were engrossed in deep conversation with 'Dan' and his female companion. I saw John when we played soccer on Sunday but I forgot to ask him how the rest of the night went. We should have stuck around, it's not every day that a minor celebrity takes his shirt off and dances suggestively at your table.
