      Well, it has been a long time since I posted, huh? Last week went by so fast! Work was crazy with phones ringing off the hook all day long, every single day of the week!!! Friday night Jeremy and I just stayed at home and watched  Second Hand Lions.  It's a great movie! If you haven't seen it, you must check it out.  &nbsp;  Saturday, we traveled around Montgomery taking pictures of the cool churches we have here, as well as some of the government buildings. We thought we should have pictures of it for our scapbook, since we may possibly move away in the future sometime (no plans for that right now).  &nbsp;  Also, we wanted to check our camera before heading off on vacation at the end of this month to South Carolina. I can't wait! It's going to be a lot of fun. We are traveling through Columbia, Charleston, and lots of other great towns in SC. We will be staying at bed and breakfast inns all the way...cool, huh? Hopefully, we can figure out how to post pictures on this site so we can share them with you.  &nbsp;  I will be off work tomorrow. Yeah! I am going to go to the airport with my parents to pick up my sister and brother-in-law. They live in the United Arab Emirites (he teaches Architecture at an American University there and she does Public Relations stuff for the University). They will be home for about a month visiting family and friends. I am so excited to see her! We only get to see them once a year. The plan is to pick them up, take them out to lunch somewhere here in Montgomery, and spend some time with them in the afternoon. They will be staying with my parents in Evergreen, AL for most of the time they are here...so Jeremy and I will have to make several trips to my hometown on the weekends to see them.  &nbsp;  Tonight we have plans to go to our Lifegroup (small group&nbsp;that meets once a&nbsp;week to talk about God)&nbsp;through Evangel Temple AOG. Right now, we are studying  The Case for Christ , by Lee Strobel.&nbsp;It is a pretty cool book about all the evidence surrounding the life/death/resurrection of Jesus.   Well, I have to run...my break time at work is officially over.

      Well, now that the debate is over, I decided to remove all the&nbsp; contact numbers for our senators. It takes up a lot of room on the site! However, I thought I would still leave the info by Dr. James Dobson and websites you may check out in regards to God-ordained Marriage.  &nbsp;  ____________________________________  11 Arguments Against Same Sex Marriage by Dr. James Dobson   1. The legalization of homosexual marriage will quickly destory the traditional family.   2.Children will suffer most.   3.Public schools in every state will embrace homosexuality.   4. Adoption laws will be obsolete.   5.Foster-care programs will be impacted dramatically.   6.The health care system will stagger and perhaps collapse.   7.Social Security will be severly stressed.   8.Religious freedom will almost certainly be jeopardized.   9. Other nations are watching our march towards homosexual marriage and will follow our lead.   10.The gospel of Jesus Christ will be severly curtailed.   11.The culture war will be over, and the world may soon become "as it was in the days of Noah" (Matt. 24:37). Every nation in history that has embraced homosexuality has soon after been destroyed. Look at the Roman Empire, look at Sodom, look at the days of Noah!   ____________________________________  Places to "Get the Facts"---More Information   Website with several links to the Marriage Debate:  www.family.org/cforum/fosi/marriage/ssuap/   Link to Marriage Under Fire book by Dr. James Dobson:  www.marriageunderfire.com/index_flash.aspx   Letter from Senator John Cornyn Regarding Need to Protect Marriage:  www.protectmarriagesunday.com/DOMADearColleague.html   Talking Points Defending Traditional Marriage:  www.nogaymarriage.com/talkingpoints.html   What's Wrong with Letting Same-Sex Couples "Marry?":  www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IF03H01   What Homosexual "Marriage" Will Mean to America's Children:  www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=33660   Frequently Asked Questions:  http://family.org/cforum/fosi/marriage/FAQs/a0026916.cfm

      I really was not going to post today, but since my Dad requested me to do so, here goes:  Dinner last night at Chris & Fran's was great! Fran, I know you read this, you did an aWeSoMe job with the veggie lasagna...please give me the recipe! You can post it on this site in the comments if you want, then everyone who reads this can enjoy the same marvelous dish I did.  Jeremy and I had a great time as greeters at church today. Sunday School was great as usual. We are going through the book, "Contagious Christian" right now (really good---check it out).  I spent the rest of the afternoon catching up on my studies. I am working on my credentials to be a licensed minister with the Assemblies of God. I believe I am called to be a Youth Pastor or College Campus Pastor one day, wherever God leads. So far, I have completed 2 classes: "How to Study the Bible Inductively" & "The Life of Jesus Christ". Currently, I am studying "The 16 Fundamental Truths of the Assemblies of God". I am having a great time and learning a lot. It just takes awhile to complete the classes when you work a full time job.  Well, anyway, so the weekend is over...

      Ok, so this title isn't very original. Anyway, not much to talk about today except breakfast. I cooked Jeremy & I fresh blueberry waffles and cheese eggs with salsa for brunch. Yum!   My parents brought us the blueberries last weekend when they came up to visit us (from Evergreen, AL)for the 4th of July weekend. Saturday we all just lazed around during the day, but we had a huge fish fry that night. Jeremy's parents, brother, and brother's girlfriend came over for that. The menu included: fried catfish & bream, fajita fries, coleslaw, hushpuppies, grilled eggplant (really good...I was surprised b/c I don't usually like it), peach cobbler w/ ice cream, and better than anything else cake. We were all stuffed!  Sunday, my parents went to church with us at Evangel Temple Assembly of God. It's an awesome church you should check out if you are ever in Montgomery. That night we went to a Biscuits Baseball Game at the new Riverwalk Stadium. After the Biscuits won, we got to enjoy a HUGE display of fireworks.  Monday we all went to Smokey Bones(my favorite restaurant here in Montgomery, I believe) and enjoyed some great BBQ. I had the smoked pulled pork platter with homemade mashed potatoes & gravy, garlic bread, and cinnamon apples.  Well, that's enough talk about eating food. Isn't that what you do during the holidays though? :o)  Now Jeremy & I have to get back on our diet...we were doing Weight Watchers. It's hard to keep it up though during holidays.

      Well, here we go! I have contracted the blog fever from my sister, Amanda (a.k.a. Manny).  I don't know where to start exactly, so I will just comment on today. It's Friday!!! I have been on the phone all day and I just want to go home! I work in a call center.  I think my husband and I are just going to veg-out in front of the television tonight. We have both had our share of stress from working with the public this week. He works in a call center too. :o)  Saturday night we are going over to a friends house for dinner. Lasagna,mmmmmmmmmm! Sunday we will praise the Lord and greet people. It will be our first Sunday on the Hospitality Team at church...lots of shaking hands, hugs, and passing literature out. :o)  Well, I am going to go for now...about 45 mins til I can go home!

      I realized that I have not posted my latest news yet.  I have a new job!  Many of you already knew that I would be losing my job with the bank soon due to a merger with another company (approximately 450 people will loose their jobs from this). Anyhow, God really blessed me with an AWESOME new career! I will now be teaching a Drama Class for high school students at our church's Christian academy. I will also be the Aftercare Director for the students who stay at the church after school. I will bascially be working half-days every day, so that will give me extra time for my Berean classes, which will hopefully provide a quicker path for me to get into Youth Ministry and eventually, College Ministry. The new career will also be great ministry experience for the future. Jeremy and I are so excited about this opportunity!!!  Praise God, To Him Be All The Glory!

      Well, we got back from our South Carolina vacation last Saturday...I have been way too busy to post until now! So, here's a breakdown of the trip...where we went, what cool things we did/saw, and the awesome food!  07/24 We left early that morning and headed for the Pendleton/Clemson area of S.C. It took us 3 1/2 hrs. to get to that first stop. Once there, we started our trip by visiting Issaqueena Falls, Stumphouse Tunnel, Oconee Station State Historic Site, and Split Creek Goat Dairy Farm. We got to try all kinds of goat cheeses (strawberry, peach, herbed, etc.) and goat fudge. It was all really tasty!After all the fun, we headed to our first Bed and Breakfast...Liberty Hall Inn in Pendleton. The two story Southern Plantation (featured in Southern Living) has wrap around verandahs and dates circa 1840. There is a full service restaurant included on the first floor, Cafe Leisure, which we ate at that night. I had a wonderful steak rubbed with pepper and a side of mashed potatoes. Jeremy had yellow fin tuna and rice. Both meals came with steamed veggies, fresh bread, and sweet tea. Superb! Our room was beautiful! Wooden floors, deep red paint on the walls, antique furniture, king-size bed, private bath, old rocker, huge comfy chair, nice paintings, and so much more!  07/25 Breakfast was magnificient! We had omelets, biscuits, and fresh fruit. I have to mention the breakfasts, since we did stay at Bed and Breakfast places.We visited Clemson University (they are known for their great ice cream and it was great), Hagood Mill, S.C. Botanical Gardens (which included a geology museum, discovery center, butterfly garden, etc.), Old Stone Church, Pendleton Village Green, Ashtabula Plantation, and we drove around various little towns in the area. Visiting Clemson Universtiy was like going to Auburn University. We felt at home! They are tigers too, so why not? We think Clemson might be a great place for us to start a Chi Alpha Ministry in the future. :o) That night we ate at a Mellow Mushroom that was built inside of an old plantation-style house. It was quite an experience!  07/26 We visited the S.C. Botanical Gardens again and finished up seeing the place (it's huge). Then we headed on to Columbia, S.C. Once there, our first stop was the Riverbanks Zoo. All the animals lived in their simulated natural habitats. We saw penguins, elephants, tigers, monkeys, you name it! The zoo also had their own lovely gardens and aquarium. It was a great way to spend the afternoon.After leaving the zoo, we checked into our next Bed and Breakfast, The 1425 Inn. Our room had a king-size bed, antique furniture, whirpool, etc. They also provided a spa/bath gift bag and featured a turn down service with chocolates! The inn was a beautiful two-story home and was close enough for us to walk to everything we visited. The family that lived in the house and ran the place was so nice. We felt like we were at home!That night, we went to the Carolina Wings & Rib House. Jeremy said those were the best wings he had ever had. My ribs were delicious as well...I finished them off before he ever started on his food! Gotta love the S.C. BBQ!  07/27 We visited the campus of USC, toured 2 of the Historic Columbia Foundation Houses (1. Home of Robert Mills, the architect who designed the Washington Monument and other famous structures 2. Woodrow Wilson's boyhood home), and we visited the State House.That night we ate Greek food...we gotta have it!  07/28 We had some awesome Caramel French toast on this morning! I will have to get the recipe from the family that ran the place. We visited Trinity Episcopal and St. Peter's Catholic church...2 of the historic churches in the city. Then we headed on to Charleston!When we arrived in Charleston, the 1837 Bed and Breakfast had homemade strawberry shortcake waiting on us! Mmmm! At this inn, we stayed in the Carriage House. There was a nice king-size bed, private bath, antique furniture, and the walls were made of brick like they would have been back in the days. It was cool! We ate at Queen Anne's Revenge that night, a Pirate-themed restaurant...they even had real pirate artifacts (swords, daggers, pieces of eight, etc. that were found at the bottom of the ocean). After dinner, we drove around Daniel Island. They have a really cool planned community there (where you can walk to everything...school, dentist, grocery store, etc.).  07/29 On this morning, we had raspberry french toast. It melted in your mouth! That's how good it was!We went on a carriage tour through Charleston, visited the Old City Market, and went to Summerville to visit some of Jeremy's cousins. They cooked out for us and we had a great time!  07/30 We visited numerous churches throughout Charleston, saw Rainbow Row and Cabbage Row, toured Middleton Plantation, played in the pineapple fountain at Waterfront Park, walked along the Historic Battery, visited a few of the islands nearby, and did some shopping in the Old City Market as well as some of the downtown shops.  07/31 I had Sausage Pie for breakfast this morning. All I can say is, oh my goodness! This is another one I need a recipe for!Our last day in Charleston, we visited the Nathaniel-Russell House (famous merchant). This was probably the most beautiful home we had been in on the trip. Parts of the ceiling designs were done in 14-K Gold and everything was so detailed. The colors in the home were bright and beautiful. The gardens outside were lovely.Our last stop in Charleston was at the famous Sticky Fingers restaurant. I got the dry rub ribs and they were so tasty! We ended our meal with peach cobbler and ice cream! Mmmm!It took us about 8 hrs to get home from Charleston! We were so tired, but we did stop in Auburn to see a couple of friends before we got home.  We have tons of pictures! Hopefully, I can figure out how to put them all on here soon. We had a wonderful time an we can't wait to go back again. You have to visit South Carolina! Who knows? Maybe we will live there some day! :o)
