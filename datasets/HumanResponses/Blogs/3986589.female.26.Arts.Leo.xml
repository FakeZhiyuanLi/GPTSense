         Hey everybody, as you all  can see this is my blog! Just for those things in life I thought it would be funy to make it! Ha! I dunno if I'm going to write very often but my intention is to do it! Many times we stay quiet and the only thing that calms our spirit, many times hurt by those stupid things in life... is to talk to somebody... but also to put in words what we feel calm down those damn feelings, that makes us feel good and other feel like hell... that's why I think I start this thing today... Today us the friendship day in Argentina, it's a thing quite celebrated here... a chance to be with your friends... but sometimes you can't be with them... because they are far away or life just took them away... Finally, happy friendship day to all my friends, a hug, a word, a telephone call, a smile, a nice gesture, a hello, an emoticon... that's what they all mean to me... luv you and I luv 'cause you are authentic, don't change... Hasta pronto! Até logo! See ya soon!

        urlLink        Tryin' to say I'm sorry  Didn't mean to break your heart  And find you waitin'up by the light of day   There's alot I want to tell you  But I don't know where to start  And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away   ooh, baby I tried to make it  i just got lost along the way   chorus  'Cause every time i look at you  No matter what I'm goin' thru  It's easy to see  And every time I hold you  The things I never told you  Seem to come easily  'Cause you're everything to me   Yeah   I never really wanted  To let you get inside my heart  I wanted to believe this would soon be ending  I thought it wouldn't matter  If it all just came apart  But, now I realized I was just pretending   Ooh, baby, I know I hurt you  But you can still believe in me   chorus  'Cause, every time I look at you  No matter what I'm goin' thru  It's easy to see  And every time I hold you  The things I never told you  Seem to come easliy,  'Cause your everything to me   It's gonna take a little time to show you  Just what you mean to me, oh yeah  It seems the more I get to know you  The more I need to make you see, you're everything I need, yeah   I need ya I need ya I need ya I need ya  Baby baby I know I hurt you  But you can still believe in me  'Cause, every time I look at you  No matter what I'm goin' thru  It's easy to see  And every time I hold you  The things I never told you  Seems to come easily  'Cause your every thing to me   Every thing to me  You're everything to me       This is song by Kiss, I found it by chance... It's a great song and tells so many things I want to tell you, baby... And it's for you... always for you... :)   Posted by  your girl

           Today I'm not feeling fine... my year hasn't begun so good as I wanted to be... A lot of people stood me up last night... I'm not angry or anything just disappointed... I just wanted to celebrate my birthday! My best friend of all times was there, and I was soooooo glad that she came, we had soooo much fun! Thanks, Flor! You are my best friend in&nbsp;my whole world! I remember the first day we meet, we were so little, now it's been like 20 years of an incredible friendship! Luv ya gurl! I'm so happy for ya, you found the love of your life and you are going to spend the rest of your life with him! You make a great couple! I luv ya both! Thanks for last night! Thanks for all the laughters, the good times, the sad times, the fun times... I'm always here for ya! I'm honoured... soooooooooo honoured that you want me to design your wedding dress! It made me really happy when you ask me to! You rock girl!          Finally, where are you? I just wanna hear my celphone ring... and to know that it's you... and that you still care... I wanna believe that you couldn't call... but I'm starting to... doubt... will you call today?... hope still remains...

        urlLink        Well, here I am again... This picture was taken by someone really special to me and very close to my heart... Today I got a new job doing costumes for a play... I'm quite happy about it! Yay! This is going to be my second job as a professional, and it's so close to my first! I hope things keep going like that! Eventhough that was great,&nbsp; something else really made my day... he tried to call and he send me messages to my celphone... that really made my day... I was sad about it for a moment, thinking that he forgot about me and he was not interested in me... but surprisingly enough I didnt believe that at all, I was quite calm about it! This time I didnt overthink it! That's pretty awesome for me... I always think too much about things... And he call me amore... that makes my heart beat fast... So this was an awesome&nbsp;day, I know that it could be better, but for the moment was pretty great! I think I'm going to sleep, I'm tired, I have to do some things for tomorrow... I want to fall asleep thinking about him... I still love you, leãozinho... forever! My hope still remains...      Posted by   Little AngEL

         Well, I spent a few days without writing... I've been too busy actually and when I had some spare time... to tell the truth I didn't feel like it! But well, here I am again... have some good news and some that I don't actually want to talk about them... love life... I better not discuss it... though I still feel the same way... I better leave it like that for the moment... Maybe he needs some time, maybe I do too...

        urlLink        Si ayer tuviste un día gris, tranquilo, yo haré canciones para ver si así consigo hacerte sonreír Si lo que quieres es huir, camina, yo haré canciones para ver, si así consigo fuerzas pa' vivir  No tengo más motivos para darte que éste miedo que me da de no volver a verte nunca más..  Creo ver la lluvia caer, en mi ventana te veo pero no está lloviendo, no es más que un reflejo de mi pensamiento hoy te echo de menos Yo sólo quiero hacerte saber amigo estés donde estés que si te falta el aliento yo te lo daré... Si te sientes solo hablame que te estaré escuchando aunque no te pueda ver aunque no te pueda ver...  De tantas cosas que perdí, diría que solo guardo lo que fue mágico tiempo que nacío en abril Miradas tristes sobre mí se anidan y se hacen parte de mi piel y ahora siempre llueve por que estoy sin ti..  No tengo más motivos para darte que esta fría soledad que necesito darte tantas cosas más  Creo ver la lluvia caer, en mi ventana te veo pero no está lloviendo, no es más que un reflejo de mi pensamiento hoy te echo de menos Yo sólo quiero hacerte saber amigo estés donde estés que si te falta el aliento yo te lo daré... Si te sientes solo hablame que te estaré escuchando aunque no te pueda ver aunque no te pueda ver...

        urlLink         I'm tired of being what you want me to be, Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface, I don't know what you're expecting of me, Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes.  Caught in the undertow Just caught in the undertow Every step that I take is Another mistake to you. Caught in the undertow Just caught in the undertow  I've become so numb, I can't feel you there, Become so tired, So much more aware, I'm becoming this, All I want to do, Is be more like me, And be less like you.  Can't you see that your smothering me, Holding too tightly Afraid to lose control, 'Cause everything that you thought I would be, Has fallen apart, right in front of you.  Caught in the undertow Just caught in the undertow Every step that I take is Another mistake to you. Caught in the undertow Just caught in the undertow And every second I waste Is more than I can take.  I've become so numb, I can't feel you there, Become so tired, So much more aware, I'm becomming this, All I want to do, Is be more like me, And be less like you.  And I know I may end up failing too, But I know you were just like me, With someone disappointed in you.  I've become so numb, I can't feel you there, Become so tired, So much more aware, I'm becomming this, All I want to do, Is be more like me, And be less like you.  I've become so numb, I can't feel you there, I'm tired of being what you want me to be.  I've become so numb, I can't feel you there, I'm tired of being what you want me to be.

        urlLink        Hey... well... here I am again... I'm doing OK, I'm better actually... nothing has change though... *time has freezed*... Everything is just there, I dunno what to feel actually... the only thing that comes to mind is to W4!T... dunno if it's going to be good or worse... but for the moment and 'cause my friend advised me to, I'm going to do that... my feelings are the same... I'm happy... not totally happy, I have good things in my life, a loving family, my friends, *€dd!€* you know how much I care about you, *SOlC!tO* I miss you so much, and my best friends, *MY G!RL$* (Flopy & Yanina) that are there for me anytime I need them and *MY DUcK!€*, I luv you like I luv life, you are so close to my heart... you are the B€$T! And you *MY L€ãOZ!NhO*, I still love you... you don't know how special you are... think positive, and you will get anything your heart desires...    Sweet AngEL
