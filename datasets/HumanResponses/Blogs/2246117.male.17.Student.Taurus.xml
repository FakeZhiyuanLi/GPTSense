      Not a big fan of pop music.. at all, but I happen to really like this song. yeah, bite me.  "I was naive, your love was like candy artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed I was prey in your bed and devoured completely  And it hurts my soul cause I can't let go All these walls are caving in, I can't stop my sufferin' I hate to show that I lost control Cause I keep going right back  To the one thing that I need To walk away from..."

      Like any stereotypical teen, I cannot get along with my parents. At all. Ever. We co-exist perfectly when we don't see each other, which is how I like it.  Today was not one of those days in which I could completely avoid them.  And it all started with one minor quirk about hair. Hair! Of all things. I mean, if they had caught me having sex or something (not that I am, but the example still stands) at least that would be a decent issue to get upset over.  ... But hair? Please.   For any of you who has seen a picture of me, I have my hair dyed an unnatural blood red shade. Well, it's turing a sort of pinkish-orange shade now, but I digress.  The matter is, my parents have all their relatives and extended family back in China. They're planning on the three of us taking a trip there, in order to visit old friends and relatives. I'm not exactly thrilled with the idea of going there, but I don't really mind it. My parents don't want me to go back with red hair. They want me to dye it black.. Well, I wanted to go away to college with green hair, or another exciting color, so I don't want to dye it black, since that'd be a bitttttch to bleach out.  They threatened to just leave me here and go back themselves. It would be completely fine with me, actually, *IF* the plane tickets weren't bought yet. Instead, it would be a ridiculous waste of money, and I just couldn't allow myself to be the cause of such much waste.  We were trying to compromise, and finally agree that I'll do my hair a medium brown. It's supposed to be all fine and dandy, right?  Right?  Wrong.  Very, very wrong.  My dad says, "IF HE'S GOING TO DO IT BROWN, HE MAY AS WELL STAY HERE." And I had thought we had reached a fucking compromise.  What. the. hell.  Why must they do this to me?

      The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared. And in your place an empty space Has filled the void behind my face.  I just made love with your sweet memory, One thousand times in my head. You said you loved it more than ever, You said...  You remain, turned away. Turning further everyday.  I talked for hours to your wallet photograph And you just listened. You laughed enchanted by my intellect Or maybe you didn't...  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared. And in your place an empty space  Has filled the void behind my face.   Do you believe what I sing now?

      .. is going to fall off from all this damn coloring.  I feel like I should rant, but I'm too paranoid about the wrong people reading this thing.

      Never involve yourself in something so deeply that its failure could cost you your happiness.  Why do I keep on forgetting?  *Sighs*
