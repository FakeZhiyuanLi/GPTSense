      Why do people lie just to gain someones trust? Isn`t that an oxymoron? Moron being the keyword....  Oh..by the way...those of you that think a description of yourself will suffice..instead of a real pic...it doesn`t b/c what you perceive as sexy, attractive or fine...another may not...at least with a photo it allows the viewer to decide... Just my thought...

      5-22-04 Thanks for the notes in response to my question! At the request of Just-Chillyn - the question should read: Why are married men and women on BP seeking someone to creep with on and offline?  Oh..and another question: Why do men/women jump into marriage with their mate without really knowing that person, as the marriage progress, they accuse their mate of changing..but actually, they have not changed - you are just beginning to see the OTHER side of that individual? Remember in time you will learn more and more about a person...hit me back with your comments!  5-21-04 Today`s thought: Sad but true..married men are on BP seeking women that are willing to *play* with them.....so I am asking..why? If this is you - hey I know alot of you hit my page..I check my page log - leave me a note and let me know why.....I am thinking of writing a journal on *Why Men Cheat Online* - Don`t worry I wont reveal your identity! ************************************* Responses: Male-1  There are those who are lost to the lust of their own flesh and no matter who they marry nothing will change, they will always cheat.  However there are those who seek relationships rooted in emotional content and at the same time do not wish to disturb their world for one reason or another.  I think if people want to creep they need to be up front with those they seek out. For obvious reason they can`t be straight-up with their sigficant other.  Some of us here are just seeking a love they can`t get at home, notice I said love not sex and I do knoe the difference. One of the most selfish things people do today is get a divorce. They forget the family, the children and move on because they`re not happy.  Most people who are seeking are hurt deep inside and are just looking for a way to feel better. Right or wrong they are hurting.  Not everybody is out to get laid.  Male-2  Hey I have read your page and perhaps you and I should collaberate. As for the question about married men and the time that they spend on the internet. I cannot answer, never having been married however. I will say that there are a reasonbale number of women that are using this vehicle also. Come on over to my page and tell me what you think about it. Take care.

      Afraid of Me?  Me: Why are you afraid of me? What is there to fear? You said that I was everything that you wanted in a woman. We talk about any and everything. You have said that we mesh well together. So, why are you afraid of me? Are you afraid that you may fall in love with me And not be able to control your feelings? Are  you afraid that I may hurt you, do you think think That this is a dream?  I am for real..I do exist..this is not  A dream –   Why are you afraid of me? You said that I seem to know what I want And I know how to express my feelings openly. Is that a bad thing? Tell me, why are you afraid of me?  I have assured you that I am not playing Games.  I am just a woman that has had time to think about what she wants in her man, from her   Man and with her man.  So, why are your afraid of me?    Him:  nice........yesIamafriadIwillfallinlovewithyouandwon'tbeabletocontrolmyself.......... andbecomingopentoyouineveryshapeformandfashionandgivingyouallofmeeverysingle thoughteverysinglewordeverysingletoucheverysinglefeelingyesIamafraid    Why Didn’t You Tell Me?  Me: Why didn’t you tell me you weren’t really ready for a real relationship? Why didn’t you just tell me?  I thought you knew I wanted more from you than Just a friendship, a long term friendship.  I can find a friend anywhere.   If I had known That your intentions were not to make me yours permanently; I would have not given myself so Freely.  Why didn’t you tell me?  Him: I can't tell you why I didn't tell you.....maybe because the thought of a long term relationship with you feels good.......and even though you know you not ready for it the thought of it and the feeling you get from even imagining it makes you feel....HMMM just feel.........you know...like looking at a house you know you want but can't buy right now...like finishing a good meal and being full.....and having one last bite on your plate and having no room for it in your body but you still savor it....like .....UMMM like that.......

      Did you even ask God for His guidance or are you just doing it on your own ....using your knowledge of the subject?  Think about it..wouldn't the creator of creation know how it operates?  Creator being God - Creation being you!  Believe me You do not have it all figured out..if you did...you wouldn't be asking everyone else for answers.  Go back to the user's manual (the bible), become a member so you can have a better understanding of the owner's manual....  Did you even ask?

      You ask for woman of substance, no drama, and intellectual. She has everything that you ask for in a woman, BUT yet you have no idea of how to love her.  She gives you all of her love. She gives you attention and affection.  Treat you like you desire to be treated. But yet you have no idea of how to love her.  You say you love her…words are not enough.   Show her how you love her. She has made it known that she shares the same feelings as you. You said that she was the woman that you have always dreamed of loving, BUT yet you have no idea of how to love her.

      This is what a friend told me I needed in a man...just after 2yrs of friendship she told me: Someone who will listen and probe a little, not too hard (ok...no pun intended), but just enough for me to understand that he cares about my feelings and my inner thoughts, he needs to provide for me a safe environment for me to express myself freely. He needs to be able to understand that sometimes during conflict that my first reaction or actions to a situation are not always what I truly mean to express. He needs to be patient enough to wait for my true feelings to come out which are fair and loving. He needs to be a giver, because I am one, and not ask me what I want but listen and try to figure out what I need and give it to me. I need someone to help expose me to things because I am curious and loves adventure, but need someone to help pull me out into the world of the unknown. I need someone who will respect me and show me how a woman should be treated especially physically and sexually. RESPECT, his mindset should be "now baby this is how a woman is supposed to be treated" so that my mind is renewed regarding relationships. I love quality time with my man, so he has to be someone that values one on one time.

      I don't want what you want I don't talk like you talk I don't act like you act You don't understand You are not trying to understand You haven't taken time to understand You are only seeing one thing You are only being guided by one thing You are missing the entire picture You are not listening Your focus is fuzzy You are being guided by lust You have no understanding of love You are not listening You are making accusations You haven't taken time to understand Why are we having this argument Did you hear a word I said... Are you listening with your heart No - you are not- We are not the same We want different things You are not listening You are getting upset You are making me upset I am backing down I am backing out I am walking away You don't understand You do not want to understand Your heart is in the wrong place We are NOT THE SAME
