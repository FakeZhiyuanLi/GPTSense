      I know not this person standing before me,  Yet She bears an uncanny resemblance  She stares at me with a questioning gaze I wonder what she knows And does She wonder what I know?  Would you be so kind to trade places? I queried My shoes have grown too tight,  Maybe you can fill them? But our feet are exactly the same size She replied showing me a dainty foot.  Desperate, I pleaded You are me and I am you Nobody will be able to tell the difference She smiles sadly, Since you are me and i am you what I feel is what you feel What I do is what you do  Perhaps you can make better sense of  Life than me, I pressed For I know not what I do You have done good, she smiled For I would have only done the same

      There was once when i would run from bad things, shut out people who care, spend days under the covers of my bed and gribe about never being able to change anything and complained about how life was always unfair to me.   My latest neurotic habit has been to run to another country to escape. Now i find it ironic that i just want to run home and hide under my covers again.   So maybe my love affair with HK (and other love affairs included) has finally ended, and the only logical thing to do would be to fall back into old bad habits, escape this place, go home and be miserable.  But i'm not going to do that.   I've learnt it the hard way just how much we all are resistant to change. And for a long time now i've been practising the art of change. And yes, it is an art bacause humans are creatures of habit(especially men). Once we get into comfortable routine, emotions or actions we cling to them cus it becomes clockwork and requires little effort to put into motion(see just how aptly men fit into this profile?). Change is a crucial part of sustaining hope, cus when we keep moving, doing something new, our senses are constantly heightened to the experience of new things, and we learn a little more about ourselves along the way and hopefully, move one step closer to 'finding ourselves'.   The way i see it, i have two options.   I can go home, settle for a normal job, spend my paycheck shopping every month, go back to complaining about life in Singapore not being enough again.   Or i can take on a challenge, accept the job offer in China, start a new life in a place where i will more or less be totally alone, grab life by the balls and see where it takes me.   I'm gonna stare change in its face, and make it cower to me.

      I know how the story ends now...  girl gave it her all, finally made a committment of her feelings and told him how she felt.   He had beforehand already said how he felt that he truely wanted this. But it is possible things change overnight, feelings change and he doesn't feel the same way anymore.   Girl takes one last attempt at getting him to say that he wants it to work.   But the fact is, he has closed up his heart.   And she has to close up her heart once again, for the sake of self preservation.   So another chapter is closed.   Girl goes back to being a controlled individual longing for someone or something to open up her heart again.   Hope will keep her alive that someday something good will pass her way and not disappear in a fleeting moment...

      My best friend was crying to me on the phone a few days ago. Her totally devoted and sweet bf had gone off the deep end, went back to smoking after one year and started to push her away and was watching Euro 04 with his mates every night. She's convinced it isn't just cus the esteemed Euro Cup cometh but once every 2 years, She's angry and hurt that he is pushing her away.   And why shouldn't she be?   This guy had, up till this point, promised her the world, filled with love and a marriage in the books; been patient and sweet, considerate, listened to her every fear, tried to curb every insecurity and most importantly, had tried to change for her. (as a smoker i know this daunting task is next to impossible)  This same friend has been reprimanding me for some time for fearing love, for choosing a safe option of being with someone i could never totally fall in love with so that i would always retain a certain amount of self control.   Secretly, i've admired her courage of holding onto the notion that love conquers all and that with 'the one', everything will fall into place and he will be everything she wants.   I decided i would let go of my controlled behavior which had been gathering dust for some time now. Being in a foreign land has also opened up the floodgates to taking more risks that i usually would since there is virtually no one here to judge me.   So when i met him, i took a plunge against my better judgement, against my usually level headed self in choosing a bf, not caring two hoots about the expiration date on my stay in HK, not caring that he's more than a decade older (see you are judging aren't you?!), or that he has a 7-year relationship that ended only cus he didn't want to marry her and she was pressuring him. It was no doubt a flurry of confusion in the beginning cus it's so hard to distinguish infatuation from love.  Now im leaving in a week. And things are not going well anymore.   And then it hit me, i had actually fallen in love.   How did i know this?  Cus every time i look at him, every emotion floods my consciousness at lightning speed, each trying to capture my attention in a fleeting split second; the fear, insecurity, desire, warmth, frustration, happiness, sadness, passion, ,melancholy, joy...  any emotion associated with describing how one would feel when... in love.   I realized that when one opens up their hearts, they are subjected to extreme emotions and their senses are heightened to every detail of the loved one. You can imagine just how dangerous this is...one ends up vulnerable to all sorts of erratic behaviour and reactions that would be unbecoming of mature, controlled individuals.   I can't complete this entry, Cus i don't know how it ends. But i do know i'm in danger.

      I made a final trip to China yesterday for my current company and for once it was a truely enjoyable experience.   Why?  Cus my Boss didn't go with us so we had free reign on where to go and what to do :)  Official duties were completed by lunchtime cus the sole purpose was to go to Panyu to meet up with a Chinese design company who is going to produce our company leaflet, which is completely designed by yours truely. My ego got a boosting when the designer asked me if i was a designer by training and was full of compliments as i am a finance major by training.   We proceeded for lunch at a restaurant recommended by my China colleague, Jeff who had promised to bring me to eat 'ye shou' which means wild beasts in Mandarin. I politely declined the offer so we had a pretty normal lunch. But Monica, who came with me from HK, had different ideas. She ordered duck's tongue. I had already tried this in HK and it wasn't so bad cus in HK, it just looks like an elongated piece of flesh that was kinda rubbery. So i thought i was mentally prepared. When the dish came, it looked like this...   urlLink    duck tongue  I only had the stomach to eat one...Monica ate like half a dozen =P The red circled part is the duck's tongue.   After lunch, Monica wanted to go for a foot massage and i wasn't keen on the idea so when i saw a salon next to the massage parlour i decided to do something crazy. I have been meaning to cut my hair for the longest time but never found the energy to find a good hairdresser in HK.  I am terrified of hair dressers and hold my hair in very high esteem as i think a great cut brings out a person's features. I always stuck to one haridresser who gave me great cuts from my friend who was the artistic director for Toni and Guy in Singapore.   Jeff recommended we go to his normal hairdresser. The shampoo girls were great and i nearly fell asleep after 15 minutes of pure pleasure.   I was supposed to get the cut from the owner of the salon but he wasnt free so, Gasp!, they sent another guy. I gave him pretty specific instructions while i shivered in my chair.   He took 10 minutes examining my hair and observed that it wasn't cut in China. Then he took another 15 minutes to cut my fringe. Jeff was done with his cut in 10 minutes and spent the rest of the time laughing at me squirming in my chair.   It didn't help that since the hairdresser took so long, we were running outta time to catch the ferry back to HK so he had to finish up fast.   So here it is, my really cheap hair cut from China which turned out to be pretty good and only cost me 40RMB (= less than 10 SGD!!)    urlLink    my china haircut

      So i had a thought today.. im leaving Hong Kong soon and i needed to document, file, report things that i have seen and experienced. Today I document 2 things that have puzzled me over the past few months..  And excuse my lousy photos cus i broke my cammy the first night i got here so have to use handphone. Yeah. I think technology and me have a long way to go before becoming good friends...   What the heck is this?     urlLink    what is this?  I know what its for, it stares me in the face everytime i go pay for parking...but what the heck does the word 'SHROFF' mean? I have checked  urlLink dictionary.com  i've asked everyone i know from HK but so far no one has been able to shed light...  I'll treat the first person who finds out what 'Shroff' means to Chicken testes hahah..  People who sit with their toes turned in are said to have low self esteem. If this is the case then Hong Kong girls must have really low self esteem cus on average 7 out of 10 girls on the train sit like this....   urlLink    the most lady-like sitting position  Seriously, is it really lady like to sit like that? Cus the girls also tend to walk with their toes turned in as well. I was so intrigued i decided to try it for myself..and i failed miserably cus its so damn uncomfortable to sit like my toes have to kiss and walk like a duck...

      Ever since i arrived in Hong Kong i've taken to eating pretty exotic stuff which even though are common back home, are even more prominent and a favourite of the HK taste buds..I like bah gut teh and pigs organ soup but never in my life have i consumed every conceivable part of pigs, cow and chickens as i have in HK.   One item that i have taken a particular liking to is 'kei ji'.   It's a part of the chicken (as you can tell from the cantonese name) but which part?  Best savoured after being boiled in a hot pot for about 15 mins, dipped in soya sauce.  Yums!   After i tried it for the first time, i liked it. Then came a sudden thought...  I asked my friend: so is it the kidney of the chicken?  ans: nope i think it's chicken testicles  My jaw dropped and i had a weird twisting feeling in my tummy. I looked at the one 'kei ji'left on my plate sheepishly and pushed it around for a while. But i still ate it in the end rationalizing that i eat pigs organs, cow gizzards so what of chicken balls...  I don't believe they are chicken testicle cus they are large; the size of perhaps a fifty-cent singapore coin and from my memory i could not recall ever seeing chickens with two fifty-cent sized sacs... and they come in varying sizes too so does this mean that there are more verile cocks or impotent ones?    urlLink    chicken balls?  I even googled 'chicken testicles' but didn't get a picture like the one i took above...  hmm im still curious what it is...  But what the heck i'll eat first then think about it ;)

       STILL WAITING   I thought i saw your car turn in And waited in anticipation for the click of the key in our door.  When it didn't happen I thought perhaps you were washing your car like you  usually do on a Sunday afternoon  And so i waited impatiently  for the click of the key in our door.  When it didn't happen I told myself you might  have bumped into a neighbour and gone for a drink at the clubhouse  And continued waiting with fervor  for the click of the key in our door.  When it didn't happen my heart dropped I knew my eyes had betrayed me I had mistaken your car for someone else's  And with each passing moment  I continue to wait  for the click of the key in our door.    Yes the wait is finally over. i Went out for a long walk, went for mass (two times in one week my mum will be proud :) then wanted to meet friends but they would be too late so i took a long and painful journey home. Painful cus the walk to the MTR took forever and with a temperature of 30 degrees its beginning to feel like Singapore here. And i had to change trains and then missed my bus so had to get back on the train and find another route home...  Well i wasn't totally looking forward to going home. Its a love-hate thing that i wanted him to be home before me, yet i know if he wasn't i would also breathe a sigh of relieve cus then i wouldn't have to deal with what has happened over the weekend.   I made a good move of checking the car park cus i wanted to be mentally prepared if he was home. Yeah, the M3 was sitting majestically in its usual assigned spot. So i took a deep breadth and went home.   No discussion so far, no 'how was yer weekend?' no physical contact or 'i've missed yer'Maybe cus i just couldn't hide my aloofness despite my cheery 'hi!' and random comments about the remote control car he's building and the soccer he's watching...  Well i guess waiting for something to happen begins right now...

       A Mental Snapshot   Herein lies a humble servant, a child of God. A maelstrom of baggage weighing down shoulders Crawling on hands and knees to rest at the feet of our omnipotent creator.  Gently bequeaths burden Pleading feebly With arms outstretched for lucidity in this confusion to release this tired soul    I went to church yesterday.   Haven't gone for a while and felt like i was fast becoming a bad christian. I always find a sense of calm in the serene environment of church. As if an omnipotent energy runs through the place; the silence where only the buzzing of the fans or airconditioning is audible, the random people who sit quietly at the pew or kneeling on the foot rest infront of them, with heads bowed and hands clasped, each with their own stories to tell, own questions to ask. And yesterday i was one of them.  I believe in signs, and i asked for signs to gently nudge me in the right direction...  And silly as it might sound, i think i actually got a sign. Cus i met some friends after and was flipping through a copy of IS magazine when i chanced upon the horoscope section. I never believe in predictions but i do read them for a laugh, especially IS ones cus they are so outrageous. Can't remember the whole thing but gist of it was   For Libra: Have faith that after this vacation, God will send you good things 2 or even 4 fold.  I had a private chuckle about it cus it seems silly to really believe that God had sent me a message through IS. Nontheless it made my day cus i know God is listening and all i need is patience with lots of faith to ride this storm...

      "I don't want the person im with to change for me..."  "I want the person i'm with to be herself..."  Bullshit.  Spending a Friday night at home, no friends to call, no party to go to, basically no life of my own. This is not my life. This is not me.  This is change.  And why not just go out myself you might ask?  Well i might have done so if you hadn't call me at 7pm after i just reached home from work to inform me that you have a friend's birthday to attend and there is no time to come home and pick me up.   Bullshit.  And when you called me at midnight i knew you were gonna do a cinderella on me. So to avoid displaying my displeasure with a bad attitude and unhappy voice i decided not to pick up. The wonders of technology made sure you got your sms text message through loud and clear that you would not be coming home tonight and staying at your other place cus you are busy tommorow.  Bullshit.  When you introduced me as 'your driver' to friends since you lost your license I kept mum to save your ego. I'm nobody's driver, I'm the me you met whom you said you didn't want to change. I'm still the same person whom you somehow had the romantic notion of asking to be 'your unmarried housewife' just cus you saw that i can do some housework and cook.   I'm nobody's housewife, married or otherwise.

      No. There isn't any erotic literature in this post.   I've just come from the last meeting with my Boss (yay!) and have 10 minutes (yeah yer thinking is this my definition of the timespan of a quickie..heh..NO) to just enter some random ramblings before i run out of the office..   Its official, my bummer unemployed days begins Thurdays 24th June.   YAY!   But the downside is that i still have to make one last trip to China next week to settle some designer stuff for the work im publishing for the company. While my Boss is happily galavanting in Singapore for the whole week..milk this cheap labour for all she's worth..thats my Boss's motto..

      I have not done an ounce of work today.   Probably a combination of feeling crappy from being sick, feeling the impending emptiness of being unemployed after i stop work next week and lots of worrying about nothing and everything.  Hence the sudden fervor in starting a new blog. I've heard stories about blogger being complicated and yeah, for a tech idiot i guess im stumped. I took a course called 'Internet Marketing' in university which gave us a 45-hour crash course of in html, ftp, xml, dns and the lists goes on. Not surprisingly i learnt nearly nothing.   Now suddenly faced with the prospect of having alot of time on my hands the next few weeks while i pray that companies in HK and Spore will call me in for interviews, i have resolved to learn a new skill...  The result of my sudden enthusiam? I took 2 hrs to figure out how to upload my picture onto the blogger profile.  Don't laugh.   I didnt think i would ever need to use the skills when i can just use dreamweaver...  I think im not moving from Xanga to Blogspot already. I will dedicate xanga to my public rantings and blogspot for my more personal posts...cus my dad already has my link on xanga and im not to thrilled at the idea of him reading about my bf woes haha  in the meantime this is my shout out to bloggers...H E L P.

      An uneventful first evening spent in my new lily pad, i had to make do with what ever little i had for entertainment. The tv cable had not been installed, the phone line not connected and needless to say internet&nbsp;was prolly a&nbsp;thing of the&nbsp;next millenium.   The eerie quietness of a new residential estate made my ears ring with an 'eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee'&nbsp;which i only managed&nbsp;to get rid of using my mp3 player. I decided to apply myself to some work and actually managed to read a contract from cover to cover after many years of not being able to absorb&nbsp;even one during business law class.   I then moved onto examining the Guangzhou map which killed time a little as i poored over it searching for the tiny dots of my home and my office. Its amazing how useless silly facts&nbsp;increase in value and importance when one is totally and utterly bored. I learnt little snippets of information such as Guangzhou being known as 羊城 and 穗城 which means 'Rams City' and 'Rice Ear City' respectively. Legend has it that five immortals&nbsp;came to Guangzhou on five different coloured rams, gave the local people ears of rice and taught them how to&nbsp;cultivate it, thus they&nbsp;never went&nbsp;hungry again. It seems amusing to think that the five Rams must all be of different colours. If i was a farmer back then, i would prolly try to barter something to get me one of those,&nbsp;prolly a&nbsp;purple one&nbsp;and use it for a freak show. Guangzhou's quirks soon lost its charm as my eyes started to tire from reading small chinese characters under dim lighting, so i decided to check out the neighbours. This plan proved futile cus all the other units from my floor was unoccupied and i entertained the thought of going down and chatting up the security guard. But reminder of the purid smell of smoke and dust and dirt from the lobby made me go back into my lily pad. I was flipping my newly bought 4inch thick chinese dictionary when out of the corner of my eye, i spotted a little dark thing on the balcony. I knew it had not been there before and got up to take a closer look. As i suspected, a cockroach. With a quick movement&nbsp;i reached for the&nbsp;newly bought insect repellent, swiftly aimed it at the bugger and used all energy my index finger had and depressed the nozzel. Xiao Qiang started running of course and i gave chase with the bottle. He appeared to be much tougher than those i had encountered in HK and Singapore and i had to really give it all ive got to finally knock him out. Then i spied something black hovering on the ground next to me. with the reflex of an predator going for its prey, i brought my slipper down on Xiao Ming and caused a tiny mess of insect body parts and blood on&nbsp;the white floor. While cleaning up this mess, xiao buzz the fly whizzed around my ears and face. I couldnt catch this one cus he was too fast.&nbsp;I mused as he whizzed around: i did find company after all.   The rest of the&nbsp;night i spent chain smoking, thinking about nothing except when the next cig will be and when other visitors will arrive...

      Once upon a time, There was a girl&nbsp; happy and secure in her little fairytale world She had fought demons and monsters and triumphant, felt invincible and untouchable  While strolling through a park one day, found an envelop on the grass among the pretty wild flowers inside was an air ticket and a note.  herein lies a ticket to the rest of your life.  Curious and excited, she packed her bags and left her fairytale world. 'Maybe i'll find my Prince Charming, maybe i'll find my fortune  and maybe, just maybe, I'll live happily ever after.'  The birds were chirping the day she left.  A sweet song of random notes, tuneless yet melodious She packed her prized possessions and weapons (for you never know&nbsp;when one&nbsp;might meet new demons to slay) and flew off to never never land.   True to her prediction, she found her prince charming. True to her prediction, she found a road to fortune. True to her prediction, she felt contented and&nbsp;said ' i might just live happily ever after'.  She was soon to learn however, that sadly,  Happily ever after&nbsp;only happens to Cinderella and Snow White Prince Charming turned out to be a toad in disguise It broke her heart and spirit. Fortune too, was flighty and unloyal, leaving her poor and in want of comfort She took out her weapons (for she always felt better after a victorious battle) but the only demons she could find that day were those inside her head, 'happily ever after only happens to Cinderella and Snow White' she sobbed, longing to be back in her little&nbsp;fairytale world.   'I'll find my way home! I'll return to my little fairytale world.' So she walked and she walked. Day and night, she navigated by the sun and the stars, trying to recall which direction was the one from whence she had come. But try as she might, she was lost feeling hopeless, she came to a fork in the path, sat down and cried.  She cried for hours and hours,  it wasn't long before her tears had formed a little stream   When&nbsp;her stream had almost turned into an ocean,  &nbsp;a creature in a little boat appeared This creature was like no other demon or monster she had seen before it was the uglier than the ugliest monster she had ever faced.  She drew her weapon, ready to strike But stopped short when she saw it waving something white as if in surrender 'I have a message for you!' He dropped&nbsp;the white envelop and quickly rowed away Hoping it would be a ticket home, she opened it with newfound hope but all she found within was a note:  There is only one ticket to life and you have used up yours. The only way home is to not search for it, but take a chance on any path you might cross, and maybe someday you will return home.    &nbsp; She reread the note day after day, night after night, She sat there hoping that the creature might return When Hope dried out, she felt the familiar ache in her heart jaded and disparaged, she read the note one last time and finally&nbsp;understood its meaning, there is no short cut back to her little fairytale world, that she had in a heart beat, used up the&nbsp;ticket to the rest of her life and there was no turning back.   She picked herself up, and&nbsp;dragged her feet&nbsp;into the first path&nbsp;she found, cus&nbsp;happily ever after only happens to Cinderella and Snow White for the rest of us, there is only more demons to fight.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Ok so i'm about to burst already. Before i really do it physically i felt i had to try to organize things in text so maybe i can put things in better perspective.   1) For the past 2 days, i have received anonymous silent calls to my hk number. the first two at 4.26 and 4.29 am respectively and then this morning, i got one at 9.00.03am. The accuracy at which my mysterious stalker is doing this is uncanny. It's like the person has a whole schedule printed out and would set alarms to carry out action. I half expected to hear heavy breathing each time i pick up but just background noise, like traffic noise. I have only been stalked once and that was someone i knew ( thats another story when im not so pissed) so this time i had to really think about whether i had made any enemies in hk. Then it hit me, it must be associated with someone's ex gf and&nbsp;God knows other gfs for all i know. My well being and safety is more important than fighting someone elses childish battle. If i find out that it i am right, i'm heading straight for the exit.   2) Mr Ego has this bleady way of trying to unload nostalgia on me whenever he's feeling vulnerable or has lost his direction. For a long time, he always claimed that i inspired him and i was his saviour blah blah blah... it's only cus&nbsp;i criticized him the most when everyone just let him live in his deluded world. Even after the relationship ended proper, he would at the most random of times, sms me some new insight he has gotten about us and how he needs me blah blah blah...yeah, at 1.29am i was dozing off into dreamland when the sms came: I  miss you. i'm on absinth.  I'm not&nbsp;familiar with&nbsp;drugs and toxic chemicals that do not have 'vodka', 'scotch' or 'whiskey' on it so for a second i got worried. I nearly got up to check out this thing online and would have called him if my smarter sense told me to f*&^ it cus he has done this to me too many times. Always feeding on my nice attitude towards him.   3) Then today, Mr&nbsp;No Licence&nbsp;suggested we go jetskiing. I was in no mood but i decided to humour him anyway. And i ended up having to drive on a stretch of road that had alot of potential road blocks. Forget getting to the destination&nbsp;in one piece, this ride consisted of no peace given to the poor driver who had to endure snide remarks about her driving...   "When did you get your licence? What?! when u were 18? so you've been driving for 6 years, then by right you should not be making such silly mistakes. If you've been driving a auto car all your life i guess i could forgive you but&nbsp;you drive a manual car. You drive an EG should by right be someone who likes to drive so how come drive like that?"   Miss Boiling Inside:    I drive just fine. I just don't like the pressure you are giving me. It's like going for driving lessons again. If i wanted to learn driving again i will sign up for lessons myself. This is your car so it's extremely difficult for me to be comfortable while driving, somemore you keep throwing criticisms at me of course i can't drive properly. I need to drive and listen to you and try to do every instruction you are sending out. And i don't have this problem in my own car. I drive my EG just fine.    MR No licence:   I'm not criticizing you, it's advice that i think you should follow. Don't you want to improve you're driving? You're just too proud. You can't seem to take advice in the right manner can you?   4) I've become my own worse nightmare. I read his smses while he was parking the car (which of course i refuse to drive by the end of the trip) and found some smses not coming from the ex. They weren't mushy or anything. Just the kind you know that are the  'getting to know you so im being sweet but controlled'  kinda smses. Normally im very controlled and believe in respecting one's privacy but i've done it. No turning back now.   See how i need to burst?

       Wonderful     I wanna hold you  And be so held back  Don't wanna need you  But it's where i'm At  Thinkin bout you every day  How come i was made that way?  It's so surreal...&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Annie Lennox, 'Wonderful', album: BARE   One of natures most basic concept and gift to humankind has got me completely tongue tied.   Talk.   Communication is the essence of maintaining any kind of relationships. We are social creatures who need to release the pent up emotions, ideas, opinions and all the hullabaloo that rips through our heads every minute of our waking moments. Yet when it comes to saying things to those who matters most to us, the words often gets stuck in one's throat. This is what i call the 'dumb detachment syndrome (DDS)' where one might have planned out, listed out, all the important things one has to convey to another person, but just end up spluttering out anything that is as far removed from the desired topic as possible.   My diagnosis is that im suffering from a cronic case of such DDS.   Perhaps its some spillover effect from childhood memories of not being close to my family. To this day, i havent been able to really tell the two most important people in my life that i love them. I had planned to do it...the day i left for HK, the propsect of not knowing when im gonna be returning home struck a little cord in me to wanna say it...yet i could only manage to do it in a card.   Everyday, i face someone whom i have so much to say, so much to question. I go through the painful process of organizing my thoughts, searching for the right words, but still the silence is deafening. Maybe it's cus those who leave us most vulnerable, whose opinions and judgements we know will hit&nbsp;close to home are those whom we need to be defensive against. Betcha lots of people are screaming 'NO WAY!' at the last statement.   So often heard, "Talk is cheap", has taken on a whole new threshold in the way i handle communication. I worship it like the holy grail (ok not really but its a nice exaggerated extreme way to look at it dont u think?) and spend lots of tiring hours waiting and analyzing signs, actions, gestures and hidden meanings.   Gone are the days where meaning what you say and saying what you mean are the dictum of communication. We have traded in simple words for devices of metaphors like songs, movies and books to externalize the REAL things we need to convey inside. The worse thing is we still get misunderstood and send wrong signals with these so called foolproof 'this is exactly my situation' kinda cop out methods of communication. This is perhaps why i value simple friendship more than any romantic relationships i have. Cus i can always be my silly self, know that i might be judged but still be loved at the end of it all.   Yeah DDS has arrived.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       CD player is blasting Coyote Ugly OST&nbsp; 'Can't fight the moonlight'     &nbsp;  I've never cared much for diamonds.   When i came home to find my parents&nbsp;presenting a diamond cross to mark my baptism the first thought that came to mind was: wow how much did this extravagant piece of jewellery cost?   Only recently had a bf (now ex bf) bequeathed me with a pretty diamond pedant for valentines' day while proclaiming proudly that he&nbsp;HAD NEVER&nbsp;given a diamond anything to anyone. This same bf had always retorted smugly that diamonds are just carbon whenever anyone talked about buying one for their significant other. (no prizes for why he got dumped)  But popular culture states that they serve to mark some sorta milestones in one's life which prolly explains the sudden abundance of these little shiny&nbsp;stones &nbsp;in my life recently.&nbsp;Remembering  urlLink an article  i read a little while back, i thought about how&nbsp;the meaning behind these little stones&nbsp;mean more to&nbsp;me than the actually stones themselves..   So when my best friend suggested&nbsp;we get matching diamond rings to mark our friendship i didn't need to think twice. We even had a little fun with the salesman at the shop. Im familiar with jewellery salesmen techniques of upselling products by appealling to prospective customers as i have a good friend who so kindly gave me all the low down, on how they appeal to peoples' need to prove their wealth, over coffee. So prepared like soldiers going into war, we pretended to be poor uni students with only an ATM card.   we coyly teased him about being lesbians when he raised a slight brow when we said we were getting matching rings.    'You two are not looking for marriage rings are you?'     urlLink     friends forever&nbsp;   Though they are three teenie&nbsp;tiny stones (0.03 ct the salesman explained), they contain a whole world of meaning to me.&nbsp;We might be miles away from each other,&nbsp;but everytime i&nbsp;think about how&nbsp;somewhere in the world, someone special is wearing the exact same&nbsp;ring, bought at the exact time, i&nbsp;know i've got a dear friend..   On another note, i just watched urlLink  Coyote&nbsp;Ugly &nbsp;which is one of the&nbsp;'must watch' recommended by lots of people.&nbsp;So inspirational it had me in tears when i draw comparisons about how i am  urlLink ditching safe paths  to pursue dreams in unknown&nbsp;territory.. almost made me wanna find some bar to&nbsp;earn extra cash when i move to GZ&nbsp;next week.&nbsp;What a sight it would be to be bar top dancin in some chinese&nbsp;pub playin chingchong tunes...think my parents&nbsp;might have heart attacks if the day ever comes...  &nbsp;

       One of the after effects of going through the Singapore education system is that is makes you go a little crazy. And i'm a big fan of&nbsp;doing  urlLink crazy &nbsp;(yeah read the entry for June the 4th quoting a friend on&nbsp;being crazy and dealing with Ah&nbsp;Bengs and Police..)things&nbsp;cus i think at some level everyone should let loose and not take life too seriously.&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   This is&nbsp;what happens after a crazy woman is forced to contort her face into plastic smiles for studio photographs... &nbsp;   &nbsp;    Introducing the Beatlettes Of Lorong Abbey  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    urlLink     Da Beatlettes&nbsp;    What&nbsp;about the result of studying too much?&nbsp;Some&nbsp;become bewitched with&nbsp;the redrawal from lack of mugging in their usual haunts...and need to return to the crime scene and revisit the torture for the last time and&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;chant some&nbsp;voodoo that might hopefully do weird things to the school admin.. watch out for it in&nbsp;tommorow's headlines...&nbsp;      &nbsp;    urlLink     da thwee weetches of McBeth    On a more serious note, i just found out that one of my mum's friend's daughter, who happened to be a SPH scholar from Brown University with a great well paying job at SPH, has in cantonese: Sot chor Seen. Literal translation is 'gone crazy'.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For years, this nemesis has left my confidence trailing in the dirt everytime my mum decides to comment about my underachiever attitude...well looks like i don't even need to have a response to this news now  &nbsp;  ;P Im just glad i can act crazy and still be grounded at the end of the day

       My parents have been looking forward to this day for a really long time. To see their daughter get a university degree cus his official duties as a dad, with regards to major financial aid anyway, are over. To commemorate this joyous occasion he wanted to take studio shots with me in my graduation garb.  &nbsp;  Included in the package&nbsp;were a series of shots of me alone, me standing against the backdrop of a bookshelf filled with encyclopedias. Yup, just&nbsp;as i suspected they were empty boxes with some fancy schmancy name like&nbsp;  urlLink Britannica  &nbsp;me leaning&nbsp;on a pile of books (i think they were some marketing management and financial accounting titles) and me against a tacky backdrop&nbsp;that appears in everyone's typicall  urlLink studios pictures .  &nbsp;  While&nbsp;the photographer prepared the lighting and film, i&nbsp;had time to notice all the example shots hanging on the walls.&nbsp;How could&nbsp;all these people&nbsp;smile so naturally, or look like they were having the best time of their lives?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There i was, wearing the hot, oversized grad gown, trying not to move my head too much cus the motar board&nbsp;was too big, perching picariously against a pile of books, trying to feel like i was on top of the world.  &nbsp;   ok, &nbsp;turn your body abit more to the left, lower&nbsp;your shoulders on the right, lift&nbsp;your chin higher, yes yes, now smile, SMILE!!!     &nbsp;   No&nbsp;no, show more teeth,&nbsp;more teeeeeeeeth!!     &nbsp;  I really tried, honest. I kept telling myself that im doing this for my parents, i kept trying to think about a funny story that my friend told me recently that had to do with taking a dump on a traffic island in Singapore...when this last method didnt work i knew i was a goner. I&nbsp;suddenly felt like&nbsp;crossing my eyes and sticking out my tongue when he snapped. But that would just be a waste of my dad's time as he has to go back to decide which shots he wanted to frame and i think he wouldn't wanna show guests&nbsp;that his daughter&nbsp;studied so hard she went berzerk after graduation.  &nbsp;  And when the final product is hung on the wall at home, i'll be glad im not around to see that sheepish, constipated&nbsp;grin i have pasted on my face, but i will be happy that my parents will look at it and smile.

      Returning to Singapore has been a weird experience..i have often heard my friends whining that when they return home from an overseas exchange or posting, they find difficulty in adjusting.  It felt as if i never left at all. My first order of things was to take my baby for a spin. Driving on Singapore roads, zipping to my favourite supper places to meet my buddies was too familiar, almost like i have been doing this for the past five months of my life. My friends are still the same, the environment is still the same, yet i felt different and i have changed.    Being bombarded with questions of my indecision to leave Singapore semi-permanently got me thinking about the past. The silly fashion mistakes, bad choice in boyfriends and whining about the Singapore system. It almost seems surreal that i'm breaking out of it, that i no longer want to be confined to complaining about the inefficiency of the super efficient Singapore system.   My grad ball was held in Swissotel on last Saturday. It was a grand affair with lots of pictures and alcohol to aid the massive amount of 'burying the hachet' i observed amongst my schoolmates. It was an amusing sight to witness the worse of enermies attempting to make small talk, to signal the progression of a new era, showing forgiveness for childish disputes. My system was buzzing from champagne which is my excuse for not participating in this bizarre activity. Afterwards, we headed for New Asia Bar aka Equinox aka Compassrose. This was the highlight of my evening as i had never been up there throughout the years i have lived in Singapore. The view was breathtaking, and i spent a few tipsy hours soaking in the view, trying to capture a mental picture. All the while, an ex bf/schoolmate, whom i had a complicated relationship with before i even entered the school, wanted to get a few words in.   Mr Ego: I hated our school and i sometimes regret ever going there  Buzzing me: Well this is the end so there is nothing more to hate is there?  Mr Ego: I hated it yet it was the best time of my life. I have to thank you as you were the reason i went there instead of USC.   Buzzing me: You made your own choices so just move on and make something of yourself.  Mr Ego: You are still the best fit for me, you fit just right with me. I am going to miss you after you are gone.   Buzzing me: I am going to miss this view so much you know...this is my home and i will always love my home...  Mr Ego: Someday maybe we will be together again, cus its meant to be.   Buzzing me smiles blanking at the view, soaking in the skyline and thinking how much i am going to miss Singapore...

      Yeah, im  urlLink cogitating  which is probably why this blog as been so quiet this past week ever since i came back to Singapore.   So many things have happened i feel like the past 5 months that i have missed out on in Singapore has been condensed into the space of a week.   Well time to blow off the dust that is gathering on this blog and retrospectively put everything down..bit by bit. Normally i only make lists when i am under pressure and have too many things to handle so i need to be organized. Now i am making a list of the possible future blog entries to unjumble my mind...  1)i am graduated since Saturday, 15 July 04, thus rendering me another sucker who has completed the status quo paper trail...woo hoo!!  2)i was batized Sunday 16 July 04 and confirmed at one go so that makes me one of those fast tracked christtians (or maybe its just singaporeans) who should just feel lucky they got a discount from not having to go through extra hassle =P  3)i am fickle minded about leaving yet not leaving yet not wanting to stay. Great, this makes my time contraint factor very exciting as the pressure increases as times ticks by...  But after all that rubbish in my head, one thing has made me feel satisfied and happy- FINALLY being able to eat this yumyum  urlLink Bah Kut teh  after i saw that picture which send me into withdrawal for Balestier Bah Kut...and it was all thanks to a treat from a super duper sweet friend who had to give blood sweat and tears (hmm i wonder) to earn $200 ;P   But it was worth it..can you tell?   urlLink    all gone

       urlLink    Ma On Shan Sunset  This is my third lily pad since arriving into HK in February 2004. Never imagined i would move so many times, from Clear Water Bay to colourful Temple Street to my final pad in Ma On Shan. I knew that my life would change forever once i left Singapore, i just didn't imagine it would be at this magnitude and scale...  Maybe this is the reality of becoming of age, moving through another phase in life as school life is effectively over and all that teen angst has come and gone like a gust of wind.  Feels like another transition has been bridged...with this last HK sunset, i look forward to the next one, which ever part of the world i may be in...

       urlLink    my little ocean  This is a recent new addition to my home in HK.    urlLink    another shot of my little ocean  A sea water fish tank which is one of its kind cus the water and sand were jetskiied from Sia Kung on a particular hot Saturday afternoon, and so far among the 9 inhabitants to have moved in, 2 have already been eaten by Hannibal the Hermit crab.   First one to go was another crab, who was still nameless at the time of the first attack from Hannibal from which he lost 2 out of his 8 legs. He was named 'Lunch' after this incident as it became apparent that Hannibal wasn't gonna give up so easily. True to our prediction, Hannibal finished Lunch within the next 24 hours.   Next to go was my favourite little creature, a colorful sea slug that was purple, pink and had bright yellow tips on the ends of its antennas. Poor Slugger didn't even know what hit him since he could only move at a rate 5cm each day.   Now whenever i look at Hannibal, i feel like taking him out of his shell and giving him a good spanking.   Here he is in his greedy glory.   urlLink    naughty little bugger  Soon i'll be crossing bigger oceans lyself and perhaps i'll forget it ever mattered that Hannibal ate my Slug =P

       CD pick of the night: Frank Sinatra 'I got you under my skin' - Romance    Enjoying another night of solitude at home blasting Sinatra and nursing mixed feelings.   Something i read  urlLink struck a cord  close to home. Two days ago i was all ready to pack up and start afresh in Singapore and even entertained a thought of moving to China to further isolate myself and test my new found independence from distraction of friends and Singapore life.   A romantically sad finale to the saga would mirror the course of  urlLink events  that would have been bittersweet but sensible. Constantly replayed over and over again like a broken recorder in my head: i would drag my luggage and leave in the wee hours of the morning, write a sweet note thanking him for being so great to me these past few months, wishing him well. I would spend aimless hours at the HK international airport, psyche myself up for the positive outlook i would embrace once i arrived back into Changi Airport, and send my house keys and security card back to him by post.   But with a twist of fate, he came home while i was packing, and said 'let's find a way to work this out'.   I smiled.  And life goes on.   Trivial as it might sound, i was worried about packing as it is amazing how much new stuff one can accumulate in just a few months in a foreign land. Take this statistic for example: i have recently acquired 7 new pairs of shoes. I was prepared to turn on my acting skills and charm some unsuspecting light traveller into passing off as my travel buddy to increase my luggage capacity.  Then, today I met his older brother (who's like 20yrs my senior) and nephew (who is only a few years younger!) today for lunch and i also got a Citibank HK interview lined up on Monday. This is becoming serious and i can't breathe. I'm glad to be going home to hopefully put everything into perspective.  Now my suitcase is half empty while my heart is overflowing of emotion.

      I had a little adventure today...went to GZ by train, had to dight my way through the crazy scary chinese people and get on their local subway, found the company ive been offered a job at, got introed to everyone there and had a tour of GZ city to see if i like it.   Environment is ok, the workplace is ok. I think i could survive in GZ given lots of reading material, a great broadband internet connection, and lots of cigs...  But the tradeoff is the pay.   They are putting only 5000RMB on the table. Apartment is provided. But from what i saw i would have to live like a local to have any savings at all..  So is this tradeoff worth the experience?  Cus maybe im inexperienced so people can 'jiak' me when it comes to pay package..but i seriously believe i am worth a lot more...at least enough to reach close to a fresh grad pay in Singapore. Cus i can speak english, chinese n enough cantonese (for china) and i know i will excel in the job they are assigning me and i will be doing more than what im being paid for.   So should i still do this?  I'm in a serious rut...bleah...  Sigh the balls of life may not be as nice to grab as i thought haha

      Jelly beans are good for health. There is something exciting about staring through the glass jar and figuring out which flavour or colour to pick. I looked into my jar last wednesday, and saw that the supply was dwindling, there were only the icky red ones that taste like cough mixture. GZ doesn't have a demand for jellybeans, so i came home to refill my jar.  A likely story, too bad i never had a jellybean jar...and the truth probably does more justice to the whole experience anyway. So here goes...  The cockies in my balcony were becoming annoying. I missed them when they didn't appear and both loathed and pitied those which did and suffered a slow death. And mozzie coils i burnt at night made me cry. And the construction workers flocking this yet-to-be finished condo establishment filled my dreams at night with exciting ninja maneuvers from this kick boxing chick. And this apartment had a flat veranda beyond my balcony which i always joked i would hold bbqs on, and could invite all the spiderman wannabes who could easily break my bedroom window to escape their enemies should their web fail them.  I'd rather not admit the worst part but without describing it would be leaving alot to the imagination of the reader. If you wanted to watch a movie, go pay 8.50.  The job was a dream come true. Promises of working visas in both HK and China. Travel to Macau and New Zealand and lots of meeting with clients peppered the words of The Boss. Well, since this isn't a movie we all know that none of this would actually materialize. Yeah, a dream come true indeed.  So it was the fucking cockroaches that did me in, and also the crappy mobile signal which forced me to sit with my head sticking outta the balcony door, and maybe it was the silly disorganized 'santa claus' Boss who never gave me any clause attractive enough to stay. The same stupid Boss who likes his crappy company logo that looks like a spastic apple eating bald man having a lobotomy.  So i packed up, came home and bought myself a proper jar of jelly beans filled with lots of different flavours, chucking out the icky cough mixture tasting red ones......

      I can't see my own blog, i can't read other people's blog and therefore cannot leave comments. My guardian Angel actually has to send me his posts through email so i can read what has been going on. I can however post up entries but still it's frustrating...  So till i fix the bug i'll prolly post up some stupid facts incase anyone decides to check out this dying blog:  China's internet servers all have to go through the government, thus there are certain sites that can never been seen, ever. BBC and New York Times are part of the list, just to name a few.
