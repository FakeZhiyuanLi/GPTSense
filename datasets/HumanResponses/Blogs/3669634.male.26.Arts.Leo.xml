      We've got only a short time before the world turns upside-down.  Everybody involved should be emailing the24hourtheatreproject@yahoo.com.  I'll be sending out the flier a the end of this week, or you can just right click the picture in the post below and click save as... and print it full page size.  If anyone wants a nice full color poster or a black and white photo quality poster to put up at work or ar a business or something, let me know and I will make one up for you.

      Well, apparently the phone troubles aren't over.  I received a call today that they opened a repair ticket, so the phone should be fixed by tomorrow at 6.  What crap.

      Well I think we've almost pieced together our ensemble.  This is going to be a great project.  We will probably release the list of artists involved later this week!

      Mark your calenders.  We're still trying to find out what venue we'll be doing the show, but it's a pretty good bet that Aug. 21st will be the 4th 24 Hour Theatre Project.

      Well guys, we did it again.  Another successful project come and gone.  We're super serious about another one in August, so keep an eye on this space.  Right now the only thing we're trying to schedule around is the NEOhioPAL picnic, so if anyone knows another time next month that we might have issues with, let us know.  The pictures from the last project are still on the website, but there are two actors missing.  I'm going to put all the pics up(including the playwright copies) during this week, but I'll only leave them up there until the end of the month.  If anyone wants their picture, go to the homepage(see link at the bottom of this page) and you can click your photo to make it larger and then right click and save it.  If that's too complicated, email me and I'll send you your pic or else you can stop by and I'll print one up for you.  That's about that for now.  Thanks again guys, although we had a smaller house then we're used to, I really think this was the best show we've produced.  One last thing, the DVD.  It's going to be two DVDs, so I will have to charge everyone for the blanks, but it shouldn't be too much.  The good news with that is that since I'll have to expand the video to two discs, I might as well put everything I can on there, so your DVD will not only include the footage from the show, but also a slideshow of the pictures and maybe even copies of the script you can view on your TV!

      We're meeting at 6 tomorrow at Dobama to take our photos.  Hopefully the playwrights will be able to start at 7.  Photos should make it to them by 8 at the latest, provided the internet is actually our friend this time.  the pictures will also be posted at the " urlLink Home Page " site.  This way if anyone has a full box or something, they are still there to download.  Plus if anyone happens upon this page for some reason, they can check out what's happening.  I'm really excited about this guys, we've got a great team ready to go all we have to do is get started.

        August 21st      7pm     at Dobama Theatre       We are currently assembling a new team of artists for our fourth show!   Dobama Theatre is located at 1846 Coventry Rd.   Tickets are $10 and they are available at the door before the show.   The show runs approximately 90 minutes   and there is a possibility for adult content      If you don't know what the 24 Hour Theatre Project is, come and see for yourself.      We take 5 playwrights, 5 directors, and a team of actors and create 5 short one-act plays in 24 hours.        Fans of the project will be happy to know that they can sign up to receive a copy of the previous show on DVD!  More on that later.
