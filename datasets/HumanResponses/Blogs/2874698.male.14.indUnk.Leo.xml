Anyway this week was normal so far  Smallville  is the absolute best show on television!!! And  Kristen Kreuk  WOAH!!!!! She is so hot! But anyway, i am oficailly in love w/  Hannah ,lol. Well i don't know what it will be but if she read this blog well i don't know exactly how she'd react...i don't think that she would be freaked out it would b GREAT if she thought it was sweet!  Evanescence  concert in 2 days!!!!!! Incredibly excited about that!!! I have to write a ballad in English wish me luck w/ that!!! I have no idea what to write about! I told my friend  Siobhan  about this blog.  Siobhan -first we were "study hall buddies" but we r good friends, she is nice, funny,fun 2 b w/, and i know u'r reading this  Siobhan  so she's pretty 2! oh and Josh you punk! u had your chance w/ her lol, but she is cool.

      Today is pretty good, i wokr up at like...20 to 12 this morning/afternoon and my dog came in and it took me 15 minutes to get out of bed anyway so 5 minutes after i wake up my best friend  Lauren , called me and invited me over but we decided that it would be better if she came here cuz then we'd have more time cuz her mom was going to a funeral at 2:30 so that is like no time so she is coming here as i type. Oh by the way  Lauren -funny, fun 2 be w/, sometimes gets depressed and when it is that time of the month  WATCH OUT!!! , but we have been best friends since 3rd grade like Arianna but we were friends but now we r all pretty much best friends. But we have always been best friends and always will be. So today is good.

      Today is just an ordinary day. I am going to Arianna's house in a little while so it's cool. Anyway i got this scary e-mail from this freaky gothic girl in my school and it mad me cry. She sent me several joking e-cards like ha ha kidding but then she sent this one that said she loved me and i will always be her valentine even if i don't want to be! That was one of the most terrifying experiences in my whole life!!! So the freaky goth girl is in love w/ me now how screwy is that!  On the plus side,  ONLY 8 MORE DAYS UNTIL THE EVANESCENCE CONCERT!!!!!

      Oh my gosh! My brother is such an idiot! He doesn't care about anything and he enjoys anoyying people and he is good at it. He likes making people angry and i am not taking it anymore! I haven't  for several years now my mom yells at me because i don't back down and i refuse to because no one else stands up to him, so i attack him and considering that he's like 250 lbs. and i am like around 150lbs or something like that and we are 4 years apart him being the older one i don't to to bad i make him say "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" a lot so it's kinda fun. I really have no words! My parents should kick his fat a** out, so he can see what it is like out there! He thinks that money grows on trees and he doesn't work and i am going to attack him one day! But today isn't all bad i am going to the mall w/ Arianna and Lizzie and maybe a movie later. They r taking me 2 Hot Topic 2 get an outfit 4 the concert cuz i don't own many things black but suprisingly i found an outfit that Arianna "approved" so i am just going 4 the ride + there is an Abercrombie there and that is MY store! lol So as you can c today is very mixed up!

      Now that i am finished w/ my english paper it's off to draw a statue of liberty for social studies (which is ok cuz i love 2 draw) and good old earth science. You should know, earth science is my most hated class!!! i can not stand it, my teacher is a lunetic and she gives so much work, everyone in earth science has this dream to viciously attack her! and yes she is that bad!!! I am thinking about  Hannah  right now and how i have 2 tell her how i feel, it's not a huge deal she wouldn't be weird about it, we have known each other since kindergarden so we are good friends. I don't know, now to anyone reading this please leave comments! i can use advice or just let me know what you think of my blog so far!

      In life you have one chance to make all of your hopes and dreams happen. But I am at a stage call being a teenager which is fun but can make you want to scream. I have a small group of friends mostly girls because most of the guys at my school are moronic. But one friends, Hannah is my "first love" now all I have to do is tell her that.

      I am Catholic and I'm pretty religious and I know it is wrong to say this but I have never in my life felt so much hatred towards one person; Michael my brother. I hate him, and I know hate is a strong word but I have strong feelings. As soon as I move out and get married and have kids I am never letting that disrespectful a** hole in my house and I'm not exposing my children to that because I feel like if I have to deal with him 4 another day I'll go off the deep end. But he is not coming into my house and my family is NOT going to have to deal with him. I really don't know who he thinks he is but all I can say is if he keeps up these habits he has now his black soul will burn in the flaming underworld. I know that it is a terrible thing to say but he doesn't care about anyone or anything least night Lauren was over and he decided he could use my computer when we were in the middle of homework because he needed something so his gay pothead friends Keith can come with us on our Florida vacation. Which is bull s*** because my dad already said no personally I don't thin Michael should even be able to go with us cuz quite frankly he doesn't deserve it! And we took one of his friends w/ us 2 years ago and my dad told him no but I'll bet you that if my dad continues saying no that Keith, the pothead, will fly down and Mike will be like oh he's gonna stay with us! And everything about him makes me want to do something that really scares me sometime I want to see him suffer ok who am  kidding I want to see him suffer all the time and that makes me sick because I don't want to hate my brother but he leaves me with no choice.

      Well 2day is Friday, thank the Lord!!! Anyway 2day was boring 2 i have an english project to do i m starting it i got a good way in only have to add 1 or 2 more of my poems and 3 more published 1's then draw pictures on each page. Well towards the end of the day Siobhan got mad at me. For anyone who doesn't know how to say Siobhan it is pronounced shu-von. Anyway i don't even remember but i said something that made her mad. Anyway i want to take a pole she says thngs that i could blow out of proportion and get mad at her about but when i say the littlest thing she freaks out! -girls- Anyway, leave what u think in comments. I just don't think it's fair i have to beg to get her not to be mad at me anymore, when i mean beg i don't mean like on my handa and knees but just like asking her a lot. I don't want 2 lose her friendship so i make sure she's not mad but it's still not fair. Next year we r going to different high schools and i m going to miss her1 She is one of my best friends!High school is going to be hard. My school is so small that we have to transfer into 1 of 3 schools so we have a choice. Today really was a wake up call because my volleyball season is over, it feels so weird knowing i won't be trying out for the team next year and playing at this school that i've went to for 9 years. Next year i will try out 4 the team but still it's weird. i am just glad i have a few friends going w/ me next year. And Lizzie goes there so i will already know someone there. But i am strting to feel alone alredy because it's almost the end of the year, and i still have things to do. Like tell Hannah how i feel. But i don't think she likes me :( i mean, i have sources who tell me who she likes but i just don't know i mean i really like her but i don't know what to do and it's driving me insane. Sometimes the pressure of everythng id just to much i just go in my room and attack the bed and pillows and scream because i fear i might explode if i don't. I don't want to leave my other friends next year. I want them to come w/ me, i mean i have gone to school w/ these people 4 9 years of my life and next year i'll be with 10 from my school if that...i am very confused and just plain tired lately of everything. And sometimes i think i might not be able to handle it. I think Hannah knows that i like her, she was told years ago like in 5th grade by Lauren. Idk anymore about anything. So the title of this blog is very appropriate. Leave comments do w/eu want in the comment box i don't care right now i am so  blas è, oh yeah blase! vocabulary word. But who really cares.............

      Today is just dumb. I mean there's really nothing else 2 say it was s o boring...grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Anyway...I wrote these 2 stories and they r good if I do say so myself but they r short and they could b novels so that is my new goal: to make them into novels and get them published make millions, live the good life and have nothing to do ever except grace people w/ my presence by going to award shows because of coarse I will become an actor and b on VHI 101 Hottest Hotties! Ok Ok! I am sharing w/ u a nice little fantasy lol! But I m serious about making this book into a novel and then I'll be done with it pretty soon and then I'll make millions when the book is published and I will have body guards that will beat the living tar out of people that annoy me! :) doesn't that sound wonderful? Arianna I am going to take this time to tell u to shutup Miss. DramaQueen! Because of my acting rant thing up there but seriously...I would become an actor and win best actor just to make you mad!!! lol But I m not kidding! To all u people that read this Arianna is  VERY  sad!!! Anyway back to me...yeah so 2day was boring! I m not freaking out anymore about my hair I kinda like it...Over the weekend at my brother's 18th b-day party something happened to my cousin Scott that he will never 4get...myself and several other people r in the "dog house" because of something that is good and bad. Well I was talking and I mentioned that we had gotton a Micro Touch (by we I mean the my family) and if u don't know what a Micro Touch is watch T.V. so he let my cousin Kellie separate the two kissing catapellars over his eyes and I said "And then there were two" so he laughed and it was good so then my cousin Kellie trimmed the whole thing on the long setting and they looked good then she insisted on doing them on the short setting and it would have been good if there weren't bald spots in his eyebrow but we didn't know cuz the long eyebrow hair covered them so that is y I m in the "dog house" for saying these words "We have a Mirco Touch" and so now there r several people in the dog house but for Scotty Kellie is in a jail cell! If u could have seen his reaction you wouldn't believe it and he had a right to b angry. My mom fixed the problem though... I won't tell u how but she fixed it. But it really would have looked good if there weren't the u know bald spots....................

      Ok today was good in general. I took an Earth Sciens test and it was pretty easy. BUT, i took a really hard history test and u know how i was absent last week well... i was missing the notes so i got them on wednesday. So today i took the test, good thing the wench gave me time 2 study she is so generous about those things! NOT!!! I kind of hate her right now. And the first history test w/o a study guide was conviniently this one by the way.    After school i had a volleyball game at our school cuz i'm on the team. duh! And you know not like i am trying to toot my own horn but TOOT!!! TOOT!!! I did great in the game, i was all over the place. I already m as the setter but this game i was really all over the place. To prove it, one of my saves i dove and hit it over and when Mr. Arm met Mr. Floor and Mr.Scab was in the way things got rough 4 Mr. Scab. Basically that means i had a scab on my arm from floorburn at yesterdays practice and i re-opened it in todays game, so it's kind of a hole in my arm-lovely isn't it. Well we won 4 out of five games and obviously won the match. :) happy!

      Well today was good i went over my cousin Kellie's house and we were watching T.V. and playing w/ her babie Joseph. Kellie-fun, smart, cool, lives one block away from me. Joseph-6 months old, possibly the cutest baby i've ever seen, and funny. We also did a packet for my Confirmation and let me tell u they r really crakin down or something cuz those questions were HARD! I also finished a book i read 4 English called Go Ask Alice, if u haven't read it already then check it out of the library cuz it is really worth the time!!! Well school w/ new hair is tommorow wish me luck!!! :) I'll need it!!! I LOVE EVANESCENCE!!!! They r sooooooo awesome!!!! Anyway i will leave u with the lyrics from an Evanescence song it is from the song Everybody's Fool off of the Fallen album    Everybody's Fool  perfect by nature icons of self indulgence just what we all need more lies about a world that  never was and never will be have you no shame don't you see me you know you've got everybody fooled  look here she comes now bow down and stare in wonder oh how we love you no flaws when you're pretending but now i know she  never was and never will be you don't know how you've betrayed me and somehow you've got everybody fooled  without the mask where will you hide can't find yourself lost in your lie   i know the truth now i know who you are and i don't love you anymore  it never was and never will be you're not real and you can't save me somehow now you're everybody's fool   It is a very true song in many ways so i thought i would share it w/ u! ok BYE!

      Yesterday I made possibly the worst mistake of my young life!!! In all of my 13 years on this planet I don't know of something as terribly wrong as this. I stayed home Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday (today). Yesterday was the funeral for my aunts x-husband who was shot in the face. Today is the burial. Oh and get this it was OPEN CASKET!!!! It was crazy he had so much make up on and it was just weird and sad my aunt was like a walking zombie. Ok now back to the worst mistake of my life. Now I have done some bad things involving my hair like 5 years ago when over the summers I got my head buzzed! Well this is almost the same thing!!! I am more sick than I thought I was. Because I trusted my brother to cut my hair! And he cuts a lot of people's hair and I told him now that I am wearing it forward I wanted the same thing just shorter. He was almost finished when the clip on the buzzer that guides the length of the hair getting cut fell of and a huge gouge came out of my hair it is currently a skin fade and the top is SOOO short and the ONLY thing I can do w/ it is forward w/ a flip in the front it looks ok he did a good job but NOT 4 ME I mean I would never ever get my hair like that! EVER!!! And I can't help but be depressed. No I am not gay and I am not a girl but it is a big deal when half of my head looks like five o'clock shadow!!!!! I am about ready to jump off a cliff of make my parents get me home schooled until it grows out. To all of my friends/relatives reading this u know how long my hair is right now. So just imagine me trying to make out w/ a lawn mower that was on and getting my hair caught in it and BUZZED OFF!!! I just don't know what to do I can't handle all of this stress and just garbage I mean I have changed my hair twice in a month and I think if one more thing happens I am going to become a dropout or something! Ok I like to exaggerate but guess what if your hair was long 4 a guy I mean it's not like I had hair down to my shoulders or something but it was like 3 or 4 inches long on the top and I was putting gel in it and doing it forward and I was just getting comfortable w/ it and now this!!! I mean my hair looks like a cross between the length of a 70 year old mans and an orange's hair and oranges don't have hair so do the math!!! Ok I'm exaggerating a little bit but it is sooooo short if I c either Arianna or Liz this weekend (unlikely) but u 2 will FREAK OUT!!!! I AM FREAKING OUT!!! OBVIOUSLY!!! BUT REALLY I AM GOING TO GO INSANE!!!! I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT IS MY HAIR!!!  I think that I am going to ask my mom to take me to the wig store so I don't look like a soldier!!! Ok still exaggerating but I mean I just can't believe this I am going to go insane!!! But thanks the Lord in Heaven that my hair grows fast!!! If u could have seen me when my brother was cutting it u would be hysterical laughing because all of the things I was saying were quite funny if I do say so myself but this is in NO way funny I am freaking out!!! U know that commercial for Shick Quatro razors and it says "It's 5:00 do you know where your shadow is?" well I can tell u where it is ON MY HEAD!!!!!   Ok another thing going on in my or more so a friends life. One of my friends I will not name names but I have introduced them in this blog. Now they ice skate and they have been for a long time but they decided to quit. Maybe it was the best thing for them but I think that if they are really passionate about it than they should continue doing it. They said they were tired of getting up at 4 in the morning and of everything. But I think like they said they get picked on at school cuz they get 2 miss 2 periods so they can skate and they come in late. Anyway I think they are just tired of it all and I am not trying to tell them what to do at all BUT I do believe if u like something and want to do it I think that u should no matter what people say or think about u. Like for example I play the piano and this doesn't happen but if people picked on me at school I wouldn't care because I like it and they'd only be picking on me because they can even read a book let alone notes on a sheet of music. Anyway, I still will not tell who this person is and I repeat I am not trying to convince them to do something they don't want to I am just saying that maybe if u love ice skating then it might be worth it to stay w/ it now remember I am NOT trying to convince u to rejoin!!!   In closing I'd like to say that life is to short for u to do things just because other people want u to do it. u have to make u'rself happy and if u do that then u really have succeeded in life so to everyone reading this don't do things cuz people tell u that u should, do them cuz u want to.

      WOW!!! That  Evanescence  concert was so amazing i can't even put it into words...ok i kinda just did but it really was the absolut best concert i have ever been to even though it had stiff competition: Spice Girls and Britney Spears. lol! But it was sooooooooooo awesome but it was at a place that had no seats so it was standing and there was 2 hours of opening bands. The first 1 was so bad it was heavy metal and the bass made me vibrate up to my throat!!! lol But the second was pretty good but i wanted  EVANESCENCE  cuz after 2 hours i got a tad bit anxious. But when they came on all the pain in my legs went away! Ok well not really, they still were killing me and i felt dehydrated but they were  SOOOOOOOOO  awesome ok gotta go eat dinner bye! And to any other Lord of the Rings fans out there, there are sites that translate u'r name in 2 middle earth names. My elf name is Eärymir. Yes Arianna i know u'r elvish name because u told it 2 me 10,000 times and after u finish reading this u'r gonna put it one the comments! ok the site is: http://www.lotruk.com/nametranslator/index.html     Well have fun finding out u'r middle Earth names!!! lol BYE!!!

Here r the lyrics:    Broken    I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away You've gone away, you don't feel me, anymore  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open  And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away You've gone away You don't feel me here anymore   Now i'm done w/ u ok begone!!!

      Well I know that is weird, so I will explain. Last night was yet another gay dance at my school...but I made myself a promise that I will tell Hannah, but I didn't...well I didn't tell her or ask her to dance. Why? I'll tell you I have a source that told me she liked this guy jared  in my grade, and that was a while back but anyway...it's confirmed she likes jared...that that that ju ju bean! Ok ok controlling my anger. but it's not even really anger it's more like disappointment. But I am still going to cast the spell of ju ju on jared so he turns into a big fat ju ju bean. And if anyone is wondering y I am calling people ju ju beans that new phrase is care of Lizzie. Anyway like the title says it's good that I know but I still think I should tell her just so that she knows. But like the title of my blog says 'Confusion' I am once again confused. And like any confused person I need advice so advice goes in the comment box.   On to other topics...Lauren! Why the heck do u like pizza topping?!? Pizza topping- chad- this retard!!! OMG!!! I've met piles of dog droppings that r more intelligent than this retard and yet she likes him. He has acne and is nasty he's a burnout and I can't stand him when she worships the ground he walks on. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!! I was at my locker getting books out of it he walks by and asks who's locker is the locker 5 down from mine and I reply I don't know then he asks who's is the one 4 away from min and I once again say I don't know then he walks up 2 mine and keep in mind I am still taking books out of it and says who's is this so I say what is disbelief of his low IQ and he once again asks who's is this and I say mine...yeah so u pretty much understand that bologna sandwiches are more intelligent than him. So I ask Lauren PLEASE COME BACK FROM THE DARK SIDE!!!!!!!

      Well I am a confirmed Catholic and proud of it. My sponsor Kellie gave me a really nice cross and I made quite a pretty penny... :) But it's not about that. I felt great all day and that is what it's about...being accepted into the catholic faith as an adult not a child. Today was a really great day and I am quite happy that I got to make my confirmation and I am glad Kellie sponsored me.   Anyway...that is pretty much all today is...except I had a thought that is quite obvious. Why not just tell Hannah? I mean what have I got to loose? Right? NOTHING!!! I have nothing to loose and the fact of the matter is I have been being a retard!!! I was being a sissy...because I was afraid of rejection but guess what if things don't work out then I move on but I can't move on if I never tell her that I liked her. So why don't I tall her? EXACTLY!!! I was a sissy...but I am determined that I will tell her because I am not going to be someone that never does anything EVER about my feelings because it could become something...and I can't try again or restart because this is real life and I have already wasted enough time and I don't want to wonder about anything I want no I need to KNOW!!! So I would like suggestions for how to tell her even though I know how I walk up to her "Hi Hannah I need to talk to you"  "Ok what's up?"  "Well I have to tell you something important...well I have really liked you since fifth grade and I know your not officially supposed to go out with anyone until your 16 but I just need to know how you feel about me"  "Well to be honest..." There are three things that could happen here 1. "...I like you to" 2. "...sorry but I don't like you that way" 3. "...eww" Ok 1 and 2 are the most probable ok it's basically 1 or 2 because she's not the type of person to say eww but obviously 1 is favorable. But I can also have a friends ask or tell her...whatever happends happends but I will know!!!

      Well Florida was awesome!!! And that last post was really gay, but i was exited 2 go to Florida but i promise that i will NOT be that retarted anymore. something that has been bothering me is me brother. I mean not him him but what he is doing with his life. We got along good on the Florida vacation but i wonder what he is goint to become sometimes well more than sometimes...a lot!!! He just doesn't think about anything at all. He is so...i don't think there is a word for it. But through all of the anger he has put me and my parents and everyone around him i shouldn't give a flying fig about him but i do. I worry bout him and it makes me wonder about myself a lot. For example the other day i found myself wondering about whether i would choose him as my best man but in my heart i know that as of now he hasn't been there for me enough. I just hope that he doesn't amount to nothing because he is soon going to find out if he annoys all the people that care about him than they are going to abandon him. He is just so annoying sometimes he can make my skin crawl and my flesh itch! I feel like i am hallucinating sometimes i mean he drives me so insane that i can't wait until the day i don't ever have to see or speak to him again. But i know i can't do that but i will NOT be the poor slob that is giving him money or anything else that he wants i will care about him but if he ever comes to me for money i will tell him these exact words: "Well Mike guess what! Maybe if you cared about school and didn't skip and decide not to get a good education maybe you would have two nickels to rub together!!!" . I don't know about him sometimes...no not sometimes all the time.   On a happier note every comic book lover's dream is coming true!!! City of Heroes is coming out!!! It's an online game so obviously you play w/ other people. It's a huge RPG (role playing game) and i can't wait 4 it!!! I probably wouldn't even know about it if Scott (my cousin) hadn't told me about it. Wow, i don't thin i even introduced Scott in my blog!!! I am ashamed actually because he is one of my favorite cousins, so idk y i havn't introduced him well w/e. But as always i'll give a description,  Scott - he is smart, great on computers and games, fun to hang out w/, really really funny, and he's also a friend not just a cousin. Anyway thanks Scott i wouldn't know about a lot of the best games out there if you hadn'y told me about them. He actually helped get me into things that i now love, Star Wars, X-men, Spiderman, most marvel things...   I have also been loving this song and i've been listening to it all the time so here it is it's called Meant to Live by Switchfoot.   Meant to Live  Fumbling his confidence  And wond’ring why the world has passed him by  Hoping that he’s meant for more than arguments  And failed attempts to fly, fly   We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside  Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside   Dreaming about Providence And whether mice or men have second tries  Maybe we’ve been livin with our eyes half open  Maybe we’re bent and broken, broken   We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside  Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside   We want more than this world’s got to offer  We want more than this world’s got to offer  We want more than the wars of our fathers  And everything inside screams for second life   We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live  We were meant to live  I love that song a lot.    The novel is being worked on! Remember i rold you about  novels that i was writing well yeah the first is started. And i like them i was telling Scott the first one and it managed to creep him out which is good cuz i didn't want some wannabe scary story!!! Ok well now i must do as much homework as i can!!! Teachers that give homework over SPRING BREAK should be burned at the stake cuz only a heartless witch could do a thing like that. Ok well off to do homework...grrrrrrrrrrrr

      Avril Lavigne's new album came out on the 25th I am going to get it. I liked the last album, "Let Go" but I have heard the first single from it "Don't Tell Me" and I think it's pretty good. But that is not why I entitled this entry "Under My Skin", I wish it was, I wish that it could be something frivolous or stupid like that but it isn't and it probably never will be. One of my "friends" is under my skin. He drives you to the point where you find yourself saying "hey I'm young and 25 years to life isn't that long" and then you snap out of it and you are still saying "not that long...25 years...life...". Yes I know this may come off as a psychotic episode but it isn't. This person used to be my friend in fourth grade and then he pissed me off and we stopped being friends. And we started again, and if it weren't for me he probably wouldn't be going out with the person he is going out with now, and he really doesn't deserve her, she doesn't know about the horny, obnoxious, annoying, moron that he is, all he talks about is having sex w/ her and it's really annoying. And you know what it's not easy to listen to when he is talking about girl B like that and I can not stand it I really can't and I feel like killing him. No, I feel like hurting him more than that, so I'll hurt him THEN kill him! I really am considering telling his girlfriend everything about him that is bad and trying to stop their relationship. Cruel, yes, but he does not deserve someone so nice, funny, and all around cool because he is not like her, he is not decent, and she is my friend and he is not anymore. I remember why I couldn't stand being around him: HE GETS UNDER MY SKIN!!!   Ok on the plus side I haven't blogged in a few days cuz I was on my 8th grade trip to Williamsburg, where we visited colonial Williamsburg, went to Busch gardens and went to an aquarium in Baltimore. But on the trip is where I got even more mad at the first "friend" I was mad at and got mad at the "new friend". So I had to blog about that and I'm sure that there will be more because right now I m so amazingly mad at the chipmunk and the defective lab rat that I can't even stand it it's annoying me just writing about it!!! Well that's all 4 2day, I'll complain 2 u guys at a later date...bye.

      Grrrrrrrrrr is what happens when I think of all the time I wasted! Grrrrrrr is when I see her in the hallway and don't tell her how much I care about her! Grrrrrrrr is the feeling I get when I realize school I over June 25 and I need to do something about it too! Grrrrrrrr is when my mom tells me she talked to her mom and her mom said "Hannah always says Anthony is such a nice boy, and he dresses so nice" (thanks to Abercrombie and Fitch). Grrrrrrr is what I feel every time I see her sitting next to me at lunch! Grrrrrrr is every time she jumps on my lap or hangs on my shoulder! Grrrrrrrr is every time I see her! Why Grrrrrrrr when I see her? Because I haven't told her yet and it's really beginning to eat me up inside. I need to tell her, I really physically need to. If she read this blog or if I wrote her a letter this is what it would be:   Dear Hannah,  I have to tell you something and it is possibly the most important thing in my life right now; you. You see I have admired you from a far for so long and this year we have become friends and I have enjoyed every second of it, but I don't know if you know or not but you really mean a lot to me. You are so beautiful inside and out and you are so intelligent, it's really amazing. Hannah I need to tell you that I like you so much but I have such a big fear of rejection that I have hesitated every chance I have ever had to tell you. Hannah, you mean so much to me and I have waited for so long to tell you that it seems unreal. Hannah I feel like I love you, I think I do. I do. Hannah you are amazing and I wanted to tell you all of this and I hope that you feel that same way. You probably don't because I know that you liked Jared but I really need to know. Please tell me. And if you don't have feelings for me than I want to stay friends.            Love, Anthony   Yep that's what I'd say. GRRRRRRRRRRRRr!!!  Anyway today I am sick GRRRRRRRR!!! I missed Madam Tousaud's wax museum. I wanted to go, yes I am an art geek. But anyway I want to go to Lauren's later because we were planning this big movie marathon thing and it'll rock I want to go I gotta ask my mom. That all folks.

      Why do you have to add to the weight crashing down on me called my tolerance level? Why are you becoming what you are not? "Friend" you have to look at yourself long and hard and ask if this is you. It is not. We have been best friends since the third grade and now you are making me get more and more mad at you. You are eating away at our friendship. You are not being a friend. You are being the opposite of a friend. You are being Ali. Why do I compare you to Ali? Because Ali has no real friends, sad yes, but not entirely everyone else's fault. She is the most annoying, irritating, and completely unbearable person I have met in my life. As cruel as that sounds she is so annoying and she does not have the right to do any of the things that she does, which in her eyes are cool and make her cool, but in reality they are just plain stupid. I ask you to tell me why you are becoming Ali? Why? I know you are not her but guess what as much as you might not want to admit it, you are. You are doing things that hurt people, people that care about you. It is probably because you hate your dad and all that stuff, but guess what, you have problems yes BUT you are not the only one with them. And I am sick and tired of having to deal with you and your attitude. You are my friends and I know that is NOT who you are. You were a nice person, but now she is buried inside of you and are waiting to come out. They are lying there dormant and I am trying to wake them up, because it's ok to have emotions and it's ok to have feelings, that is fine. But what you are doing is not expressing yourself it's hiding yourself. I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU WHO TO BE OR WHAT YOU SHOULD BE LIKE!!! What I am trying to do is let you know how I feel and how annoying it is to see my best friend turn into someone that I don't know. As shmaltzie and lame as that might seem it's true. And some of you are probably saying what a moron I am right now to be talking like this. BUT I AM NOT. I am very smart and very tired. Tired of being treated like dirt by you. Friends do NOT treat one another like dirt, they help one another. I want to stay friends with you but I do not want to deal with this! I have had it! I am done with dealing with it! And I don't want to flip out on you or explode on you but if you do not stop I will. I will. And so I am telling you now my friend, do not let this be the end of our friendship. We are friends and you know it and I have been there for you and I have helped you but I have never until recently been ridiculed by you. And I won't be anymore. I won't be. This is something I need to tell you. I am not an accessory. I am not to be taken for granted. I am your friend. I am practically your brother and I am probably closer to you than your brothers but I don't want to be mad at you like brothers. I want to be your best friend, but I do not want to be annoyed by you. I want to have a great friend and right now you are lacking in that. BUT THIS IS  NOT  THE END IT IS THE BEGINNING TO OUR RENEWED FRIENDSHIP AND I WANT TO BE FRIENDS FOREVER LIKE WE PROMISED!!! AND NOTHING CAN BRAKE THAT PROMISE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WON'T LET THAT PROMISE BREAK AND I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW THAT I WON'T LET IT BREAK EITHER!!!                                                                              Love (in a caring friend way),                                          Your best friend

      Girl A- Hannah, the most beautiful girl in our school, smart, funny, fun to be with and all around great. Girl B- friend, she is funny fun and cool, fun to be with but one of my good friends likes her A LOT!!! Girl C- another friend, funny, fun, and easy to talk to, but only friends. Girl A I can see myself with, Girl B I could kinda see myself with and Girl C I can't really see myself with but who knows.   What do you think? I think I am insane, really insane. I don't even know if I like like Girls B or C but I think I have a better chance with them. But then when I'm about to give up on Hannah I see her and I say a phrase that I say pretty often: "Here we go again!" and the truth is if I can't stop liking Hannah the way I do that means that I am not ready to give her up but I really need to do something because I got one shot at this thing called life and I do not want to wonder, I want to know! So I need to tell Hannah during the next few weeks because school is almost over and we are going to different high schools!!! NO!!! But if anything happens I know it will be ok, we don't have to go to the same school.   Just when I think I might be able to drop my feelings for Hannah I almost do and then I get a backhand telling me that I can't give up because I have liked her for too long to just give up and leave my feelings alone and never do anything about them. I fear that if I am too much of a sissy to do anything about it I won't be able to do anything but guess what if you want something you go and get it! And I have to go get her or at least try, but I have heard from her mouth that she likes jared but that was a while ago. Also I don't know if I should take them as flirts or as a friendly gesture because she always holds on to my shoulders and stuff like that or falls on me and tells me to carry her, that type of thing and I don't know what to take it as because Hannah is a very touchy person, by that I mean she always sits on people and stuff and I don't think I could be enough for her. I don't think I look good enough I mean I'm not an ugly nerd that shines his pocket protector or anything but I don't think I am that great looking I really don't know what I look like. Siobhan said I'm not ugly but I think she might be saying that to make me feel better, and I don't know what to believe someone please give me a reality check or something cuz I don't know what I look like so tell me! People that know me tell me because I need confidence or something because she is so beautiful and I just don't feel like I am up to her level. What level am I? I don't know. I am not asking you to tell me if you don't want to but the people that do know me tell me if I am a monster because I don't want to go up to this angelic girl and be like hey I like you and have her run away. Even though I know she wouldn't do that because that's not who she is, but please I need input so put your input in the comments.

      Ok I ask you what is friendship? Friendship is when people care about each other, help each other, and support you and sometimes save you. They know your strong qualities and your weak qualities, and they help you to make the weak qualities become strong ones. They do not expose, laugh at, make fun of, or anything of that nature to your faults they help you make the fault something you can deal with. And to people that are really my friends I hope that they all know I would never do anything to hurt them and I would never really mean anything like saying "your stupid" or stuff like that. Yes me and my friends joke around a lot but there is a line and once you have crossed it, it is hard to get back to the other side. Right now one of my friends have crossed it. I'm not going to say who but if this person appends to be reading this they will know who they are. This friend has always been best friends with me since third grade. We get in fights sometimes but make up in like a second. But recently she is becoming something that I don't want her to become she is becoming more and more annoying every day and I fear she is making the transformation into someone like a particular girl in my school. Well I'm not sure if she's really a girl I have seen goats more civilized and goats that are easier to be with. I am going to refer to this person as the goat. My friends and I (by friends I mean all of my friends) have always ignore the goat but it is very difficult. But my friend whom I am just a tad bit perturbed with is getting to be where she is almost the goat. And if this person thinks that the things that she is doing is funny, well she thinks they are hysterical are  NOT  in any way humorous. They are not things that "friends" should do! She and the goat made little "diagrams" of each of us and picked out every little thing that they thought was imperfect or "cool" to make fun of. Well guess what, it is  NOT  funny. It is so amazingly ridiculous I can't even believe that something so retarded could escape from the mind of my "friend". I, quite frankly, am fed up and tired of dealing with it. And if it continues than this "friend" and I are going to have some problems. And you know what "friend" there are so many things that I could say to and about you that would make you fall to your knees in shock of how cold I could be. Well guess what that is not who I am and if you make me stoop to your level there is definitely a real problem and I am not going to deal with a little ignorant wench if I don't have to and I don't. But this person is my friend and I really don't want to do that, because I know that is  NOT  who she is. She was always cool with me she used to like me, but guess what babe, we are in eighth grade and it's time to grow up! I am sorry but I am not perfect and almost every thing in that book was not even a flaw just something you can make fun of, my arms, my cross, my hair. Guess what, my arms are hairy because I am Italian and the only people that shave their arms are gay (which I am not) body builders, or my brother who is not a body builder but questionable. My cross, is beautiful and if you have a problem with me being a religious person then that's pretty sad. And my hair rules so you can just shutup about that because I don't even have to open my mouth about that one! Guess what "friend" I care about you a lot, but that doesn't mean you can walk all over me because you take me for granted and think you will always have me. Well this Anthony does not deal with people like you so get your priorities in order!

      Ok ready? Now what do you think of when you hear the word evil? I think of darkness. What do you think of when you hear the word good? I think of light. Now in the ongoing battle of good vs. evil good is supposed to always overcome, I wish that were true about everything and not just something that appends in the movies. Think about it one evil person can kill thousands of people, the World Trade Center for example. What I am trying to get at is how can only one (good or evil) win? Darkness (evil) consumes light (good), light in turn brightens up darkness. What do we learn from this? That in the ever present battle of good vs. evil there really is no winner, sure one side may win a battle, but I'm talking big picture; the war. How can only one win when both can defeat each other? They can't, because behind every evil mind there are loyal followers dedicated to the same cause. But behind every good person there are other good people that the good person up. So there are always going to be good people and there are always going to be evil people and that is balance. But the scale tips in ones favor all the time. The only difference from a good leader and a bad leader is the good leader has people backing him up every step of the way and make him stronger in the long run, while evil people have people backing them up sure, but those people are forced or in it for the money or are plotting against that person. I'm not saying bad things don't happen to good people but I am saying good people have something that makes all the difference:  FRIENDS . And that's why in the long run I believe good will overcome evil. The fate of everyone is in the hands of God but God forgives but he doesn't help evil people. If they are sorry yes he does forgive them but there is one thing that I know for sure. Good people will always be happier because of the greatest gift a person can give of receive true friendship, one that never ends, and that is what separates good from evil...besides evil people's devious minds. But my question to you is not a long one but it is one that means more than a normal question. What kind of a person are you? Are you the kind like me that believes good wile overcome evil in the long run, or are you the other kind that believes that evil will prevail? Whatever your answer may be remember this: even though it may look like a battle was lost doesn't mean that it was. Any questions, thoughts, comments, concerns, put 'em in the comment box!

      I used to think that having "The Life" was being wealthy, cool, having tons of friends, being popular, having a gorgeous girlfriend, and things of that nature but I realize that it is not. Those things mean nothing! Why? Because when you have all of those things you think that's all you want and all you need but people like that almost every single one of them end up unhappy and alone. Why? Because other people leech off of them trying to grab some of the limelight by being that cool person's best friend. That means nothing.  The only thing that you need are friends real friends ones that care about me and ones that I care about. And I have those friends, I have friends that care about me and I care about my friends. I guess happiness is judged by an individuals points of view but I realized something that some people never realize, not just that happiness is in the eye of the beholder but happiness is different for everyone. You can not make everyone happy you just can't. The only thing you can do in life is make yourself happy. I am happy. I realized I have such great parents they don't scream at me, they don't fight with me, they don't fight with each other. People that feel sorry for themselves usually have a good reason, but people that feel sorry for themselves for so long feel that they have no escape from it, no escape from the unhappiness. But the reality of it is that you can't expect things to just happen you can't expect someone to save you from your unhappiness, you have to save yourself. And the people that don't escape their unhappiness can blame some people but ultimately, they are responsible.   "But where will you go With no one left to save you from yourself You can't escape the truth  I realize you're afraid But you can't reject the whole world You can't escape You won't escape You can't escape  You don't want to escape "    -Where Will You Go- by, Evanescence   That is the truth. People that give up on themselves have either been crushed and hurt and restrained for so long that they either can't escape, won't escape, or don't want to escape. How could someone not want to escape, they are afraid of change because they have been used to one thing for so long they feel that change will destroy them. But it won't, change will save them.   "The Life" is nothing more than an imaginative story. Anyone can have the life. All you have to do is change. I don't have to change. I am lucky enough to have what I define "The Life" as. But my life is not good for everyone, but it is good for me. I have the life.

      What a mood I was in this morning and through the day. I was so happy, the bird were singing, the wind was blowing, and the flowers were ablooming! I went to school got a hundred in everything and then the most wonderfulest thing happened... I WOKE UP!!!  I had such an annoying day everything was annoying people were annoying me teachers were annoying me everything was annoying me even some of my friends. I was just ready to flip out on a teacher I flipped out on Arianna. She was babbling and being well her, as usual, when she asked me if I knew drew Carey and the show Whose Line is it Anyway? So I said sarcastically no I don't know what that is and she said Oh my gosh u have never heard of Drew Carey or Whose Line is it Anyway? Like oh my gosh like oh my gosh like oh my gosh and I mumbled it's called sarcasm learn it memorize it and use it. So she didn't hear me so she's still saying oh my gosh like how can you not have seen that show like oh my gosh. So I yelled in the middle of the classroom "RETARD IT'S CALLED SARCASM!!!" the teacher said nothing, the class was dismissing anyway. So my day was full of magical magic that mystified me and everyone around me by being graced with my bewilderingly wonderful presence, and then  they  woke up!

      It's not like I am so insecure that I can't do anything. I have fun and stuff, actually I went to two parties yesterday one that Hannah was at too. I don't know what is going to happen, I think it might just be an experience that I had in junior high, but I wish it wasn't. I am also starting to have mixed feelings about a friend of mine. She I really pretty, and we have been friends for a few years, but now I think that might be starting to like her. And on top of that I might be getting feeling for another girl that I know. I don't know they are both good friends and I am beginning to wonder if the right person could be my friend. Or they could be, to quote Chloe from Smallville, "the girl of my dreams masquerading as my best friend". I don't know. I though I had everything straight, but I guess I was wrong. I guess I was wrong about a lot of things. Like in fifth grade I always thought me and Hannah would just end up together one way or another but I didn't think of what I might have had to do to get her to love me too. I hope she isn't just a learning experience, I hope that we can be friends or that something can happen. She is so cool and she is just herself and nobody else and she does not try to be something or someone she's not. That is such a great thing. I feel like I am just getting stuck on her and I am gong to like her and maybe not even see her but I don't want that to happen because if it does, than she would be that "first love" and just the stepping stone to high school, the girl that made my middle school experience even better. Middle school wasn't so bad now, as I am living it, but it's the place nobody wants to be again. And I know I would never want to be there again. So much has happened this year alone that I never imagined. It's going to be hard to let that go of this whole experience. I have met some of the nicest most beautiful people (not just outside but inside) that I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. And it is because of these people that I am as strong as I am today. I can get through anything, I know I can. I may not be ready for it but that doesn't mean I won't do fine in it. When I think about it I realize that I am not so unprepared, I can do this, and so can everyone else. The truth is that most people never know what they can accomplish in life until they just try something or just do it. Do you think Donald Trump thought he'd be one of the richest and most successful people in the world when he got into real estate. No. He just thought it'd be a good job. People never expect half of the things they do for themselves. I can do whatever I want. And so can everyone else, Scott for example. Scott your going to college in August, you are so smart, and you have the potential to go so much further than you can ever imagine. I know you can do great things, and even though you may not feel ready for college, you are. Not just Scott but all of my friends. People don't expect themselves to go so far but they can. I can. I can only hope that the people I know and meet and all the places I go can teach me something. I can only hope that I grow and learn from my experiences, I can only hope that I accomplish all of the great things that I can do. I know that I can do great things, all I can do is hope, hope that I get to do them. Insecurity is something that I deal with, so does everyone else, but as nervous or insecure or unstable as you may be, you can never let that take control of you. It can take control, shatter, and destroy someone's life but don't let it happen to you. You don't have to be ruled by it, that's the thing about this world, it's so cruel, and has gotten to be so dangerous and evil. I wish this world could be like mine. My world is some place far off in my imagination. That's the thing, I am blessed with an unspeakably large imagination, I can pull so many things from it. That is why I want to write, that is why I want to draw, I want to share my imagination and my gifts with the world or at least some people because I think that might be what I can do. I think that I can do something great for the world and myself. I want people to see that there is always some place that you can be you, and this world is not the most embracing place for people like me. That's why I retreat to my imagination, and that's why I hide myself in my world, because nobody can change my world. That is why it's mine. This is my world, a poem written by me.    ~My World~    Why is the world so scary and evil? What has become of the Eden it once was,  The ideal place is one of beauty, It is always warm and things are clear, That is my world perfect and clean, Clean of hatred and clean of mean, My world is amazing,  But too bad it's only mine, I can't share it with the world, But if I could what a world it would be.

      Listen, I know it may seem tacky to put these lyrics on here, mainly because we are only graduating from eighth grade. But I listened to this song really for the first time in years. Even though it used to be played all the time I really listened, and I was almost in tears because I don't know if I can handle leaving my friends! So here they are, the lyrics:  Graduation (Friends Forever) by Vitamin C  And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same But when we leave this year we won't be coming back No more hanging out cause we're on a different track And if you got something that you need to say You better say it right now cause you don't have another day Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down These memories are playing like a film without sound And I keep thinking of that night in June  I didn't know much of love But it came too soon And there was me and you And then we got real blue Stay at home talking on the telephone We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair And this is how it feels  As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come Whatever We will still be Friends Forever  So if we get the big jobs And we make the big money When we look back now Will our jokes still be funny? Will we still remember everything we learned in school? Still be trying to break every single rule Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man? Will Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan? I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly And this is how it feels  La, la, la, la: Yeah, yeah, yeah La, la, la, la: We will still be friends forever  Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now? Can we survive it out there? Can we make it somehow? I guess I thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round? Will these memories fade when I leave this town I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly   I really am beginning to understand that song, I mean I used to hate it to be honest, but now, it's different. I am starting to realize what it will feel like. I know I really don't know, and I know I am really not prepared or ready, but to quote my class' valedictorian Vanessa:  "It's ok to be afraid of change, but you should never shelter yourself from it" . That is so true, Vanessa is wise beyond her years, really she is. That is a line in her speech which will be read in about six hours, when I graduate. I know I am not ready for graduating twelfth grade and I am glad I don't have to do it now, but I am going into high school and sometimes I wonder if I am ready even for that!

      Tonight was my night. Alana told Hannah that I liked her. Tonight was the dance. Tonight  I  danced with  Hannah ! It was so cool! She wasn't bugged out or anything, I didn't think she'd be she's so cool! She asked me! I almost died! I was so happy it was incredible. I don't know what it means, it might mean she wanted to make feel good because she knew I like her. Maybe she likes me. I don't know. It was so cool, we had a really cool conversation and we were both pretty comfortable. Arianna said she was watching and she said she can read body language and she said we both were comfortable, she said we were looking at each other (well duh we were talking!), and she said we were really close. I don't know what to make of it, I would like more than anything to believe that she likes me, but I don't know if it's true. I think I have a chance, I mean she's really really cool. When she first asked me I thought I was going to pass out! I felt my face get warm and than it was like a conversation but my hands were on her hips and hers were on my shoulders. She hasn't been dancing with a lot of people lately. Konrad, asked her to  dance and they did but I watched and they didn't talk at all and they looked painfully uncomfortable. I don't know, I would like more than anything for her to like me too. On Honor Roll night her mom gave me a kiss and said congratulations for being ninth in my class, and Hannah and I talked a bit that night. I don't know if that was her mom's way of saying your smart and you can date my daughter, or my daughter liked you ask her out you dumb boy, or just hey congratulations on getting ninth in your class. I don't know. But now more than ever I know I like Hannah. B, C, D, nope! A! Hannah! She is just so cool and I am so happy and sure of things when I'm around her. I definitely know now more than ever that I like Hannah, I have the whole time, and I do now. But what is going to kill me is if nothing happens between us ( knock on wood, literally I am knocking on wood and typing at the same time ) than it will be so hard to move on without her! I don't know what will happen, all I can do is pray, that maybe there is a slight chance she might like me!   Also I think I might be able to leave my school on a good note with everyone, even Lauren. Maybe. Idk.   I am proud of me for not fainting when she asked me! I thought I might have pissed myself, wait wait I did! lol j/k! But it was so amazing! It made well...my life. Bye!

      I am done playing around. I am serious about this now. How serious? So serious that this is the entry. This is where it appends. This is it. It's time. Hannah this is something I have been needing to tell you for years, and it is time now that I have no more, I need to tell you so many things.    Dear Hannah,   Since kindergarten we have known each other, and in kindergarten we were friends. We weren't in each other's class again until fifth grade and that's when it happened. I started to like you! I have since fifth grade! We are graduating this year and I can't let myself give up because I was afraid to tell you. I wish I could have told you in person, but I don't think I'd be able to get the words out because I melt around you. You are amazing, your gorgeous, intelligent, and such a nice caring fun person. I feel like if I don't tell you I will never be able to and I can't let that happen. Then I will never know if something could have happened. I don't know if you like me the way I like you, I know that you liked Jared at the last dance, but maybe you have changed your mind since then. I am not trying to convince you to like me, and I don't want you to feel bad for me, I want to know if you like me, really genuinely like me like I genuinely like you. Hannah, you have made our boring little school so great for me, coming to school I know the only good thing that can come out of this is seeing my friends and seeing you. I never thought I would feel like this for someone when I was so young. I mean I am not an obsessed stalker but I really care about you Hannah and I couldn't leave our little school not knowing what could have happened between us. It seems like a dream to me, I mean you are so smart, beautiful, and all around great! And I don't know if I am really any of those things, but I know what I am. I am someone who really cares about you. I don't know if you knew that I liked you or not but I do, and I wanted to let you know before we graduate. I wish that I told you sooner, I wish I had done a lot of things, but I do not regret telling you this at all. I think this is the best thing that has happened to me in, well, my life. I am facing my fears. I don't know exactly what they are, rejection, nervousness, or just being a chicken, but whatever the case is I know that I really like you and care about you and before we might not ever see each other again, I want to tell you how much I like you. Please tell me how you feel about me, if you just want to be friends it's fine but I just want to know so I don't have to wonder.   Love,  Anthony  P.S. You can talk to me in school, in the comment box, or on the phone (you have my number from honor society), but please just talk to me. Now you know my big secret (that half the school knows about), what you make of it is entirely up to you!

      That day that I talk about...that day when I won't be confused...that day is today. I am done being confused. I am done. I'm not confused anymore. I like Hannah soooo much!!! I hate Lauren. I love (in a friends caring way) my friends. I will  NOT  wonder what could have been. I will know what could have been. I am going to give Hannah the address to this blog. I need to give her the address to this blog. This is the way she will know how I feel about her. I need her to know how I feel about her. She will know how I feel about her. I love her. I really do. I thought there was going to be a discrepancy about who I liked more Girl A or Girl B, but there isn't. There never really was. I always knew who I liked; Hannah. She is amazing. Talking to her is like being lifted into somewhere I have never been before. All of my feelings are obvious and clear. No discrepancy. I don't feel adequate to her because she is so amazing but if she likes me as much as I like her I know I am adequate. She will get the address to this blog. She will know how I feel about her. I am not confused, that period is over. I am gonna have the best summer of my life and no one is gonna take that away from me. I will go into the summer knowing I told Hannah how I felt about her, I will go into the summer knowing that only my real friends are still there for me, I will go into the summer looking forward to four parties (including mine and my friends), Six Flags here I come! Pool here I come! Summer here I come! I am not the same person I used to be, I am Anthony!  HEAR ME ROAR!!!  Summer you get ready because you are gonna be the best one I have ever had,  ever .

      I am so proud of Arianna! She told Lauren off! OFF! Go Arianna!!! Today Arianna found out that Lauren, the ugly wench, calls her fat behind her back. Let's just say Arianna didn't respond well which is AWESOME!!! That really it for today, I know boring, oh well.    THE FOLLOWING MUST BE DONE: YOU MUST GO BACK TO THE ENTRY "ODE TO FRIENDS" AND LOOK THROUGH AND FIND BECKY AND READ HER PARAGRAPH I FEEL SO BAD THAT I DIDN'T PUT HER ON WHOOPS! BUT YOU MUST READ IT!!! AND I ADDED A SENTENCE OR TWO ONTO LAUREN'S!!! READ IT NOW!!!   News I have decided that I am going to do the blog thing with Hannah. I like her so much and I need her to know. And I think I am going to do it soon, really soon. Like this week or next week! I need to do this for myself! I will do this for myself!  I WILL!!!

      You know what I realized? I bet you don't! Well I do! LOL Anyway I realized I can be mad about everything and anything until the day I die or I can say screw them cuz their gonna be moronic now and they are gonna be later so don't bother! I have nothing to loose! I can only gain and if something goes wrong it's not setting me back! The truth is I'm still gonna be the same person whether someone likes me or not. So I am really gonna do it! I am almost positive that I am going to make this awesome letter to Hannah telling her everything I feel about her because I do care about her so much! And you know what if she doesn't feel the same way I'll have to deal with it but if she does it will be great! Even if she turns me down it's ok because we will still be friends and I won't have any hard feeling towards her, I mean come on I'll be upset but I am not gonna kill myself over it! I really like her and I want her to know, but that doesn't mean that I am gonna stalk her or anything that is terrible! What it means is that I really like her but I would never ever do anything to make her feel uncomfortable. I am not going to lie I've said it already if she turns me down I will be sad, but I'll recover, I'll make it. I really think that I am going to do that; write a great leter to her on the blog and give her the address. Well give me advice but right now I got to go eat it's dinner time! Bye!

      I am torturing myself. I know what is going to happen. I do. I am gonna flip out on Lauren and it'll feel great but I know me and I know I will feel bad but you know what, it has to be done I realized this. I talked to her online before and well I told her she was turning into Ali and how terrible it was and that she was annoying the life out of me for the past few months and she asked for my side of the Chelsea thing too. And she still believed Chris and then we had a serious discussion well a short discussion on us. "Our paths are splitting" (L) "I know" (Me) "But whenever you need to there is always a side-street to my path, remember that" (Me, isn't that the nicest thing you ever heard of I have like hated her for the past few months and I still said that!) and she says "I won't forget" (L) and I say "Do I have the same path?" and she said "idk". IDK?!? Who is she?!? Yeah she said it herself she has changed yeah into a crazy wench heading to hell! And you know what I can't stand it anymore I am finished! If she says something to me again I am gonna blow up at her! I am going to say things that I will feel bad about but you know what they need to be said! Because I will not deal with this anymore! Where does she get off saying idk to me? TO ME?!? I was her best friend when no one else would be! And the fact that she trusts Chris more than me is amazing. I know things about her that not even her mother knows and it is just incredible for me to see someone be so cold and heartless. We were best friends and we shared everything together! Is this not the most perfect story for a teen soap opera? I mean really best friends turned enemies! This is not the movies and it isn't going to turn out right but the truth is that I would be there for her no matter what. That is friendship. I am a good friend. I know I am. How? This is how. I would be there for her even though we are fighting right now. Is that incredible?!? I can not believe that she could be so evil. We shared such good times and such bad times. We were best friends. And we both said we would be BFFs (best friends forever). But the truth is we won't, ad I realize this and am trying to come to grips with this, yes it's hard but friends do not put you down to try to make themselves look better than you. That shows how weak they are. I don't want to stoop to her level and put her down because I don't need to reassure myself that I am better than her. I know that I am better than her because I am a friend, and honest person, and I will never ever give up on my friends. How dare you do something like that to me?!? I was there for you! I supported you! I looked out for you! I cared about you! And I couldn't stand you! But I still stood by you. And I "protected you out of courtesy" (Likin Park). It hurts so bad for your "BFF" to tell you she might not be there for you when you just basically ended your friendship and I say I'll ALWAYS be there for you and you say I'll remember that and when I ask if I have the same...THE SAME which is something I expected. She says idk. Well I certainly know who was really my friend. NOT HER. She doesn't even care enough about me to promise to be there for me. How could you not be there for me after everything I have done for you. Lauren, I used to know you but I don't. I really don't. And it hurts and as I write this knowing that I am losing my best friend, it kills me and I am tearing. I don't want to tell my mom or anyone what happened. Because it's something I think that parents don't understand. They went through it already but they forgot. Old age, it's so cruel. You know I cared about you Lauren but now I don't know. That's right idk now and now when you need someone I might not be there. So you go ahead with your plan to meet some punk kids like you. And you have a great life. But all I can say is that I had a feeling the other day that one day I was gonna see on the news: local resident Lauren ****** killed herself today...... and you know what...I know she will never be happy. I know she won't because she won't allow someone to get close enough to her to make her happy, and that is why Lauren has condemned herself to misery. When you need me idk, I might be there. Who am I kidding I know I'd be there, I would hate her but I'd probably be there because that's who I am and you know what I wouldn't change one thing about me! :)

      This is a, well obviously and ode to my friends. I want to thank them for everything they have done for me, everything they do, everything about them. I don't think they know how important they are to me, and I want to tell them that I really need them.    Arianna-  We weren't always the best of friends until this year and I know that we always will be. People pick on you (Danny, Lauren) but they have NO right to. You are great. You are so nice and always there for me! You are among the few who aren't mad at me at school. We share so many things, SMALLVILLE!, the Smallville-athon that we are yet to have! Over the summer definitely! I'll always be there for you! Thanks Arianna! For being you!    Liz-  We just became friends this year too, but I feel like I've known you as long as I have known Arianna.

Your my friend out of my school that I can always turn to when I need to talk to someone outside of school.

Alana you are an amazing person and any person in the world would be lucky to know you! Alana you are amazing! I wish I could be such a wonderful person Alana! I am always here for you! Thanks for being you Alana!    Siobhan-  It all started in study hall and now it's a great friendship! You are so fun to be with!

Chelsea-  We haven't been friends for long but I feel like I know you for much longer than I have! I can't believe your in seventh grade you should be in eighth grade! We are all leaving you this year! We will still be friends don't worry! I'm always here for you, and thanks for being you!    Hannah-  Thank you so much for living! Thanks Hannah's mom for having such a beautiful child! Hannah we have been friends since kindergarten, not great friends more of acquaintances, we are beginning to become better friends but I need to know if you like me the way I like you! I like you so much! I don't want to freak you out but I need to know! I also know that at the dance you liked Jared and that kills me because you told me, I heard the words from your mouth! But he's so immature! Hannah thanks for being born! I am always here for you!    Jackie-  We have become friends this year and you are quite the comedian! (mutant alien pig face!) And you are a cool person! And sometimes violent! (Angel + fist = trip to the principle's office) lol Thanks for being my friend Jackie!    Vanessa-  We have been friends a little this year and you are a really cool person. I can never beat you in Earth Science! AAAAAAAA!!! One day I'll beat you! lol Thanks for being my friend.    Dana-  I can't tell if you hate me or if you like me but I'm still gonna poke you either way! lol Thanks for being my poking pad! lol   James-  We are friends mostly from volleyball, but it's still fun! If we do the beach volleyball thing over the summer I'll see you then! Thanks for being my friend, fellow captain! lol    Scott-  Yes you are my cousin but you are still my friend. We have always been together at family parties, you and I have a little more in common than you and Michael! lol But you always played with me when I was little and I appreciate that! You saved me from Steven! You have helped me improve in playing games even though you are the all time master of video games! But Jean Grey would kick Toad's butt any day! Oh yeah that's a challenge! lol You are a very strong person, strong enough to find flaws within yourself and try to correct them. With getting sick and everything it may have looked like a curse but you have learned so much about yourself in these past few years than ever! Scott you are a really cool person! And my free movie pass! lol Thanks for hanging out with me and saving me from Steven! I'm always here Scott, remember that.   And last and least, lol just kidding! Last but most certainly  not  least:  Becky-  We started being friends last year, which is a big improvement from sixth grade when you Ashliegh and myself had that little problem! lol That was so funny with Leech! lol (yes I said leech intentionally) Ashleigh denied the whole thing and you just sat there quiet. Then you apologized. It was so funny now that I look back at it! You are a good friend, a good listener, and you give me all the dirt! lol You are a great friend Becky, and I am sorry I called you a PMSing wench but I was mad and I had I right to be! You are really cool and I know I can always rely on you to listen to me and that is something everyone needs! Thanks for being you and being my friend!   -Former Friend-    Lauren-  Well we were the best of friends and now you have changes into well Ali, and that is a terrible thing to do. You are always putting people down and you think that it makes you cool, but you look like a reject. I can't stand this new person with two faces and two personalities.   "Too many Things that you've said about me When I'm not around You think having the upper hand Means you've got to keep putting me down But I've had too many stand-offs with you It's just about as much as I can stand Just wait until the upper hand Is mine" excerpt from Hit the Floor, by Linkin Park  Lauren I was your friend through it all and this is how you repay me?!? You have changed into someone that I don't know and it is a terrible thing, and you should be ashamed of it. You think who you are is a cool funny person but guess what. You are someone who thinks that you are the center of the universe and you most certainly are not! You have hurt everyone, not physically cuz I'll take your little football playing squirrelly butt out! But you have picked out the flaws with everyone but yourself! Lauren you think because you have boobs you are a hot desirable person. But You are not. The truth is if you looked like Britney Spears I still wouldn't like you. Because the inside of you makes the outside of you look nauseating and you are hurting yourself in reality. Lauren I am done fighting. I am done. Done. Done. Done. But no matter what I will always be here for you Lauren. Why? Because I am a loyal friend. And I will never give up on you. Lauren I am here...I am here.  NOT!  Do you know why? Well maybe I would have been here if you hadn't been the way you have and if you haven't pushed me to this point! I don't like myself when I do this but it's to bad for me because I am done!  I feel like I am writing my will or something. But I felt like telling my friends what they meant to me. They mean the world to me and I need each and every one of you. Thanks for being my friends.

      Oh yes don't speak. Self explanatory DON'T SPEAK!!! Ok, I know I have been going on and on and on about how mad I am at Chris and Lauren....... well this one is going to be a little different today kiddies. It's about Lauren. She has been the "friend" I was mad at before the whole Chris thing. Lauren. Here is a timeline of our friendship:   third grade: met, became best friends, liked each other, stopped liking each other.   fourth grade: became friends with Chris, became x-friends with Chris, thought the blair witch goatman and scream resided in Lauren's backyard.   fifth grade: still great friends   sixth grade: still great friends   seventh grade: great friends, started getting a little rocky, nick (lauren's brother) went out with Ali...eew!, sat at different tables for a little while because she moved to the table with nick and Ali and there was no room until I made room for me (he he he).   eight grade: well I suppose you know that already now don't you?   So that is the timeline of our friendship. Exciting isn't it. Not. It was fine until this year that's when it blew up in my face. It was like a backhand right in the cheek (the one on my face!). I feel like a part of my life is withering in front of me and there is nothing that I can do to save it and writing this is making me feel sick. What happened to you? I can get to you anymore. AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! It drives me insane. When I want to be angry I realize I am losing my best friend, it really feels that way.    Don't Speak-No Doubt   You and me We used to be together Every day together always  I really feel I'm losing my best friend I can't believe This could be the end  It looks as though you're letting go And if it's real, Well I don't want to know  Don't speak I know just what you're saying So please stop explaining Don't tell me 'cause it hurts Don't speak I know what you're thinking I don't need your reasons Don't tell me 'cause it hurts  Our memories They can be inviting But some are altogether Mighty frightening  As we die, both you and I With my head in my hands I sit and cry  It's all ending I gotta stop pretending who we are... You and me I can see us dying ... are we?    Well are we dying? No I am alive. Our friendship is crippled and dying. I am beginning to think that I made a mistake, telling Chelsea. I mean everything was fine but I just didn't feel right not telling her. It's not like I enjoyed it! I mean really! Hey let me break up my friends cuz I feel like being a jerk! NO! And it hurts to think that I did something wrong in trying to make my friend aware of something I take very seriously. It hurts that Lauren comes up to me in tech and says "Why did you lie to Chelsea?" and it hurts me to yell back "Lauren shutup! You don't even know half the story! And when you don't know what your talking about you shouldn't talk, wait that means you would never speak a word in your life!". It disgusts me that we have to go through this and it hurts me just as much. We were such good friends. What happened? Well guess what I can only feel sad for so long. And that is over.   I am sad but my anger is stronger! Who does she think she is?!? I should smack the living life out of her! She has nerve! You know what go ahead and take Chris' side you little bimbo! We have been friends since third grade and you know I would never lie about something like that and you know very well that I would never ever do something like that unless I felt it to be absolutely necessary! AAAAAAAAA!!! The hurt and the pain turns to bitterness and anger very quickly! VERY QUICKLY! Which makes me think of a song and here it is:    Hit the Floor-Linkin Park  There are just too many Times that people Have tried to look inside of me Wondering what I think of you And I protect you out of courtesy Too many times that I've Held on when I needed to push away Afraid to say what was on my mind Afraid to say what I need to say Too many Things that you've said about me When I'm not around You think having the upper hand Means you've got to keep putting me down But I've had too many stand-offs with you It's just about as much as I can stand Just wait until the upper hand Is mine  So many people like me Put so much trust in all your lies So concerned with what you think To just say what we feel inside So many people like me Walk on eggshells all day long All I know is that all I want Is to feel like I'm not stepped on There are so many things you say That make me feel like you've crossed the line What goes up will surely fall And I'm counting down the time 'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you It's about as much as I can stand So I'm waiting until the upper hand Is mine  One minute you're on top The next you're not Watch it drop Making your heart stop Just before you hit the floor One minute you're on top The next you're not Missed your shot Making your heart stop You think you won.  And then it's all gone  I know I'll never trust a single thing you say You knew your lies would divide us But you lied anyway And all the lies have got you floating Up above us all But what goes up has got to fall    Truth be told I am once again confused. Not about if I am angry or not but whether or not I should try to salvage what is left of our friendship. Just swallow my pride and go u to her and say we gotta talk. I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know if I will ever know.   I am so confused right now! I don't know anything anymore! Again. Well I am talking about girls. Which one?!? A? B? C? D? ??? Huh? AAAAAAAAAAA!!! Well it's time for me to be going. Leave a comment!

      Ok ready? I am going to tell you a story and you leave what you think in the comment box. My friend Chelsea and x-friend Chris were going out for about a week. Last week the eight grade went to Williamsburg for the eight grade trip. Chelsea is in seventh grade. She asks how the trip was I say it was really fun. The I say Chris was annoying me a lot on the trip. She asks why. I say: he was being a jerk about the beds and stuff and he was saying stuff that he shouldn't have. She asks what. I reply you don't want to know. She says yes I do so I tell her that Chris was talking about his erotic dreams that involve Chelsea. She freaks out and says eeeeew what a freak I am breaking up with him. I say are you really? She says yeah I don't want to go out with a weirdo like that. I say ok... I didn't know that she was going to break up with him but she did. She promised to keep her source of the information a secret. She told Chris that I gave her the info. Chris asks why I said that to her and I did not respond. Now Becky, Chris, Lauren, and probably Arianna are mad at me. I quite frankly don't give a flying fig because Becky is a PMSing WENCH!!! Chris is a retarded pain in the butt with ADHD. Lauren is a dumb little gothic wench that I have been mad at for the past two months and now I pretty much hate her. And Arianna has no reason to be mad at me. I don't know what their problem is. Chelsea is my friend. When friends find out that their boyfriend/girlfriend is a psycho rapist I think it is the friend's duty to tell them. So I ask you: If you were going out with someone and behind your back they talk about having sex with you, among other things, and talk about every little detail of your body every second wouldn't you like to know that you are going out with a stalker? Yeah, you'd probably want to know. I was trying to let Chelsea know to be a good friend. Sorry that I try to let my friends know that their current boyfriend/girlfriend might rape them. Excuse me from telling her that's she's going out with a dirt bag. I sincerely apologize for letting a friend know that they are being stalked. Next time I'll let my friend get raped and be on channel seven news because she disappeared and was raped. Please don't let me stand in your way, I know that you probably would have liked to do those things to her, but guess what! I was trying to let my friend know what her boyfriend was really like. If I was going out with someone that would be the furthest thing from my mind!!! The first thing I would think about would be to have a good relationship with them and to be a good boyfriend, not make her pregnant!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Sorry but my internet connection was down for like two days so I desperately needed to vent and this is the best place to do it, so I am blogging right now. You know what Lauren is going to a different high school than me so it's gonna be me, Arianna, and Liz against the world. I know Liz is there for me and I want to thank her because she is GREAT to talk to when you are having a great day because she doesn't go to my school and you really need to escape sometimes. Arianna I am not doubting you at all it's just that I really don't know if you are mad at me. But I know that you two will be there for me and I hope that you both know that I'll be there for you two. Lauren and I are getting so distant from each other and honestly I don't know how much more of this our friendship can take. Chris- don't even make me talk about it. Chelsea- is really cool and funny, but is going out with a dirt bag. Sorry Chelsea that I am talking about your boyfriend that way but that's what I feel like. Becky, Lauren, and Chris I am not apologizing so get that out of your heads. And honestly where do Becky and Lauren get off being mad at me?!? You'd think they were going out with Chelsea...well I don't know Lauren and Becky but please keep those thoughts to yourself, I am running a clean blog over here. Anyway can't you tell what kind of a day I am having? Can ya? Huh? Well I will give you a hint: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! So I hope you have enjoyed reading the angry section of my blog this evening, have a DANDY night folks!!!   Ok on to the happy section: I have a few friends that aren't retarded right now. OK that ends the happy section right now. Let's move on to the brutally honest section shall we.   I don't care that they are mad at me!!! Excuse me for being a good friend to Chelsea let me not tell her anything that may be related to her safety. GIVE ME A BLEEPING BREAK!!! Who do you think you are?!? Hey Anthony don't tell Chelsea I am a horny rapist ok. Yeah sure Chris, I'll be sure to play dumb when the police interrogate me too I won't tell them that's what you did. I know it's kinda bad that I am saying all this stuff about Chelsea getting raped sorry Chelsea. I don't want you to get rapped but you know what he was saying and I don't know what happened today but I would really like to know so I can understand what I have caused. Let's move on to the Cause and Effect section ok!   Cause: I told Chelsea that her boyfriend was thinking erotic thoughts about her, in an attempt to be a good friend.   Effect: Several people do not like me right now.   Effect 2: Chelsea and Chris are back together again.   Lesson: Don't try to be a good friend. Let your friends be oblivious to what they are getting themselves into.   Two questions: 1. Do you think I did the right thing? (not breaking up Chris and Chelsea, even though I didn't know she was going to) 2. Can you tell that I had a wonderful day?   Well that's all for today...LEAVE A COMMENT!!!

       High school scares me. I won't lie. I won't try to pretend I'm fine about it. I am completely terrified. But at the same time I am completely giddy and can't wait, to see new people and do new things. But at the same time I just want to stay in this summer forever. Without a real care in the world.     &nbsp;   People are leaving me. Jerks. What's wrong with you people? why would you want to leave me?!? lol. Just kidding *cough* not *cough*. Scott, jerk, why are you going to college? Why couldn't you be like Mike and have no drive whatsoever? Just kidding! It's great that your going and I'm happy for you. But now you won't be at every family party, who am I stuck with? huh? STEVEN!!!&nbsp;That gives me the chills. Along with being nervous and stuff...&nbsp;What were you thinking leaving me with that thing?!? I'm calling RIT and telling them not to accept you. You think that will work?     &nbsp;   Alana, Siobhan, Becky, they are all leaving me. Going to a different high school. Who do they think they are?!? How dare they?!? AAAAAAAA!!! It's gonna be really rough not seeing these people that I've known for, like, ever. It's not fair. It should&nbsp;be illegal. Grrrrrrrrr.     I hope I'll be ok, I want to succeed and do well and have a great time in high school.&nbsp;A wise person I know told me to "enjoy high school, I didn't have the chance to, you know why, it should be the time of your life, make sure it&nbsp;is". And that&nbsp;is what I aspire to do. Just that. Have a great time.     About that whole I'm gonna have the best&nbsp;summer in the world and nobody is gonna stop me thing is sad. Yes this is a pretty good summer. I've lost and gained things throughout the year, but this summer I am putting me back together I guess you can say. I was kinda ripped apart a little this year and I am taking this summer to chill out and come back to reality and to me.     I am starting to read this book called Eragon and the first&nbsp;eleven pages are pretty good. I am reading it because I think I let City of Heroes&nbsp;take over my life. It's been hard but I have realized I don't live in Paragon City, I am not Astraeus the hero that shoots energy blasts from his hands, I can not&nbsp;fly. But I still absolutely love the game. Anyway, I have began to cut down my time playing to do other things, like watch television which is annoying I'd much rather play City of Heroes than watch T.V.!!!&nbsp;So, I have realized that I need to hang out&nbsp;with my friends more. If your my friend, I'm hanging out with you. Ok,&nbsp;I gotta umm go cut the lawn...ha ha ha...ok you broke me down I'm playing City of Heroes but I have my mom's timer so I don't play for to long, but it's the first time I've played today so&nbsp;watch out Paragon baddies, I'm coming to get you!!! &nbsp;

        ALL HAIL EVANESCENCE!!!        &nbsp;   Concert number 2 was last night and it was amazing! No other word. The openers were pretty good but the main event was of course the beautiful voice and piano playing of Amy Lee, the awesome guitar playing of John LeCompt and Terry Balsalmo, the&nbsp;great bass of Will Boyd, and of course the crazy drums of Rocky Gray. Who together are   EVANESCENCE!!!    I had such a great time or as Shaun Morgan singer and guitarist of Seether (one of the openers) would say the f ing time of our lives. He really enjoyed saying that. lol. Anyway, I know Arianna and Liz had a good time, my mom did, Arianna's mom and aunt did, my cousin Jen did, and it was just awesome!!! I loves it!!! And Arianna brought up a good point: how many shows do you think we have to go to until we get free back stage passes? lol. I WISH!!! That would be amazing. Anyway I have to go, be good, and stay in school. Thank you, and goodnight.

        Future     &nbsp;  The&nbsp;future,    It is foretold in palms,    Written in scriptures,    Seen by those with a "sixth sense",    And created by those who can mold their own life,    Created by people who make their future their own,    No one really knows what will happen for sure,    Even if someone really does have a vision of someone's future,    Whether it be good or bad,    It can always change,    Because of stress,    Because of an odd stroke of good fortune,    Because of a terrible accident,    People may be able to "see" into the future,    But they can not control it,    Only you can control it,    If you let what others say and do change you that's ok,    Because it may be for the better,    But you should never let other people or events change what you want,    What you want to do with your life is not for anyone but you to decide,    People go to people with "sight" and get their futures "revealed",    But the thing is when they know things that might happen they become weary of the future,    One thing you should never ever do is fear it; the future,    It is what will save us from a desolate wasteland,    It is also what will eventually condemn us to die,    But you shouldn't fear change and the future,    All you can do is hope that you&nbsp;do whatever makes you happy,    Because happiness, hope, and love, are the only things that save us,    From the desolate wastelands that we get trapped in,    Or that other people pull us into,    Or that we put ourselves into,    People in general are to hard on themselves,    They don't consider the progress they have made,    Or how good they are really doing,    Because all they think of is how good they can be,    Which gives us all drive to do better,    And always want to be better than ourselves,    But sometimes you need to step out of being you and say,    Wow,    I did good,    Or wow I'm smart,    Or wow I am talented,    Self praise does relieve stress,    But too much blocks our progress,    We plummet into the future every second,    Every breath,    Every step,    The future is now,    Here is is,    Are you ready?    Don't fear it,    Don't run from it,    Don't run away,    Head right for it,    Head on,    Never stopping,    Because we can never stop,    We have to live our lives,    The way we want,    We have to have the life,    That we always dreamed of,    It won't be the same life as in your dreams,    Because everytime you kiss the person you love there won't always be fireworks and sparkles,    And everything won't be perfect,    But who needs perfection,    Perfection is fake,    And unlogical,    And unpractical,    Nothing is perfect,    You have to work on everything you do and want,    But when you get it,    It is all worth it,    Your future is bright,    If you don't cover the light,    Let it shine,    Let it fill your heart and mind,    Love yourself,    Because if you don't love yourself,    People will know,    That something is wrong,    They will realize that you are upset,    Or different,    Or not as fun as you used to be,    The future is now,    Right now,    So,    What are you doing with yours?    By,    Anthony (me)   &nbsp;   I don't know why I got that sudden burst of creativity, but well I'm glad I did. I like how that came out...what do you think of it? Anyway, sometimes I do feel like I can see things...past...future...present. I told my aunt Vivian this earlier this year: "Your sister, she is going to come to you soon. You have felt her before, how do you know it's her?" she said: "I smell lilacs, when none are in the house or outside or around at all" so I said: "You are going to smell them soon". She has not smelled them yet. Recently while touching her head (I was playing with her hair) I got this vision or two little girls playing in a field of all kinds of flowers and a tree, The older one had a butterfly on her finger, and the younger one was spinning around holding her dress out so the win would catch it. I don't know if I have an overactive imagination, but I usually don't imagine something like this. At first I thought immediately that I was my aunt Vivian and her sister. But they were in clothes that weren't really from their time. I don't know who they were but I got the "vision" when I was touching my aunts head. I also told her recently that her sister has tried to come to her many times but she can't smell her because she is to preoccupied with everything. I said she needs to relax and enjoy and appreciate the simplest things in life. Not usual things but just little things and I also said that she was always thinking about something, it worries her and she is always worried about it. I said she makes herself sick over it too. And that when she learns how to appreciate things that aren't typical, just simple she will smell lilacs; she will feel her sister. She said this was all right, me saying she was worried about something, all of that stuff. I was amazed. I get these little bursts of "psychic energy" I guess you can say. Or I might just be freakishly good at being able to tell what people feel by how they act. Maybe I am really perceptive. I don't know. If I get better at this..."talent" when I get older or something or if this really becomes something I can do. I would tell people things, that is if I could. I wouldn't be one of those cheesy people that are on television, but maybe I would do it to some people. I guess we will see what the future brings...

       You know something...life really isn't that bad. It's not bad at all it's actually wonderful. Many entries I've written have been about me accepting myself or not accepting myself or not liking things or people. But there's no reason to act like I have this horrible life when I really don't. I have a loving, caring, great family, I have friends that genuinely care about me whether we are or are not related, I am smart, I can draw pretty good, and I don't give my life nearly enough credit! I have a great life and I am surrounded by great people that make my great life even better! I can't imagine not having any of these people around me they are the reason I am so happy. I am not sad really just bored. I am really bored. Alana says I should get a job, I laughed. But she loves her job, I continued to laugh. And she's in love with a little Mexican boy, lol, inside joke. I think I need to start doing things on a regular basis. I really do appreciate the little thing in life that I have. So I have compiled a list of reasons why it's good to be me!  &nbsp;    1.   I have caring friends and family around to help me all the time.  &nbsp;    2.   My parents get me things that I want when I ask them for something, not meaning this in a greedy way, I mean some kids get nothing, when I am spoiled...almost rotten.  &nbsp;    3.   I am smart, I get good grades, must take after&nbsp;Kellie and Scott. lol.  &nbsp;    4.   I have some artistic ability.  &nbsp;    5.   I have an adorable dog! Belle!  &nbsp;    6.   I am blessed with so many good things.  &nbsp;    7.   Nothing really bad has ever happened to me, like an injury, the most that has happened to me is a piano bench full of music books and other assorted garbage fell on my toe&nbsp;popping up the nail bleeding hurting you know all that good stuff, and once I pulled my Achilles tendon.  &nbsp;    8.   I am&nbsp;still alive after my tragic experience in Lake&nbsp;Powell, in which I owe my life to&nbsp;my uncle Sammy.  &nbsp;    9.   I have an older brother to release my frustrations on, among other things.  &nbsp;    10.   I have City of Heroes!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I took this quote from a song I really like:  &nbsp;  "Who knows what could happen  Do what you do, just keep on laughing  One thing's true, there's always a brand new day  I'm gonna live today like it's my last day"  &nbsp;  The song is called "Who Knows" and it's by Avril Lavigne. Yes Arianna Avril Lavigne get over it. I think it's great. I really like that song the whole message is really good.  &nbsp;  This whole entry is about me appreciating my life and everything I have. But...if I had a car (curse you Scott) I could go hang out with my friends and go places and do things and it would rock! Speaking of "rock"...  &nbsp;       4 DAYS UNTIL THE EVANESCENCE CONCERT!!!     &nbsp;  As you may be able to tell I CAN'T WAIT!!!  &nbsp;  That's all folks.&nbsp;Now begone. Unless your commenting than stay. And if your not commenting than there is something wrong with you. So comment. Do it now. Stop twiddling your thumbs and get to it! Now!

OK I'm done. That is if you went to it... But seriously I can't wait and Scott we went to the first one together. And Liz you have to watch the first one with me soon. And Scott we have to see the second one together. And Liz if you can't see the second one when me and Scott see it than I'll go with you again some other time, but you must understand that I must see this movie at the earliest possible date. I can't wait for it, this new hype that I'm on is mainly because the new trailer is up and it's awesome!!! I can't wait, I really can't!!! It's gonna be awesome!!!  I need to listen to Alana, she says I need to do something, she's right. That something is be with my friends more but since it's not always easy I have to have something I can fall back on. For example: yesterday my mother and I went to my grandma's apartment because she is moving to a different apartment one without stairs, because my grandma can't be walking up and down, anyway, she was getting rid of some stuff and my mom came for the cooking stuff. I realized what a beautiful person my grandma really is. She sacrificed so much to make my family as happy as they are, and she is just an all around amazing person.   A week or two ago, my aunt Vivian, my aunt Roseanne, and my cousin Dari each had an hour session with a psychic and a lot of the things he was saying to them were right on target and so specific. Scott, my cousin, my aunt Rosanne's son, and Dari's brother, about him, the psychic told my aunt that he and I are growing closer and we get along great and always have. And I believe we are, it's great to have friends that are there for you and everything, but to be friends with someone in your own family is great. Not just Scott but there's plenty of other people in my family that I consider friends. But in general it's really great to have people that you know you'll always be able to keep in touch with. Scott is going to college next year, and that's not fair! It's going to be so weird not having Scott always there at family parties, I mean he'll come back and fourth plenty, but I just can't believe it. He's going to Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and that's great for him I think he needs to go out there and meet new people and stuff, but it'll be so weird not having him always there. I know he's moving on to bigger and better things but don't you worry Scott, I am going to send you e-mails and talk to you on the phone and online and on CoH. Also I am very proud of him he was very sick for a long time he is feeling so much better and I am so happy for him, and I'm glad he's going to be able to experience college. It just stinks see if we lived in Florida we could go to the same one at the same time (I'd be in my first year and you in your third). LOL. Inside joke, no one is supposed to get it but Scott, if you are not Scott and don't get it there is nothing wrong with you...well nevermind. LOL just kidding. Congratulations Scott! And if you think your going to get away with not talking to me when your there that's not happening buddy, ha ha! And you thought you'd escaped the mighty Anthony, but no it is you that is mistaken! Mu ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! I things would slow down everything is moving to fast for me...or is it me that is moving to slow for everything?

      It's very easy to take someone or something for granted, I mean when you think about it you realize how much you do it yourself, and of course you don't want anyone to take you for granted. I have learned that taking things or people for granted is foolish and juvenile. But I realized today that you can take someone for granted in two weeks. My uncle Robert, aunt Debbie, cousin Callie, and cousin Robert came up from Florida two weeks ago. They stayed with us, I am surprised that I haven't written about them in this blog yet. They left today, and even though I will see them for Christmas, probably in a month, and seen them for a week and a half a month ago, it is still terrible to see them go. I miss them so much, Callie and Robert are so cool, not annoying like young cousins can sometimes be. I did take them for granted, from the first day they got here. I knew in my mind that I always had someone to play around with, or hang out with, or play video games with, because it's sometimes hard to get together with friends. I had them here, every morning, to entertain and be entertained by the wonder of a child. Children are great, I miss being a kid, seeing everything in a completely different light, never thinking about the terrible things in the world that are going on, or the crazy people, just thinking about having plenty of time to play with their toys, and having peanut butter and jelly everyday for lunch, even though your mom wants you to have something else for a change, like bologna. I remember waking up everyday, having breakfast, watching my morning shows, and would hope that maybe my cousin Scott would come over and play power rangers, or The Spiderman and Tweety Adventures with me. Or maybe Kellie would come over and we might make a fort or she might help me get Mike back for pushing me down earlier that day. Or maybe we might go to my aunt Vera's house, who lived five minutes away, so I could see Jen-Jen, or Bernie, Or Joe, or Annie-baganie, and cry and desperately grasp one of their legs so I wouldn't have to leave. Then I would stop crying when I got into the car and we'd see aunt Vera standing at the door waving and blowing us kisses, and I remember kissing my hand all the way home and just before going in my house blowing them all to them. To be a little kid again, not worrying about school or friends or getting a job. Just to be a kid and enjoy everyday of our lives. To be a kid and see the simple pleasures of everything and take nothing for granted. To be a kid and see the joy of living and see all the little things that make this world so beautiful. To be a kid and be so unaware of all the terrible things in the world, and not caring what anyone else in the world thought of you except your mom, your family, and your pet. I wish I knew how wonderful being a kid was when I was a kid, but I guess if I knew that I wouldn't have been a kid, and I wouldn't have my childhood to look back on now. I want to thank everyone for making my childhood so great because I know I'll remember it forever, and always think of you very fondly.

      I am beginning to realize that I was never really not confused. I will always be confused about some things but that doesn't make me a bad person. I think right now I am really coming to grips with being me, and realizing that I am me and not this perfect person, I am me; and that's ok. I am confused about some things, but others I know and there is no question to them. I realized that I am not someone who is confused all the time, but I am still confused about some things. This is not the blog of a person that know what he wants exactly, but it's not the blog of someone who is confused all the time.   When I first started this blog I was so carefree, and the entries were really boring. I didn't think so at the time but I now realize that they were really lame. I didn't write how I felt, I just wrote what happened that day, and it is really boring to read. Things were so uncomplicated then, and now they are pretty complicated. But it's apart of growing up, and I think I am handling it pretty well.   I hope that my friends, if I don't see them again, not just now but in college or after college, when they find their junior high year book and say "Oh my gosh I remember Anthony! He was so nice!". I don't want to leave the comfort and the security and just the routine feeling of going to school with these people I have known for so long. I am not over graduating, I am in some ways ready for high school, but in other I am terrified to go there.   I do not plan to stop writing in this blog, it is the one place I know I can really express my feelings, feelings that stretch to vast but all have one thing in common; they are mine. And nobody can make me feel anything that I don't want to. And my blog holds my vast feelings together in one place, reminding me that I can be in different moods and go through different changes but I am still me. And I am not changing for anyone!

      This masquerade I have been portraying, is nothing more than that; a masquerade. I'm really not this weak person, in fact I am pretty strong. I don't give myself enough credit, really I don't. I think I'm a good friend. I listen. And I talk. I try to be my best but I realized that I don't always have to be the best or the smartest or the happiest or the coolest. I have to be me how I am right now. And the people that love me and truly care about me will accept it and get me through it, just like I accept them and try to comfort them. We don't have to be someone we are not. I am Anthony. I am smart. Sometimes I'm funny. I can be goofy. I can be serious. I am a good friend. I love drawing. And most of all I love me. I LOVE ME!!! For the past week I never thought I could say that again. But I do, I really really do! I am really cocky right now and I never thought I would be but I realized narcism is not a crime. I have to love and accept myself...and I do. I am going through one of the most difficult time of my life, "It is a chapter that everyone has to go though but how you come out of it effects who you will be in the future", wise words from a wise person. I am so glad I have come to grips with myself. Really the 4th of July woke me up! It's like a new beginning. This summer is still going to be great!!! I am hanging out with my friends whether they want to or not! I will haunt them until they hang out with me! I don't give all of my friends enough credit. I think I take them for granted sometimes, but I won't make that mistake. I won't make the mistake Lauren did. We were friends and she took me for granted and thought I would always be around no matter what she did; and as you know she was wrong. I would never do any of the things Lauren did to me to my friends though! But I do take them for granted sometimes, and as I graduated it was like my world came crashing down on me crushing me so I couldn't breath anymore. Something that is supposed to be so wonderful and so good can be so Earth shattering. The thought of not seeing these people five days a week come September makes me sick to be honest. Someone I though would always be there to talk to won't be there everyday in school next year and I am starting to like her!I don't know if my whole heart is in some things, for example piano. I love the piano and it's a beautiful instrument, but I don't know if my heart is in it, and it would kill me to quit, I'd feel like I failed, but most of all to my teacher. She is such a nice person but I don't know if my heart is in it. Instruments are for people that love music, I do, but I don't know if I want to play it. I don't know about it. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders, just in one day. Thank you everyone that cared,and thank you my friends, and thank me for realizing that I don't need this masquerade of perfection, I am not perfect, and no masquerade can hide that.

      I have so many things to write about, but I really don't know how to start...well here it goes. Recently I have been oddly...depressed. I don't know what I am to be honest. This was supposed to be the best summer ever, but so far it's had it's ups and downs. Alana, Arianna, and Becky's parties = ups...and most of the other time is down. I finally got City of Heroes (an awesome video game) working. I have been nasty to some people and just ignored others. I am beginning to feel bipolar, seriously I am in a completely different mood sometimes in a matter of seconds. I am starting to loose track of who I am. I am not this boring person. I think I need to hang out with people more! I need people to be happy. Really I do. Alana when we are together it's non-stop laughter and I love every second of it, I really do. You can make me go from a furious and crummy mood and turn the mood completely around and I can be happy for the whole day. All of my friends can do that, and I appreciate it. I miss people already and I can't stand it. Why do I have to go through this? I don't know if I am strong enough to do it. I just wish that I didn't have to go through this, I am being separated from people that I have known and have loved for so long. I need these people to stay with me, I feel like they are walking away from me and I am just letting them go when I want so much to scream out and tell them to get back here next to me, but I can't. I am just disappointed that this summer isn't so amazing, like it was supposed to be. It was supposed to be the summer of all summers. It's not to late, I am determined to turn this summer around, for me. I want more than anything to love someone, unconditionally, and forever. I want to love someone, so bad. I am not to young to love, I think if I love someone this sadness will go away. But I don't know who to love, and I want more than anything to unleash these emotions that I have. I wish I could be with Hannah because for so long I have wished that I could love her and I wished she would love me back, but I don't know if it will happen. I am trying so hard to be realistic but I don't want to let go of these feelings that I have had for so long. I need to talk to someone so bad, just to explain the situation and talk about it. I am tired of being confused, I am tired of being unsure, I just want to know what I want. I am such a weak person, I regally thought I was strong but I'm not. I am a weak, normal boring person. My friends are my world, I sometimes wonder why they even like me, but they do and it makes me feel so amazing knowing that people actually like me. I really don't know why. I am such a weak person, and I don't know my friends are so amazing I don't feel like I am good enough to be their friend, and yet, they still talk to me and make me feel better than I ever thought I would feel. But I want to love someone, I really do. Because I think if I have some person that I love that loves me back I think that I'll love myself. And that is something that I want to do, because when I accept myself and love myself I will know who I am. Which is something that I am not sure of as of right now...

      ¡Feliz de cumpleaños a tú! Translated means Happy birthday Alana! I don't think it's actually I don't know if it's her birthday I think it's graduation but whatever, I got her a present and she's gonna love it! My family is up from Florida and they are staying in my house so I don't get to blog much so I have to take this chance to! Alana's party is going to be so much fun! I can't wait!   I am desperately trying to make heads or tails of my feelings. Why isn't it easier? I thinks it's because I don't want to give up on Hannah I mean I have like her so much for so long. But this other person that I am starting to like knows me well too, we are friends. But Hannah, when I am around her I know what my feelings are: I like her so much nobody else matters, and when I'm away from her it's the same thing but I question myself! Why? Because I don't know if she likes me or not. And so I wrestle my feelings to try to see if one is stronger than the other. My feelings for Hannah win. But why do I find myself thinking about both of them? I won't admit that I am confused, because this isn't "Confused" anymore, I refused to be "Confused". I dare not say that I am, so I won't. I don't have to. You all know what I feel. It's obvious that I like Hannah, but this other person...I don't know! AAAAAAA!!! I can't stand it! It drives me insane not being positive about things. But I know I like Hannah more there isn't any dispute there, I definitely like Hannah. I know that. I'm  not  "confused" about that......

       Ever get the feeling like all you wanna do is feel like you made a difference in someone's life, or that you were a big part, or helped them through a tough time or was always there for them? I do. There's this person that I know and care a lot about that I feel sometimes doesn't even care I exist. I want to help this person and really make a difference. And when I think we are getting along good. Something happens and it's annoying. Because I can only try so much you know. I know he can do great things and be successful, but I think he needs to see it and as much as I try to get him to see it I sometimes feel like he never will...       Another person...We have known each other forever. Literally. And I feel like we are close and we can talk about things, and we have always been close. But I think I am just the kid this person knows. Not the friend this person can rely on. We have a lot in common, that's obvious. Even a psychic can see that. And we get along really good, but I just think that I am someone to talk to when nobody else is around. I think this person does consider me a friend. But I don't know sometimes. I feel like I am always trying to do certain things as good as this person. And I feel like it'd one sided. I feel like this person doesn't care as much about me and my future as I do about this person. I hope this person succeeds in everything they try and I know that this person can make a difference. I just wish this person would see me as a friend...       I hope things are made clear soon. I guess I have to take baby steps to try to find out what I can do to help them. Baby steps...

        Movie Reviews:        Catwoman : ***** I don't care what anyone says. I loved both the movie and Halle Berry in leather. Prrrrrrrrrrrr.    Dodgeball A True Underdog Story :  ***  I liked this a lot, it was funny and I enjoyed it.     Shrek 2 : *** Like Shrek, Shrek 2 was a good family film, it may seem like I am giving it a low rating, but this is my personal preference, judging on age and/or maturity level this can have anywhere from one to five stars.    Spiderman 2 : ***** Amazing.     The Village : ***½ I liked it. It's more of a see once in theatres and when it comes out on video but you need to forget a bit of the details before watching it again, because once you know the big "secret" that makes you go see the movie, it loses it's scaring ability. It was a little boring sometimes though.       *These reviews are based on all of the movies I have seen that are currently playing at Island 16, and I would personally like to thank all of the employees of Island 16, for making my movie experiences great, and of course for the nachos and NATHANS for their chicken fingers*       I am starting to get a little cheerier I guess you can say, four of my closest friends in the past week and it was just a lot of fun and I'm getting just happier I guess you can say. Siobhan is probably coming over tomorrow. I just got off of the phone with Arianna and we might watch a movie.       I'm really getting nervous and partly excited about high school. I really also want to start writing a lot of my novels. I wish they were just done but they aren't and if I want them to be published by the time I am finished with high school so before I go to college I can fit in the movie version of Haunted and have Miranda, the sequel to Haunted released the day Haunted (the movie) comes out. (The above is a dream of mine which will hopefully be fulfilled somewhere between becoming a world famous artist.)      My cousin got me the Ashlee Simpson CD and I like it. I don't care what anyone says, her voice isn't as "pretty" as Jessica's but guess what it's more rock and more fun to listen to. MUCh more fun. People don't have to have great voices for me to like them, Britney Spears for example. But what bothers me is when people are like "oh no Ashlee Simpson sucks but Yellowcard is awesome". No. Yellowcard was bearable for about...a week. Than I wanted to personally beat the living life from them. He has no special voice either, it annoys me to death. But for the people that like Yellowcard they are your equivalent to Ashlee Simpson.       I'm glad my blog is returning to it's once carefree environment. I am also doing everything I can possible do to keep it that way. And I have a strong feeling that it will.  HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN!!!
