         Even Pilz-e doesn't have this much shit running through his mind. when i just sit in one spot i get soooooo many ideas for the dumbest, and most genius comics. But I only tend to choose 1/5th of the ideas. I hate that, i want to do them all. but i keep forgetting that i always have my little note book with me. so... I'M GONNA PUT A WALLET CHAIN ON IT!!! And add little machine that will be wired to my brain, when i get an idea, IT SHOCKS ME! Then i write it down before it shocks me again. Smart huh?...     When you sleep deprived i notice you think about "things" alot more then your use to... I mean, i made a comic on why de-caff coffee shouldb't exsist. THAT MEANS I NEED SLEEP! ttyl peeps

         My God i have realy messed my  whole  Summer up. I don't even get to see the sun in the middle of the sky. Cara, Adrian and me have been staying up till 4-6 AM, messing around going from me and adr's house to Cara's house. It's been fun and all. But I'd realy like to wake up in the morning for once. With a cup of coffee and a bagel... mm cream cheese... mmm     Well I don't have to worry about the number of comics on  urlLink my site  for awhile. when I get enough money, I can buy all the bandwidth I need and I can add over 1,000 items storage. I am pretty sure that i won't need to worry about having enough comics for a small comic book  =D      I sorta cheated FreeWebs by creating 2 other small sites that only have the purpose of holding other content. It's been a big help due to the fact that i can only hold 50 items. And i just uploaded a buncha comics. I'm kinda on this great, comic making, Blaze o' Glory right now. It's fun.     It's only been a little over 2 weeks of summer break now... and iv'e been done so much. Me, ADR, and Cara were being followed by some guy with police lights on his car and had realy annoying screaching breaks; We fucked with our good friend, Michelle, yelling "Hey blade, you been schfucking tuhkies lately!?!" "Ohh yes, Shmigilio. MANY TUHKIES!!!".  Me and ADR did that down at Phillip 66, people stare too damn much. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SCREWING PIGGIES!!!  ... just dont ever squil like one. people get all pissy with you... hehe   well i got alot of shit to do on my site. so later fellers
