      i am so sad today because yet again my brother canceled on me!! hes such a bastard... you want to hear his reasoning?  yes well because his darling mariah doesnt want to go... who fucking cares if she doesnt want to go she doesnt have to but dont bail on kelly and i and leave us here in the dust because the girlfriend just doesnt want to... god damn it... i cant fucking stand people who do everything there significant other tells them to... i understand that my brother and mariah are in a serious relationship but that doesnt make him any less of a brother to me... and hes canceled every plan since january that we have ever had whether it be something big or something little it all adds up... i just cant wait to hear that we arent going to see dashboard confessional because mariah doesnt want to... AHHH i just want to scream!!! anyways... i think that i am going to see the ataris tomorrow!! but it kind of sucks because i have no one to take with me which means its just me and my dad... oh well... and also friday at dashboard is kind of going to suck because its going to be kev and riah and then me... AHHH i hate being with couples!!!  i just realized right now that i am really crabby... i hate being crabby but sometimes it happens... but i am just going to keep thinking of how much fun camping is going to be with all my relatives and amanda... we are going to have a blast... and im going to get a tan!!! Hallelujah!!! although i think that im going to miss my poor little pale body... i really have come to terms with being pale and i actually think that it goes well with the dark hair and dark eyes... i dont think that being tan would make me look all that attractive... who knows??? the pale skin works for me... anyways one last thing before i go for a little while... my favorite teacher in the whole wide world... mrs. heideman... who teaches art has invited my brother, jamie, and i to go sailing with her!!! AHHH ive never been sailing but i am so excited to go!!! so tomorrow when we finish touch ups on the mural we are going to plan a date!!!

      yet again another day has almost gone by... im about to leave for the stalkers house... yes i know i keep leading him on because im the one calling him but still im calling him because hes my friend... anyways amanda and i are heading over there so that we can watch nip/tuck there!!! YAY... who loves niptuck??? we do!!! everyone does... well yes today i did something very out of the ordinary... i did something with matty spittel... dun dun dun... weird Aye?  but we actually had a good time and hes one of my new buddies... he's actually a lot different to me now than when we were going out... but still i had a good time there and it all went smoothly and im sure he will see more of me in the future... hahahaha the poor kid hes going to want a gun before the summers out... either he'll shoot me or he'll shoot himself... haha... i decided i really want something worthwhile to write about on here and i never have anything... what is wrong with me do i not care about world matters or important things like that?? i feel like i am just taking up some space with my pathetically pathetic life that is just rotting away... why do i sit here and mourn over some random thing like how i ate too much chocolate for breakfast and now im vomiting all over the place when i could be sitting here writing about how i made a difference or how others could make a difference... i have nothing insightful to say and im disappointed in myself... and now instead of say something worthwhile im telling all of you how i think that i am useless when it comes to talking about things that matter... but i think i know why that is... its because i dont want to grow up!!! things that are important are things that adults talk about not things that kids do and i just want to be an immature teenager right now, why are people rushing me to grow up so quickly? most kids sit at home wishing that they are older and can do all the fun things older kids can where i am sitting here wishing that people would stop trying to get me to get a job or would stop pressuring a serious relationship on me because i just want to be a kid and do kiddie things... why do some many kids force themselves to grow up so quickly when they know deep down that they really want to sit around a table the burp with a bunch of friends or go outside and light bugs on fire? seriously we all know when we are teenagers that someday we will be old and we will wish that we were young again and able to do all that immature stuff so why rush into being an adult when you can sit around doing kid things and having fun and living your teenage years for what they are worth. the whole reason we have these years are so that you can immature before you have to grow up and have kids and a serious full time job or maybe even just college... im just hate it when people say i wish i were older... why the  HELL  would you want to be older... whoa when your 18 you can buy cigarettes but what the hell is the point of smoking anymore if its not illegal (by the way i hate cigarettes it is the  most digusting  thing you could do so stop!!!) oh but wait cigarettes may not be illegal but having sex with younger teens is so whoa you can still be rebellious well you know youre getting 50 different std's oh or maybe you'd want to be 21 so you can drink, um yeah well maybe you want to become a lush but i dont... i have absolutely nothing against drinking, i myself have done and does it but once its there at your disposal you can become a lush and an alcoholic and never get anywhere in life except of the month of december when you can dress up as santa and fuck every girl in sight and swear at little kids... god damn who would ever do that to themselves and who would keep living like that for so many years? go out and get help!! please... i know so many people who throw their lives away doing stupid shit like that and it makes me want to cry... i myself dont want to throw away my life i really want to go as far as i can and i want to have a worthwhile life, why even live if you are dependent on so substance to keep you going when youre upset, down or even happy come on people wake up!! life is more than high school and impressing every person!! life goes on after that point and then you know what you have do something more than party to get anywhere... okay well my rides here so im done for now but dont be surprised if i bring this up again!!!

      well this weekend was a good time... lame but good. what am i saying the more lame the better in my case... i love weekends at my dads! so much freedom. friday night was a lot of fun. amanda and i met up and we went walking and stopped at the park and called many random people on her cell phone trying to find something to do and NO ONE WAS HOME!! not a one, except boz and i think hes kind of nervous to do something with us... i dont know or he doesnt like us i guess we'll never know... well we got to the end of our list and decided to call pat, yes thats my stalker, and we went to his house... now seeing as we didnt even go there until 10 we were out until 1:30 and my dad didnt care. isnt it nice to have parents that let you do what you want. but you know i actually had a really good time with pat and i was considering calling him today but i didnt get a chance and so i think that i will on tuesday i would tomorrow but i am going to do something with brittany because she leaves for england in 4 days and will be gone for an entire month yes a month... im going to miss her so much. but yeah tomorrow is dedicated to her because its the only day that she is free before she leaves so i need to visit her asap because shes one of my best friends...  saturday was my little sister's 5th birthday so although i was with my father this weekend i went with my mom, stepdad, little sister, brother, and mariah to the wisconsin dells it was a fun time... we went mini golfing and on a horse drawn wagon ride through the canyons, its was beautiful and our driver was hilarious and we also visited the family friends and they offered me to come and stay with them and work for them i would really like to but i really cant this july and i probably could only do it for about a week and a half in august but then if i like it i will go back next summer for longer... we'll see but i am excited for it... oh yes and then amanda came over to keep me company because no one was home and we just sat around and talked and we decided we want to go to summer camp... hahahah we were watching bug juice!!  and today well today has been nothing short of a relaxing day. my brother was gone and my daddy was recovering from dancing the night away at a wedding so i just laid around playing the windwaker for a second time... good times good times!  well the rest of the week is pretty jammed packed...  - monday. doing something with britt and amanda - tuesday. probably something with the stalker boy and amanda - wednesday. going to see fahrenheit 9/11 with kevipoo - thrusday. summerfest with dad and amanda - friday. summerfest to see DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL with kevipoo, mariah and maybe amanda - saturday. hang out with my mom, stepdad, and dannylin because its my last day before my dad's three weeks - sunday. FOURTH OF JULY probably going to party with my brother and mariah... maybe mandy will come. not going for sure but i'd like to.  then the three weeks begin... and on the 11th i leave for camping!! yay!! im excited. i think everyone else is to and my dad might bring his girlfriend and her kids!! yay more people... and then we get back on the 15th and then the 18th is pickles baby shower and then the 22nd is canoeing!! wow what a summer!! and august 1st is lost prophets concert!! yay... wowsers im so excited...  well now since everyone knows my summer play by play i guess im done on here...

      today was an absolute blast... seeing as i never want to sleep anymore... because to every geek in the world sleep is overrated, give us a double shot espresso and a tv and a video game and we will stay up well into the next day... now see my weakness happens to be my gamecube, i cant live without it... now i always get that comment "but youre a girl" yes, thanks for noticing but i am also a big geek and i am not ashamed of that, and anyways everyone is a geek in their own way and maybe its just that they hide away in their room and do their geeky things in there away from everyone?? i used to do that until i hit high school and became the biggest geek ever and you know what i have more friends now than i ever did throughout grade school... anyways not my point. so even though i was running on a few hours of sleep yesterday i stayed up really late... then today i slept until 12:30... i was kind of bummed i miss the whole morning and i am very much so a morning person and i missed my workout... ahhh i feel lazy... so then i laid around for a long time and then went to my dads and laid around some more... but then the fun time comes... we went and got amanda and we went to fond du lac and went minature golfing!!! YAY what fun and after that we got that great idea of going to the driving range... hahaha disasterous... but fun, even my dad sucked at it... anyways that was my day... and i had fun and i also found out that during the storm last night a tornado went through waupun... yikes and my poor stepsister and her kids live there and her poor little son was so terrified that he cant eat or sleep... i feel so bad... yes well this entry was extremely boring but i am so excited about the weekend because tomorrow i am going to see fahrenheit 9/11 with my brother ahh im so excited and saturday mylittle sister turns 5 and we are taking a nice little trip to the wisconsin dells to mini golf and go on a horse drawn carriage into the carverns... YAY and then sunday i am either going to six flags or i am going to see my aunts and uncles because we are having a family meeting about our week long camping trip that is coming up soon... im so excited because maxipad might be able to come... hahaha (sorry max for calling you that) im funny!! yes well i am sure i will be back soon with more news of my stalker! yay and with other boring news about what i did in the past few days! ps... 8 days until dashboard confessional and i am practically pissing my pants because i am so excited and i might get to meet them!!! AHHH i love them!!

      wowsers... today was the longest day of my life and i cant believe i am still up and willing to update this freaking thing... last night i went to bed at 12:30... you know a normal things for a high school student to do on their summer vacation but the not so normal thing was, i had to get up at   3:30 AM   to shower and leave for LaCrosse... a 2 1/2 hour drive so you'd assume that i would sleep there, but i didnt so i was running all day on 3 hours of sleep... i did nap on the way home but that is getting ahead of myself... so we get to lacrosse around 7:30am and my parents ditched my at my childhood friend's house so that they could take my older brother to college registration... im so sad he's leaving me... anyways... sumathy, my friend of course, decided that she would show me the downtown area and take me to riverside park... it was exciting... we rode the public bus system thingy... and i was just amazed by it.. its so convinent.. yikes but its not like we need those here in my little mayville... anyways she took me to a cute little coffee shop and we had some espresso (then i was wired) and then we wandered around downtown and then walked to the park and walked along the mississippi!!! YAY and then we rode the bus back to her house and i got to pull the thing!!! YAY how exciting... hahaha lame-O... anyways and then we played some hardcore nitendo 64 and some presidents and then i came home... just to be here for about a half hour when the tornado sirens go off and have my mom freaking out about us going into the basement... which never happened but there was actually a tornado about 20miles north of us and it hit one of the towns that my parents have their karate centers in so my mom is flipping out because they closed down all entrance into the town and shes worried that the karate center might be hurt (that sounds a little weird) and sadly our power went out and i had to sit around with my older sister and her boyfriend all night... and my little sister slept right through it!! WHAHAHA i wish i would have... it was torture... well anyways i feel like i am extremely boring today so i am just going to go i need sleep because i have to get up tomorrow morning and do pilates at 7am so i need to get a little sleep... over and out -

      wowsers... yet again another eventful day... surprisingly for me i was up at quarter to 7am this morning... walked my little sister to school, meet her teacher, came home wanting so baddly to go back to sleep to find that yes my mom was pestering me into working out like i had promised... so i did!! it was fun Pilates for Dummies YES!! exactly what i need and it really wasnt that bad... i plan to do more of it when the time comes... so then after the workout i was dying just to go back to sleep just a little nap... but nope it didnt happen... i laid out in the sun for a half hour... so to get ready for that of course i changed into my swimsuit, not my new one of course the old one so that i was just popping out all over the place... then put a robe on so none of my family could see me and i headed outside to the lawn with beachtowel in hand... i take my robe off, spread my towel on the ground to find that as im trying to fit my short stubby body onto this towel that it seems to be a tad bit short... damn oh well i didnt want to waddle my little self back inside to get a different one so... i decided to scarifice my poor little feet to the lawn... dundundun... i lay down on my tummy first and the bugs begin to be drawn to my from every angle... i try to ignore the crawling sensation but after i start feeling my body lifting off the ground and being carried away i begin to swat repeatedly and wildly to get all the creatures off me once i was situated again i lay myself down thinking finally a chance to relax and listen to the nature when a big ass train comes speeding through town at top rates scaring me to death with its horn... so i gave up on the getting in one with nature act and decided to just lay and count, counting of course how long until i get to turn my little body over and let the other side roast for awhile... this helped until i realized a group of birds going psycho right above my head... why? you ask, well of course im laying near the nest of these guys and they are worried that i might hurt the babies... yes well i begin ignoring and go back to my peaceful counting techniques of ancient wontons... when my mind begins to wonder and i come to the conclusion that if i move these birds are going to come a take a chunk out of me... i get scared and begin shaking... then i realize with one move of my finger or toe these birds are going to become vicious carnivores and ripe one off to feed to the babies i start freaking out about ready to scream but trying to stay calm... nothing ever became of the vicious carnivorious birds but i seriously thought there might... so my sugestion to you is dont get up early, do pilates, and go outside in a tiny bikini that is extremely embarassing and lay directly where the birds nest is... just dont do it... it know that it sounds extremely tempting, you know having bugs crawling all over you and being attacked and carried away or getting pooped out doing a workout but DONT do it... its not worth it... i will have nightmares for weeks of this horrendous morning... luckily... i was not killed, yes i lived to tell the terrifying story... and i came inside and napped!!! amen... a nice long nap to find that my stalker is out to get me... ahhh im going to his house in less than an hour... SAVE ME!!! someone come and save me!!! oh well tomorrow i get to go to LaCrosse so im okay with the tortureous day im having today... over and out -

      wowsers... once again a very uneventful day... i decided that i had to push off the applications until tomorrow because living in this town most places of employment are closed on mondays plus travis told me he would drive me!  i stayed up too late last night so i didnt start my workout this morning... im very disappointed with myself... oh well tomorrow is another day and then wednesday i get to go to lacrosse for the day to visit my friend sumathy the sucky part is we leave at 4am and i have to babysit my little sister the whole time im there. oh well i guess life goes on... but its funny because the whole reason i stayed up last night was to watch adult programming hahaha a show called bliss on the oh! oxygen channel for women i just wanted to see what it was about and how the hell it could be considered adult programming on a basic cable channel but now i know why... there was a lot of stuff i didnt need to see on the show like some hardcore lesbian sex... and you saw it all i had to change the channel because i wanted to vomit... i have no problem with lesbian or gay couples basically i dont want to watch anyone having sex... sex is very scary to me and im not ready for it so why should i be watching it... but then again i religously watch the sunday sex show so i guess im just a huge contradicting mess arent i? hahaha oh well. well i am going to go upstairs i have some stuff to tend to.. over and out -

      wowsers... i am so excited tomorrow to go around and get applications and i pray to god that i get one... i have lots of plans for the money... my first paycheck will get to a fish and a fish bowl for my little sister because her birthday is on saturday... i have no money now to be able to get her anything but once i get the paycheck i am going to get a fish for her and probably one for myself and the rest is going to clothes... i found tons i want and tons i need so i think that that is my first priority and then i will start saving for florida and costa rica and for college... i love the thought of having money and having responsibilty and i think that i might pay some of my way into a drivers ed class during school time because i think i should at least get my license so i have to option to drive but i dont necessarily have to drive... i dont know we'll see. well im going now because we are going to make blueberry muffins... over and out -

       Wow... two nights in a row, Gabby!!! You're frickin' awesome!!! I had so much fun tonight!! So many people were there. I'm not going to make a list, and I'm not going to tell you why the cops came but they did. Not that it was a big deal. We weren't doing anything bad. Amanda and I reigned victorious at foosball. We beat Jim's and Tyler's asses!!! Hell Yes.. Best 2 out of 3 and we won!!! YAY!! haha...&nbsp;I actually talked to a lot of people that I normally dont so I am proud. I dont know I get along with everyone. It's not like I have a reason not to... Well this was a very poor entry but I'm tired... had a long fun day and I am going to work out tomorrow morning!! YAY!!

       Well today is going to be a good day. I am going to go out to Travis's later tonight and have a good time!! YAY!! I am excited and I think that I am able to stay out late!! Yes!!!    I feel so bad because my sister is so sick. Its not really a good thing to be sick when you're pregnant. So we are all a bit worried. She hasnt been to work in 3 days and she cant keep any food in her system. I feel so bad for her. I just hope that she gets better before the baby is born otherwise the baby will be sick when she's born. That wouldnt be a good thing. I hope she gets better!!   Oh and I was kind of mean in my past entry. I'm sorry. I didnt mean to come off as a bitch. I just wanted to get across the idea that I'm over it... Completely and totally over it.   Anyways... I am super pumped for tonight!! its going to be a blast. Well I just now remember that I have to go to my dad's tonight... SHIT!!! I dont want to go!!! I just wanted to jump around my house all day. GRRR!!! now I have to deal with showering and getting dressed and all the bullshit stuff that I didnt want to do until later. GRRR...   adios   -Gabby

       I am so frickin proud of myself. I actually accomplished a lot today!! YAY!! I went to my appointment and got that all taken care of. Then I came home and burned 11 cd's which took all day. Along with a break in there to go to the park with my mom and stepdad and little sister. We had fun and played volleyball with some kids who were there who are karate students. It was fun. Then I went out tonight to Jonny's and we played some weird game like "smashing testicles" or something along those names. But anyways despite the name it was a lot of fun. Amanda and I were a team... The team with the red balls. And we played James and Michelle and beat their asses!!! and then we played Jon and Pat, and beat their asses too. HAHAHA. We reign victorious.&nbsp;I had a lot of fun!! A lot A lot of fun!!! I am so happy to be able to go out and have a good time...   Wow... well you might think that by telling me these things that I will question you... but I dont want to know. if you are getting around with some other girl, well good for you. and even if you are serious about her, well good for you. these things dont make me interested. all I&nbsp;want to be is friends. I dont know if you can handle that one. I might have made myself seem interested the other night but it was just a question for later reference. and seeing as you couldnt even give me a straight answer I have begun to care less. A lot less. You've known that I adore you. But people's feelings change and you've turned me off. I guess same goes for your feelings about me, aye?? Yeah well I hope that your good thing that is happening is really really good for you. I mean that, I'm not saying that in a mean way. You deserve something good and I hope that you find it. And I hope that maybe we will be able to be friends. I really hope so. I think that you are fun and can be fun, but friends is all the more I want. Not to hurt your feelings but I am not interested, not anymore. And that probably doesnt bug you at all, but I thought that you should know. And I needed to get it off my chest. I'm happy with my life, I am perfectly content with it all. I dont need a change. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what I am sorry for but I'm sorry.    And about how I started this paragraph, well I'm not even sure that that is what your intentions were. I'm sorry if I misjudged the situation. I dont know. Maybe I'm right Maybe I'm wrong, Only you will know for sure. I just hope that we are still friends. I consider you mine, and I really hope that you consider me yours. Only time will tell what will happen.   Anyways... I am so proud of what I have done today. I have really had an accomplished day. I even had a bonding conversation with my mom and I think that it helped insure trust between us. I mean my curfew was 11:30 tonight!!! Thats really good for the girl who normally has to be home at 10:00. Wow and its not like I'm just talking to her to get on her good side, its like I actually enjoy talking to her. She always has something good to say or something that will help me. I dont know I've really grown to adore my mom. She's amazing. And I really had a good night tonight. I didnt think about anything bad, I just had a good time. I messed around with james's phone and I changed his banner to "Jizzy-James" and his welcome thing is "Gabby Says Hello" and his ringtone is "Feeling This"&nbsp;by Blink-182.&nbsp;&nbsp;And his screen saver is a frog and his&nbsp;background is orange and has dots&nbsp;all over it!!! I&nbsp;pimped out his phone!!! Haha. Goodtimes. I just hope that&nbsp;I can still have just James and me days when britt gets because because of course all of us will hang out together and Just&nbsp;Britt and I will hang out but I also just want James day too... I dont know how that will go but we will see. He told me&nbsp;that he would... lets&nbsp;see if he keeps his promise...    Okay well these are the cd's&nbsp;I burned today:     Spiderman 2 soundtrack    Blink-182; blink-182    dude ranch; blink-182    the&nbsp;mark tom and travis show; blink-182    cheshire cat; blink-182    take off your pants and jacket; blink-182    enema of the state; blink-182    so long, astoria; the&nbsp;ataris    international superhits; green day    a mark, a mission, a brand, a scar; dashboard confessional    and some other random dashboard cd. &nbsp;   they are all frickin awesome!!! i cant wait to listen to them... but i am going to go to bed now i dont want to sleep away the day... we might call chadd from waterloo tomorrow, mandy and I, and i might beg my dad to take me to see him!!!  well nighty night  -gabby

       Well I never went for my walk. HaHa. I guess that makes me a liar again. Opps. But really I dont feel bad because I would have missed Sumathy's phone call if I would have left. I had a nice long talk with her about how her trip to Texas was and how I dont want school to start. I dont know it was nice to hear from her.    I decided that I am going to start the morning Kardio Kick class at the karate center. It starts tomorrow and I cant make it because of my ortho. appointment but I am going to go on friday. Its only on wednesdays and fridays which kind of sucks but maybe I will do the night time ones on some days. I dont know. But I know I need to get myself into shape. I want to look good before school starts. And I want a job before then. And maybe even get my braces off before then, that one might be pushing it but I am praying.    Oh my goodness. NipTuck was so good tonight. I love that show. I really love Christian Troy, he's one sexy man. And I didnt have to watch alone because my sister came home early from work because she didnt feel well so it was kind of nice to have someone there. I was bummed that they arent showing it again right now, instead Rescue Me is on. GRRR. They are determined to confuse me.    Man... I cant believe that I am going to be a Junior. It just doesnt feel right. But I'm also not going to complain because that means 2 more years and then I am done with high school. And that thought makes me sad but also I am ready to get out of here. Its so weird growing up with the same people forever. I mean I have been with these same kids all my life so even though it sucks that I dont have a boyfriend, I also have to realize these are just a few of the people that I will meet in my life and I have known almost all of them too long to date. I mean the only people that I have been interested in are people that I just started to talk to. Everyone else are more like siblings that love interests. Okay I'm lame. I am really really lame. Who cares. Its the truth, isn't it? Anyways I still cant believe it. Holy Crap!! I feel really old. When really I'm not old at all. But older than I used to be. Which is logical.    Well I have to go to bed because of my appointment tomorrow morning. We have to leave by 10 so that means I have to get up at 8:30 or 9:00 because Kevin and I both have to shower.   Goodnight   -Gabby

       Well I decided after long deliberation that I dont want to do anything tonight. I mean besides going for a walk which I am about to leave for. I dont want to call anyone, dont want to see anyone and I really just dont want anything to do with anyone. For some reason I am not feeling to social and fun today. Maybe its the thought of the ortho. appt. I have to go to tomorrow, where I know that he is going to tell me that I cant get them off because of some stupid reason or another. I fucking hate my dentist person. He's an ass. He never even gets my name right let alone actually inform me about what is going on im my mouth. What a fucker!?!?! I'd like to have them off before school starts. Then I could go and get retakes of my school pic so it doesnt have braces. Let's hope it happens. AHHH Now I'm all angered up and I just want to scream. You wouldnt believe how moody my dentist makes me. GRRR... But back to what I was talking about. I dont want to be around people right now. Its just one of those days where I am feeling extremely lazy and crabby. It happens to the best of us.    But one really good thing about tonight is the fact that Nip Tuck is on. The bad thing about that is I wont be having any company :( Normally Amanda and Max join me and swoon the TV but not tonight. Mandy is at her grandmas and who knows what Max is doing but he wouldnt come if its just he and I. Oh well I will watch it myself.   Oh... I cant believe I forgot to tell y'all that I cant go see the Lost Prophets. WAH!! My mom wont let me go to the rave. haha. figures. Oh well. I'm scared of the Rave anyways and I dont really know Lost Prophets' songs and I dont have anything to wear. Maybe some other time when someone I actually listen to comes I will push my mom into letting me but as of now I'm not too bummed. Although it would have been fun to go and listen to the music and hang out with Travis. I guess he'll have to take me to Hilary Duff instead... HAHA I'm joking I dont like her music. I can sing better than her. And that's not saying much.    I talked to Britt today for the first time in forever. It wasnt very long though because she had to go. But it was nice to just say hello and see how things are going for her. I bet she will enjoy the next couple of days and then be happy to return home soon. only 6 more days. I probably wont see her for 7 or 8 but still I am sure she will be happy to get home and see her family and James and hang out with Max before he leaves us for forever. AHHH What are Mandy and I going to do without Max??? He's always the one we call and annoy if we cant find anything to do. It will be so weird when he's gone. Part of the Group will be missing. Amanda and I better start preparing now, or we might go crazy while hes gone.   Well I am going now.   -gabby

       Well I am super happy because I fixed my hair today!! It looks absolutely adorable. I have to take a picture so that I can do it again sometime!!  HAHA  I am lame. But still it makes me feel tens times better about the way I look.    Anyways My friend Sumathy has been emailing me and she is going to come and visit soon! That's really exciting. She wants to come for my birthday which would be awesome. She might have to deal with me being gone sometimes because I'm " busy". Haha  well I kind of am. I dont know we'll see what she and I can work out.    Oh man. Tonight I am going to be all alone.  WAH !! My mom and sister and stepdad are going to karate so I will be here. Unless of course I call Emily or someone to do something and I know that I am about to call Emily but if she's busy I dont know if I will call anyone else. We'll have to see how I feel. I'm not sure who I would want to call anyways. I'm not feeling too social.  Blah , I hate feeling tired and worn out. It makes me not want to do anything and yet I still want to go out.  Blah .  Blah .  Blah . All I ever do is complain.  BOO FRICKITY WHO , Gabby! Get over it!! Not that I even really have something to complain about but I always manage to find some random thing.  GRRR !!!    Well I'm going. I'm  tired ,  hungry ,  lonely , and feeling  lazy .    -gabby

       Last night I went to bed early just so that I could get up at 8:30 this morning. Well obviously it didnt work. I ended up sleeping until 11:00. Grrr. I really wanted to get up and do something conventional in the morning hours while it is still cool, but it didnt happen. Maybe tomorrow. But even though I went to bed early I ended up reading more of the bible, because I'm crazy, and writing in my journal so actually I was up until 1:00. Which is really late to me. Oh well.    Well I need to shower because I smell bad and my hair is all over. Then I am going to call Emily and see what she is up to today and if she is busy I think I will take myself for a little walk. Maybe I'll stop up by Boz's if I walk that far or maybe I will call some random person. Who knows? Well I'm going now   -gabby

       Well tonight I went out for a nice little walk with Mandy. It was nice to get out of the house and do something active. And then we went to her house and watched The Assistant. That show is hilarious. I want to  marry  Andy Dick. He's so adorable, in a weird old man way.    I'm not sure what I am going to do with myself tomorrow. I think that I am going to call Emily. No wait, I am going to call her. Maybe she and I will go see a movie or something. We'll see, otherwise if she is busy I will call some random person. I'm not sure who it will be but someone. I'm really bummed because I have been wanting to talk to Britt, I mean just to say hello and she what she has been up to, but she's never on when I am. WAHH. It makes me sad. But she will be home soon.    I found a pair of shoes today that I LOVE!! They are black with white polka dots and a pink bow. They are high heeled pumps. Absolutely adorable! Along with many other things that I would buy if I had money. But I am still pushing off the job applications. I just cant seem to get ambition. Maybe I will tomorrow along with working out. We'll see. But I need my mom to help me because I am retarded when it comes to filling them out. I cant answer half the questions. They all scare me.   Oh. I forgot to tell you what my grandma said about my hair being black. Yesterday when she was up for my dads party the first thing she said was "I like the Gothic look". I was in shock, I dont look gothic, all I did was dye my hair black and automatically thats what she thought. Not that I have a problem with Gothic people I just found it weird that that was what she automatically associated me with. Then later that day she told me I look Mexican. I dont look mexican, I'm pale!! That makes it a little difficult and then my aunt chimed in the fact that if i tanned I could look Indian. haha. So I am a Gothic Mexican Indian!! AWESOME!! I rock!!   I want to be a bartender when I turn 18. I was watching the championship on food network and they are freakin' amazing. They just throw around the bottles and can mix 10 drinks in 36 seconds, it was breath-taking. I want to learn to do that, but I cant. I'm not nearly coordinated enough. I drop everything, I'm a huge clutz. Oh well, its one of those things that you like to watch and cant do, along with gymnastics.    I did all of my laundry... Its all done. Even my favorite blankie and my robe! YAY! Nothing smells like cigarettes anymore. And I have a choice from anything to wear tomorrow. That's exciting. That reminds me that I need to go and get my blanket out of the dryer. It amazes me how different a house with AC and a house without it feels. My dad has airconditioning and he always has it running where as my mom doesnt even have the option to open the windows downstairs let alone have airconditioning. But as nice as being cool is, it really dried out my hair and my sinuses were a lot more sensitive there. Here its all natural. I mean I dont even have a fan in my room and yet I am completely content unless its really humid. And having radiators really helps my hair stay healthy. But I'm sad because its so damaged after being at dad's for so long. I dont know I am sure that I can nurse it back to being nice.    I really love this sweatshirt of my brother's. Is that weird? I dont know sometimes people think that I am weird for wearing my brothers sweatshirt but I really consider it mine now. I dont want to give it back, I really like it. Not that that has anything to do with anything important but is anything on here ever really important? Hell No. If it was it wouldnt be on here by me.    I'm really kind of psycho about this blog. It's something that I am always working on. I feel weird if I dont write on it all the time, even if I have nothing to say I still write something. Every entry's so random and unusual and they show every side of me. Its weird that I am so obsessive about this. Oh well. Its something that makes me feel better.   Well it is time for bed. I want to get up early tomorrow and workout.   Nighty Night   -gabby    &nbsp;

        Well today has been a total drag. I am so bored. I played Mario Party 5 with my little sister for an hour and then we played some other game she made up. And during all of this I have been doing my laundry because everything I own smells like cigarettes. I still have another load to do. Ick. And now I am on my own for a few hours. My brother is visiting Mariah in Door County and my parents and Dannylin are at karate. I'm at a loss of what to do with myself. I'm not feeling like being social and at the same time I dont feel like sitting here alone. I think I am going to go for a walk. I feel like a fatty, because I've been so lazy lately. So hopefully going for a walk will make me feel less lazy. We'll see.    My sister's due date got pushed back to August 22nd. Yikes 11 days longer than it should have been. But I think its better if she doesnt have her until then because she doesnt have to worry about having her at work. That would really suck, and to tell you the truth she isnt really even dropping yet so I think that she will probably have her near the 22nd. I dont know though, I obviously dont know anything about having kids. Thank God. But someday I am sure that I will. Not soon though.    Last night I was at a loss of what to do with myself so I decided to start reading Slaughthouse 5 again and also I started reading the bible. Weird I know but I would like to read it once through. I'm not really that religious but I mean I have been confirmed so maybe reading it is something I should do. We will see how long that last, by tomorrow I will never want to pick it up again.     Well I am going to go now. I am going to get dressed and fix my hair and then I'm going to go for my walk.    -gabby    &nbsp;

       As much as I longed to be home and as much as I love being home, I hate it. Its a whole new atmosphere that is foreign to me. I really enjoy dad's house. I normally had it to myself and I could basically have whoever I wanted over and I could leave whenever I want. Now I'm back to having to answer Who? What? When? and Where?. It sucks. And I cant just invite random people over because my mom would interrogate them the whole time they are here. I dont know I miss my dad's and at the same time I'm happy I'm home. Grrr. Its so frustrating. Boo Frickity Who! I am fine being here. Its not like my parents are ever home at night, they leave at 3:30 and get home around 8:30 or 9:00 so I guess its kind of the same process. We'll have to see, I haven't even been here a full 24 hours so I will just have to give it time.    Well my mom is gone getting Dannylin right now and me being an idiot promised Danny I would play with her when she got home from school. That means I need to go and shower and get ready for an hour of hell with her. Wish me luck. And later I think I will go out. Maybe? I dont know for sure.   -gabby

       I'm sorry to announce this to the world, or the people who read this. But Jim is a stupid shitface. He is a dumbass. He went crazy tonight because he could send Brittany an e-mail. Yes, I dont know the circumstances or what has been going on between him but he needs to chill out. He got all pissy because shes at her storage limit and his email cant get through to her. Boo Frickity Who. And what pissed me off even more the fact that he said its probably because of those "fuckers max and jarred" What the hell?!?! He is the biggest baby ever. How much you want to bet that if I said that I email Britt a lot he would have gone psycho on me and killed me. He is way too up tight for his own good. My god, its only been 3 days, thats it. They arent a married frickin' couple and they are only 16. He should not be freaking out over 3 days of not talking, even if they are fighting. Its not like couples are always together everyday of there life and its not like 16 year olds should freak out over 4 weeks apart, if anything it should do them good. He's way too wrapped up in her. He's 16 for christ's sakes. So if he reads this, and I hope he does, and he confronts me on it that is my reasoning. He is 16, he has the rest of his life ahead of him and many more girlfriends before he finds the one. I'm not saying the he and Britt wont last but if they do I am sure that at one point in time they will take a break to meet new people. How can someone my age say that he is going to spend the rest of his life with someone when they are so young. Come on when youre this age you are more likely to cheat on someone than to last. But maybe I'm wrong, I'm not saying I'm right, they may prove me completely wrong and if they do good for them. Even so I am sticking with my thoughts of 3 days of not talking is not a big deal, and if it is then you are way too attached for your own good.   Well anyways I really needed to vent about that because it really pissed me off. I know its not a nice thing to do and I will probably regret it but I cant deny that I mean every single word of it. If I ever become that infatuated with someone I hope someone will slapped me and tell me I'm being stupid. Please. I get so carried away on things like this because its something that really bothers me. I'm sorry. I dont mean to come off as a stupid jealous bitch, because I'm not. Or maybe I am, maybe I am just wishing that I had someone to be attached to. I dont know but I still think its gross. Its not like I dont want to be in a relationship. Of course I do. And of course it would be a serious relationship and of course I would want to see and talk to the person that I am with as much as possible but I cant let that be the center of my life. I have seen too many people get into a relationship and suddenly they ditch all their friends. I cant do that, I would include my boyfriend in the things I do with my friends but I would also do things with just my friends. I really do want a relationship but everytime I find someone that I feel like I could be with something gets in the way. And really I'm not going to push it. I'm young, I hopefully have many years ahead of me. If I do get into a seriously relationship soon, good for me. But its not something that I am going to force onto myself. I want something real, not just something to fill the void of not having someone. I can handle being alone, I may not always like it but I try not to dwell on that fact. I deal with it and I remind myself that something could happen tomorrow and I could fall in love and it also might not happen for a few years. Only time will tell. No lie I could tell you someone I want a relationship with but wanting it isnt going to get me it any faster. Its just more likely to push it away and for it to never happen. I will just keep telling myself that something will happen, I cant make it happen I will fall into it. Or let's hope so.   goodnight   -gabby

       Hello there, the angel from my nightmare.   Well I havent really done anything tonight. I ate some food and I talked with my mom but that's it. I am so extremely excited because Travis is going to go and buy my concert tickets in few days. YAY! I hope my mom lets me go, its actually in a week. I dont really know a lot of songs by the Lost Prophets but I'm sure it will be a good concert. I hope it is. I also feel really bad because I cant pay for my own ticket and Travis doesnt even really want to go. Oh well. He offered and its my birthday present from him and Nicole.    Oh, I was looking yesterday and I am really excited because I have coupons for six flags to get a friend in for 1/2 off anytime from August 9th - 29th. So I can go up to 4 different times with 4 different coupons. Its really nice having a pass and all.    Well I think I have to break down and fill out my applications tomorrow. Its finally time to suck it up and do it. I need to get money, I'm sick of pissing people off and making them pay for me. Everyone tells me I'm lazy and pathetic so I guess I'm just sick of it. I need to give in to the pressure and do it. Along with taking driver's ed because I'm sick of depending on others to tote me around. It's bullshit and no one likes to do it so I might as well just give in to that while I'm at it and get my frickin' license and tote my little self around. I dont know I think I just need to be responsible for myself for once instead of having other people have to worry about me or having me not being able to do something because I cant afford it or I cant get there. I always feel so bad so I'm done being a mooch... Well actually I'm not until I get a job and I wont stop mooching rides for a long time because I can't take a class anytime soon. Still at least I am putting forth effort to do it. Anyways&nbsp;I must be going, my brother wants to computer for awhile.   -gabby

       Happy Birthday Daddy!!! I hope you had a great day!!    Well I am finally home! YES!! I haven't even started to unpack. Oh well, I can do that tomorrow. I am just so happy to be back here and all. And yet I am kind of sad. I'm really sad that my freedom is kind of gone, but really my mom isn't too crazy about it.    Today was a lot of fun though. A LOT! Veronice, Ellen, Tim, Nelly, Michael, Nicole, Travis, Tracie, Rocky, and Aubrey came to celebrate with us. It was fun. We did a lot of talking and Travis and I played a lot of football, well technically catch. And we flagged down the ice cream man and had some ice cream! It was a good time. I really enjoy Veronica, she's so sweet. I adore her.    Well I know that I said that I was going to do a recap of the past three weeks with my dad, but i guess I kind of discovered that its really not necessary. But here are a few of the highlights:    Fourth of July: We lost The Chad. Damn it. Fire at Max's with Josh and Amanda. Mandy yelling ASS really loud when the firecrackers stopped. The guy who almost died when the box of fireworks blew up.    July 9 and 10: The 9th, going to see anchorman with Mandy and Chad. Chad's really funny stains on his pants. HAHA. The pizza getting dumped in Mandy's garbage, sorry! And Chad and Mandy over to watch 50 First Dates on the 10th. Good times!!    July 11 - 15: CAMPING!! Fun and not so fun. Extreme Volleyball, Taking Kevin's car, Sleeping with Max, Enjoying the time with the family and friends. I'll never forget how long those 5 days seemed to take!!    Tuesday Nights: Nip Tuck. Swooning around the TV with Mandy and Max. YES!!    July 22nd: CANOEING!!&nbsp;What a blast!! The scary bug and the cutie Chadd. Sinking our boat trying to learn how to splash. All those good times.    And WOW now its over. Time flies.&nbsp; And its really has been so much fun And I really have left so much out. And the month of June rocked too. I hope August is just as amazing!! It is my "summer of sin" so it better last into the school year.    Well I know I will be back with some more later but I must be going now. Oh but I've been to 15 states... in your face beotch!!! 15!! Illinois, Indianna, Nebraska, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Texas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. YES!! I rock!!!    bye    -gabby

      The Brilliant Dance So this is odd, the painful realization that all has gone wrong and nobody cares at all. and nobody cares at all. So you buried all your lover's clothes and burned the letters lover wrote, but it doesn't make it any better. Does it make it any better? And the plaster dented from you fist in the hall where you had your first kiss reminds you that the memories will fade. So this is strange, our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance where nobody leads at all, where nobody leads at all. And the picture frames are facing down and the ringing from this empty sound is deafening and keeping you from sleep. And breathing is a foreign task and thinking's just too much to ask and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights. This is incredible. Starving, insatiable, yes, this is love for the first time. Well, you'd like to think that you were invincible. Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time. Well this is the last time.  The Good Fight Consider the odds, consider the obvious. The martyr is meaningless, the campaign has died. In the planning stages and the fallen faces are the singular proof that it was ever alive. This purchased rebelliion has been outbidded, denounced, and rescinded and left to die championless. I begged you not to go. I begged you, I pleaded. Claimed you as my only hope and watched the floor as you retreated. Hope has sprung a perfect dive a perfect day, a perfect lie, a slowly crafted monologue conceding your defeat. This purchased rebellion has been outbidded, denounced, and rescinded and left to die championless. I begged you not to go. I begged you, I pleaded. Claimed you as my only hope and watched the floor as you retreated. Does it comfort you to know you fought the good fight? Basking in your victory, hollow and alone to boast your bitter braggin rights to anyone who'll listen. While you're left with nothing tanglible to gain.  This Bitter Pill Walking away, it's not that same as running. is it to you now that you've run this in the ground. And you say take this. This medicine is just what you deserve. Swallow, choke and die. And this bitter bill is leaving you with such an angry mouth. One that's void of all discretion such an awful tearing sound. With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare glaring over you and over you this feeling of despair is never wearing out. it's wearing off and its leaving you with such a heavy heart and a head to match. The bottle is waiting the cap is twisted begging to be used and so are you. And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth. one that's void of all discretion such an awful tearing sound. With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare glaring over you and over you this feeling of despair is never wearing out.

      Well today all i did was sit around bored out of my mind for hours on end alone. I watched a little marathon of $40 a day on food network and then chris and josh and amanda came and got me and we went to marsh days for about 2 hours. it was lame, but alright i was happy to get out and walk for awhile. i dont know it wasnt too bad.  Tomorrow i have to get up early and pack for my moms. YAY i finally get to go home!! and then we have to clean like crazy for everyone to get here at noon. It should be fun. and then i go home at 6pm... i cant wait to get all unpacked and in my pjs and sit on the computer that actually works for hours on end until i cant keep my eyes open and sleep in my bed and then wake up to my mom and little sister instead of the sound of slurped coffee... i cant frickin wait!!! i decided that tomorrow i am going to do an entry about the past 3 wonderful weeks at my fathers. im going to go indepth on all the fun things that have happened over the long period of time, the good the bad and the ugly. its going to be fun to go back and remember all the fun times... wow i really cant believe that july is coming to a close so fast. it feels like just yesterday it was the last day of school and i was getting ready to go to harry potter with the gang and now its the 24 of july!! holy crap. summers almost over, school registration is coming up on the 10 and 11. nicoles going to have her baby soon!! AHH i cant believe that its already here i cant believe that 8 months ago i was being told that she was pregnant. its going by so fast. im sad. seriously i dont want this summer to end, i dont want to go back to school. for gods sake im going to be a frickin' JUNIOR. thats scary like im going to be having junior prom this year... what?!?! and then the year will fly by and then it will be our summer before SENIOR year and i will go ape because i never want it to end. im going to cry when i graduate, i really dont want it to happen. oh well, its still far away. i have 2 more years to enjoy before i have to grow up and move out and go to college and even though it will be the end of high school i am excited to get out and be with a new group of people. anyways i really look forward to talking about my 3 weeks with my dad tomorrow on here... oh... i tried to write a song today, well not really but sort of. i sang it and all but then when i actually wanted to write it down i forgot the rhythm so i couldnt do it. WAHH oh well... i guess it will come around again sometime. i think its time for me to end this entry... the content of it is getting old and i dont really want to think about it anymore. i cant wait for tomorrow!! YAY!! i'm going home!!! nighty night -gabby

      well tomorrow is my dads birthday so i have to clean the house today. i am supposed to be doing it right now but i am lazy and i dont want to. we are having my family come up tomorrow for a nice little bbq. it should be fun. and veronice and company are coming too but probably not chadd or ellen because they have to work. it should still be lots of fun. and surprisingly tomorrow is my last day at my dads and then i get to go back home!!! i am so excited and yet i am going to miss the freedom to do whatever i want, whenever i want. oh well it will be nice to be home and sleeping in a bed again. im excited to just be home. i really cant wait. and i cant wait until my sister has her little baby!! i hope shes cute. and its going to be so exciting. wow... exciting is the word of the day! i am excited for a lot of stuff. its not very exciting things but i have to have something to look forward to.  i cant wait to plan all the rest of my summer... i would still likt to go to the lost prophets concert and i would like to go camping at the ledge for a night and i would like to go canoeing at least one more time and i really really want to go to six flags a few more times and once especially with chadd. hes my new friend and i really hope that he gets his license soon so he can come and visit or maybe i will have to work something out with max so when he goes to visit kait and ellen i can go and visit chadd. and there are a ton of other things that i want to get done but none really come to mind right now. i cant wait!!! well i will be back to update again soon -gabby

      well my hair turned out really well!! My brother said i did really well for doing it by myself for the first time. but there is dye all over me. oh well. Pat came over to visit me while i was alone tonight. it was nice even though i look like a wreck. oh and josh came and visited for awhile. it was nice to have a little visit where i didnt get all bitchy and crazy on everyone. im proud of myself.  i have a good feeling that i will be able to sleep tonight! i dyed my hair to get rid of the memories of you and now im different and over it, or at least that is what i am telling myself. i am no longer going to dwell on you and what happened. ive had my share of heartache and remorse and ive had my share of dwelling for too long on those things. i am sick of letting myself get so caught up in you and yet i cant seem to let go. there is a part of me that makes me think that you will change your mind and suddenly everything will be okay and it will all make sense again. but i know im wrong, the more i think of the things that could happen the more unlikely they are to become true. i just wish that i knew why, i wish i knew what was going through your head and i wish i knew what is keeping this from working. and at the same time maybe it is all better off left unsaid and me not knowing, but the less i know the less likely i am to get over it. im trying to change myself and who i associate with to help me forget but its harder than you think, its harder than anyone thinks. some people move on quickly and some people can forget and i cant. i get attached easily, but not often, and once i am i cant let go... not until i get what i want out of it. you helped me get over my last problem with someone and now you become the next, its funny how that works. i just wish you would have given us a chance because i know that you cared and that you wanted it to, but something held you back. what? i dont know, but i wish it wasnt there i wish that i could have worked. but it didnt and i need to face that fact and move on. im trying. just give me time. goodnight -gabby --- its funny how i have conversations with people on here.

      well i couldnt sleep for the life of me last night. I laid awake listening to dashboard confessional over and over. I feel asleep around 3 but it wasnt a very sound sleep, i kept twitching and wake up and random moments. Then I woke up at 7:22 and it was hot as hell in my house and i needed to go to the bathroom. I went back to sleep, having a weird weird dream and jumped around. Woke up at 10:00 and then i napped until 12:30 because i felt like shit. I seem to always get really sick when im PMS-ing, as some say. Oh well. I ended up calling james and we wanted to go to a movie but then decided that there wasnt a good one playing and we went through many random options that either got vetoed or werent possible. so we ran to beaver dam and i got some hair dye. And now my hair is BLACK!!! YAY... i did it all by myself so it was a little messy and i even got it on my leg. HAHA... next time i will be better. It actually looks really good and i even took the time to blowdry it. well i am going to go and watch tv or play zelda. See ya -gabby

      at this very moment in time i wish it wasnt night and i wish i wasnt tired and i wish i wasnt here. im not sure what id rather be or where i would rather be but anything would be better than this. i am so amazingly tired and yet i cant sleep. the thought of everything is driving me crazy and the only thing that keeps me sane is life questions. and well these questions, which are nothing short of frustrating, keep me sane they also make me crazy. but its my way to forget about everything else that makes things seem so frustrating. questions like what's life, what are we really here for, how do we know that there is an ozone, how do we know that our life is only a freak second of someone else, how do people become attracted to each other, how do you fall in love, how do you know its love, how can you prove your feelings, what are feelings, why do we experience more bad than good, what is bad, what is good, how do we know we arent dreaming when dreams seem so real, how do we know that there really are other humans around, how do we know we are just making it up, how does our mind think, how am i thinking of all these random questions, how does everyone who speaks the same language know what each other are talking about, how can we be sure that languages are translated correctly, how do we know that love doesnt really mean hate, how do we know that love is good and hate is bad, how can we ever be sure of anything? these are just some of the many many questions that run through my head when i dont want to deal with things. only problem... they drive me crazy, keep me awake for hours, and i will never find an answer that is truely proven correct i can only believe what i want to and just imagine its true. well im tired, but i cant sleep. but im going to go to bed. i will drift away to dashboard confessional trying not to think of everything, trying to clear my mind of everything and just be happy with myself and my surroundings. or maybe just leave reality and go to a peaceful place where i cant be bother, just for a second, something to keep me from going crazy. goodnight -gabby

      Well I can tell you right now, I have never had this much fun on a canoe trip. I didn't even get crabby! HALLELUJAH!!! Out group ended up consisting of... Ellen, Chadd, Kale (sp?), dad, Kevin, Jamie, Amanda, and I. We left here at about 10:00am and headed to Ding's Dock in Waupaca, Wisconsin. On the way there and the way home we played the "name that tune, artist, and album" game and it made the trip a lot shorter. The end totals were: Kevin - 32, Jamie - 24, Amanda - 14, Dad - 10, and myself - 14. It was fun. Artist and song title were worth 1 point a piece and album worth 2... This was my 7th year there. When we got there we realized how much the place had changed since last year. The big boat that used to take you out to the river was replaced with a little one and we didn't even have to jump off it!!! They put in a little pier to get off on and get into the canoes off of. That was the biggest shock. But otherwise it was all the same old stuff, just more fun. Amanda and I sunk our canoe 3 or 4 times. But I realized that it is a lot more fun if you sink it. Even if we couldnt dump it ourselves so Chadd or my dad would. Chadd was hilarious, he sunk our canoe. HAHA. I adore him, he actually wasnt scared to talk to Amanda and I. Oh crap, I forgot to tell y'all about the crazy alien bug we had in our canoe. He was huge! He look like a cross of a cockroach and a centipede and an earwig. He was horrific. And he was about 2 1/2 inches long. AHHH. Amanda and I were terrified. And we had a visit from 3 different spiders, huge spiders. Oh wait I forgot the very super canoe wash we got. Amanda and I trailed behind a bit so we got to the place that my family always stops to rest and splash random people and we got a canoe wash. Most of the time I would have been upset but it was a lot of fun and really refreshing. I dont know but this trip had a lot of memorable times on it and they seem to be forgotten as soon as I get on here, even so I had an absolute blast! Um... Well tomorrow will be my recovery day. I'm feeling really beat up. I am completely drained of all energy physically and mental. I dont know why but I'm beating myself up emotionally and its for such a stupid reason. I really just need to forget about it, but at the same time I really dont want to. I always get myself into situations where I get attached and then dump off on my ass. I dont know I just need to give it up, much easier said than done.  well nighty night -gabby

      Well here is the updated information for the canoeing trip.    Travis will not be attending. No need to worry, We are planning to do it again this summer.    We assume Mariah will not be attending. This is only an assumption. But we believe she would like to stay with her mom and she doesnt want to ruin our even number.    The weather is forecasted as: Partly Sunny with highs of 81.     The river should be a good depth. We are predicting that we wont have to worry about scraping along the bottom. YES!!! No having to get out and push the canoe!!    Amanda and I may rampage and dump the others canoes. We are being crabby girls.    Gabby will be thinking of Brittany tomorrow because Brittany really wants to be there. (I'm hoping she had a fantastic birthday. And I hope to talk to her real soon.) Well i have another NEWS FLASH but it has nothing to do with canoeing.    Gabby is miserable without you. Wishing you were talking to her. Wishing you actually meant what you said when you said that you cared and that you would never hurt me and that I mean a lot to you. Wishing that you know this in some way and that you do care. Wishing that tomorrow you will call me and leave me a message saying you miss me. Wishing that one of these wishes will come true. Wishing that you were here to give me a big toasty hug goodnight. Wishing that you werent so hurt. Wishing I could change what happened. Wishing that I had the guts to tell you the truth. Wishing that these wishes come true. goodnight y'all  -gabby

       Well it was really nice to visit my mom tonight. She always makes me feel better about things. I kind of feel like she is becoming one of my best friends. I basically tell her everything, minus boy things and illegal things. But I did tell her about driving James's car. Opps. That was a little illegal but still she thought it was funny. And I also talked to her about Kevin. I kind of feel weird about my brother, he's really started to ignore me and other things. So basically&nbsp;I talked to my mom about it and she helped me realize that I cant be mad, my brother is getting older and is about to move away he doesnt want to sit at home with me. And I dont know my mom is so good at cheering me up. She tends to always tell me what I need to hear.   I am really bummed because I wrote on my last page of my journal yesterday. I finally have to get a new one, because lately my journal is my only way out. So today I cleaned it out and got rid of the useless pages that have no importance. And now I am going to get a new one from my room before I go back to my dad's.   Well the canoeing plans are starting to go down the hole. I don't know if Mariah is coming and now Travis probably won't be. He has to work until 1:00pm and he can't get off any sooner. AHH this is going to suck. I just hope we have an even number. Not that I have to worry because I have a for sure partner but still I always feel bad for the person who has to go alone. It's a lot harder that way. So I really hope that no one has to go through that. And I really hope I&nbsp; am not too crabby. Because I really should be sleeping right now and I'm not. Well my dad is coming to get me soon. I have to say goodbye to my mom and get a notebook quick. I'll be back tomorrow night or friday depending.   -gabby

      well today is Brittany's birthday... happy birthday girl... finally 16!!! i wish i could be celebrating in London with you... tomorrow is canoeing. im both excited and not too excited. im bummed because its of course with my luck that "time of the month" and its going to suck being out on the river for 5 hours. AHHH but also its going to kick ass because its going to be, myself, my daddy, kevin, jamie, travis, amanda, chadd, his friend, ellen, and maybe mariah. (chadd and ellen are veronicas children) im excited to meet chadd and excited to get to know ellen better because when we were camping i was rather shy and didnt really talk to her much. so i really hope tomorrow is successful and if its not i'll be sure to give y'all the LD (haha) on it and dish up all the dirt.  today/tonight has.... guess.... SUCKED!!!! i have been so bored. i actually watched some old movie on the oxygen channel because im so bored. oh well i guess everyone has a day that sucks ass and today takes the cake from all the rest. but you know what i forgot to put on here... its rather exciting... i finally talked to boz!!! i havent talked to him in forever so it was nice to talk to him. and hes ungrounded!! YAY!! but im bummed because hes been for like 2 weeks now and i never even knew... WAHHH he said that he has tried to call me but we discovered that hes been calling my moms... opps... that tends to happen often. so im hoping to hear from him soon because i miss him a bunch. hes my buddy, well one of the many, but still hes fun. better than most the people i have been associating myself with lately (i.e. chris, josh, and pat) they all hate me now. oh well. im sure they will get over it. i attempted to fill out some of my applications today! but i didnt really get anywhere. as much as i really want/need a job i really dont want to have one, at least not until my birthday. so im kind of pushing it all off. and yet im like basically everyone works, why am i being so stupid? i always complain about having nothing to do so why dont i get a job and make some money and not be bored. why not kill to birds with one stone? because im freakin' LAZY!! surprise!! i bet you didnt know that. haha oh well. my mom isnt really on my case yet so once she is then i will break down and finish all these applications. but i need to go now... -gabby

      well i guess last night was alright... James and amanda and i went to horicon and got some ice cream... YUMMY!! and then we picked up mike and went to chris's where they were watching the butterfly effect, i didnt want to watch it so i was the big bitch who left and made everyone hate us!!! YAY my dream has come true!!! no then somehow we ended up back at chris's just to leave again because james didnt want to stay so we came to my house and sat around until i got tired and kicked them out... so the night wasnt a complete let down but i was pretty lazy... today is going to be interesting... my brother just left for the warped tour!! i wish i were going because i really want to meet yellowcard, well actually i really want to meet the violinist, but still so i begged my brother to get their autograph and he was like... blah blah blah, i guess i will get you something but i cant promise that exact thing... but still hes going to get me something because he loves me!!! and then my dad is basically dedicating the whatever the hell i want to do... pat a. is going to call me around 2 and we are supposed to play video games, im not sure it will happen but we'll see, and then later tonight amanda is coming over to watch nip tuck with me... and max might come after hes done working we'll see if that actually happens... i dont know but these past days have been so amazingly boring that i just want to shoot myself in the foot... nothing to do... no one to talk to... sitting alone trying to find something convenient to do well i avoid everyone and everything that will make me feel bad about myself... im sick of people in general... i have been around too many too much lately, and half of them are asses so why do i even associate with them??? they just bring down my mood and make me become bitchy (i.e. last night) i cant be myself and have fun with people that i dont feel comfortable around or who are complete assholes to me... well i feel like all i do is complain, i feel really bad, but i hate having to deal with people who i dont even care for... and i hate it when the ones i do blow me off every night and now arent even talking to me... what did i do? could someone please explain this to me? well i must go... need to shower... i stink -gabby

      well this day has sucked... all the way from the baby shower to sitting at home on my ass for another night... the baby shower wasnt that bad... actually it was fun because i got to talk to emily for awhile and i decided that i am going to call her this week and do something with her... im excited... but then my dad and brother got cell phones and i didnt... FUCK them in their ASSES... is how i feel about that... dont promise me something and then not go through with it you dumb shitface... sorry i know i sound absolutely selfish and dumb but im used to people keeping their promises to me, especially my dad and he didnt and now im outraged... so i talked to my mom and for my birthday shes going to get me a line on hers!!! yay thats not that far away... lets hope that shes not lying to me too or i will go ape... okay anyways moving on with the story... my night ended up consisting of me sitting on my ass and not doing anything... chad and i had plans but then his mom wouldnt let him so that kind of made my night shitty, but thats not his fault... i dont know but i am real ready to go back to moms and be away from my father who is driving me fucking crazy... no offense to him but you can only take so much of not having privacy i mean i am a teenage girl and i live in my room away from everyone or i am out with friends but here, no i have no privacy. i mean seriously i wake up and i have my father hovering over me and asking me questions like do you want food... FUCK no!!! i dont want food the second i wake up, no i dont want to go and spend the day at the mall with you, i want to be out with my friends or sitting in my room with my cd player and tv or sitting on my computer away from everyone... my goodness even the computer is in his room so there is no getting away... AHHH... i think that i am basically just in the mood to complain right now... sorry... um yes well here are the plans for the next few days... monday: dad's working, must find something to do... tuesday: dad's working, must find something to do until james is ready to do something wednesday: dad's working, its britts b-day, um... must find something to do thursday: canoeing!!! YAY!!! friday: um... well i dont know... maybe camping with chad?? saturday: same as friday sunday: dad's b-day, having a BBQ and the family's coming up monday: BACK AT MOMS!!! HALLELUJAH!!! tuesday: well this is where i dont even want to think about having to plan things this far in advance, we'll see what happens...  um well thats a run down of life at this moment... by tomorrow i will probably be complaining about something else or i will be so happy that its obnoxious who knows?  i kind of go through mood swings on here, not actually in life, but when i get on here i can either find the best thing ever to complain about or i can find something really lame to celebrate where as when im with someone im just weird and dance to all different songs in my mind and jump around... well i really am done babbling... im sick of writing on here... goodnight... gabby

      well if you havent notice i have been name every entry after a dashboard confessional song... thats besides the point... today is the morning of nicole's baby shower and i am so excited... but rather crabby because i didnt get enough sleep... but at least i feel absolutely adorable in my skirt and shirt... my skirt is the cutest thing i own and the cute is perfect for my body...  well i am having a good day but also kind of bummed... my dad is taking my brother for a cell phone today and i asked if i was getting one and from what he said i dont think so... WAHH i really think that my dad would adore me having one but who flippin cares i guess if he doesnt want to pay for one then i cant really do anything about it... we'll see maybe my brother will talk him into it... anyways i must be going&nbsp; because i assume i should probably start helping or i am going to get my ass chewed by my mom love gabby

      well ive been home for awhile now... and im complete stir crazy and wanting out of here... i've tried so hard to be a happy little camper... but im withering away... i know its bad to say and hard to admit but i havent been eating and its not even like i do it intentionally, its more like its been going on for a good month now where i never want to eat, i'm never feeling hungry and when i am, i eat and then feel sick and need to vomit... i think i should go see a doctor, obviously something is wrong, or something isnt right... i think that i need to go and get checked out im worried about myself... i dont want to become anorexic i cant i love food... but im feeling so crappy and food isnt something that i want to indulge in, it just makes me feel worse... i know that there isnt anything wrong with my weight and thats not even the problem its just not appealing to me... for example right now i am so hungry and i havent ate yet today and yet anything offered to me makes me feel sick so i just sit here dealing with my stomach yelling at me for food but i just ignore it and go on because when there is food in there i feel sick... i think me not eating contributes to the naps that i am forced to take... i sleep a good 10-12 hours a night and yet i take 3 hours naps during the day... im scared... im not sure this is something that i should annouce to the world but i think that something needs to be done... i dont know what the problem is or why this is happening and that is what scares me the most... i dont want to be and skinnier than i am now its not a weight problem its a lack of things to keep myself from indulging in... i feel like i let myself have whatever i want and i feel like that is wrong and i just cant bring myself to eating... AHHH im scared and im scared to tell someone this... i just dont know what to do... gabby

      yes well camping sucks... no lie i am not an outdoor type of person and im not sure i ever will be after having a tick in my hair... that was what made this trip so hard for me within the first hour i had a tick in my hair... yeah scary!!! but dont get me wrong this trip had its highlights... such as: "i might of just farted" or volleyball games and me actually being good, well good in comparison to some of my family but we are all athletically chanllenged in more than one way, for many, every way... or long night talks about random things and me being such a funny person and amanda actually appreciating my humor My god i am the funniest person... okay got sidetracked other good things: hmmm... well in general being with my family and veronica and her family and mariah max and amanda was the biggest highlight... i love my family and i love veronica and her family i absolutely adore her. i really hope that my dad and her work out because i'd love to have her in our family and her children to be around and for me to talk to them and get to know them a little better and i really seemed to get along with beth and paige really well... and so did max and amanda like max fit in with basically everyone and amanda well is adored by all because she so beautiful i think that everyone got along fairly well and aubrey fell in "love" with max... hahahah it was so cute... shes so adorable... well if anything good came out of this i think that it was the fact that we as a family have become closer and now they know the real me because i had my friends there to bring it out. i think we are all a little more bonded on different levels because this is the first big expedition for my family and it was 5 days long HOLY CRAP how did we survive... no i was a good time and i have a lot of good and bad memories and even the bad ones are funny... im such a big baby... haha well im really flipping crabby and wanting to sleep and get up and have a fun day tomorrow... lets hope... i have plans with chad in the afternoon so i have to do something before then to keep me occupied... wish me luck... goodnight oh yeah forgot the biggest highlight... amanda and i got to take kevins car!!! yeah he let us have it and we took paige and daniel to the beach and then beth came with home... it was so much fun... even the time when i lost my shoe out the window and we had to go in reverse to get it... hahahaha who does that? hahaha

AYE? im super pumped for camping!!1 i leave on sunday and i cant wait to go... i just hope that we dont have a moody max on our hands because that would suck and if he does get moody then he can just sit in the tent all day and listen to his beloved ipod because i dont want him to ruin my time there... well i must be going now... bye

      yes that is the noise of a friendly firework!! wow if im not the lamest person you have ever met i would be in shock... well the 4th of july came and went very enjoyably...sat home all day long and finally left at about 8:30pm with amanda, max, and THE CHAD to go to the fun and exciting local fireworks show... it was actually an extremely fun time other than the fact that james left us and never came back and we lost THE CHAD!!!AHHHH its a crime.. can you believe it? hahaha thats the lame thing that we came up with while sitting around the fire roasting marshmallows and drinking green river with max and josh... and then we did some running around to jon's and to josh's and then i finally came back to my dads to realize "nope i dont have a nice bed to crawl into... i have a fucking couch to sleep on" i could have taken the futon because my brother was out parting for the night but i decided not to and thats a good thing because he came home at about 3am so he would have woken me up and made me move... but im really glad he left the party because if he would have been there even 30minutes longer he would have had his tires slashed but a bunch of dumbass who were pissy because they couldnt get into the party... hahaha yes well i think that i will be going now nip tuck is on tonight and i need to find a nice place to watch it...

      well my summerfest experience was nothing short of boring, horrible, good, bad, fun, exciting, and sad.... im not going to go into the part where i cried like a little baby because no one gave a shit about me or maybe the part where we left the concert early because someone, no name, didnt want to stay... AHHH thats the bad part... the good part... i saw my babies... DASHBOARD i love them more than anything in the world and i cant wait until they come back and i can see them up close... because we were way back in the middle of nowhere... hopefully my pics will turn out... another thing that kind of bummed me out was the fact that all the shirts for sale were only in large. so me being the big lame-O i am bought a dog tag... yes that is what i said a dog tag... hahaha oh well its fucking awesome because its DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL!!! and i plan on wearing it all the time until i lose it because i always lose everything i love!!!  well i must go and im not going to be around much because i am at my dads for 3 weeks and i hate his computer...

         Good Morning... erp... I'm tired... well actually I'm not tired at all... but even so I am still feeling worn out... basically my whole family is gone except for Kevin... they went to see an apartment for Pickle... I'm okay with them not being around... its a little less crazy when they arent around... now Kevin is going in the shower which means that I have to wait a good while of time until I can shower... OoO... oh well because I dont smell that bad... haha... I cant wait to wear one of my new outfits today... but I really need to do laundry... I have to do at least all my underwear... hahaha... because I only have like 5 pairs left... and I like to be able to keep my options open so I need them all clean... I guess I'm just a little crazy when it comes to that... haha... my head is kind of hurting... oh well... I will live... I think that I might call one of my friends today... yes I do have friends... and see what they are up to because I havent done anything with friends since Wednesday when Britt and James came over so I am slacking in that department... especially with Mandy... erp... its so weird I havent seen her since tuesday and havent talked to her since thursday... thats so weird... we used to spend everyday together... OoO... whats happening??? haha... well I am going to go now because I didnt plan on this one being long... because I have nothing to say... haha... well goodbye       -gabby      "So, we're talking forever and you almost feel better but better's no excuse for tonight.

Well, it caught up and honestly the weight of my decisions were impossible to hold but they were never yours, they were never yours.    Well, I know you know everything. I know you didn't mean it.

         Well today was a fun time... got up... Tracie came and picked me up... went to Angies... went to Dennys for breakfast... went to brookfield square to shop and blow $277.42... erp... thats a lot of freaking money... I wanted to vomit when I found out how much I spent... that's too much for all that I bought... 4 pairs of jeans... 4 t-shirts... 1 shelf bra... 1 sweatshirt... and 1 pair of sandles... I love the sandles... so comfy... and adorable... YAY!!! well yeah thats it... erp... and there was so many funny funny moments... but none that I can really write on here and any of you would appreciate... my family is rather weird... and I am not sure that you would find any of it funny and plus I am not a very good writer so I am not sure that I could do it justice... oh well... I am just going to leave on the note that I have tons of fun... and thank you to all of them because I bought lots and I love it all... nighty night       -gabby

I cant wait to watch both together... it will be good... um... we went out to eat at yesterday's... it was yummy... um... britt and james stopped over to give me my card and then left again to get me a cupcake with a candle so they could sing to me... and it just so happened to be that Maxipants called!!! YAY!! so he wished me a happy birthday too... grrr... I cant wait for him to come home... like I say everyday "I miss him" haha... I do... why??? dont ask me... but I do... haha... well I racked in some good stuff for my birthday... lots of money... 100 dollars in cash and then a 50 dollar gift certificate... um... 4 gift certificates to the salon to get a manicure, pedicure, hair cut, and hair coloring... YAY... I'm going to look good for school... um and the Taking Back Sunday cd... where you want to be... good stuff... I love everything I got... thank you to everyone...

         Well today is my birthday and I actually have nothing to say... no one is even at home right now... other than my brother and he didnt even know that I was awake until my dad called... and then he didnt even come down stairs to wish me a happy day... so you know what?? he can have it in his ass... grrr... well anyways before I go talking smack about every person I know I think that I need to stop... sorry y'all... I cant pretend to be all happy and cheerful when no one could care less about me... haha... I'm a big ass baby... someone come over here and punch me in the face because I am ridiculous... grr... well       bye       -gabby

         Erp... man today has sucked... I dont know why but I have just been crabby and moody and not wanting to put up with everyone's bullshit... I feel bad though because we went out to dinner tonight with V and dad and Kevin and Mariah and I felt bad being crabby... I guess you know I just dont feel like its going to be my birthday... I'm not even excited... and dinner was great but depressing at the same time because I mean it was me and 2 couples... being with just couples sucks... I'm lonely... I miss having someone... and at the same time I dont know who I want... grr... or maybe I do... maybe I just dont want to have to deal with relationships and love... because like I said... love is like taking it in the ass... it is... painful and uncomfortable and nothing good can come out of it... I dont know... I think that I am just moody and lonely and missing having someone here... but anyways... Veronica got me a really adorable turtle from the hospital for me... turtles are my favorite... and she also got me a $50 gift certificate for either east towne or west towne mall... yay... shopping spree... haha... what a sweetie... I felt bad being so crabby though because she rushed and came up here just for me... oh well she knows that I was having a bad day... hopefully tomorrow will be better... but I dont know... I dont even have anything planned yet let alone something fun... erp... I dont know... I'm not expecting something too spectacular because it doesnt even feel like my birthday... I mean I just hope that someone calls me to wish me a happy day because right now it seems that everyone I know is busy with their own things... I think I'm just a big baby... I know that I will have a good day... even if I am alone and bored... there's never a dull moment with me... haha... thats the biggest lie I have ever told... opps... oh well... Yes I am going to say it again... I miss Maxipants... he was in a big rush today so he only emailed me to let me know he was still alive... nother spectacular... oh well... at least I am not having to flip shit thinking that he died or something... I kind of feel like I need to vomit... is that too personal to put on here??? I doubt it... but I do feel really sick... erp... gross... I feel disgusting and I am sick of everyone trying to make me feel worse... give me a break... please... you dont need to rub it in my face any longer... let it go... obviously I dont care otherwise I would be freakin out on my own... so bug off... grr... you're all driving me mad... well       nighty night       -gabby       "Defense is paper thin...

        Well today should be a good day... tomorrow is my birthday... geez... it doesnt even feel that way... I'm all bummed because by now my Aunts and grandma have called me and set up my birthday shopping and they havent!!! I mean I know that I am going on saturday but I dont know when or where... and I still have to decide where I want to eat... erp... thats the worst thing to have to decide... I think I want noodles and company... haha... joking maybe we'll do lunch there and then dinner somewhere else... we always go somewhere really nice and expensive because its to celebrate!!! haha... we'll see and tonight I am going to eat with my dad and Veronica and Kevin... I might take a friend I dont know... maybe not... we'll see... but I decided that I wanted to eat at pizza hut... haha... yeah I have a choice to go anywhere and I decided on pizza hut... I'm a big loser when it comes to food... I've been wanting pizza hut real bad so I just decided that that was where I would like to go... My hand is starting to cramp... grrr... but yes... last night we didnt watch Kill Bill we watched Lost In Translation because Britt had to be home too early to watch volume 1 and I really just want to watch volume 2 because I'm sick of number 1... yeah but it was nice to have them over... even if James fell asleep and they were only here for about 2 hours... even so... good times... and to make Mandy feel better... deep down inside I am flippin' shit over here about not having classes or lunch with anyone... but I am trying to ignore that feeling and remember that its only 1 year and senior year will rock... I am sure that we will get used to having new and different people around... erp... even though I dont want to... grrr... damn it... oh well... BOO FRICKITY WHO... maybe I should just cry about it... haha... anyways... I will probably update tomorrow because its going to blow ass... no one is even going to be around to do anything... :( ... I almost want to cry... oh well... every birthday has blown ass in one way or another... life goes on... at least I will be 16... finally... erp... well I am going to go... I need to shower... wow I stink... haha..     byes     -gabby

       well I got registered for school today... yay!!! but... I dont have lunch with Britt or Mandy... grrr... oh well... I'm not even caring anymore... I am sure that someone I talk to will be in my lunch so I dont think that I have anything to worry about... same with classes I only have 2 with Mandy and like 3 with Britt... but oh well... I am really surprised that I am not freaking out over here... I am in shock... but I'm fine with it... um... what else... My mom wont let me do Cross Country... but I'm not going to get into that because I will get angry... um... I got an athletic pass for this year... that will be nice for games and stuff... um... thats really it...   We took Sumathy to the train station today... wow... that place is really creepy... but interesting... erp... I am glad I didnt have to ride on there... but I am sure that Sumathy made it home just fine... she should be there by now... her train left at like 10 after 5... Britt and James are coming over soon... we are going to have a little kill bill fest it should be a good time... blah... other than the fact that I am feeling really sick... grr... I hate feeling like complete and total crap!!! my stomach hurts and my head aches... I just cant wait to sleep in my own bed tonight because Sumathy and I were sleeping on my mom's bed for the past 3 nights and it sucks... sucks... I hate it... and the pillows are way too fluffy for me... I like my flat and worn... haha... erp... well I feel like I am going to vomit so I should probably go... 2 days until my birthday but it doesnt feel that way... it feels like its just another friday of doing nothing... crap... I was supposed to call impressions today to see how much my hair coloring will be and see if I even want to do it anymore... I dont know... V told me that she loves the color that I just dyed it so I dont know if I should change it... we'll see how I feel about it tomorrow...   byes   -gabby   Here's my schedule... I know that I have put it on here before but here it is now   1. Publications - Steffeck   2. I. Comp - Mac      2. Modern Lit - Reak   3. Spanish - Kutz   4. Chemistry - Nied   5a. Lunch   5b.

This year is going to be so much more different than the last... I mean I wont have every class with Mandy... AHHH... But it will be nice to have to make new friends and talk to new people and not feel so dependent on someone else... I'm excited... Also sad because I wont have Mrs. McSorley or Ms. Hagemann anymore... WAHHH... and my art class isnt going to be the same anymore... everyone in my last year took drawing and painting and I went against the crowd and took Multicultural Media... I am so excited about it!!! I dont know this year will be different but change isnt always a bad thing... it can be very good...      Sumathy leaves today... her train gets in at 5:00pm so we have to leave at about 4 to get there on time... It's sad to see her go but I bet she's ready to get home... Mayville's a bore... but I actually did more with her than I expected to... It was fun!!! Now I need to go and visit her... OoO... tonight I am going to have Britt and James over to watch the Kill Bill's... neither of them have seen the first on so I have to sit through that and then watch the second... I also need to get together with Mandy and watch Y Tu Mama Tambien... what a great movie... haha... its more like a soft porn but still good... haha... no I like it because of Diego Luna... haha... well got to go we are going to registered...  then I have to get in my last few hours of hangin' with sumathy before she takes off...     adios     -gabby

       Well you have no idea how much fun sailing was but I mean its so long ago now that I am not going to write about it or Veronica's... her house was a blast but I mean I have it in my journal so I dont really have to write it on here... same with Britt's b-day party... it was a really really good time... we were just having fun and being lame... sorry josh for wanting to pinch your balls!!! opps... maybe I shouldnt put that on here... haha... oh well... and she said that she really like my gift to her... which makes me really really happy... eep... yesterday and today have been alright... having sumi here is awesome... I mean there has been some rough moments and many more to come but I will be okay and I think we all will... everyone has a point in time like we feel like there is no way out and now is one but I also feel like more than anything I should be there for everyone else and that is what I am trying to do... I am trying to be a good support for everyone else...    I miss Max so much... I really dont know what has come over me... like no offense to him but I mean we have been friends for a long time now but never really best friends... like he never considered me really a best friend... but lately I dont know I just miss him... like I never realized how much he means to me and how much of my life involves him... I dont know but its nice that he emails me everyday it really makes me feel ten times better... It makes me happier knowing that Hey maybe he does consider me one of his good friends... I consider him right up there with Mandy and Britt... like he is my best friend that is a boy... I love him to pieces and I dont know what I would do without him... I dont know... Its like I cant wait for him to email tomorrow just to know that he was thinking about me and you know caring at least enough to tell me about his day and about life conclusions!!! haha... I dont know I am sure that he knows pretty well now that I love him and care about him and miss him a ton... and he also knows it is not like I want him or anything but hes my friend... and I think he knows that... well I need to sleep I have a long day in front of me tomorrow and I didnt sleep well last night   nighty night   -gabby

       Well today wasnt too shabby... I slept late, again... like usual... and then I got up and showered and scanned some pictures and did some of that boring stuff. I got to talk to max today!!! YAY!!! That made my day!!! Not that it was the longest talk but it was still nice... its nice to be able to talk to him while hes gone... he said he misses me... and he even emailed me... I hope he will email me tomorrow while I'm gone because if he comes online I wont be around... because I'm going sailing!!! YAY!!! But anyways he told me to rent this movie called Donnie Darko... so I guess this weekend when I am bored out of my mind I will rent it and hopefully it will make me happy... Not that I really have time to be bored because tomorrow I am gone all day and saturday I am "going shopping" at like 5:30pm so I guess that morning and then Sunday I have to pack to come home and then go back home and clean my house before Sumathy gets here... It is the most I've  had  to do since summer started... I also have to call my Aunt Angie and plan a day to go birthday shopping and I have to call the salon and find out how much it will cost to get my hair 'did' and then get an appointment... AHHH so much to do... but it will all be fun...   Veronica's is going to be a blast!!! I cant wait... Mandy is going to come with me and I did invite Chad and Britt but according to Max, Chad is going out of town and Britt cant because she has to work early saturday morning and its her first day back... But I am sure it will still be fun and Chadd will be happy that Amanda is coming!! haha... we have proof, sucker!!!    Anyways the rest of today was good... I went to dad's and then we went shopping for Brittany's present and then I called Mandy and she came over and she came back to mom's with me for awhile... It was fun even if we didnt really do anything other than talk smack and read magazines....   Well I have to go now... I have to get up really early tomorrow morning, like 9:00am because I have to shower and pack and then go shopping for snacks and then we have to meet in Fond du Lac at 11:00am... It will be so much fun... even if I get sick... haha... well I am still excited I will try to update soon...   nighty night   -gabby

       Well today was fun!!! I got up really late because I couldn't sleep last night. I just couldnt get comfortable. Anyways I got up and showered and all and then I went to Britts and I just got home. It was a good time... We basically just sat around her house and talked for awhile. A long long while. And then Mandy and James came over too. We all just hung out for a few hours. It was fun though.     Epp ... we went by Boz's today!!! But he wasnt home... I just wanted to cry... I miss that kid!!! He's my buddy and he never seems to be around when I want him to. Oh well... So I sent him an email telling him that we missed him again!!!   I talked to Veronica tonight... She told me that I really need to get Amanda to be able to go to the bonfire on friday... and guess who else... dun dun dun... Kait and Ellen want me to invite Chad... So I need to get ahold of him and see if he wants to come... He probably wont but I still think that I should ask... I mean it would be fun if he came... I havent seen him in an ubber long time... ubber, what a funny funny word. haha... So I need to either talk to him tomorrow online or call him... and I need to find out asap about what time we are done sailing...  eep ... I dont want to make anyone feel pressured but I really want to make it out to Veronica's at an okay time... Chadd really wants Amanda there... haha... cute!!! I dont know if she wants to come... We'll see...   I dont think that my braces are going to come off for school!!! :( I am so bummed... I've had them way too long... and I want them off now!!!!  NOW !!!  GRRR ... It makes me so angry, its not like there is anything else wrong and if there is then my dentist sucks ass because he hasn't told me...  AHHH  I just want to scream!!!   I got Britt a blog today!!! visit it... It's  urlLink http://bombshellbrittany.blogspot.com  It should be awesome... We'll see if she keeps it updated!!!    Oh I cant believe I didnt tell y'all my new obsession... Diego Luna...  AHHH  Hes so frickin' sexy!!! I am in love with him... he's my new desktop on my computer... haha...  LAME-O !!! Damn proud of it too!!! hehe... Well the reason behind this new obsession is I saw  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights  I know it looked horrible but I loved it... mainly for the sexy lead character: Javier... Played by Diego... So inturn I am now in love with him and he is another one of the many random people that I want to marry... And it also gave me new ambition to watch  Y Tu Mama Tambien...  One of Diego's earlier movies that my brother has that I really want to see... It's supposed to be sooper dooper good... Oh yeah by the way did I meantion my new love that I have for Jones Soda... my sister fiance, Travis, had one and they are ubber good... ubber, what a funny funny word...    Well anyways I am going to go to bed... eep I am sooper dooper tired and I need some beauty sleep...   nighty night   -gabby

       Epp!!! Well I just got back from Brittany's where we watched Nip/Tuck... I love Nip/Tuck... it is an amazing show... Wahh!!! it was the last time that I got to see Max before he leaves us!!! AHHH I just want to cry... I know that he's only gone for like 3 weeks and that I probably wouldnt see much of him if he was here. but I consider him one of my closest friends... And now he is leaving... It's like a little swap, get Britt back just in time for Max to leave... its not fair!!! haha... Oh well I am sure he will have fun!!!    well I just thought I'd reinforce the fact that I'm going to miss him...    nighty night   -gabby

       Well Max leaves at 2am... ahhh I'm going to miss him a load, even though hes never around anymore. I'm bummed. I miss all our lame times that we've had this summer like harry potter, halo, joeys, all trying to fit in the bed at once, and camping. even just sitting and watching nip/tuck. I dont want him to leave. but I am sure he will have fun and its not like he isnt coming back. He better email me lots though!!! haha...   Britt's back!!! YAY!!! she called me today and we talked each other's ears off for like an hour and then we all got together and hung out at mandys for a little while. It is nice to have her back. So she will get her work schedule and then we will plan our days of fun. including six flags and canoeing.   My dad called last night and we decided that we would tell Veronica we are coming but we just dont know when. So I mean we are sailing until like 8 or 9 but we will drive down there and be with them late... it will be fun!! I am excited... and Chadd will probably be bummed because amanda wont be coming and he's got a thing for her. haha we even have a pic where he is checking her out. haha...    Um... well I am going over to Britt's house to watch Nip/Tuck tonight; amanda, maybe max, britt, james, and myself; it should be a good time. I just hope they all realize that it is quiet time!! well I'm going now...   adios   -gabby

       This is my favorite color to write in!! anyways this morning has been interesting... Actually it has sucked. James came online and he's made at me because I sent a text to Max last night. And so he thought that I didnt want to be there last night and that I wanted Max there. That was not the case at all... Amanda and I were just bored at that moment and we decided that we would send Max a message... We were just being stupid and having fun. But I guess it was a bad move on our part because we hurt his feelings. Now I feel really bad about it. I didnt mean to. If I would have known that it was going to make him mad I wouldnt have done it. Oh well, I told him that I am sorry, because I am. But still his day should be good. He gets to go and pick Britt up from the airport tonight. She gets in at 6:30pm and he is super pumped. I am too but I'm not sure that I will even see her until wednesday so... well whatever that means.    I might have to watch my little sister tonight because she is sick and my mom doesnt want to take her to karate if she isnt feeling well... but I think that she might go. I dont know for sure until 4:30 but if Dannylin goes then I will call Mandy and maybe she and I will call Max??? I dont know... Maybe we wont... My older sister Nicole is all bummed because she has to go back to work tonight but you know she only has this week and next week and then shes on leave!! But the doctor says he doesnt expect her anytime soon... Poor pickle... shes got to be wishing she would just have the kid now... (by the way... Nicole's nickname is Pickle, just so you know who I'm talking about when I say Pickle)    Is it weird that I miss Veronica so much?? I mean I dont really know her and at the same time I love her to pieces. I think she is such a sweet sweet lady and I really do adore her. I cant wait to see her this weekend. And now I kind of think that saturday the 14th I am going to do something with my daddy because I cant really on my birthday. Even if I am just another thing to get scheduled into my mother's life I have to spend the day with her. But I think that I might also go out with friends. Probably Brittany. And maybe Josh or someone like that. We'll see what kind of mood I am in when that roles around... These next few days starting friday are going to be busy... actually thursday will too because I am going shopping for Britt's present. Well they should be fun even if all of it is a little overwhelming. Once my birthday is over everything will settle down and I will try to enjoy my last 2 weeks of no school. AHHH... school starts in a month... thats so freakin' soon... I just wont think about it. There we go thats a plan... I'm not going to even remember that school is going to start. Although I do have to go to registration. But even so... I'm not going to think about it.   Well I have to go and shower still because I have been super lazy so I still smell... Hopefully tonight will be worthwhile. We'll see, maybe I'll just sit home and read and clean my room. Or maybe I'll go out. I dont know. I dont even know what I want to do let alone what I am going to do...   Adios   -gabby

It was mainly a lazy lazy day that I spent with my sick little sister... :( The poor girl is miserable and has a really high temp. it doesnt help that our house is a toaster over. ICKY!!    Tonight was fun though. It was another night at jonny's and it was fun!!! We played some more nutball (its nutball not what I called it last time) We lost!!! BOO FRICKITY WHO!!! It was fun and James bought us some candy and we saw sexy Will at kwik trip... Mandy take him up on that "long conversation"!!!! do it!!! haha... And amanda and i took jim's car out... opps thats not quite legal but a lot of fun... we took it through main street!!! oh man!!! good times...   Um... I have a perdicament... Friday is sailing and i cant wait but... now i just got an email from my dad saying that if we dont go all day Veronica wants to get all of us together... including: ellen, tim, chadd, michael, nelly, amanda, and our family... i really want to do that!!! AHHH I dont know what to do because i really want to spend time with them but i cant just bail on sailing and i cant make everyone else cut the time short... i guess i should just stick with sailing and see if we get back in time to do it... AHHHHHHH!!!! And then sumathy gets here on the 8th which is sunday and shes staying until the 11th or 12th... epp... what am i going to do with her... i guess i will just drag her out with us... i mean dont get me wrong i am super pumped but i just dont know if she will have any fun because she has so much to do in lacrosse and here we just sit and play nutball... haha... we'll see... well im tired and i need to go discuss sailing with kev...    nighty night   -gabby
