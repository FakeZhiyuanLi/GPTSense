      I think I'll stick with these colours then.  They go with my site anyway :)  Hmmm Commenting or not... Nah sod it.  I don't think this will be read much  anyway.

      I'm still arsing about with the colours of this thing.  I actually don't know why i created a private blog.  I think maybe the opportunity to  create more than one blog was too great :D   I'm not worried about updating this one so much but will try to use it now and again.  Dunno who might stumble on it as it's hidden and all, but anyone who views the source on my homepage will see it if they look close enough.  Anyway, Just emailed a cute pic of the kid to Kelly.  Might print it out aswell and hang in in my office.  I caught her in mid jump in a bouncey castle at our healthfest this year.  I like it :)

      Fuck sake I hate blogger sometimes.  This is being a real pain in the ass.  I can't tell you how many times I've typed out a fucking load of stuff only to have blogger lose it on the upload *grrrrr*!!!!.  I hate the colours of this template but I like the layout.  Will have to fiddle some more if I can deal with blogger's slowness. Hmmm..

      Ok I think I got it right.  Of course Blogger's being a pain in the ass though.  Slooooooow and loads of 'page not found' errors when i try to update my settings and template.  I hate the colours of this template but I like the layout.  Ah well, will just have to deal with it.  Rah.  I tried deadjournal but it's too limiting.  I can't work out how to edit old posts so fuck that. I'd end up getting sussed out by the bitch brigade anyway.

      Rah.  A private journal.  Wonder if any will be clever enough to cop on to this.  Oh well, I didn't exactly hide it did I? :) Now I have to fiddle with ftp settings.

      Mmmm Spinach Alfredo pizza.  Not bad!  So I got the ww portal working and it's looking quite pretty if I do say so myself.  I really just need to move the content over and play with it some more before I spring it on everyone.  Oh and KDSI needs to sort out the reason why it won't email new signups.  Hope they do that quickly.  I think I'm going to ask my boss if we could send them a candy bouquet or something.  They've been sooo helpful getting me going and very patient with me as well, especially when I broke it the day they got it up and running :)  *yawn* I'm tired.  I think I need to get up and move around because I've been fiddling with the site for a couple hours now.  Took the kid and visited Judy this morning.  Grandparents showed up aswell. Then we went and did some grocery shopping for her.  It is fecking hot out and I have no good summer clothes.  So here I am in my hoodie and thick track pants. All black of course so I'm absolutely baking. And my calf is killing me.  Went swimming last night and got a horrific leg cramp just as I was diving under water.  And just at that moment the poor kidlet got hit in the head with a volleyball. Poor thing.  But I'm so proud of her.  She went down the speed slide for the first time all by herself.  Other than the atomic wedgie it gave her I think she liked it!  She's so brave :)  Anyway I'm off to do... something.  Dunno what but need a break from the comp. Ta ra.

      Man I've got a headache.  Argh.  And I get to spend the next 7 hours looking at the computer.  Yeah, that should help.  Lately I've gotten a  little tired of being online all the time.  I think I'm going to take a break from it in the evenings.  I was mainly on to talk to Leigh and Dee but they're caught up in football fever (well, Leigh is anyway) and Big Brother UK. So, while I adore talking to them, I need to get away from the comp and get things done around the house etc.  Maybe I'll take the kidlet swimming tonight.    Ooo Payday tomorrow.  The raise should have kicked in.  Still have to wait a month before I get my first check with my fulltime webmaster status on it, but tomorrow's check should still be nice.  Thank goodness because if I don't start making more money soon, I'm really going to be in the shit.  I dunno where it all goes, it's not like I buy extravagant things.  Hell I haven't bought new clothes for myself in ages even.  And the poor kidlet is wearing clothes from last summer.  Plus her bday is coming up and I don't know what to get her....  Maybe I'll get her one of the HP books on CD.  She's dying for all of them.  She likes to listen to them in her room - what a cutie.    Anyway I'm off to see if the damn ISP has finished installing PHP yet because I need to get going on the WW site.  I've been stagnant for 3 weeks now because of them *grr*.  Will write later.

      Ooo ahh I wonder if this one still works...  I have so many blogs to write in any more... I dunno what I've gotten myself into and I dunno if I have it in me to blog in 4 different places.  Ohh I know some people have a million places they blog in, but I't s hard enough to babble on about the weather and other mundane shit in one, let alone other ones.   Oh well.  The TCZ blog is kind of fun because it's a groupl blog and I find it actually motivates me to update it more frequently than I do my private blogs.  I liked it so much I started one for SR members.  I might even start one for the public forum.. will have to see if there's any interest.  Anyway. off I go.

      Well I'm glad I came to my senses. I wrote a longish blog about something personal and decided I'd better not publish it.  Never know who's looking. Bah.  Annoying that is.  What is the point of this blog if I can't say what I want.  What is the point of any blog really.  Maybe Perdue was right in that these things are pointless.  I have to censor myself in case of prying eyes. Oh well. I'll just continue to rant about mundane things because oddly enough, I enjoy it.  On the other hand, Some public blogs are great reads. I love going to blogger.com 'blogs of note' section and checking those out.  And I'd love for my other one to get a nice readership.  I'm a feedback whore, what can I say? :)  Man the day's nearly half over.  Love when Fridays fly by.  I am the alt-tab queen though.  Whenever I'm stuck on work or waiting for things to load I flip over and blog for a bit.  Which will explain why my thoughts seem a bit random.  I started writing this one at 10am and it's now 11.  I've made progress on my php stuff (slow-going as it is) and written and deleted about 2 and a half entries in here.  As well as checked email, Meditech and surfed for website tracking software. Damn I'm good. Makes time go faster.  Anyway enough nonsense.  Back to work.

      There, finally got this journal looking the way I want it.  Fixed it so my name doesn't show up, so hopefully this journal will stop showing up in search engines.  I hate that.  I did an innocent search on my name and this fecking thing popped up. I know this isn't exactly top-secret, but I would like some place away from prying eyes - they know who they are.  I'm making myself sound like some government spy, hehe :)  Nope, sorry to disappoint, just your average everyday person on the internet doing nothing that amounts to much. move along, nothing to see here.  I think I've got my website looking pretty good.  It resizes for different resolutions so people won't have to deal with funky scrollybars all over the place.  I don't know how it looks in Netscape though.  I'll have to test that out.  What a pain in the ass, making a site compatible in different browsers.  Why can't they be standard.  Damn you Bill Gates! Anyway fixed all the broken links (Thanks Rick!), including about 10 of them on my british telly map.  I hadn't thought of checking that one for a while and there were so many dead links on it!  So I combed through the net looking for new ones and I think I got them all.  I'd love to add some shows to the map but it's far too much hassle for now.  Maybe some other time. I nicked the look of my site from someone's Blogger template because I loved it so much.  It's unusual.  I hope they don't mind.  I left their name in the meta tag as credit. At least I think I did.  Better check that.  Anyway back to typing. Bleh.

      Payday tomorrow. Woohoo! Going to take 100 out of it and put it aside for the trip. Same in two weeks, then again on the third one before we go.  If I end up getting the child support checks aswell, then Jason the eejit can help fund his daughter's first big roadtrip. I'm sooo looking forward to this now that it's getting closer to the time to go. I wasn't sure I'd be able to go what with Thanksgiving usually being a time when the family gets together and all.  But well, Now that Judy's not here, my grandparents don't feel up to having company for it and I think they're just going to go out. I've never been away from family for it so I have mixed emotions - excitement at seeing my friends, and a bit of sadness that i won't be seeing mom, or Judy, or my sister for grandparents for it. I really am too sentimental I think.  And I think too much about stuff. Might be a family trait because kelly does it too.  We end up overanalysing every bloody thing until we eventually drive ourselves mad.  And it never turns out how we expected.  Ah well, I'm not going to dwell on it. Time for snuggling up in bed with my book. Gnighty!

      It's fecking snowing outside. Grrrr.  And underneath it is a thickass layer of ice. My car doors were frozen shut this morning - I love when that happens.  Need to buy de-icer.  Anyway, luckily yesterday I got it in my head to go get my new tires on the car.  I'm not a very good planner, hehe. I meant to get one tire this check and another tire next check, but Goodyear had a deal on some used ones.  Hope my paycheck is big.  They said I need new brakes aswell (rotors and pads whatever that means) *sigh* At this rate I'm never going to get to go to Chicago.  Well I am going, but still, I'm not going to have much money. Luckily I've only got to cover gas and food and *maybe* a bit of shopping in Chicago. Then it's up to Rick's to see the big Pink House, hehehe.. That makes me giggle.. My big tough cousin living in a pink house :)   Saw Red Dragon the other night.  Very very good and creepy.  Much better than Hannibal (though, frankly I liked Hannibal but lecter enthusiasts always seem negative about it.  Of course it wasn't as good as Silence.  Even Red Dragon wasn't as good as that, but it was still scary and creepy and made me look away a few times.   What have I been doing.. Let's see. Got AAA to make a trip tick thingie for me, free for AAA members so woohoo to that.  I remember my aunt using one for our roadtrip to the east coast and it was dead handy.  I'm about to begin typing up three brochures on how to quit smoking for the website. wheeeee fun.  I lead an exciting life.  Don't have much else to add.  Waiting still to hear from Kelly in Scotland.  She better email today.

      I was just re-reading what I wrote yesterday and I realised it sounds kind of bad, especially where I said 'I don't care that much' right after saying everythings gone to hell.  I didn't mean that. Of course I care about my aunt, and I'm having a difficult time adjusting to her being gone. I guess I meant that because of that, I'm not bothered too much about losing some other things that used to be important to me, ie. the forum, the group blog etc.  They just don't seem that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.  I got a dose of perspective on it all and found I don't miss them as much as I thought I would.  Anyway, cheers to Rick for pointing out every link error I had on my site and making me actually work when I was at home :D  The other day I decided I'd better tidy up my site and add some more content so I went through and changed my little flash menu on every page, added some pics and new links, fixed the tables that didn't stretch for every screen resolution and all that stuff.  I didn't do too badly but by the time I'd changed everything I was too tired to check links. So a couple of them were buggered.  All sorted now tho. THEN he tells me his emails to me keep bouncing, yet I'm getting the message, so something with my ukmelia.com domain email is fucking up along the line and I can't figure it out.  I tell you, I need to marry a computer techie/auto mechanic and I would be set for life.  All the good ones are taken though :(  Anyway, I'd better get to work, lots to do today.

      Eesh everything's just gone all to hell.  Funnily enough, I don't care all that much. Judy is gone.  I know I should be glad she's at peace (this is what everyone says.  If it comforts them, that's all right), but damnit I miss her. I miss being able to go to her with my woes.  You know how, with your mother, you can be very close, but there are just things you don't tell your mom?  I could say them to Judy.  Of course she would often pass them along to Mom but that's ok.  Sisters do that.  I don't like the memories of the past week - well most of them.  Last week was very nice for other reasons I won't go into because they're irrelevant to this train of thought. But Judy's funeral was at the same funeral home as my mother's.  The same person officiated. It was surreal. I'm not sure who I was crying for more, mom or Judy.    It was weird being on the peripheral edge of it all aswell. My sister and I weren't 'immediate family' and so we felt a little left out. My uncle's relative sort of came and took over everything, from food to sorting through Judy's things. There wasn't anything left for us to do. In a way it was a relief.  There was so much to do after mom's funeral, so many things to organise, plus I had to pack up her whole house in less than a week or her psycho landlady would have expected more rent. I suppose it's because of all of that that I felt like there would have been more for me to do.  I don't know, I'm new to the funeral thing, but I don't like it.  What else have I lost... Oh my Placebo forum. Ka-rash and burn.  Leigh shut them down for personal reasons and quit working for the band. So I think Dee has taken over the site and the Silver Rocket forum so that's still there at least.  But oddly enough I'm not fussed. I can still talk to Leigh and Dee so I'm happy with that.  Still have TCZ aswell so all is not hopeless.    So some nice things about this last week. I've learned beer is not that bad.  Not sure I could ever fully enjoy it the way Rick does, and I deffo dislike the bitter beers he's so fond of, but it's not all bad.  I never knew there could be so many subtle flavours and aromas in a pint. What else... Oh watched my first full hockey game and I now know what a power play is.  I must sound desperately silly to a sports fan but I don't care.  I never got into them.  Always preferred playing to watching, not that I get much of a chance to do that these days, but hockey's definitely something I can watch with interest.  I used to love ice-skating.  I might have to take the kid sometime to kearney and skate the rink there.  Must also look into renting Slapshot if I can find it. Rick said it's a classic.  Anyway, have to get back into the mode of going to work. Which means I'd better get to bed.

      Fucking hell it's freeeeezing in my office.  Maybe they do that to us on purpose so that we can't doze off or something.  But my ability to type and work is hindered by the fact that my fingers are blue and I can see my breath in here. Anyway I can't seem to get my head into work atm.  I've sorted all the major issues I've had as far as work requests go.  I've got loads to do for my freelance stuff but I can't work on that here.  Maybe I'll run over to G&G's and pick up that ficus bush they said I could have.  But it's cold outside too.  Maybe I'll just sit and think about the wicked things I'd like to do to a certain someone.  No, no it wouldn't do to get all turned on while at work.   Hmmm... baseball... ummmm, PHP code... UNIX - eewww that did it.  Better than a cold shower that is.  Chicago's looking really good now that it's less than a month off.  Especially after my big money scare this week - one that really turned into a blessing in disguise as now I have enough to get my brakes fixed and bills caught up and *still* have some left for the trip. I need to think up a good gift for chickie for inviting us over there.. Hmmmm... Will have to browse online for something I think.  Or I could take her kidlets some husker gear - hehehehe.  I am evil.  26 days to go.

      Ohhhhhhh bleh.  Woke up, nauseated and just thoroughly nasty. Not it's not that, yeesh ;) Impossible.  I think I ate something off.  Might have been my hamburger in the sloppy joes last night.  I was dumb and let it thaw on the counter because I hate doing it in the microwave.  Well Not going to do that again.  Been in the fecking bathroom all day.  Lovely eh? It's after 5 now though and I'm feeling a touch better.  Should be right as rain tomorrow.  I am so glad I'm allowed to work from home if necessary.   Speaking of that, I typed up probably the most mind-numbingly boring rubbish for a newsletter I'm working on.  I think the newsletter is for Hospice patients, family and staff etc and it's written by some staff member. I think, I didn't get a lot of background on it.  Anyway the copy was given to me on paper which means instead of a quick cut and paste, I have to type the fecking thing out. And oh. My. Gawd.   The woman goes on for two pages and 800 words about candle flames. I think she was going for metaphor comparing candle flames to grief but she went way to far with it.  Or maybe it was just because I had to type it out.  I don't know.  Then someone else wrote what started to be a nice piece about Autumn, which soon turned into patriotic drivel complete with a quote from William Bradford thanking God for protection from 'savages'.  Yick. I'm glad I'm going away for turkey day.  I think.  Thanksgiving's always been a family holiday (of course), but as my family is either dead or not bothering with it, I'm going to my good friend Kat's house in Indiana (just outside Chicago.) It's going to be weird though, not having mom's sweet potatoes or green bean casserole.  I'm not in charge of sweet pickles this year :( But, I'm looking forward to going.  Maybe doing something so different for the holiday will take the edge off of missing mom, dad and Judy.  Kelly too of course, but at least I can call her.  Yeah, I think a roadtrip is just what the doctor ordered.    So the plan is, 10-11 hours to Kat's house, Thanksgiving and a movie with her and her family, The day after spent in Chicago seeing the sites and shopping with very little money, then Saturday morning drive up to Rick's and see the Big Pink House and get some more beer lessons.  The kid can't wait to see his kitties.  I need to tell him that I changed my mind again and we would like to stay over and just drive back Sunday rather than driving thorugh the night on very little sleep.  Might have to PTO Monday aswell to recuperate.  I'm getting to old for all of this :D  Anyway off to see if I can handle some food.  Ta ra.

      I totally think it's possible women think about sex more than men do. The only difference is that women think about every detail from beginning to end, and men just wanna come. I have noticed that, with me anyway, it tends to be on a cycle. At the moment, every spare second I have turns to sex.  Either pure fantasies with guys I would never dream of going near irl or replaying recent adventures. Sex sex sex sex sex.  Geez.  It's annoying.   And now that I've typed sex a bunch of times, I bet this blog shows up in porn searches eventually.  I was actually thinking about how much I would like to have a non-relationship relationship.  It would have to be someone I'm comfortable with and who knows me and I know them.   And who will go away when I want some me time.  I don't want someone moving into my place and space and sort of invading my life.  But I really miss the sex and the cuddling and snuggling and staying up til dawn talking about stupid things.  *sigh* There is no happy medium.  Ah well, life's a bitch and then you get some :)

      Wow haven't written here in a while.  Just reading my last entry and man, I must have been in a mood.  It's passed by now :)  My latest 'obsession', if you can call it that, is a slightly immoral lust for Elijah Wood. I dunno why.  I think it's tied with my huge passion for Lord of the Rings and the fact that Elijah is playing Frodo to perfection.  I've been a fan of his for years though - such talent from such a young age.  He was the quintessential Huck Finn I think.  I've read and seen a few interviews with him and he just seems like a genuinely decent person and hasn't got the 'moviestar' complex.    I've noticed that a lot of my phases revolve around actors who are semi-obscure until they get a breakthrough role and they're just 'out there' more and with the Internet you get loads more access to clips, interviews, pics etc.  Just feeds the obsession :)  It will pass though.  Anyway, I'm watching VH1's 'I Love the 80s' and I feel like I've gone back in time.  Toni Basil, the original MTV veejays, J. Geils Band, mullets, o-ring bracelets, rubik's cubes,Square Pegs, Pac-Man... Ahhhh... Bless VH1.  Would write more, but I think now I'm going to go get rid of my Placebo website.  That spark has fizzled.  Still like the music, will buy the album, but with all the shite that happened, and with other things going on, and nothing new out of them for over a year, I've moved on.  So my Placebo site is going to become my spot for reviewing movies :) tara.

      Man.  I don't know what kind of mood I'm in right now but it's annoying.  Everything irritates me, I'm sad, I'm broke, it's cold out side, the roads are a bitch to drive on because of snow-packed ice, everyone I know is just as bitchy and irritable as me... I would love to chalk it up to winter blahs.  Maybe I will.  That seems to be the predominant theme in my head.  It's cold outside, it's cold in the house, there's frost on the inside of my windows, none of my shoes have a decent grip on icy sidewalks so I have to walk like an old lady if I don't want to fall... my forums are dead.  I can't figure out how to drive traffic to my movie site without paying through the nose for it. I just have no patience really. It's only been up a couple of weeks and is just beginning to trickle into the search engines. I should quit bitching and be patient, but I'm a taurus damnit.  We aren't known for patience.  Anyway just needed to vent. I'm done now.

      Oh my fecking head is killing me.  Is it stress? Is it lack of caffeine? Am I about to have an aneurysm?  I don't know.  It just hurts like a mofo. Luckily, I get to leave work a bit early to pick the kid up.  And I have money again after sorting out the finances.  Damn tax refund was direct deposited at a bad time. Oh well.  I wonder if I'll be getting my federal refund.  From what I could gather, the student loan eejits hadn't put a hold on it yet but were about to if I didn't apply for forbearance. So I did and we'll see if I get the refund.  I'm going on the assumption I won't see it this year.  That way I won't be disappointed when I get a letter saying 'Ha ha, we took your money. and after 6 years out of college you still owe us the same freaking amount you started with because out interest rates are outrageous.' Bastards.  Still doing pretty well with the film site.  Traffic's picking up slowly but surely. I just wish I could get more people to join and use the forum.  Now that I don't go to the placebo boards anymore, I have less to read online.  I've never been a surfer per se.  I like to have my specific sites I check and interact on and that's it.  And they're dwindling now. I've no desire to go to any of the old haunts so I'm looking for new ones :) I found a Lord of the Rings board I like - well, I like the info I find there, I'm not wild about the forum software they use.  I swear I've been spoiled by Phpbb and Vbulletin. They're like the luxury editions of forum software :)  Anyway signing off.  Need to get Foundation sorted out.

      I'm going mad.  I really think I am on a slow dive descent into insanity.  Or maybe it's just cabin fever.  I can't tell.  The kidlet's been sick for the last 5 days so we've been stuck inside apart from brief forays to the store and the doc and I'm sick of the sight of my place. Ugh. I'm even looking forward to going to my office tomorrow.  Anyway, that's my life lately. Sick child, endless teaspoons of cough syrup, enough kleenex to choke a horse, worrying, feeling her pain with every racking cough in the middle of the night.  I hate it when she's sick.  We had such lovely weather this weekend. She should have been out playing in it, not laid up in bed.  *sigh* Poor thing.  She's on the mend now though.  Turns out it was a flu turned bacterial infection so we have some lovely antibiotics and she should be good as new very soon.  Anyway, it's taking me forever to write in this so I must not have anything interesting to say.  Offski.

      Cold in the office again.  If I crank the heat though I'll bake so I'll just type with blue fingers. Wish I had something interesting to talk about.  I feel like all I do is blog about how dull my life is, when it really isn't.  I figured that it may seem dull by other people's standards, but if you're happy with what you do, then what's boring about that?  I actually enjoy working on websites and chatting with friends surfing in general.  I enjoy going to the movies or renting them.  Nothing, in my opinion, is finer than curling up with that certain someone, munching on red licorice and watching videos in the dark.  Especially if that someone and you end up getting some during the movie and neither of you can talk about the film the next day because you have no clue how it ended :)  Oh there's that subject of sex again... It keeps popping up, forgive me. I only mention it because there was a movie once that I've never seen the end of because my significant other and myself apparently couldn't not have sex during it.  I don't know what it was (and no, it wasn't a porn) but we'd settle down to watch it and pretty soon we would be under the blanket paying no attention to the screen whatsoever.  I'm not complaning though, I'd much rather have sex than watch a movie (*gasp!* Did I just say that??) - well really, who in their right mind wouldn't?  Anyway, enough sex talk.  As I said, I'm happy.  I might be happier if I were to move out of this stupid city, but I've come to accept the fact that I just can't right now. I'll look forward instead to the day when I can get out of Nebraska, and the cool thing about that is I can literally go anywhere I want. I think I'd like to try the east coast for a change.  California's cool and all but I don't want to live there again.  I'm thinking New England :)  But i also liked Chicago when I was there, and I'd be closer to my friend Kat... I dunno, we'll see :)  Better sign off the blog now and get some work done.  Cheerio :)

      So I made this journal a bit more public.  Not sure why, but maybe I have some sort of perverse desire to have total strangers peek into my life.  This is still a hidden link on the main site but anyone who knows how to view the source can find it easily enough.  And I'm showing up in search engines, confound it all.  Oh well :)    Went a little bit mad with the tax refund money (after the bills were paid of course) and bought a few nice things.  Felt really good to do that.  I still have a nice chunk left that I'm going to hang on to for a while in case I have an emergency - and I've been emergency-free for a while now so I'm sure something bad will happen fairly soon.  Went ice skating the other day and had a lovely time doing that.  Bit scary though as I hadn't been since I was around my daughter's age and my sense of balance has evidently gotten worse :)  There's just not a whole lot going on in my life right now. Kelly's moving to London next month and while I support her in doing so, I can't help but think she's not being very clever about it. And I speak as someone who wasn't very clever about it herself when she went.  I didn't have a job lined up before I went, neither does she.  I didn't have a friend to stay with - she does, but London is damn expensive.  I DID have a 6 month work visa to start off with, she doesn't and any job she's likely to get will be crap pub work that pays you under the table.  So she will be working illegally.  I didn't move over there during a time of impending war and the government didn't crack down hard on illegal immigrants (well, they didn't bother me when I was illegal for 6 months).  Granted Kelly is not from any of the "axis of evil" countries, and she's a blonde white girl, but she will still be in country illegally after her tour visa expires.  I don't know...  I hope she works it all out, but a tiny part of me hopes she comes back.    Ah well.. I'm signing off before I get all sniffly.

      I decided that this just isn't a blog until I've done one of those personality-type quiz thingies.  So I did a random search, found one, and answered it below. Everyone should do these because they're fun. No really, they are.     1) What, if any, nicknames do you have?  I don't really have any. Unless you count my net name, which is really just my middle name. I used to be called 'Blueberry' though by some perverted friends of mine who thought I had a penchant for blueberry-flavoured joygel. (I don't btw so get your mind out of the gutter :D)    2) What is your nationality?  Born and raised in Yankeedom, family came over from Ireland.    3) What is your height?   I'm 5'8". No I will not convert that for you freaky metric Europeans.    4) What is your hair colour?  It's usually some shade of red.    5) What is your shoe size?  My feet are annoying in that I'm the only female in the family with big feet. I wear a size 11 in women's, size 9 in men's. Everyone else is a 7 or 8.  It sucks.    6) What is your place of birth?  I was born in Grand Island, Nebraska.    7) Where did you grow up?  I grew up, however, mainly in California. My favourite spot I lived in for about 6 years was Monterey, CA.    8) What is your current occupation?  I'm a web designer.    9) Name your favorite: band, TV show, album, flavor/taste, car, author, flower, movie, food, singer, fruit, book, color, actress, cologne, cartoon, song, magazine, drink, number, actor, perfume, animal?  Don't have a fave band right now, Survivor, Chicago Soundtrack, hot chocolate, Jaguars, Tolkien, Birds of paradise, Lord of the Rings Trilogy, homemade veggie soup, Bowie, pineapples, Lotr Trilogy again, deep green, Nicole Kidman, Canel Christale, Spongebob, Gollum's Song, Entertainment Weekly, Dasani, 42, Richard harris, Sunflowers, cats or dogs.  10) What is the one thing you would never do?  Bungee Jump  11) What is the one thing you've never done, but want to?  Surf.   12) What is the first thing you notice on a person?  Probably their eyes, unless I'm talking to someone online, then I notice spelling errors :(  13) What one word would describe you best?  Clever  14) What are your morals?   What the hell kind of question is that? Uhhhh, don't kill people? Be excellent to each other? Stupid question.  15) Name 3 things you really don't like:  1 - It's pronounced 'Noo-Klee-Er' Mr. Bush.  Not 'Noo-Cue-Ler'. Idiot. 2 - People who say 'I seen that movie the other day'.  3 - Blatant bigotry.  16) What three things would you change in the world if you could?  I'd go back and make sure Bush Jr. was never elected, for any public office whatsoever. I'd go back in time and make my father go to the doctor.  And I'd probably fire whomever thought hiring Carrottop for 1-800-call-att adverts would be a good idea.  17) If you could only take three items to a desert isle, what would they be?  A stack of my favourite books, suntan lotion, and a cell phone.  18) What are three things that turn you on?  Sexually? Or just in general... Sexually speaking, it would have to be left up to your imagination because I'm not going to answer that.  Generally speaking, I like it when a person actually listens when I speak rather than just waiting for their turn to speak.  I also like people who have interesting things to say, I like a good debate - a good-natured one mind you, not one that turns into a fight.  19) What are three things that turn you off?  Well I think I answered that one already - when talking to me, please be considerate and listen to what I'm saying.  Don't just nod your head and smile and then cut me off just to be able to hear your own voice.  20) What three places would you most like to travel to in the world?  Ohhh, pick three spots in Europe and I'd be happy.  21) What three things would you most like to change about yourself, and why?  I'd beef up my willpower, my metabolism and my ability to stand up for what I want instead of justifying my unhappiness in where I live by saying I'm staying to be close to my family.  22) Do you have any brothers and/or sisters? How many?  I have a sister, and about a year ago I found out I have another sister, but I've only met her once.  23) Do you have a best friend?  Yes. 2 of them :)   24) Do you use illicit (illegal) drugs?  Nope.  25) Do you smoke?  Not anymore.  26) Do you have any piercings? List them:   Umm, my left ear is pierced three times, my right ear once. That's it.  27) Do you have any tattoos? List them:  No tattoos.  28) What do you feel your purpose in life is?  If I knew that one, I suppose I'd be happier eh?  29) Describe the perfect man/woman:  My perfect man knows how to fix computers and cars, will kill spiders without rolling his eyes at me, is affectionate without being smothering, and willing to leave me alone now and then and let me have my own space.  30) Who do you think is the sexiest woman/man in the world?  Oh gosh, ummm, depends on my mood.  I could drool over Joaquin Phoenix/Gabirel Byrne/Elijah Wood for hours really.  31) What do you look for in a person?  Intelligence, sensitivity, sense of humour.  32) Rate yourself from 1 to 10:  I'm a 10 and don't you forget it :)  33) Are you a romantic person?  I like to think so.  34) What do you consider romantic?  Thoughtfulness is probably my number one romantic ideal.  35) Would you rather have a serious relationship, or a one-night stand?  Well, a serious one, because there's absolutely nothing satisfying in a one-night stand. Having said that, my idea of a perfect relationship is one that doesn't involve me having to give up any shred of my independence.  36) Have you ever truly fell in love with someone? If so, how did it feel?  Yes. Wonderful, heart-wrenching, painful, glorious, sexy, perfect.  37) Do you ever look in the mirror and make funny faces?  All the time :)  38) What do you like to dress in?  Comfy clothes on the outside, nice silky satin stuff underneath.  39) Say you were in a busy eatery/restaurant, what would you do if your friend/mate jumped up on the table, and began singing to you?  Laugh good-naturedly and applaud when finished   40) Would you run 4 blocks nude for $100,000?  Nope.  41) What are your hobbies?  Movies, traveling, computers.. nothing horribly exciting but it makes me happy.  42) Do you like to read?  Voraciously. If I don't have a book going I feel naked.  43) What types of books?  Depends on the mood again.  I like thrillers, courtroom stuff, a bit of Sci-fi.   44) What authors?  Tolkien, Grisham, Jean Auel, JK Rowling (she's my hero), Ann Rule, Patricia Cornwell.  45) Do you exercise?  Sporadically.  46) If you could be anyone in the world, who would you be?  Nicole Kidman  47) Do you have an idol? If so, who?  Yes, JK Rowling. Single Mom makes good :)  48) What types of music do you enjoy?  80s alternative, underground stuff. I despise Top 40.  49) What is your best memory? Your worst? Most memorable?  Best - Probably any family get-together. Worst - Death of my mother. Most memorable? My daughter's first steps.  50) What was the nicest thing ever done for you? The worst?  Nicest - Oh my daughter does them constantly. She'll draw a picture for me, write a story or make something out of clay for me while away at a sleepover. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to know she's thinking of me when she's away.  The worst - Probably the day my selfish ex-husband came home from class one day and told me he was divorcing me and taking my daughter.  51) Do you have plans to go to college?  Been there, done that.  52) Have you traveled anywhere?   Oh yes, I've traveled a lot around the US, and done quite a bit of the UK and Ireland.  53) If you could go anywhere right now, where would it be?   Back to England.  54) Have you ever been arrested?  *cough* I plead the fifth.  55) If you could be an animal, which one would you be?  A slinky little cat.  56) Do you believe in a god? If so, who? Why?  Oh man I don't want to do a deep dark god talk here. I don't believe in God. Why? I have my reasons.  57) Do you believe in the supernatural?  No not really. I like the idea of it, and it makes for great movies (usually) but I don't believe it's real.  58) What is your outlook on homosexuality/bisexuality?  I believe that if you are happy with yourself then that is all that matters.  I haven't got a single issue with anyone and their sexual orientations.  One of my best friends said it best when he said 'I'm not homosexual, I'm not heterosexual or bisexual. I'm just sexual'. Right on.  59) Have you ever been in love with someone that didn't love you? If so, how did it feel?  Ohhh back in high school I had a huge crush on a boy called Patrick Douthit. He of course, didn't know I existed I'm sure he still doesn't. But it was one of those 'worship from afar' things.  Didn't hurt too much - nothing compared to the pain of being in a serious relationship and getting dumped for stupid reasons like distance.  60) What, if any, phobias do you have?  I have a fear of drowning.  But I love to swim. Go figure.  61) What is your sexual orientation?   Well I'm just sexual too, but only with blokes :)

      Right, all sorted, I think.  Had to change fecking stat counters because Nedstat wasn't compatible with the commenting code. Bah. Annoying. Anyway, it's all good now and anyone sneaky enough to find there way here, either by googling or by the hidden link - leave me a damn comment :) Even if it's just nonsense. I like comments. If you're rude and obnoxious though I'll ban your IP and make fun of you here in the blog :D

      Spent a bunch of time moving my public blog to use gm software.  Now this one is the only one still using blogger.com.  I suppose one day I'll get that wild hair up my ass and switch this too but meh. Fuck it.  Went to see Chicago tonight at the cinema. What a fabulous movie.  If LotR has to lose to one movie this year, it should lose to Chicago :) Also bought 'Where the Day Takes You' off Ebay.  I wish I could have rented it first because I'm breaking my rule of 'no buying if I haven't seen it' but Kat put sooo much pressure on me to get it. You hear that Chickie?  You peer-pressured me into it! Twisted my arm!  Damn you!!! *cheeky grin*.  You know I love ya honey. And anyway, from the reviews I've read, and chickie's own review, it's probably one I'll like.  All in all, a lovely day today. Got some new pants and a skirt, took the kidlet out for dinner and a show and had a lovely conversation about the thrill of thunderstorms (hoping to get the first ones of the season this weekend, cross your fingers) and now I'm just chilling out, winding down, watching Seinfeld, pondering sinking into my big cozy, warm bed in a few.  Ahhh bliss.

      On the S&N forums I posted a bunch of writing exercises in the creative section and I think I'll do one here.  I've got a story floating around in my head but need more details. Maybe this will help.  Anyway, I'm going to make up a person and bring them to life. Hopefully :D ---------------------------- There was a Mary in every junior high. The girl no one remembered.  The girl who endured the jokes about her clothes from the rich kids.  The girl who could never hope to be popular because she did everything wrong. She was the one who, when asked to go up to the board and answer a math problem, had an embarrassing stain on her jeans the day she got her first period. She was the girl who threw up at her desk during biology. Teachers may have felt a little sympathy towards her, but mainly they wished she was in any other class but their own. She was a chubby girl with horribly curly brown hair.  No svelte, bouncy curls for her. Oh no, it was wiry and had a tendency to stick out in odd directions.  Her small, freckled face was dwarfed in size by her thick glasses.  Her vision was so bad, she couldn't read the big 'E' on the eye chart. Her mother said contacts were out of the question until she was older and so, she suffered behind those god-awful frames. She looked rather like a wild-eyed owl dodging students as she made her unobtrusive way to each class.   When she entered the classroom, no one noticed.  That's not exactly true... the teacher noticed and gave a little grimace. One of the popular girls snickered at Mary's hopelessly out-of-date clothes. Mary eased past the 'cool crowd' and slunk into her seat at the back of the room where she immediately piled her books as high as she could on top of her desk and hid behind them, lowering her head and staring at her desk for the duration of class. The teacher never called on her anyway, what was the point of paying attention? She would just sit here and write her little vengeance stories.  Her stories were her escape. -----------------------------  So there's Mary.  I have a vague idea of what I want to do with her but right now, it's just *too* vague.  I could add a little more depth to her as well.  I think I want her to come out of junior high so traumatised and tormented that she vows she'll get even with the nasty 'popular' kids one day.  And so she writes little stories of how she gets back at them all.  And as she continues on to high school, her stories get darker and more violent.  And I could intersperse her everyday life with her fantasy world until one day, they merge together.  I'll think on it.

      Well I gave up on using blogger for my project. Two days of 'oops, your blog isn't quite ready for publishing' is enough to drive me away. So I wandered around the greymatter site and found out I can run more than one blog at a time with it (no, I did not know that before. Shut up.) So long story short, GM is now my favourite blogging software and now my  urlLink fiction evolution  project is up and running :D  And to whomever left me the comment below about the character Mary I wrote about, I don't have anything else written about her. That was just a writing exercise. But I might develop her further on my new site linked above :)

      Chalk another fecking reason to get totally irritated with blogger. I'm trying to start a new blog (yes I know I've got too many as it is but I'm embarking on another project) and whenever I try to publish it, I get 'Opps, Your blog is not quite ready to be published. Try again.'  What the fuck is that? My settings are *identical* to my other blogger journal (apart from filenames of course).  What the hell is that error?  Grrrrrrrr.   Now this one is screwing up.  I swear this software gives me more headaches than enjoyment.

      I wonder if this thing has stopped being a pain.  Don't really have anything exciting to blog about.  I refuse to talk about the war and the only cool thing that's happened this week is that we bought the new Zelda game and have been happily addicted to it ever since. Right now is a good time to be holed up in the house. The other night apparently someone fired a gun into a house a few doors down from me.  No one was hurt, but police found six bullet holes in the wood.  So I have been afraid to let the kidlet go outside to play. This used to be a failry benign town, as much as I hate its dreariness.  But even I have to admit the violence is more frequent than ever. But I do refuse to blame it on any one ethnicity like some other residents here do.  Apparently our problems started when "those damn Mexicans" started coming here and taking our jobs. (If you could see me right now, watch my eyes as they roll). I hate to burst the hicks' bubbles, but quite a lot of the violence in this town is related to *gasp* drunken white people!! *SHOCK - HORROR*.   A couple years ago I worked as a waitress at a steakhouse, and I had a friend there who was, shall we say, friendly with a number of drug addicts and gang members and you know what? They were all white. One night I was parked outside her house waiting for her to get home (no way was I going inside without her as her boyfriend was home and had a slew of idiot around drinking beers). Suddenly a car comes flying around the corner, it shut its lights off and ground to a halt right behind my car.  The occupants inside, all 3 white boys jumped out and flew across the street and into neighbour's backyards, blending in with the shadows.  Seconds later a police car races by, lights flashing, looking for them I presume.  But they didn't see them and didn't notice the car they were after was parked right behind me. I don't know what they did - I didn't stick around to find out, but suffice to say I had no desire to hang around this gang of idiots anymore. I liked my friend a lot, she was a sweetheart, but I hated her boyfriend and his friends - all white, all self-professed members of some stupid 'westside' gang of privileged delinquents.  Some of their parents are prominent business people in the community.  I wish I could open up the eyes of the 'I hate Mexicans' crowd here, but it's a lost cause. It's like arguing with a wall.  Anyway, I doubt I'd find much different anywhere else in the country. I'm looking to the day when we can move away from here, but I can't think of a single place I'd want to move to in the United States. I don't know what I want. Maybe it'll come to me.  Until then, I'll toil away here.

      So I typo'd on an article on my work website. Now I feel like shite, and have done nothing but make myself look like an ass all day today. I wish I could go home, rewind and start this day over again.   First, I got a call from my boss saying that he got a nasty email from a department that *my* department is not fond of saying there were errors in their article I posted for them about a raffle. Well fuck me, I took a look and what do you know. I left a 'd', and 'c' out of a couple of words, and put an apostrophe in the wrong place (though, to be fair, it was a proper name of a place and I thought there actually was an apostrophe in the name. But I was wrong.) But before I looked I told my boss that I thought I'd cut and pasted the information from stuff they'd given me, which is what I normally do.  I shouldn't have done that. I should have looked first. Because now he's sent them a message saying that the errors must have come from them. Which of course, they denied and got huffy about. So not only did I make myself look dumb, I just made my boss look dumb in front of the one person he does not get on well with in our organization.   Then I had to do some damage control and explain that yes, the errors were my fault, I apologised and explained that I did cut and paste some of it, while some of it I had to type myself because the poster/flyer they gave me was too large to shrink and still be readable.   Oi. On top of that mess, I missed a conference call yesterday because I thought it was happening today. This was after I emailed the host of the call to say I'd be there for it today. *sigh* I want a rock to crawl under please.   I think I will lock my office door and just hole up in here for the rest of the day.

      Snow snow snow.  In April. Big, fat, wet, heavy snow too, not the nice kind you can just brush off your car, but the kind that requires an actual shovel to get it off. *sigh* Nebby is so weird for weather. What was even weirder waas that during the storm yesterday, there were several booming, rolling thunderclaps.  It was eerie and surreal.  It's not supposed to thunder during a snowstorm!  Anyway, the kidlet got her ears pierced this weekend. I used to tell her that she would have to wait until she was 13 for that because, well, because I had to wait.  Then I thought, well that's stupid, if she wants her ears pierced now, I feel she's old enough to handle it.  But as we were shopping for shorts at the mall, I decided to tell her she could do it if she wanted.  The thing is, she was scared.  I think she really wanted to do it, but was afraid it would hurt.  This from a kid who doesn't even bat an eye when she has to get a shot. So after much convincing from me and a friend of ours who works at the mall, she held her hand behind her back and made me guess whether it was '1' or '2'.  I said 2 and luckily, that was right.   So she got in the chair, tightly grasping the stuffed ladybug and making nervous jokes about ripping its head off if necessary.  They did both her ears at once and she didn't even blink.  She said "That's it?" Hehehehe.. Silly girl. The rest of the weekend was spent admiring her pretty ruby earrings and doing the 'I got my ears pierced' dance.

      At what point do I step back from certain family members and say 'Hey, I'm a grownup now, you have to stop trying to run my life.' In theory, this should stop as soon as you move out.  But I don't live in a perfect world and damnit I hate being made to feel guilty - especially when I don't even know what I did to deserve it. Grrrr. Okay, so I've spoken to my grandmother a couple of times this week, and she's been really short with me.  You know how you can just detect when someone's not happy with you? I became an expert on it with my mom, the queen of silent treatments. And she must have gotten it from my grandmother because I find she's doing the same thing now. So now I get to try and rack my brain and figure out what I could have possibly done to irritate her.   Yesterday she nearly had a fit because I offered to bring a jug of milk to the Easter brunch she's having. She was telling me what we're having, and said 'blah blah blah, and juice.'  I asked if she needed me to bring anything, or pick anything up for her. She said no.  I said, 'Well, how about if we bring some extra milk?'  And she says, 'No we are having JUICE.' and got positively petulant about it. For fuck sake it's just milk! My cousin's wife is bringing stuff, why is it okay for her to bring things and not me?   *sigh* I know it's a totally stupid thing, and I think if she hadn't been irked with me about other things (though what those other things are, I dunno) she wouldn't have had such a fit about the milk. But see how this works?  When I call, she acts as if I'm putting her out because I wanted to know if she had any ideas for where I could hide my daughter's new bike. 'Oh you'll have to ask grampa.' Well, why? Doesn't she live in the same house? It just irritates the fuck out of me when she acts like this. For fuck sake, my daughter is more mature than that.  It's an old story though.  I grew up idolising my grandparents because, well because they always brought presents and they lived far away so I didn't see them much.  Now I know why we lived far away.  I know I'm making a big deal out of nothing, and I wish I could get it in my head that I don't care if she's miffed at me.  But I do care.  I hate it when people are upset or mad at me, and I always want to fix it when I really should go about my life and be happy. I suppose it's this hangup that keeps me in Nebraska.  but that's another rant altogether.

      Still no word from the bellydancer. I'm starting to get a little mad.  This may be quite stupid of me but I'm rather new to this freelance gig, but I didn't have either of my two jobs sign a contract. If I end up with a third job, there will be a notarized, written contract so I don't have to sit and stress about the fact that I have $600 bucks owed to me and no way to prove it. I also need to work out how to pay tax on it so I don't get fucked by Uncle Sam (ooer missus!).  Saw X-Men 2 last night and it rocked quite a lot. I remember back in high school, or maybe it was a little after, I had a friend who was a huge fan and I might have had a thing for this guy, so I began reading the comics. And I remember liking Wolverine and his sexy Adamantium claws, but I thought Storm was the coolest. Sadly, that phase was short-lived and I remember very little about the storylines. So I wanted to see X2 when it came out but I figured I'd better rent the first movie beforehand.  When I did, everything came back to me. "Oh right they are *mutants*, not superheroes!" "Hey I remember Jean Grey!" and so forth. I'm glad I saw that first because I wouldn't have enjoyed part 2 nearly as much otherwise.  So needless to say I really liked X2, as did my daughter. That was probably the highlight of my week. I did go to my little cousin's 3rd bday party but you know, it's a room full of people I don't know and a little boy wired on candy. He's an absolute doll, but frankly, seeing my uncle all cosied up to his new gf still isn't sitting well with me and I couldn't wait to get out of there. Then Wednesday I had a bitch of a headache so stayed home from work, felt 100% better Thursday, and Friday I felt like I had a cold coming on (you know, skin is sore to the touch, just standing up is an effort etc.) But I guess I'm not because I feel fine now.  So it's been a bit of an odd week. So, signing off for now.

      What a weekend. What a bombshell. I don't know how I feel about it yet.   It's been a bit of a crazy week.  I went from puttering around on the TCZ site to gung ho make a lot of changes to it at once and then go live with it in just a few days. It's been a whirlwind, and it seems to be going over okay. It did turn out well if I do say so myself. Just a few minor tweaks here and there to go, and then I can start adding new features that people are coming up with.  I wish I could get my bellydancer to write me back. I finally got her site up and running, domain and all, and now it's been five days since she's written. I hope she's just away or something.  Anyway, so the family (that would be me, my cousin, his wife, and my grandparents) had a garage sale at my grandparent's house this weekend. I took Friday off to help out with it which meant getting up at 5.30am (ugh!) and it went all right. Very tiring and on top of it all I had the most horrendous cramps. Ohhhh no she's talking about periods and such - Ewww. Well deal with it - that pain was awful. And unusual for me. I never get cramps like that so I'm wondering where these came from. I couldn't even stand up straight.   Anyway, at the sale also was Ida's (my cousin's wife) sister, Sherry. My uncle stopped by as well, mainly to drop the bombshell: he is now dating Sherry. It's been a bare 6 months since his wife, my beloved aunt, died. Apparently they have been dating for about a month and a half now. She's riding around in the truck my aunt rode around in when she was well. She's probably over at my aunt's house, spending the night, invading her space.   My question is why the hell are men so quick to jump into the next relationship? If my spouse of over 20 years had just died a few months ago, I'd be gutted for a long time. My mother mourned for my dad for years - until the day she died in fact. And what makes this doubly awkward is the fact that the woman he's seeing is his wife's son's sister-in-law. In relation to me, it's my cousin's wife's sister. The one who was in prison. Not jail, but the actual state penitentiary. So fucked up.  I still can't quite get my head around this. Yesterday at the sale he came driving up with her in his truck and it stung.   I just don't think it's right. It's too soon.

      What a weird week. Meeting yesterday with advertising firm we use. Was supposed to be "fun" according to my boss, was really just okay. The food was shite (mental note: don't eatat the Garden Cafe in Hastings) and all I really did at the meeting was say "Why isn't the website on that ad?" over and over. Fuck sake, what is the point of me busting my ass to put together a decent website when they don't even bother to help me drive traffic to it? I mean, I could understand if I were doing this for, I dunno, one of my freelance jobs where they don't have the budget for advertising, but I work for a hospital that has millions of dollars in the coffers, you'd think they could spare some change to put the fucking URL on print ads. Argh. No wonder the forums I added aren't getting any use.  Right now I'm watching the 200th episode of ER. It's pretty good but I could really do without all the vomit. I don't handle vomit well. Not even my own child's. You know how they say (who THEY are, I have no idea) when you have your own child you can deal with their body functions and odors with no problems, but with me, vomit is a different story.  I don't know if it's the actual goops that hurls itself out of the body, or the involuntary wretching and *ugh* I'm making myself ill just writing about it. I think I'll move on to the next topic.  Which is ummmm... Heheh, I don't know. Oh, dinner withbiodad tomorrow night. Should be fun, I'm looking forward to it. We're going for Chinese and who knows what. Depends on the weather. It rained most of the day today and again I regretted that I had to spend the day cooped up in my windowless office. There is something about the rain that I just love. I love turbulent weather more than sunny days. I really am only happy when it rains. Such beautiful weather. I remember this one time, on a hillside... Well I'll keep that to myself.  Thunderstorms. Thunderstorms are just... ohhh.. They thrill me.  Anyway, if it's not rainy tomorrow night, we might take my daughter to the new park the city built, or just let her ride her bike around or something.  Right ER's over, I'm freezing (after being out in the rain to plant some flowers, I'm a bit nippy.) so my nice warm bed calls. night.

      Hurray I heard from the bellydancer.  Can I just say *phew*? I had all sorts of awful thoughts about that job. First I worried that I was pestering her with my emails and that she'd probably had a family emergency or something and the last thing on her mind was me, then I worried that she hated what I did and skipped out on me, then I decided not to analyse it to death and just keep sending emails periodically.  Turns out she's just taken possession of her new dance studio and has been busy getting it set up for a May 15th opening and she's only just now getting to her emails.  Which is a relief but now I've just sent the first bill and I am now stuck worrying whether she will faint at the price. I can't get used to charging the fee I came up with. I come from a long track record of working for minimum wage on up to where I am now (which is waaaaay low end of the scale compared to what I'm charging for the same services freelance). So it's a bizarre feeling charging someone $60 bucks an hour. I feel like I don't deserve to be charging that much, and I also feel like she'll see the bill and balk. But, she knew my fee going into it and even said that it was reasonable so we'll see how quickly I get a check. I stipulated that payment is due within 5 days of receipt of the bill so I'll keep my lovely reader posted :)  In other news, looks like I get to hook up with biodad on Friday which will be nice. Still don't know what we're going to do, but we'll figure something out. He mentioned something about seeing if there are any concerts going on and doing that rather than having dinner (we can eat anytime he says). I reminded him that this is not exactly a mecca of culture here and all I could find to do was see a movie or get our blood/glucose levels checked. Exciting eh? Maybe we'll just hang out at a park.  The thing is that he's very athletic and outdoorsy, and I'm just not. Ah well, we'll see how it goes.

      I had a strange dream this morning. I dreamt I had my little black car in the UK and I was going to the Bournemouth meet. So I drove around Bomo, which looked really weird and almost Roman. I found a parking spot but I didn't realise it was near a small train track. Anyway I go off to the Bomo meet and see some people I know there but I get really really bored (sorry Matt, if you read this :) ). Since I'm only in England for 3 or 4 days, I decide I'd rather drive to London to visit my sister. As I walk back to my car, There's a funky weird train car almost encasing it, so somehow I get on board and sit down. The train car is crowded with people.  I have it in my head that my car is in the front of the car that's closed off. Meanwhile the train is making a circuit of Bournemouth and along the way there are beggars hanging over into the car (we were going very slow) and being really aggressive asking for money.  Then the fecking train drops us off seemingly in the middle of a large urban jungle type area - I say urban jungle because we were obviously still in the city, but there was a sort of forest with a couple of paths you could follow where the grass was beaten down. I distinctly remember knowing that if i was on the wrong path, I'd be in trouble. I heard people talking on the other path so i delved into some trees and found myself on that other path which ended up being very near the spot where my car was still parked. But I passed a bar that had no walls or roof. It was a typical pub-type place but the bar itself was actually on the sidewalk. And I remember asking if I could use the phone to call my sister and tell her I was coming. Then I couldn't remember her number and smacking my forhead as I realised it was on my Palm Pilot which was in my desk all the way back in Nebraska. I could remember the first couple of digits, and the last 4 and Information was not very helpful as she wasn't listed yet.  And that's it. Bizarre eh? I don't quite know what to make of it.

      So, I haven't written in here for a few days.  It's hell keeping up with all of these blogs you know :) but I wouldn't have it any other way. I can't get over how much they motivate me to write stuff down. Well, apart from my story over on Evolve, but well, I'm think that story wasn't going anywhere anyway. I dunno if I can write horror.   Anyway, yes the big 3-2 today and what am I doing? I'm at work, writing a brochure, tweaking some webpages and I don't have any plans to go out this evening. It's Monday for goodness sake. Not that I'd have plans if it were Friday but well you know. There's nothing in this town I wanna do anyway. Not even anyONE I wanna do *cheeky grin*.  My cousin has said he will be bottling and shipping my 12th of Maibock beer he brewed for me. Said it was "sweet and roasty". Okiedokie. I'm getting six bottles of it and I have a feeling that there will be five and a half bottles of it still in my fridge a year from now. I'm not a beer drinker by any means. I never developed a taste for it. At parties when I was a teenie, I used to dump out my can of Bud and fill it with Coke and pretend I was getting drunk. I feel bad though because Rick went through a lot of trouble to brew this for me (and I basically whined that I wanted a beer named after me anyway) but ah well, I will definitely try to get it doon ma neck.  Had a lovely weekend that started with dinner and ice cream with Biodad that went very well. I enjoyed it a lot, as did my daughter. He's a pretty neat guy. Look forward to meeting up with him again soon. Saturday the kidlet spent the night with the grandparents so had the house to myself and I veg'd to my heart's content. Sunday we had a nice family dinner that was a combo Mum's Day and my bday. I found out that my beautiful, gorgeous, sweet and wonderful daughter spent her own money on the presents she picked for me (a gorgeous cherrywood jewelry box and a perfect rose encased in glass). She is truly a wonderful kid *sniffle*.  What else... oh chatted with Meechie a bit last night. The boy always seems to call me when he's in the loo. I don't know how to take that :) Kelly rang me at 6am this morning and it was great to talk ot her. I've caught her online once or twice but she's busy jobhunting etc and really, it's always nice to talk "live".  Today, as I said, I'm working and then tonight I think I will play Zelda :) I'm so exciting :)

      Ruben won. Feck. Bah. Eight bloody months of watching this show and rooting for Clay, and Ruben won.  I am not watching next series. It's too draining. Tuesday and Wednesdays - ugh! And the filler shows! Awful! *sigh*  But now that I have my Tuesday and Wednesday nights back, I can devote more time to blogging :D  Oh and Thursdays too. Survivor's over now as well. Those are my only indulgences into the reality genre. I dabbled briefly with Surreal Life but Corey Feldman was a letdown.  I don't really have anything profound to say this evening. I'm tired and feeling that anticlimactic feeling after the Idol finale. Think I'll go finish my book. Nighty :)

      I'm trying to decide if my thumb is green enough to handle a small trellis with some Jasmine entwined on it.  I think it would be really lovely to have some on my balcony. I was actually thinking of buying some trellis slats and fixing them to the sides of the balcony to give us a bit more privacy. Not sure if the landlord will allow that though. What I really want to do is paint. I *really* don't think the landlord would allow that though. In fact after a quick call to her I've discovered I'm not allowed to paint, put border up or put a trellis on the balcony :( I hate that. Why could I not paint at the least? Especially if I said I would paint it back to the blah white it is now when I leave. How depressing.  I hate apartment life. It's fine if you're young and footloose and fancy-free, but man, I'm sick of hearing neighbours fighting, neighbours screwing, neighbours screaming across the courtyard, neighbours smoking weed while I try to explain to my child what that funky smell is. I'm also tired of hauling groceries up three flights of stairs, and climbing four flights to do laundry. I want a garage. I never want to scrape ice off of my car again. I want a lawn that I can pay someone to mow. I want to run around the house without fear of disturbing the neighbours. I want a little garden. I want a place where I can DIY to my heart's content.  Well why don't I go find a house to live in? Hmmm.. There are two major 'pros' to where I'm living now: 1. Rent is cheap, but place is nice enough and 2. My landlord is incredibly cool about working with me when I'm struggling to get rent paid on time. Which *knock on wood* I haven't had trouble with so far this year, but then it's only May.   I need to come up with some sort of plan. I think the key to me getting away from here with little fuss from the family is if I was offered a job somewhere that paid incredibly well - well enough that I just couldn't turn it down. I often have people ask me why I stay here in Nebraska if I hate it so much and the answer is not easy to make them understand. Here's the short version: When I left my ex-husband, I had nowhere to go, no money, no clothes, nothing. I moved back in with my family in California and began a struggle to get back on my feet. Six months later they decide they can't afford California anymore and I have no choice but to come back to Nebraska with them. If they couldn't afford it, how could I, a single parent with a baby? So Nebby beckoned. My father died right after we arrived here, moved a few times and ended up where I am now, got my act together and put myself through college and still hated the lack of anything to do here so I upped sticks and moved to England for a year and loved every minute of it. Unfortunately, I had a tyrant boss, and I was working illegally. After coming back, my mother died. Followed soon after by my Aunt and aside from my grandparents, that's pretty much my entire family. My sister lived 3 hours away while she was at university, then she moved back to Cali, and now she's living in London.   Did I say short version? Hehe. You should see the long version :D  Anyway, my grandparents are wonderful people, but they are also what ties me down here and I know that's awful to say. I love them dearly. I want my daughter to be around what little family she has left as much as she can, so the sacrifice on my part is that I work in a great job for shit pay, live in an OK apartment with shitty neighbours and continue to struggle with no opportunity to improve the situation short of winning the lottery. So I need a plan of attack. And I need time to think up a good one. I need to stop waiting for opportunity to come to me and go out and make it happen. *cheesy slogan alert*  So I'll write if I come up with a good one.

      I want to do a little photography. I really like it for a little hobby.  I don't ever see it developing into anything but I do enjoy taking nice pics and having friends and relatives enjoy them. I took a couple cool shots of the kidlet that I'm rather proud of so I might do some more and make a little feature wall.  Need some frames though.  I think this blog will pretty much just be trains of thought as my mind wanders. Saw 'The Pianist' last night. My god what a disturbing movie. Good... but disturbing. I never should have watched that Hitler movie on CBS. It seems to have reignited my fascination with the Holocaust. I've never been interested much in the militaristic aspect of WWII, more the human side of it. Jewish Survivor stories fascinate and horrify me. I don't know why. My old pub boss in England thinks I'm a reincarnated survivor, but I think he's full of shite. Speaking of shite, I wonder how his pub is doing. It's been a long time since I visited the website I made for him. Last time I checked he hadn't done a damn thing to it. I remember that not long after I'd returned to the states, he actually emailed me and asked me to continue updating his site - for free. HAHAHAHAHA that made me laugh.  Anyway, I have a lot of things to do today so I'd better get to it.

      Wednesday morning and my first day of working from home one day a week. I think I'm going to like this. It was a nice feeling last night knowing I didn't have to haul my ass out of bed at ridiculous o'clock this morning and I can work in my jammies :) I've a lot to do today. I broke one of my work sites right before I left work yesterday and now I have to fix it. *sigh* Silly me. I also hope the stupid IS department doesn't choose today to give me my new computer. They've been pissing me off lately. I blame the director of that department for my depressed mood all flipping day Monday. I got in and checked email, to find one from him directing me to some shit site in Kansas because it was simple and easy to navigate. It was also clunky, ugly and outdated. Then he says he finds our website slow and confusing. Kat said I should have emailed him back saying 'Well I find YOU slow and confusing but you don't see me emailing you about it.' I thought that was quite funny and cheered me right up :) Told my boss about it and he said not to worry about it, web stuff isn't exactly the IS guy's forte, so that made me feeel better too.  I guess I don't handle criticism very well. I mean, I can take it as long as it's constructive. I can't count how many times my boss has made improvement suggestions for the sites. But he does it in such a way that my feelings aren't hurt, and in fact I get enthusiastic about making his changes.  But 'slow and confusing'. That hurt. We've only had this site up and running for over a fecking year now and not once did I ever hear that about the site. So I've come to the conclusion that he's a wank.  Grrr.

      It's 7.45am-ish on Sunday morning. Wtf am I doing up? My daughter was away for the night, I stayed up late watching Star Trek movies (bloody hell, how could I have missed First Contact?? It was great!) and I had every intention of sleeping in. Well I was having some disturbing dreams that I don't remember much of apart from leaning over a guy to kiss the tattoo on the back of his neck, which led into a rousing romp of oral sex  -nice enough except that we were standing on a roadside in full view of passing traffic. I also remember that this guy (I have no clue who he was but he was good in bed) and I were looking after a guy who was on the run from the NDASP (I clearly remember those initials on some letter written to us). The NDASP are better known as the Nazis.  So anyway I guess that's why I'm awake. I think I'm going to have to stop reading about Hitler. I see in my last blog that I already explained my fascination with the Holocaust etc. Since then I've received a book I ordered from Amazon called 'Hitler's Niece' and I devoured that. A fascinating glimpse into the private Hitler. The book is historical fiction which means a lot of it is supposition based on actual facts. Apparently, and I had never heard about this, but Hitler was in love with his niece, Geli Raubal who was the daughter of his half-sister. Eventually he moved Geli into his flat so that he could monitor her every move and she chafed under his watchful eye. According to several factual accounts, Geli and Hitler had quite a sadistic, masochistic private relationship that sickened Geli and in 1931, she was found dead from a gunshot would to the chest. The weapon was Hitler's gun and it's been a mystery ever since - did she kill herself? Did Hitler do it? Or was it Himmler who was afraid he was losing his Fuehrer to some insignificant girl? "Hitler's Niece"  makes its own assumption about that that I won't reveal in case anyone should care to pick up the book. It's written from Geli's POV and I found it excellent. The fictional stuff aside, I learned quite a bit about Hitler pre-WWII. So that's my new little hobby and I've no clue why. I don't care about troop movements or battles - well obviously I don't mean to imply they are meaningless. I want to learn about what made Hitler so evil. I have to admit I feel weird about this as well because I don't 'admire' him or anything (before anyone starts thinking I'm turning into a neo-nazi :) ) It's just that he was so evil, so awful that I can't imagine he was ever human, with feelings and emotions. That's why I guess I'm fascinated by this story of his niece.  Enough of that. I'm hungry.

      Flu shots are feckin' useless. I have just spent the majority of this week throwing up food I'm pretty sure I ate back in 1985. Ugh. I'm beginning to feel better now, but my chest and back are so sore it hurts to take a deep breath. Gonna try to go back to work tomorrow but I don't know if I'll make it the whole day. Just standing up tires me out. I feel bad for missing so much work, I hope the boss doesn't get mad.  He shouldn't tho, he's pretty cool. He's weird, but he's cool.  Still no word from the bellydancer. Again. Have not heard whether she likes the site, nor have I received payment for May. Argh. So frustrating! I need a big old mafia guy to go around breaking legs of those who don't pay me :) Bet she couldn't bellydance then! My other job has been great now their domain woes are sorted out and they're up and running. I sent the bill and got payment 2 days later. I really hate worrying about this shit. I want an accountant.  Anyway, short blog. getting tired and all this typing has worn me out. Gnight.

      Oof Blackhawk Down is a bit of a downer movie. Well, I guess the overall message of the film is a good one. I suppose. *shudder* nevermind I don't wanna go into it. Ahhh so Monday tomorrow. I've decided to make tomorrow my day at home this week. I have meetings on both Wednesday and Friday and nothing sucks more than having to drive into work just for a bloody meeting. I was trying to start alternating Wednesday's and Fridays at home but it's just not working out for me this week. But this is kind of cool, this not having to go in to work on a Monday. Andy was right :) Heheh.. I have been debating which day to choose for a couple months now based upon my desire to either sort of have a three day weekend (either monday or Friday) or to have a 'day off' in the middle of the week. The benefits of all three are pretty good. Oh I know I still have to work, but there's something to be said for doing your work in your PJs :)  I was afraid if I chose Friday, my boss would think I'd use it to slack off and get paid for three day weekends (which I'd never dream of, but you know how bosses are). Monday was kind of the same fear - no one likes to work on Mondays. So Wednesdays seemed safe enough.. Anyway.. sheesh I even bore myself sometimes.   Sorry, I don't feel well. Throat.. nose.. Guess it's good I'm working home tomorrow.   I installed Xp on this comp a couple of days ago and it went fine. But I didn't realise I'd have to reinstall all of my programs :( Ugh. I had so many. Please realise I am not a techie by any means. I've always said that I need to marry a techie/mechanic who has no qualms about killing bugs, and won't make fun of me for not wanting to kill bugs. I know enough about comps to be dangerous and to my credit, I figured out how to grab and install my cable modem's drivers and got that working again. Go me. Anyway, I'm still able to boot up my ME edition and use my stuff but now I have to operating systems running on here. That can't be good. But then, what do I know.

      Ahhh my god this new computer is bloody fast. And I have to say the flat panel monitor is awesome. Really nice clarity. The only drawback is I have to re-download all my programs I had on my old one. See, I was told by our illustrious IS department that my old comp was so slow and old. We've been converting the hospital to Dells and mine was still an old Gateway. So I asked my boss to stick me on a list for a new computer and I figured I wouldn't hear another word about it for another year. The wheels grind ever so slowly around here you see. a mere 3 weeks later I've got a new puter :) It's spanky. I managed to move my vital files onto my network so I didn't lose all of that but half my programs are freebies downloaded from the net, or registered copies I downloaded. So it's been tedious getting everything put back, especially since I will not have admin privs after one of the geeks comes to put Norton antivirus on here. I guess he's a real nazi about not letting us peons have the ability to download stuff.  I wouldn't normally be bothered by it, but 99.9% of my job is online and sometimes requires the odd download of a new program now and then in order for me to be able to get my work done. Now I will have to submit work orders for someone up there to come down, download and install for me, wasting their time and mine. Corporations are fun!  Friday night is going to be a big night for the kidlet. One of the bookshops in town is doing a midnight release party for Harry Potter 5 and I'm going to take her. She's beside herself with excitement. We're going to buy 2 copies of the book so we can read it together. But I bet she finishes before me. To be quite honest, I'm kind of looking forward to it myself. JK Rowling is my hero - single mum makes good, you know, that kind of thing. There are quite a few Potter freaks here at work and we'r going to meet up at the party, should be a good time. I just have to resist buying movies while I kill tim til midnight (it's a video/music/bookstore). I'm at the point where I could hang a sign out and rent videos myself. The problem is a couple video stores in town closed down and are selling all their video for like, $3-$5 each and I've found about 8 I just couldn't live without. *sigh* So in my  urlLink collection  I'm up to 166 VHS vids and 42 DVDs. Give or take the ones I didn't inventory because they were just kiddie cartoons or recorded from television.  Hmm. With this uber-cool monitor, my background kind of looks shit on the movie site.  Have to fix that after the geeks come install my new Photoshop proggie. *sigh*

      Hmmmm.. My blog has emigrated and now everything look weird. Not bad, just... weird. Ah well, we'll see how it goes.   Anyway, haven't been doing much, just working and hanging out. I made the mistake of getting back into playing Sims on my Gamecube. Yeesh. I forgot how much fun it was to play God. I ended up killing one of my Sims as he was trying to cook dinner, but I played odds or evens with Death and won so he's still with us. I should have them throw a party or something. So that's what I've been doing with my time while my daughter was is away camping.  She left on Tuesday and is due back sometime today. I'm so curious as to how it went because this is her first time in the wilds of Nebby, and it's been a stormy and hot week. She does not function well in the heat so I hope she wasn't too bad off. Her best friend invited her to go with her family, and at first I was kind of chuffed at the prospect of having a few days to myself (bad mommy!) but I really miss her and can't wait until she's home. I did manage to get her bday pressies sorted out. Nothing spectacular I'm afraid as I broke down and gave her the new bike for Easter so she'd be able to ride it more so that was the big present for the year. Still I got her some nice things she'll enjoy and she's having friends round to the Water park next weekend for an all-day swimfest instead of a proper birthday party. I think she's getting a little too old for a traditional 'skate' party or something like that. When she's older, and we live in a bigger space, she'll be able to have parties grown-up stylie, but she's completely thrilled to be able to spend all day at the water park for now.  Well, time to get back to work. I want to try to find some new modules for my sites.

      Well I finished the book. We've had ever so much fun (don't I sound posh?) this weekend and I'm so impressed and pleased. I took the kidlet and her best friend to the shop where, to be honest the 'fun and games' weren't all that fun - but I got to hang out with my old co-workers that I haven't seen for a while, so that was nice. We got last-minute panic calls earlier that day telling us we needed to ensure that we bought the pre-order gift card or else we might not get a copy, so had to rush out and grab a couple (I wanted 2 copies of the book). So midnight finally rolls around, one woman was going to have a minor heart attack if she didn't get her copy. I wanted to smack her actually, she was annoying and her kid's diaper needed changing. Not pleasant when you're crowded close together in a packed line. Anyway, we got our books and my daughter carried them reverently to the car. Arrived home and went to bed. I know she was reading aloud to her friend for a bit, but I think I read for about an hour and a half before I gave in to sleep. So by morning I was about 5 chapters ahead of her and it just about killed me to stay quiet as we read. And did we ever read. Both of us, the entire day Saturday with small breaks for food and stuff. I wanted to just devour it and I didn't want anyone to spoil the surprises in the book for me so I stayed offline for most of the day. It was so wonderful to curl up with my daughter on the bed and just read together. What a wonderful time.  I just couldn't put it down and ended up finishing it around 3am-ish. I did have a couple of breaks, one to chat online for a bit with an old friend, and another to chat on the phone to another friend. The kid gave in to sleep around 1am and she finished the book this afternoon (poor thing slept til noon :)). We are both exhausted from our marathon reading session, but thoroughly satisfied as well. It was so worth the wait.   The reason I'm impressed is because I'm thrilled to see so many people - adults and children - lining up to read. Especially to read a book that's nearly 1000 pages long. What an accomplishment. I admire JK Rowling so much.   Ahhhh... Now I'm going to re-read book 4, then read the 5th one again. Anyone out there reading this, I hope you enjoy it. If you're not a fan, that's okay - it's probably not everyone's thang. But I wouldn't trade the experience the time I've had sharing this wonderful book series with my daughter for anything. Sappy, I know, but oh well :)

      My damn comments don't seem to show up occasionally. How annoying. But not *too* annoying as no one who reads this ever leaves me a comment, hint hint :)  Hehehe, I dunno who reads this shite anyway, it's just me rambling about stupid shit most of the time. Then again that's what a journal's for eh?  Don't have very much to write about atm. just working out plans for the kidlet's 12th (*sob*) birthday this Thursday. 12! ohhhh time flies so quickly. Just yesterday she was wearing little princess outfits and watching Barney. Now she's wearing the princess outfits ONLY on Halloween and watching The Matrix. *sigh* Last weekend I cut the chord a bit and let her ride her bike to the grandparents, which is about a 5 mile journey. My nails are non-existent as I bit them waiting for her to phone me when she arrived. And she did, a half an hour after she set off. Her trip was incident-free and I worried for no reason. I can't seem to realise that she's a lot older now. It's just so hard to think of her able to do things like that. I remember the first time I let her walk across the street to get a soda from the gas station. I felt like a horrible mother for it. But I wasn't. Just letting go a little bit at a time. But nobody told me how much that sucks.

      Today I will get my work done and I will swim. I will not pop a video in until I have gotten a healthy dose of pure exercise. And I will not just float around the pool when the waves are on. I will stretch and jog in place. I will do laps while avoiding petulant little kids who blame you for getting in their way. I will let my daughter stay longer than I actually want to stay. I will be oblivious to all the hardbodies there flashing their little bellybuttons and letting their suit ride up so we can all get a good view of their ass. I will not so much as look at the chiseled, slick men as they gracefully glide through the water. I will swim against the small current in order to give my arms a good workout. I will do flips and handstands and I will teach my daughter to do them too. And most of all, I will remember, this time, to put my bloody sun deflectors up in my car because it get bloody hot in there.

      Love love loved Pirates of the Caribbean. Love the ride so much - it was great to see all the little homages to it in the film. The kid and I went to see it Wednesday night. It was pretty cool because PotC was one of the first films I started to follow when I started my movie site and I'd report on the progress here and there, read up on it whenever it got a mention on other film sites etc. And then to see the final product and to have it exceed my expectations was really kind of awesome.  It's my fondest wish to someday get a chance to hang out on a movie set and just watch. Ahhh bliss.  Anyway, day at home tomorrow... I think I really love doing that on Fridays then I sort of get a 3 day weekend every week :) I know I still have to work, but there's something about not having to dress up and go *in* to the office that makes it fun. I get so much more done as well since I don't have to answer the phone.  What else is happening... Oh yes, Kelly made it back from london okay. A bit of a cockup with the cat in LA, but she got it sorted by pulling the pitiful crying girl routine :) She is so resourceful. And damn lucky the beeyotch. She will eventually end up in a nice little place called the Carriage House in Pacific Grove near the Seven Gables Inn (gorgeous big yellow B&B right on Lighthouse Avenue that has appeared in a Visa advert). She'll be one block from the beach, and from Lover's Point. Cheap (for Pacific Grove and near-beachfront property) rent and all utilities paid. She got her job back at Pebble Beach, Spanish Bay Inn so yay more celebrity gossip for me :) and our friends who own a couple of car dealerships are loaning her a car until she gets back on her feet. I don't think she could have asked for a better way to start all over again - was certainly easier than the few times I've had to start all over, the wench. But I'm not hating. No no.. Just a little wistful I do miss foggy old Monterey sometimes. and my Meechie. I haven't talked to him in a while, should give him a call...  Ahhh well... it's getting late and I should really ummm.. yeah. I'm off now.

      So I've got a vague story idea I'm kind of excited about. The only problem is that the more I think about it, the more I begin to talk myself out of writing it. Things like 'No one's going to be interested in that' and 'who the hell cares about that?' dance through my head. Gotta love that self-doubt before I actually write the story. Well.. if anyone cares, the story idea is on my Evolve blog. Leave me a comment or something if you think it's something you'd ever check out.   Anyway... So it's July. Hottest fecking month of the year apart from August. I'm not one of those that exactly love the heat either so you can iomagine what torture Nebraska summers are for me. I scurry from one air-conditioned place to another as quick as I can, and spend as little time as possible outside. The only respite I find outside is when we hit the pool. It's not so much the heat as it is the humidity, which is a killer.   I try to find positive things about living in Nebraska, I really do. I'm stuck here for who knows how long for various reasons, so I want to try to find a way to be happy here but this place does not make it easy. Let's see... I love my job and the people there. I like swimming at the Waterpark.   ....   I honestly can't think of anything else. We have "cultural" things. We have an Ethnic Festival (outdoors, in July, the aforementioned hottest month of the year) in which a bunch of hispanic people cook hispanic food and some old people don leiderhosen and kilts and do a native dance of some kind. And we have Art in the Park where mediocre artists gather to show off their watercolours of flowers and butterflies. It's not as bad as all that but again, it's in feckin' July. WHY??   There's a museum here all about the Pioneers and there's an 'Old Town' with real houses and stores leftover from the days of the cowboys. I went there on ever bloody field trip you can imagine when I lived here as a kid.   The ratio of restaurants to actual population is outrageous. If there's construction in town it's to build another one. Or an auto parts store.   Did I mention it's hot? It's fucking hot. Hotter than hot. It's damn hot. And then we get 2 days of a lovely autumn, and then it's a deep-freeze in the winter. Then it's cold. Fucking cold. Colder than cold. it's damn cold. And the scenery. Well, if you're a fan of flat cornfields, then this is the place for you. My new thing now when someone asks me what Nebby is like is to tell them to go rent 'About Schmidt' with jack Nicholson. That is Nebraska. Depressing.   Wow what a rant. Anyway enough of that :)

      Lately online I've been feeling ignored. So many times I'll post something on some forum, or say something on TCZ only to hear cricket noises as I wait for a response. It's kind of disconcerting. I can kind of understand it on a forum, especially one where I'm not very well known - I'm more of a lurker than a joiner - but on TCZ it bothers me. I'm an administrator there, supposedly part of a team, but lately my ideas and suggestions on current issues are ignored or barely considered before being dismissed and even if I just ask some inane question or crack a joke on the admin chat channel, it's like I'm not there.   Oh well. I'm way too dependent on TCZ anyway. Maybe I should retire. But everytime I think about it, I realise there are so many aspects of being an admin I'd miss. Ugh, I have a headache. Whinging about TCZ isn't helping. I just feel like whinging full stop. What else can I moan about.... There's always my granny. She's so bizarre. In fact, my grandfather came to see me at work yesterday and I actually said 'She's whacked!' to him. The scary thing is, he said, 'Tell me about it!' That floored me :) Her current obsession of the moment is to get their house "in order" in case one of them (my grandfather) passes away. The morbidity of that aside, she's been wigging out lately because my grampa has a habit of saving bits of wood, siding, carpet etc from past home improvement projects by storing them in the basement. And he's squirreled away some of it on top of the ventilation system down there. Well she's been after him to get it all down and out of the house for months now. I swear it's the only thing she can physically talk about until it's done.  Well, grampa has no need to be monkeying up and down a ladder to get all this stuff down so I said I would come by today and do it. Little did I know that I would be stricken with a particularly horrible set of cramps all night long and this morning. Ugh it was awful. Could not even stand up straight. Totally sucks because I used to be able to brag that I never got them - and I didn't - so now it must be payback because I get 'em now with a vengeance. Anyway, too much info I know :) So I called them and said I'd be over later than I'd intended so I could rest a bit. I finally show up, piss off granny even more when I ask if we can tackle the stuff in the garage when it's cooler (beastly hot today) to which she said I should have come earlier that morning when it *was* cooler. I then replied that she was lucky I was there to help at all and proceeded to tell her I could barely stand up straight much less climb ladders in a basement all afternoon. Anyway, I made her feel bad then which made me feel bad, but you know, I was bitchy and all. Anyway I told her it was ok, I had taken some motrin and felt up to it etc etc and disappeared down the basement with my grampa.   As I looked around the basement ceiling and the plethora of junk my gran had been moaning about these past months I was shocked to discover that there werre a few slats of siding, one chuck of carpeting, 3 squares of glass and some old screening wire. That's it. Took all of five minutes to get it all down.  Aye-yi-yi, to quote Ricky Ricardo.

      I really want to do a roadtrip out to Cali this fall or if worse comes to worse, next spring. I would love to load up the car and head west for a nice leisurely drive along the southern route to Monterey with the kidlet. We could see the Rockies, the desert, stop over at the Grand Canyon (I've never seen it myself)... I think it would be cool for her to get a longer glimpse of the country and I've never attempted a roadtrip like that before. My car's in good shape, I should have enough vacation time built up by then... The only thing stopping me is money. Well, money and getting the kid time off from school which is probably not a good idea. The only feasible time to do it for her is over xmas hols. Argh. I don't want to go in the summertime because it's too bloody hot. Winter, and I'd have to worry about hitting bad weather around the mountains.  Will leave that to ponder for a bit. I want to go see Kelly and Meechie and everyone so I'll have to work something out. Not much else to say atm.. Just working away here waiting for 4.30 to come along so go outside where the heat index is 115 degrees F. And I have to go to the store aswell. Ugh. I shall be a puddle by the time I get home.

      Ohh I'm getting a nice little tan from all this swimming. Excellent so long as I don't burn. The kid and I spent a couple hours at the pool this evening and it was heavenly. It's been beastly hot and I have to say, The next car I buy I will resist the urge to buy a black car with a black interior unless I live where it's cold all the time. My car just sucks in the heat. I could fry an egg on the steering wheel. Anyway, the water felt wonderful.  Yesterday, nothing exciting happened. I don't know why I keep writing that nothing exciting happened. Not every day is a party. Maybe I should change it to 'nothing bad happened yesterday'. That might be better. I let the kidlet ride her bike to the pool over the weekend which isn't as far as when she rode to the grandparent's but it's along one of my town's busiest roads so i ended up following along behind her in the car. See, I didn't want her to ride along the busy road, even though that's the quickest way. It's illegal anyway so she had to take a bit of a circuitous route. So I followed to make sure she didn't get lost. Of course, she didn't and I always worry for nothing. But she's not allowed to ride to the pool to swim by herself, so she has to meet a friend there. I know she loves to swim but I doubt she'd have much fun swimming on her own with no buddy to hang around with.    Anyway, I'm working from home tomorrow, hurray! I wish I could think of a reason to keep that up during the winter because I'm going to miss it. Sometimes, even though I love my job very much, I wake up just not wanting to go to work. I just have no desire whatsoever to get up, shower, put makeup on, dress in uncomfortable office clothes and drive across town and sit in my little cave for 8 hours. But having a day at home to look forward to each week motivates me for some bizarre reason and I don't feel like such a sluggard in the mornings. Besides, and I think I've said this before, I love working in my jammies :D  And so ends another entry. I'm off to watch the Cheers marathon, then to bed with my 5th Harry Potter book. Gnight.

      I'm so tired. Every time I lay down to go to sleep though my brain just won't let me. It's been a rough week and I still have Friday to get through. I got a call at my office yesterday telling me that my grandfather had been taken by ambulance to the ER because he'd been having a seizure in his chair at home. My grandmother thought he was just having some kind of nightmare because he'd been dozing as grandfathers often do. But he started tensing up and shaking and so she called 911.   But when I got that phone call saying another one of my family members was rushed to the hospital I swear time slowed down and everything seemed far away. I knew I was going to go over there only to be told it was too late and he was dead. My grampa. The coolest grampa ever. The one who always stands at the door and waves at us as we drive away. The one who spent months building a victorian dollhouse for his great-granddaughter. The one who tells me great stories about when he was aboard ship in WWII down in the South Pacific or stops over at my office just to say hello. I was not prepared for this. I ran out to my car, my hands shaking as I tried to stick the key in the ignition. I was crying but trying not to cry because I knew I'd have to be strong for my gran when I got over to the ER, but I was so dreading what I would be told... The last time this very thing happened - the phone call saying my mom was rushed to the ER and when I got there she was gone...  Somehow I made it over there, I don't really remember how I got there. I stepped into the Emergency Room - the last time I was there was the day mom died and I'd avoided it ever since even though I still work for the hospital. I saw my gran and my cousin's wife, along with my boss - no clue how he knew to go over there. And they told me he was okay. I cannot describe the rush of relief that poured over me. My boss had to grab me because I think I nearly fainted. He led me over to the chairs where I sat shaking and crying...  As of right now we don't know what caused the seizure. He's incredibly healthy for a guy his age (almost 80), never had any history of seizures or other diseases that cause seizures - in fact he'd never had one before in his life. He came around in the ER and had no idea why he was there. Last thing he remembered was eating lunch yesterday. It was just after that when he dozed off and then began seizing. But he's alert, and pretty much his normal self, teasing nurses, making jokes and all that. He may get to go home tomorrow barring any more problems but we'll have to wait for the results of all the tests they've done before they tell us for sure whether he can go home.  He can't drive now for the next 3 months which is going to be hard for him as he did the majority of the driving. I stayed with my gran, and drove her home late last night and waited while she showered and got ready for bed etc to make sure she was ok. I think she was in shock herself but I could see how relieved she was after we were able to go in and see him. Today I drove her over and sat with them for a few hours, then went back to work for a while, then back again to his room to wait for the doc who didn't come and then to take her home. I couldn't sleep last night, I probably won't sleep tonight much. I leave the tv on for the noise to try and distract my brain but eventually I begin to wonder if I can't sleep because the tv is on, but when I shut it off, all I can think about is what would be going on right now if he hadn't been all right, if he had died. I know I shouldn't but I can't help it. I try reading, or getting up and mucking about with my movie site. Nothing works and I was a zombie today. And I will be one again tomorrow when I go pick Gran up and take her back to the hospital.  I think i'll stop writing now... my eyes are burning and watering I'm so tired so I'm gonna give bed a go. Gnight.

      Well I had a whole blog written earlier today but like an idiot, I closed the wrong window and lost it all. I was not happy. On the bright side, it was a boring entry anyway so no big loss.   I'm haviung a bit of crisis of conscious right now. My film site is beginning to take off and traffic is finally picking up a bit so I'm pleased with that. A couple of days ago, I stumbled onto a pic of Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. It was the first pic and it was leaked onto the net so naturally I posted the news on my film site. Later I found out that Warner Bros. have been asking the big film sites and fan sites to remove it and most have complied. Except me. I'm not big enough to warrant an email from a major studio so I figure I'll keep it up for those who want to see it. But I feel bad about it. But I've always wanted a big studio to think enough of my site to email me and ask me to take something down :) I think that would be cool. So until one of them does, I guess I'll leave it up. I justify it by the fact that it is a fan picture - meaning it was a few of the castmembers posing with some fans and therefore not official and WB has no right to say what that fan does with the image. Sounds good to me anyway.  I would so love for The Picture Show to take off. I've read where a few other bigwig film sites get a lot of promotional stuff and even invites to premieres and stuff. I would so be in heaven. I doubt it will happen but you never know :) I'm still new in the grand scheme of things so we'll see where I am a year or two from now.  Short entry now tho, dinner's almost ready. Cheerio.

      I'm diggin' the scrolly bars on here :) I'm so clever. No really - I am :)   Spent today getting my webcam working. Somewhere amongst my blogs is a woeful tale of the Big Crash that killed the drivers for it. I meant to fix them after it happened but well, then I bought a digital camera and just played with that instead. Now the digital cam is tucked away and I want my cam back up for various reason. One of them being I can keep an eye on the place while I'm at work. Every now and then Spooky wanders in front of the camera and sniffs it which makes for amusing views.   I've only got one week left of staying home one day a week and working. Poo. I swear they're sending the kids back earlier and earlier every year. She goes back on the 20th - nearly 2 weeks before labour day. The pools aren't even shut that early. Ah well. Will have to psych myself up for it again. I love my job, I really do. I think my biggest issue is having to get up at 6am. Morning person? Me? No way. I'm not fully awake til at least 10am and even that that's stretching it. I am definitely a night person.  Not much to report right now. I've got to do laundry and tidy the place up but have I done any of that? Nope. Must add 'stop procrastinating' to my to-do list. I'll bet anything though that the mood will strike me at about 9pm to hoover or something. Laundry is best done on Sunday anyway. Everyone in the building is in church so the machines are free :) Anyway, I'm boring myself with this entry so I can imagine what it must be like for anyone reading it.

      Ok so... I got a little bored this morning and tweaked this blog a little. Nothing major. I still have an urge to completely makeover ukmelia.com aswell but I haven't found a look I like yet. I'm feeling better today, I'm just gonna deal with the issue and move on. I get so sick of going to pieces when money becomes an issue. I mean, fuck sake, I'm *cough cough* years old and I've been in tighter spots so what is the big deal? Bill Bryson's father used to tell him, 'There's always someone who is worse off than you.' and he used to think, 'So?' But I can see hid dad's point. I could be living in a car and dumpster diving for dinner.  So tonight, I shall take the kidlet to the pool and we'll stay there until it closes. We'll have a good time and get totally worn out. Then we'll come home and try to catch the International Space Station passing overhead before collapsing in bed. Then I promised to rent 'What a Girl Wants' for her. Typical teen cheese movie but Colin Firth is in it. Yum yum. Eye candy for mum.  Next week we're having a service for my aunt. My uncle finally decided to buy a spot for her ashes at a cemetery, so the family is going to gather and Reverend Karen who officiated at her funeral will say a few words and then it's back to my grandparents for strawberry shortcake. Kind of an odd evening but then my granny is rather odd. My cousin's coming down for this and is staying the week so we've made some plans to take my daughter ice skating (he plays goalie for a hockey team up in Wisconsin) so they will skate around and I will fall down a lot. I'm not the most graceful person in the world :) Rick's also bringing his telescope down as Mars is supposed to be particularly bright next week and there's also a meteor shower going on so the kid will enjoy that a lot - so will I for that matter, I love looking at the stars.  Anyway, off I go. Just got some fabulous new graphics software I want to play with.

      Sometimes, life sucks. Truly. You get lulled into a false sense of security and contentment, only to have the rug pulled out from under you when you least expect it. I do hate to prattle on about my woes. Sometimes it seems like that's all I do here. last time I got to feeling like this I ended up blogging about the positive things in my life and that made me feel better. Maybe I'll end this one like that. Right now I need to vent.  Two years ago I consolidated my student loans so that I wouldn't have to make a million different payments to different loan companies. Or so I thought. Apparently I still had one loan on the loose that has been accruing interest and no payments.  Their attempts to contact me were fruitless, mainly because I refuse to call people back if, when they leave a message, they don't tell me where they are from. I also don't open mail if it doesn't say who the letter is from. I get so much junk, half of which is generic-looking and marked urgent only to open it and find out that it's only urgent I apply for their credit card. Now, loan companies are notoriously devious and sneaky and send letters in generic, non-marked envelopes, or by calling and dodging the question when I ask where they're from.  So that's my defense on why I didn't know about this loan. Anyway, I got a call this morning telling me that my loan is in default and they are about to begin garnishing my wages to the tune of $300 per month if I don't come up with $1300 now, and then make $75 payments. I cannot afford to lose $300 out of my paychecks - if that happened I'd be right back where I was when I first started my job and that's struggling to pay the rent and buy food for me and the kid. I was just getting my head above the water. So fine, the payment schedule sounds good to me and I'm fine with that, but then there is the $1300 down payment hurdle. I've just paid all the usual bills so I'm not flush - where the fuck am I going to get $1300??? No I do not have rich relatives or friends I can ask - nor would I. I've borrowed money when I was desperate from a very good friend and it felt awful. Anyway I do have options. I'm not happy about them and it might mean my xmas trip to Cali is off, and my car payment will be late next month but I can scrape up the cursed $1300. *sigh*  I went to college for 2 years and I will be paying on these fucking loans until I die. As soon as I get this thing out of default it's getting consolidated.  So now I'm bummed and feel poor again. Tonight I will toss and turn and try to add money up in my head and figure out ways to get the damn bellydancer to pay me the money she owes me. I won't get any sleep and tomorrow I'll be a wreck at work. Time to distract the brain before be methinks. Maybe I'll leave the telly on all night.  So I was going to end this on a positive note. I have many bright spots in my life right now. My grandfather is okay, my daughter is beautiful and healthy. Next week I get to go ice-skating and watch the meteor shower. I love my job and the people I work with. The summer has been abnormally mild - yes it's been damn hot but not the killer it usually is - and my AC is still working. I have good friends whom I love, my sister is thinking of going for her Master's degree, another friend of mine is going to go for his (I just think that's so impressive when people do that - if I ever get my loans paid off and become a successful web designer, I'll do it too!), my best mate's salon business is growing, and my movie site is doing well.  Not too bad.. Someday, this will all be 20 years ago and when I look at shit problems like this loan thing that way, it doesn't seem so bad.

      Well my grandad is back home now and he looks great - tho my granny will not let him nap in his chair anymore :) Which has in turn meant that he sleeps great at night. Go figure. But it's kind of odd now, it's like we've been given a second chance but in a surreal weird kind of way. When I see him now I can't help but think that he might not have made it. It's so morbid :( So he gets extra hugs and kisses all the time now.   We did a little shopping for the grandparents over the weekend and checked to make sure he was getting on all right. Then we mostly stayed in this weekend. Very hot around here - humid etc.. I hate going to the pool on the weekend because of the crowds - no fun to swim when all you're really doing is dodging innertubes and splashy kids. So we go later in the evening during the week and practically have it all to ourselves. Anyway, so we rented some videos. Avoid Solaris at all costs. That is an hour and a half I'll never get back. Horrible film and even George Clooney's naked bum did nothing for me. There was very little I wanted to rent this weekend so I ended up getting pretty much all shite movies. Kangaroo Jack could have been funnier if Disney had done it. There were a few chuckles but it was mostly shite. I've got Jurassic Park 3 and Die Another Day left to watch. Dunno if I'm all that enthused about either.  What else is happening... Not much... Had a lovely chat with an old friend over the weekend which was nice. I love it when that happens. Took the kidlet for a haircut which turned out rather nice despite my inability to convey what kind of style I wanted to see on her. Hairdressers usually intimidate me. Even Meechie somewhat. My best friend and I still feel silly if I ask him to do my hair a certain way. But as I don't get to have him as my stylist very often it's not really an issue.   I also think I may be losing my mind a little. Friday, I got out of the shower and dried off etc, got dressed. Went to work, wondered in passing why I had such a tremendous wedgie. Sorted it out when I got to my office and went about my routine. Went to the caf for brekkie, came back with the same wedgie and then it hit me, I had put my knickers on backwards. What a dolt. Then this morning I got dressed flitted about the house getting ready to go to work when I realised I had put my shirt on inside out. I thnk I might be slightly mad, but I think I'm going to call myself eccentric if I go out in public with my knickers on backwards and my shirt inside out.

      I really meant to update this sooner Leigh, I swear it :) So this blog's for you ;)   It's been a busy week. Work, pounding migraine, ice skating, dinners out of town, the discovery that there is a beer or two I can actually drink without grimacing, a memorial service, and other stuff. I've acquired an exercise bike and a printer. I sorted out a major money problem and managed to have dosh left over to buy school supplies and now it's Friday. The big blackout of 2003 has wreaked havoc on the Internet at work as our servers are actually in Philadelphia so I have a valid reason to work from home today. Woohoo!  I'm really chuffed with myself regarding the ice skating. Earlier this year I took the kid and her friend to the rink in Kearney and I managed to stumble around the ice one time before I gave up. I couldn't get my balance and I felt so embarrassed that I had to hug the wall as I went around while everyone else swooshed on by. I used to skate a lot when I was younger and was quite good. But I hadn't been in ohhhh, 15 years at least. Obviously it was not like riding a bike. So when the opportunity came this week to go again, I was actually dreading it. The guy we went with plays hockey and has been skating for over 10 years and so of course I was afraid of looking like an eejit in front of him.  However, I tried a different type of blade this time and little by little, the confidence came back! Soon I was one of the ones swooshing past and feeling so graceful and exhilerated. It was a blast! Ohh I just loved it. I can't wait to go again. The rink has open skating most evenings and it's only 5 bucks to get in. It's going to be the perfect exercise to replace swimming once the pools close for the year. My only whinge is that I wish I didn't have to drive 40 miles to do it. Ah well, it's worth it to me.   Oh the problem turend out that the first time I skated that was such a disaster, I had rented the skates with a toepick on the front of the blade. They kept catching the ice and making me feel clumsy and as if I was about to fall over with each glide of the skate. This time I got the smooth blades and that totally made all the difference.  Anyway, so that's been my week. I spent some time happily watching the Bomo spods at the big TCZ meet last weekend - thanks to Matt and his webcams. I can't belive they played Twister at 3 in the morning. Crazy kids. Had a nice big blowout amongst the reds and the admin on Sunday that was just no fun to clean up and deal with and it ended up disrupting the big meet somewhat which was uncool. Then spent the week just having fun and hanging out. We had a short memorial service for my aunt out at the cemetery which was nice. It will be nice to have a place to visit for her.  And that's about it. Fun eh?

      So here I am blogging away on a Friday morning. I have a grand plan to update all my blogs today. Yes I know I'm at work and I should be working on Radiology stuff but... but.. Radiology is boring the pants off of me. It looks like it will be a big section but I've just been told that I should ensure the content is understandable to a 6th grader. How the fuck do I do that? I'm no good at editing. *sigh* I'll figure it out I suppose, but damn I need some more schooling just to work out what a 'modality' is.  'Chicago' came out on DVD this week. Been waiting for that one - such a good flick. I'm not normally a huge fan of musicals. They're okay and there are certain ones I do love ('Cabaret' for instance) but mostly I find it hard to believe a story can just stop while the actors burst into song. But 'Chicago' is really well done and clever AND the music is fantastic. Next week though... ohhh next week... 'Two Towers' finally comes to DVD. Oh happy day. Now I can delete it off my computer :D hehehehe.... Seriously though I am so looking forward to it and yes I will be buying it next week as well as the extended version due out in November. Why? Because I can. I don't think you have a clue how much these films mean to me. I don't even know myself. I just love them so much. The books have always been special to me for as long as I can remember and Peter Jackson is just a god in my eyes because he's brought them to life so well. So I will happily give them my money if it means I get to watch these brilliant movies whenever I want. Why did I download it then? Because I want to watch it whenever I want :) I HATE waiting for movies to come out on DVD. I am not a patient person.  It just occurred to me that I'm not writing this blog like a diary, I'm writing it like a letter to someone. I wonder if that defeats the purpose of a journal where you write down your deepest darkest stuff. Maybe having an audience takes away from that. Who knows. Who cares really. Wow talk about a subject change. Anyway, I'm going to get back to my Radiology shite. *yawn*

      What is the fascination men have with breasts I wonder. The latest trend on TCZ is to have everyone get on their webcams and then the girls flash everyone. Woohoo. Fine if you're a promiscuous chick with nice tits, but I'm having trouble seeing the appeal. Maybe at first the guys are thinking, 'These girls are obtainable! I could shag one of these birds at the next meet because look! They let me look at their boobs!' I guess I can see the novelty of it. But after a few hours of staring at other people on a webcam with no sound, the novelty wears off. At least for me. Sunday night a bunch of us were doing the cam thing and several spods were quite drunk (not me of course, as a) I had no alcohol in the house and b) I don't drink much) but it didn't take long for the shirts to come off and the boob brigade to begin. I was under enormous pressure to join in myself, especially since the bloke pressuring me is awfully cute - but he was sat next to a half-naked girl IRL so I didn't see the point. That and of course my daughter was flitting about the place so it wouldn't have been very mom-like of me to get my tits out on cam.   I don't think I would have even if I'd been alone. I don't want to be viewed as one of 'those' girls. Sounds awfully bitchy of me, but it's a girl thing really. There are a few chicks on TCZ who pretty much go to meets just for the chance to get their tops off for the lads. While I applaud the fact that they are comfortable with themselves enough to enjoy doing that, I don't think they understand what sort of label they're giving themselves by other females. Or maybe they do understand but could care less. Should any of those girls read this obscure little blog and take offense, realise I am not saying there is anything wrong with having fun and frankly - if you've got a nice rack and have no hangups about nudity then more power to you. I'm just saying there's going to be a stigma attached to you. It's not nice, it's not fair but it's there. Some less-than-liberal females might tend to think the boob-girls are tarts and slappers and look on them with disdain.   While I don't agree with that stigma, I also don't think I want to subject myself to it just to give some guys I'll probably never see IRL a cheap thrill. I think I like to leave it up to the imagination. Sometimes sexy is what you have on that highlights what's underneath rather than just a peepshow. So monster, if you ever read this, I'm not getting the tits out on cam whether the kidlet's home or not :) Of course this means my webcam is boring and my viewers drop off quickly when they realise I'm not getting naked. Oh well :)  I meant to write about how boobs are kind of boring to look at but I sort of went off on a tangent :) Anyway... Boobs are kind of dull. Sure there are different shapes and sizes but the basic ingredients are there for most of them: nipples, areolas and a certain amount of squishiness. Some have tanlines, others are pale. But really.. what good is looking at them if you can't get at them? Ohhhh I suppose it's nice to have something to think about late at night in bed. Alone. Or maybe something else to think about while in bed with someone who doesn't quite have the set you'd like. Or even in bed with a set you like but you want more for variety :)   Oh who knows why guys like looking at them. Guys are weird.

      I just got the coolest program called 'Starry Night Backyard'. It's beautiful and I'm really quite excited about it. I should preface this a little and mention my growing interest in astronomy. Well, I've always enjoyed it but never really pursued it because it can be an expensive hobby. And I have my cousin to blame for re-igniting my interest in it - that and the fact that my daughter's really taken with it as well. She's so clever.  Anyway, this program has you program the Longitude and Latitude of your location and then it will project stars, planets, constellations, satellites and comets at any point in time - either past, present or future. You can "visit" other planets/stars, magnify them, learn their coordinates, check the zodiac constellations... It's just really bloody cool. The kidlet is going to get so much use out of it for school.  I just finished watching Apollo 13 for the hundredth time. I own the video but I love when they show it on the History channel because Jim Lovell is interviewed during commercial breaks. It's an amazing film really, and even though I know perfectly well how it ends, I still end up crying like a baby when they make it back home. Rick's got a couple of videos of all the Apollo missions that I guess just play all of the communications from mission control to the crafts. Can't wait to borrow that from him.  The weather's finally cooling off. It was actually chilly out this morning which brought a smile to my face. Summer's nearly over - yay! The first Husker game was today, hockey season's starting up, the nights are cold, and the leaves are slowly beginning to change. I'm looking forward to this fall and winter.

      Another truly MTV moment with Madonna snogging Britney Spears and Christina Aguilara. I want to look like Madonna when I'm 40-something. Damn. I have no clue why I watched the MTV video awards tonight. I hadn't seen a single one of the videos that won. I mean really, MTV stopped showing videos ages ago and sold out to sponsors and doesn't play much of anything I identify with. Why bother? I guess I'd heard some of the hype about what Madonna and Britney were up to and thought I'd check it out. And it was kiind of cool to see my Duran Duran all onstage (all the original members - damn Roger Taylor still looks hot.) But the rap and the hip hop.. I just don't get it. I couldn't understand a damn word any of them were saying. The beats were nice, but well.. I dunno not my thing. Beyonce's performance was pretty cool.    Anyway enough of that. I watched the VMAs and I don't know why. I think I'm getting old. I *was* going to go swimming tonight one final time before they closed the pools over Labour Day but instead the fuckheads closed last week :( I guess they close them when school starts. But you know what? IT'S STILL BLOODY HOT OUTSIDE!! It was so disappointing. Now I suppose free skates at the rink will be closed down soon due to hockey starting up soon. Bah.  I bought Meechie his very own domain name for his bday this week. I was really stumped on what to get him. He has everything - the boy is loaded up on Versace and Dolce and drives a Passat. Yeesh. He's difficult to shop for to say the least. But I think I did good this year as he loves his website. My other best friend Kat was gorgeous enough to host it for me so on his bday he loaded up  urlLink Meechieman.com  and was genuinely chuffed to find it existed :) Whee that was fun.  Mars was at it's finest last night. I've never seen it so bright. My cousin's really getting me interested in astronomy. I'll never be more than an amature at it - I don't even have a scope. Maybe I'll invest in one next time I come into some cash. The kid and I really enjoy perusing the night skies.  I was going to write more but suddenly my eyes are drooping, so off to bedfordshire I go.

      I feel sad. I'm not really sure why but I just feel like I could cry at the drop of a hat. Is that depression? I don't feel particularly depressed. I have my usual worries - money being the chief one but I'm not in dire straits. I have been thinking of my mother a lot lately. The other night I couldn't stop myself from seeing her lying dead in the ER. I hate that that was my last image of her. I'm really missing her right now. I was watching some movie today (what else is new) and one of the characters in it found it therapeutic to write letters to his absent father. He never sent them but it felt good to write them anyway. Maybe I could adapt that idea into a blog. Maybe that would help. I'll think about it.   Maybe I'm just tired. Or maybe I need a distraction. I think I'll go clean another closet... wait a minute... The other day I cleaned one of my closets out and found a lot of my mother's things that I've never gone through. I couldn't do it so soon after she died, but felt okay about it the other day. I found a lot of old letters from boyfriends, some articles she wrote for my local paper back in the 60s, old photos, sympathy cards from when my father passed away... Maybe that's what's setting me off and making me feel sad. Has to be because I can't think of any other reason.. Maybe I won't go clean a closet out right now.  Now my nose is bleeding. God this weekend has been weird.

      *Yawn* I'm sleepy. It's only 6 in the evening but I could do with a nap. The kidlet and I had LOTR day and watched Fellowship and Two Towers back to back. Good way to kill a day :) Can't wait to be able to watch all three back to back. Anyway, we picked a good day to do it as well, since it rained most of the day. Finally. I love it when it rains and it doesn't do it nearly enough here for my tastes.  I think the munchkin's coming down with a cold which is kind of sucky. She wants to try for perfect attendance at school (my little nerd :D) this year so I'm keeping her medicated and tucked up in bed to try and head whatever she's got off at the pass. Nebraska's been hit bad with West Nile Virus this year and my county, I believe, has the highest number of cases of it. The other day I noticed a bite on her arm but we couldn't decide if it was a spider bite or mosquito bite. Now she's stuffed up and slightly feverish. Oh dear oh dear...   When she was one, she came down with pneumonia and had to be in hospital for a few days with an IV and spent most of her time in a plastic tent that spurted mist all over her. It was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever had to go through with her. I was a new mom watching my little girl lay listlessly in the tent with an IV sticking out of her. I felt helpless because she couldn't understand why she had to stay in there. Anyway, I'd hate for her to have to go back into the hospital because of this west nile thing. Poor kid.  She's dozing right now. I think I'll go check on her.

      I was about to go to bed but I feel so wretched I thought if I blogged I'd get it out of my system and be able to sleep. Today was a rotten day, but not for any real reason that I can pin down. I should have enjoyed it more as it was nice and rainy all day, something we've not had much of this summer. I guess it started at lunch when one of my co-workers came into the office I share with another girl. She came in, invited her to lunch and off they went. They do this a lot really. It kind of bothers me that they don't ask me if I want to go with them. They only go to the cafeteria down the hall. I don't know why it bothers me so much. I don't even like eating in the cafeteria. If I eat lunch at all I eat at my desk. Maybe they know that and just figured I'd say no anyway. But I'd still like to be asked I guess.  So anyway, I felt somewhat out of sorts when I came home. Then on TCZ one of the retired admin totally goes off on me in the BBS (bulletin board are, publicly viewed by all users) and says a few really mean-spirited things. In a thread about the pros and cons of fullscreen vs. widescreen DVDs of all places. I misinterpreted what I thought was a sarky comment he made - but to be honest I've known this guy for years and his dislike of me and paranoia where I'm concerned is well-known by most of the regulars. Anyway it's hard to explain how the whole thing escalated without giving a big background about him and I really can't be arsed. Suffice to say I explained that if he didn't mean to be sarky then fine, it was just how I interpreted it and then he posted a response that was pretty much one long personal insult that had nothing to do with the topic or the misunderstanding of the comment. I'm guessing he's had it pent up for months now and saw his chance to vent at me now that he's no longer and admin. He's always thought I've "had it in" for him for some reason. I'll admit to disliking him but I can't say I've spent any kind of time plotting ways to make him believe I'm trying to get at im whenever I can. He misinterprets my disagreements with his opinions as me getting at him.  Ohhh.. whatever. It's really too convoluted and messy to explain. I'm not trying to say I'm entirely innocent in this situation, but I don't think anything I said warranted a personal attack. But it bothered me to the point of making me feel really awful at being completely misunderstood for so long and the futility of trying to explain myself to him frustrates me. I hate it when people dislike me for invalid reasons. And of course he posts his little attack and promptly logged off without extending the courtesy of waiting around to see my reply and by the time he came back I had debated with myself and removed all of the posts. So he never saw my reply. And he got the satisfaction of goading me into deleting it. Argh. So that's totally worsened my mood and I just want to cry.

      Blah. That's how I've been. Just blah. But it too, shall pass. Lately I've been doing a few projects, one being letters to my mum in blog form.  I kind of like it. It felt a little weird at first, writing to her, but after a while I found it kind of therapeutic.  I finished up Meechie's page after finally settling on a design I liked and that fit the wonderful pic of Meech that Leonie from my forums drew for me. She rocks. So Meechie's sister saw his page and now apparently I need to put together a page for "his own flesh and blood" whom I neglected to link to :) "Oh no she di-in't" was the exact quote I believe :)  Hehehe.. So I'm waiting for her to send me some pics and I'll put something together for them.  Today I had to go to a four hour orientation (or re-orientation rather) at work. *yawn*. No matter how they try to jazz it up, it's still sitting on a hard plastic chair for four hours listening to people talk about things like 'Emtala' and 'Bio-hazard' safety. I understand that some of this stuff is important to know, but I don't see the need to take 4 bloody hours out of my work day to go through it all. It can all be done in increments via the web. Oh well, til that glorious day, I have to sit through torture once a year. At least now I can have my job evaluation Friday and then get my raise next paycheck :)  I can't believe I've been at the hospital almost four years already. This is the longest I've ever worked in one place :) Not that I'm a job-hopper mind you. I just moved a lot, got better job offers, took time out to go to college etc.  Anyway, quick blog tonight.

      MMmmmm Vacation... Today I turned in my request for a glorious week off in a few weeks. Five whole days (9 if you count the weekends) to myself, and getting paid for it to boot! God I can't wait. I need a break in the routine. I've never been very good at monotony. I feel like all I do is get up, go to work, come home, watch a movie or flit around the Net. It's boring. I just need a little break in the monotony and then I think I'll be juiced up and energized again. I need it. It's been a rough couple of weeks.  Return of the King trailer came out yesterday and ohhhhhh my goodness I cannot bloody wait for this film. I just can't. I think I've talked about it before but who cares, it's my blog and I'll go on and on if I want to :) Anyway, yes I am a geek. YOU HEAR THAT ALL YOU EEJITS BACK IN 7th GRADE? I finally admit it now. I've read the books most of my life, I've loved the books most of my life, and I worship at the altar of Peter Jackson. Seeing the ROTK trailer was just an illuminating moment for me. December 17th just cannot come soon enough.  TCZ is crap. What else is new. Lots of problems there but nothing that won't sort itself out eventually. I just have to learn not to let it bother me as much as it usually does. Some good has come out of the recent troubles tho. I learned who my true friends are and I learned that a few people I considered friends, really aren't. I learned I can handle confrontation. I still don't like it, but I can deal with it. And I learned that no matter what you do, there will always be people in the world who dislike you for no real reason and to stop worrying about it when people do that.  So there are my lessons for the day: Vacation good. ROTK even better. TCZ crap.

      Right so... I think I finally got through to the bellydancer. I think she finally realised I'm not at fault and her own stupid business tactics failed her. Maybe she learned a valuable lesson from all of this too. Anyway she *says* she'll be sending me my final check whenever some greek church pays her for work she did on costumes for them. I seriously doubt I'll ever see that money. Kind of sucks really because I'm really down to my last few quarters. Good job tomorrow's payday.  Anyway, It's been a tight couple of months but I don't feel too horrible about it. I feel sort of hopefull and energised about a lot of things right now. I've been in tighter spots back when I was making half of what I make now. I just need to sit down and go through every one of my expenses and work out some kind of schedule. I make more than my bills now, yet somehow, somewhere I'm spending more than I should and I end with nothing.   Anyway I've got vacation coming up in a week so I'll sort it out then.  What else is going on... Oh not much. I've been spending quality time with Kiefer Sutherland *grin*. Well, not really but I have become addicted to his show '24'. I don't really watch a lot of primetime television - in fact I think the only show I watch religiously is 'Survivor'. But now I guess I have to add season three of '24' to my viewing schedule. A couple of weeks ago, I rented the first season DVDs, mainly because there was fuckall else to rent at the time, and I'd always heard it's an excellent show. But I missed the first few episodes of it when it debuted and I'd also always heard that if you do that, you're screwed for being able to follow the plot. So I didn't bother to watch any of it. Same thing happened during season 2. I'm all caught up now tho baby :) My god this is the best show I've ever seen. I simply love it.   After I became hooked on the show I started looking up Kiefer's bio because even tho I've been a fan of his from the day I saw him in Lost Boys (can you believe he was only 17 when he made that???? I can't.) I can't think of anything I've seen him in lately. Apparently '24' is his 'comeback' or whatever.  I didn't even realise he'd been off the radar. I just adore him :) Yes I've fallen into another one of my little obsessions with actors and I'm not happy about it. I get really preoccupied when I get hooked on one. Ahhhh well... This too shall pass. I haven't reached the point of wanting to create a website for him or the show yet :) hehehehe.  Anyway season three - October 28th - woohoo!

      Oh I curse the day I ever said I would do a site for a bellydancer. The woman is unreasonable! After monthly battles to get her to respond to my emails both asking for input and requesting that she pay her growing bill, I quit doing anything for her site. Why work on something I'm not getting paid for? When she finally did respond to me I was more than generous in offering to let her make whatever payments she could towards her bill. I got two small check from her and then I heard nothing from her for ages. I pretty much wrote her off. My emails to her were bouncing, no replies to my phone calls - nothing. I tried last week to email her one last time, and the email went through. And I got a response! However I told her that I would be resigning as her webmaster and that she needed to pay me the amount owed in full. Her response was a very snotty 'well I never could get the site to load' and 'I'm working 12 hour days for very little money' or 'I never got one response from the website'.  Well to those I said 'How come you never mentioned to me you were having site problems?' and 'Well I don't exactly live the life of the rich myself here in the mecca that is my midwestern town.' and 'The website has been live for about 4 months. You cannot seriously expect the money to roll in just because you have a website. You have to promote it, and you never did. I did all i could with search engine submission and attempts to reciprocal-link, but advertising is what you're meant to do. If you don't, of course no one's going to go to your site.' ARGH! Every flippin' email she sent me these past few days have been one long guilt trip and veiled insults at my work and my price for the work - which she agreed to the day we met for lunch. She didn't balk at my fee then when I was very up front about how much web startup was going to cost her, why is she balking now?? Grrrrrr.  I cut her a lot of slack because I knew she was trying to start up her own studio etc etc - I let her make payments on her bill, payments which were sporadic and small at best, I didn't charge her for half the stuff I'd done.  So this morning I fired off an email (something I really should not do just after waking up) and said as plainly and as nicely as I could that I did not appreciate the guilt complex she was laying on me but if she really wanted to have a pity competition, I would have no problem competing because my finances aren't exactly the greatest either. I told her I'd done everything I could possibly do with very little communication and input from her, and for far less than I would normally charge. But the headache of trying to get her to pay *anything* on her bill was just one headache I didn't need.   She asked for her HTML files 'because she deserves them after the great expense she went to to have me create them' and her pics back, but frankly, she can wait until I receive her final check.  In hindsight, I think the silly woman has absolutely no head for business. She should not have jumped into website development right as she was trying to begin building her studio up from scratch on very little money. She should have established herself first and ensured that her studio would be a success before hiring a professional designer to enhance her business with a website. I don't believe she timed it right and if this fiasco is indicative of the way she runs things, I doubt she will succeed in her venture. I think she was counting on the website to bring in money from the original costumes she creates and sells, and she expected the money from sales online to happen almost immediately. But, she did not have the funds for me to setup any sort of sales system where people could buy what they wanted from her online. All I could do was put together pictures of her stuff along with prices and hope people would be bothered enough to call her long distance and order something. She said she wanted to reach people in other states and even internationally. Well I hate to say it but there are a gazillion bellydance sites out there, some of them very professional, and that do allow people to buy online and I think if someone is going to shop online, they are going to want to do the entire transaction online because it's convenient. Someone in France is not going to want to make a long distance call to some woman in Lincoln, Nebraska and order a coin bra. Puh-lease.  Argh. I just had to vent. The woman pissed me off no end this weekend with her whiny, guilt-inducing emails. From now on I will: Not do websites for anyone just starting a business, Only work for established companies, and Make sure I have a contract next time. And I need a business partner to handle all the money crap. I hate squeezing people for money.

      *sigh*  The kid (I'm going to have to come upwith a new nick for her since she's not really a kid anymore :( ) went to her first real dance last night. She'd been to one before but it was right after school and I think all the parents were there. Last night was a city-wide junior high Halloween dance from 7-10pm. I had mixed feelings about letting her go though.   Originally this dance was supposed to be actually on Halloween, and would have been after school etc. which is why she spent some of her allowance on a splashy costume of Arwen from LOTR. She wanted so much to stand out and had been talking about this dance for weeks. Then Thursday she came into my office in tears because she found out that it had been moved up to the following night, and knowing my penchant for saying no to things she brings me on short notice, she didn't think I would let her go.  But how could I look at her, with tears in her eyes and say no? I'm such a pushover :) Of course I let her go.   We picked up her best friend, who chickened out of wearing a costume (I guess costumes were optional), and I dropped them off at the Senior High gym, sighed, and went home to wait until 10pm. Every time the phone rang I jumped in case it was the kid who wanted to come home early.. But it never was. So finally when I went to pick them up, I found them both beaming and excited. She had danced with a boy and what's more - she actually asked him! I was gobsmacked! I guess I had thought if anyone would have danced with a boy, it would have been her friend who's always been a bit more boy-crazy than my daughter has been. But apparently her friend was far too shy to even dance with the girls. Weird.  Anyway, my daughter danced with a boy and came home grinning ear to ear and had a lovely evening. Me, I think I've now got a grey hair or two..

      Well while I wait for someone to send me some content for my little project I guess I'll blog a little. I guess the big water cooler discussion right now is that poor Cubs fan who's allegedly blown his team's chances at going to the world series. I feel sorry for the guy. I mean, I can understand why people are upset, the Cubs haven't been in the Series for 58 years and it would have been sweet if they'd have made it. But they lost their game faces when this guy went for the foul ball and allowed the Marlins to get all those runs in. They should have put it out of their minds until the game was over. Yes it was a moment of stupidity, but tell me, if you were a huge fan of a particular team, and you were in the foul ball area of the stands and saw a ball coming towards you, wouldn't you reach for it too? Wouldn't you be caught up in the moment of having a chance to grab a little bit of a semi-historic game for yourself? Of course you would. I don't think this guy intended to deliberately sabotage his beloved team's game. it was an accident and people need to let it go.  Besides, in the footage I saw of the incident, there were quite a few other fans going for that ball too. None of them looked like they were backing off when they saw the Cub running to grab it. This poor guy just happened to get to it first. Now his phone's been disconnected, he's actually in fear for his life. What is wrong with that picture? I understand the passion fans feel for a game they love. I know what it's like to be caught up in something and of course you hate to see defeat - but come on, leave the poor guy alone. I'm sure none of the abuse he's endured from irate fans can compare to what he must feel.  I also think it was pretty shite of Florida to offer him 'asylum'. That's almost like taunting him. How rude.  Anyway that's my take on the Cubs incident. They played a good season but couldn't quite pull it out in the end. That's ok. Maybe next year they'll be back with a vengeance. Who knows. Yeesh, and I'm not even a baseball fan.

      So I'm still feeling stagnant. I shouldn't have written about it last night right before bed because that 'plain' feeling is sticking with me. And really, now I'm blaming my boss for thinking I have a wild life because now I have to live up to that *grin*.   I was driving into work this morning and thinking about what it would be like to do something different. I have vacation next week and I was thinking of spending it going out and doing a bit of photography. Fall is a beautiful time of the year - even in Nebby and I think it would be cool to go out and capture a bit of it. I can't use my good camera though as I don't have any film, so it'll have to be digital. I just want to be sure I don't spend my entire vacation locked up in the house watching Kiefer movies. Not necessarily a bad thing mind you :) I could watch him for hours. But I want to take advantage of the cooler weather and maybe nick my daughter's bike for a few rides, take some snaps and just try and get into life here.   Or maybe I should use the time to finally start writing something substantial for a change. It's been a dream of mine to write a book and become published but my problem is I can't think of a good story to tell. I can't even decide on a genre. I have a million beginnings of stories, but not real content. Maybe now's the time to pick one and see where it leads.  I don't know.. I write that a lot. I don't know. Well, I really don't know. I'm sure I'll end up just doing whatever I feel like doing, but I don't know if it will help me come to terms with having to stay here in Nebraska for the next six years. "Why don't you move then?" I hear you say... Well for a variety of reasons. The main one being the fact that my daughter is settled and happy and absolutely flourishing in junior high here. She's surrounded by her friends whom she's known all her life. I never had that feeling growing up because we moved so much. I used to think she would benefit from moving to different places as she grew up because I felt that's what gave me my love for travelling.  But then again I'm such an introverted, quiet person - not outgoing at all and I wonder if having to make new friends whenever we moved has anything to do with that.  Anyway, I also can't move because my grandparents are the only close family she and I have left apart from my sister. But Kelly's young and lives in Cali whereas the G's are getting up there in years and who knows how long we'll have them in our lives. I can't deny them or my daughter the chance to be close to each other right now.  So there are two very good reasons for staying here, at least for now. So I will continue to lose myself in the movies as a way to pass the time. I will watch my daughter grow up to be confident and sure of herself - smart and independent and beautiful... And then I will probably get the hell out of Dodge and who knows, maybe by then I'll be published, doing book tours and interviews and hanging out with my idols.  For now though, I'd better get back to work... Oh and totally off-topic but I've added a link to my good friend Corey's spanky new blog I built for him so check it out. And I've discovered someone I don't even know has me linked on their blog - pretty nifty :)

      I was in a meeting the other day with both bosses and the rest of the department and one of the bosses said we should start the meeting with a little icebreaker. I thought to myself, 'Whatever...' We're a small department, we all know each other, there's no ice to break, but ok. Anyway, he says we should tell one thing about ourselves that was false, and one thing about us that's true.   It's so much easier to think up the false stuff :)  So my turn comes around and I say my two things and my Big Boss turns to me and says "You've had such a wild life, I'm not sure what to believe." To this day her comment stuck with me. Have I had a wild life? I never thought my life was particularly outrageous. I've done some stupid things. Done some cool things. Bad things have happened to me, but so have some good. I think I did have a bit of a wild and crazy youth - where I did a LOT of stupid things. But I had fun.  I don't know... It just seems like my life right now is plain. That's a good word for it. Plain. This is dangerous for me, when I start to realize my life is plain. This is when I decide to up sticks and move half-way around the world. Maybe I should just rearrange my furniture and call it good because I can't afford to move away from my life right now.  The other day I told someone I was pretty much resigned to remaining in Nebraska, at least until my daughter graduates from high school, which is a good six years from now. I was actually starting to feel settled here, if not content. Now the thought of staying here for six years seems like a jail sentence. I can't make anything exciting happen here. I've given up trying and convinced myself that it's not so bad. And truly, it's NOT as bad as I sometimes make it out to be. I like my job, my coworkers, for the most part, are friendly and fun...   Ohhh man. I didn't mean for this to be a moaning blog. I was actually just thinking about the things I've done or seen that makes people think I have a wild life. I guess maybe my definition of a wild life is a bit different from other people's.

      Ok so I'm becoming more and more impressed with Blogger's capabilities. Now I can have titles. Nifty :) Problem is I can't think of a title first before the blog - usually. Oh well, minor inconvenience.   So I'm getting sucked further and further into my fixation on Kiefer Sutherland. *sigh* I don't know what my damn problem is. Maybe it's just hormones. I blame the internet mostly. Before I got online, I'd see a flick and think 'oh yeah, he's hot.' and that would be the end of it. Maybe I'd have a sex dream or two involving said actor deciding he couldn't live without me *grin* and well, that would pretty much be the end of it. These days, I have far too much access to archived interviews, trailers, movie updates, interviews other obsessed fans made of when they appeared on Leno and dumped online to feed my craving. I waste ages trying to delve a little bit into what makes these guys tick.  Believe me I feel incredibly silly talking about this. I don't like to let people see how weird I am but I've got a blog and I'm gonna use it. I want this to be a no-holds-barred journal so there you go. I... am a weirdo. Anyway, getting back to Kiefer... I can't sum him up. I, of course, don't know him as a person and never will really, all I know about him is his work and the articles I've read. No way does that give me any true insight to what he, or any other celeb is like as a plain old human being. So I think a lot of my attraction to him is based on the parts he's played. Same with the other 2 or 3 actors I get like this about. I like stories about tortured individuals involved in some kind of struggle - mental or physical. Kiefer happens to play a lot of those. I find it fascinating that in one film he can exude pure evil like in Eye for an Eye where he plays a rapist and in another film play an abused young man who's so traumatised that he can't speak as in 'Trapped in Silence'. Amazing. Maybe I simply admire the talent. Maybe I'm just letting my inner teenie out for a stroll. It's hard to say.  I'm sitting here writing this, feeling like such a dweeb and yet also feeling like I have to explain why I'm a dweeb.  Actually I've been wondering who the next little obsession was going to be. That's how it works you see, I get hooked on one from seeing a film and then stupid me gets online and starts reading about the actor, or at least about the film that got me hooked and it just snowballs from there. With Kiefer it was a little different as I'd actually been a fan of his since Lost Boys. In fact, I can remember when that came out because my friends and I were so chuffed that it was filmed in nearby Santa Cruz. Half of the opening scenes were like seeing my home on the big screen :) Anyway at the time I was big on vampires and into Anne Rice goth-y stuff, so naturally I was completely *phwoar* over Kiefer's vampire. He was very yum.   So now that he's on 24, I find myself back into Kiefer-dom. It's not a bad place to be really :)  Right so.. Summing up, I am really just a hormonal teenager with the hots for some actor.  I am just a heartbeat away from creating a fansite, and I have Jack Bauer as my desktop theme. *sigh*

      That would be the 'UK guy' from my last entry. I'm thoroughly enjoying his 24 blog. Only 6 freaking days until Season three! I have mixed emotions about it really. I'm really looking forward to it, however when it's on that means my vacation is over and I'm having a nice holiday atm.  I was starting to get a little bored actually, but last night I popped in one of my 24 DVDs and discovered that it's kind of fun to make screencaps and capture little moments that you might miss in a film when you're just watching it. Takes bloody ages though, but I decided to start a collection of caps, starting, of course, with every Kiefer DVD I can get my hands on. Eventually I hope to include caps from a lot of great films.   Anyway,  urlLink it's here  if anyone's interested. It's just Kiefer for now. A bunch of 24 caps and about 6 other movies of his (including 'Beat' James - however I think Kiefer gets off moreso with the lads than he does with Ms. Love :) ).   So apart from doing some capping, I did a little bit of shopping today. I shouldn't have really, but I think it's actually been over a year since I bought myself some new clothes. I'm such a fashion plate :D Anyway I found a gorgeous jumper and probably the most comfy pair of jeans ever and I feel really good. Best thing was they were on sale as well so that's good.  Shit it's after midnight... I told myself I'd quit staying up late just because I'm on holiday because I still have to get up at stupid o'clock to get the kidlet up and ready for school. And I am unable to go back to sleep when I return from dropping her off which kind of sucks.

      I'm on vacation right now. Second day into it and I'm bored out of my skull. My eyeballs hurt from watching too many Kiefer movies, my house is spotless, and I'm nearly out of gas in the car. I don't think I'm used to entertaining myself all day every day. Without a clear purpose to the day, I'm a little bit lost. I used to think I'd be in heaven if I didn't have to do the nine-to-five thing every day and could devote my days to pretty much anything I wanted. Now I'm not so sure.  Maybe it's the time of day, maybe I'm just overly tired. I haven't had any coffee yet, maybe that's it. I think somewhere earlier in this blog I said I'd give writing a shot again. I did start to form a hazy storline in my head earlier... Maybe I should get cracking on that. I've got six more days of uninterrupted time... Not that I could knock out a novel in six days, but I could at least teach myself how to develop a story beyond just a vague story arc. Hmmm... Well the kid's due home soon so maybe I should make that my agenda tomorrow.  Anyway, I just discovered some UK guy's blog about the show '24' so I'm going to go read that for a while :)

      Have you ever been asked, or thought about what it would be like to have a chance for a chat with your younger self? What would you say to yourself - assuming you're now older and allegedly wiser. Would you try and pass on any of that wisdom? Would you try to prevent yourself from making certain mistakes? Give a warning of some kind?  Forgetting about all of that time paradox crap and just thinking about a couple of things I would tell myself... I would tell my stupid ass to go to college - though if I had done that I might not have my daughter today... Oh wait that's a time paradox. Okay, I would go back and tell myself that having good friends is a wonderful thing, but family is just as important so quit dicking around. I might tell myself to lighten up a little. That my parents did understand me more than I thought they did.  Here's how I think the convo might go:  "Hey Steph."  Gobsmacked silence at being confronted with an older version of myself.  "When did I stop wearing black all the time?"  "When you realised that being goth wasn't a lifestyle, it was just a phase."  "Oh. Do we still like decent music?"  "Oh that never changes. But your tastes do broaden."  "Oh dear."  "Listen I can't stick around. I just wanted to do this:"  *thwap*  "Ow!"  And there you have it. I'd give myself a good thwap and be on my way. How very Hitchhiker's :)

      This blog is dangerously close to becoming a 24 Blog. Sorry about that. But DAMN I love this show. An amusing story tho - my sister who's in town for a week wanted to watch an episode of it to see if she'd like it. This is a girl who worked a late shift at Pebble, then dragged her ass out of bed at 5am to catch a plane, flying over 6 hours to get here, and sit in my car for another three. To say she was knackered is an understatement. Anyway I popped in the first episode of season 2 after filling her in a bit of what happened in the first season.  We ended up watching five shows last night. She is hooked! Chalk another 24 fan up to the tally - woohoo!  Heheh... Tonight she has asked me to rent West Wing to see if I like that show. Admittedly I've never seen it. I know it's touted as one of the best shows on telly, but well, I just never watched it. So I will give it a go tonight, provided we can find it for rent.  Well I just called all of our video shops and no joy. Then I decided to get smart and I looked it up online. It's not even released yet. So, oh darn, Kelly will just have to continue watching 24 :)

      The first thought in my head when I woke up this morning was, '24! Tonight!' I'm so feckin' excited. I could just kick myself for not getting in on this show from the first episode but thank Elvis for DVD releases. I am absolutely dying to see how Kiefer Sutherland handles the crazy loop the writers throw at him this time around. I couldn't help but read some of the spoilers for Season Three. Sometimes people forget to warn you they're going to talk about them, so I know why Kiefer's character's so out of sorts (to put it mildly) at the beginning of the first episode. Well, at least I think I know. The writers and creators are notorious for throwing out misinformation :)  Either way I can't wait to get back into Jack's crazy life.  And you know I've been reading a lot about the wacky situations the writers kept putting Kim, Jack Bauer's daughter in and how fans of the show were getting fed up with it. I can see that... But I'm glad they're giving her some kind of responsibility in season three because I think she's a necessary catalyst for Kiefer's character, Jack. The one thing Jack cares about most is his daughter. As far as we know, Kim's all Jack has left and I just think that adds a great dimensionality to the character. Jack could be in the middle of running down dangerous terrorists but the first question he asks a CTU agent is how his daughter is doing. And Kiefer just pulls off that fine line between a real hardass tought guy but really actually has feelings so well.  Ahhh all this waiting for 8pm is killing me. It's only 10.45 am right now. Tick tock tick tock.. Tap the fingers... La la la I'm bored.

      Well it's not really a grind. I like my job. It's just difficult to muster enthusiasm for being here after being away from it for a week. I had 114 messages in my inbox which was not as many as I thought and most of them were just my CNN and Google news alerts. Nobody needed me while I was gone :(  Kelly's coming back to GI for a few days this week. I can't wait to see her. I can wait to haul her ass to Omahahaha back and forth a few times while she's here, but what are sisters for I guess. But other than that it will be good to talk to her again face to face. I've got a lot on my mind right now I'd like to bounce off her.  I guess lately I've been pondering what I want to do and where to go in my life. I think I'd said I had resigned myself to staying in Nebraska at least until my daughter graduates from high school. Now I'm not so sure I can or want to do that. I'm having a real problem in justifying my decisions. I cannot see a very bright future for me here in Nebraska, I hate living here, and staying will mean working in a job I love but for 1 tenth the pay I should be getting. This hospital's never going to raise my pay to the level it should be at, they're too cheap. And I can't stand - I literally feel physically ill at the thought of living paycheck to paycheck like I do for the next 6 years.   The problem is that there is just no opportunity for me here. All Web jobs in this town are basically the same as what I have now. Low pay. I want to go back to school and add another field to my resume. I want to work for the film industry in some capacity. That's been my dream for as long as I can remember. It feels silly to say it out loud - in a manner of speaking and I've never told anyone about it. I never thought I'd ever get to anyway so it was just some little pipe dream tucked away in my mind. But since I've been feeling this need to move away from here and try to further my career, I'm starting to think that maybe it's not an impossible dream. But if I want to do anything about it, I can't stay here. And that means making some big decisions. I need to get over my guilt at taking my daughter away from her grandparents - I need to be up front with her about what I'm thinking about doing so she's not blindsided if I do happen to move. I need to begin actively looking for work elsewhere and not settle for the first thing that comes along. It has to be right, to allow me to save so I can go back to school without having to take out loans.  Anyway these are the things floating around in my mind right now. Who knows, I may not act on any of it. I'm not very good about motivating myself. I talk myself down from grandiose plans all the time. But then I think, if I don't at least try to make things work for the better, then I will be in a rut until I die. My daughter will probably fall into the same traps. I have to sacrifice and take a plunge now and then if I want to get what I want and be happy. Yep.

      Packed off the sister the day before yesterday. Yes we managed to watch the entire run of season 2 of 24. She just got sucked in, much like I did. Chalk up another fan :) Was sad to say goodbye to her though. We had a really great visit, I thought. Usually after about 4 or 5 days of being around each other we start to fight, as sisters often do. Kelly's probably the only person in the world who can really piss me off. I have a slow temper but when it's up, it's pretty bad. But it was different this time. Somehow I think we were both glad to see each other and catch up with everything, and show off stuff, introduce each other to new things (yes I think West Wing's pretty damn good too) - that sort of thing. I didn't even mind all the driving.  I'm still seriously thinking of finding a way to move out to Cali. I've been checking out Monster.com daily looking for work and for ways to beef up my resume. I think it's pretty light right now but I threw it together on the fly. I want to move right now and this is dangerous for me because I am subject to following whims which usually gets me into trouble. So I want to do this move the right way this time. I want a job first and a way to carry out the move, a place to live, fair warning to the grandparents and my current job and all that good stuff. I am going to do it right this time which means I have to take it slow and realise it's not going to happen within the next couple of months - as much as I would like it too. I want to get the fuck out of here so badly. Today was a horrible bout of scrambling to come up with money to cover the bills and it involved much begging of the phone and utilities company, and a lot of tears, followed by a dangerous glimpse of mounting self-pity (why me? I'm sick of living like this blah blah blah) which I'd really like to avoid. What I need to do is not let myself begin to wallow in the whole 'I'll never get things to change so I give up' shite and actually do something about it.  I mean really, I don't make a bad living, I don't have horrendous credit card debt like most folk. Just student loans. Argh student loans. Anyway, the problem lies in that I have more bills than I do income. I work 40+ hours a week and am looking into getting a second job, which means I'll rarely get to see my daughter and spend time with her, which will have a negative impact on her because the last time I worked 2 jobs and was gone all the time, her grades slipped, she withdrew into her own little world... Right now she's doing so well... *sigh* I need a work-from-home kind of (legit) job so I can at least *be* there for her.  Anyway I'm going to stop rambling on. My mind's going about a zillion miles an hour though. Might write more later.

      Whoever searched on areolas free pics - weirdo. Now the real question is why did my blog turn up in a search for areola free breast pics. I can't think of the last time I said the word 'areola' much less blogged about it. Weird.    Just had to get that out :) So it's 24 night tonight (*groan* she's not going to yak about 24 again is she?). No I'm not going to yak about it here because I've created a whole new blog for it and it can be found at  urlLink 24addict.com  (Thanks Ratty!) as soon as my new domain name propagates through the net :) I couldn't believe that domain was available.  Anyway all gushing/speculating about 24 will take place there and spare all 2 of my readers here further grief because I just know they're dying to find out how depressed I am about my finances instead :D  Actually I've decided not to be depressed about my finances.  I'm so bloody sick of stressing over money and how I'm going to juggle the bills. Last week scared the hell out of me and now I'm more determined than ever to find a way to get out of Nebraska. I'm so serious about doing it that I'm considering actually letting the grandparents in on it. Once I say it out loud to them, I have to go through with it.   I said I was thinking about it... I don't know if I'm ready to tell them yet though. But I don't want to spring it on them either. Maybe it's best to ease them into it and get them used to it. After all, it's not like I'm leaving in a month. I don't foresee me working this out until next year sometime (and I mean towards the end of next year. The kid will probably at least be able to finish 8th grade here in Nebby.) I don't want to rush this, because I have to do this in such a way as to ensure success. I don't want it to be England all over again.  After i graduated from college I was in such a fever to get the hell out of Nebraska and had an overwhelming desire to be in England that I sold everything I owned and the kidlet and I moved over there on a student visa. While I had a wonderful time over there and miss it terribly, I didn't really make much of myself there. I worked in a pub, we lived at the pub aswell - it just wasn't condusive to having a child really. So when my visa expired, I stayed a bit longer, then got paranoid about being there illegally, compounded with a tyrannical boss, and we were home by Christmas. When I got back, I was no better off than when I left. A fact that my mother pointed out to me whenever she was mad at me.  So now I've got the fever to get out, but I've also learned my lesson about acting on a whim. But this time I've got several years experience in my professional life, and I'm going to do this the right way. I've already said that but you know sometimes you just need to reinforce it. Especially when life's getting you down and all you can think of is escape. I think that's why I'm so terribly besotted with kiefer Sutherland and 24 right now. Because I'm needing some bigtime escapism and hey it's much nicer to shut my brain down by watching Jack as opposed to downing a fifth you know? So to everyone of my friends who laugh at me for my little 24 obsession - *phhhhbts* bite me :)

      Well, it's actually Sunday morning but I wrote in here last night and fuck me if I didn't lose the whole damn thing. Argh.  Well it was mainly just me rambling on about 24 and Kiefer again. I know I keep doing that, but I can't help it. I freaking love this show and I want more people to get sucked into Jack's world. It's such an addictive, well-crafted, well-written show and every character has so many layers to them it's incredible. And I can definitely say it holds up to multiple viewings. Even though I know what happens and the surprise element is gone, I'm finding I am picking up the subtleties now - things I wouldn't have known to look for the first time around. Anyway, I can't say enough good things about 24 and if you haven't seen it, see it. Right now. Drop what you're doing and go rent the DVDs.  As for Kiefer himself, well every film I catch him in shows me how underrated this man is. My favourite film of the moment is called 'Dead Heat' in which he plays Pally Lamarr, a young cop forced into retirement because of a heart condition. It also stars Anthony Lapaglia and Radha Mitchell. Pally's brother (Lapaglia) convinces him to get in on a dodgy scheme involving a horse and a jockey who's in deep to the mob. What follows is a chance to see Kiefer in a wonderful comdic performance  - a rare thing and something I'd love to see more of. He and Lapaglia act off of each other as if they really were brothers - it's great :) this is a brilliant little film.  Anyway, I'll quit gushing for now. Expect more later :) Right now I'm thinking I'm going to go back to bed. It's far too early on a Sunday to be awake.

      'Tis the weekend, snow is finally predicted (3-5 inches), which is perfect weather to snuggle up with a good book/movie with a cuppa and just chill.  Next week is Thanksgiving for us Yanks, though I don't think my family, such as it is, is doing anything for it. And I'm not cooking a turkey with all the goo just for me and the kid. She doesn't like turkey anyway and always spent t-giving picking the marshmallows off the sweet potatoes and biding her time until pumpkin pie time. Me, I devour all of the sweet pickles and black olives so that I'm too full for turkey. Sweet pickles and olives are a sort of family tradition and it's about the only time I eat either of those things, though I do love them.  Anyway, I'm just not feeling festive this year at all. Christmas - bah. Not humbug, just bah. Seems like such a hassle, and frankly if I didn't have to make it special for the kid, I wouldn't bother with it. But she does love the traditions I've tried to keep up with over the years. Christmas has been hard for me ever since my father died. He went on December 21, 1992. I think that was the worst xmas of my life.   I used to love it though. My family did a lot of little things every year that made it such fun. We'd decorate for it the day after Thanksgiving, My mom gave my sister and me a special ornament that represented something cool that had happened during the year... My sister and I would speculate on the presents.. Dad would take us shopping to buy mom's annual presents of Red perfume and the new edition of Writers Market. Then on xmas eve we'd bother the hell out of dad by asking over and over if we could just open one present before bed. He always said no. When we were younger we'd do the cookies for santa thing. Then we'd lay awake all night doing some more speculating and resisting the urge to go and peek. When we woke the 'rents up at the crack of dawn, we'd ohhh and ahhh at the 'Santa' gifts, and then Mom would have doughnuts or make french toast or something adn we'd settle in for a whole morning of slow present opening. We always doled them out, then took turns opening so that we could watch reactions. It took forever but it was so much fun.  I miss that.

      We nearly made it through the semester without getting sick. My daughter had a simple goal this semester, and that was to have perfect attendance. I believe her ulterior motive for it is some kind of party for the kids who have perfect attendance. Ah well, we've blown it with a lovely chest cold. I hope I'm not next getting it.  So yeah I am staying home today to look after her. I know that she's capable of staying home by herself - we did it all last summer. But it's just different when the kid is sick you know? She needs her mommy :) I should keep it short. She's waking up now and I can hear the poor thing hacking up a lung.

      I have to shut down my movie site :( My friend who's hosting it is giving up his server thingie which means I either need to move thepictureshow.org or stop it altogether. I decided to just stop doing it. Maybe I can pick it up another time but right now I don't have the energy to deal with moving the whole thing. Nor do I have the time to maintain it. Besides, I can't compete with most other movie news/review sites out there. I gave it a year to take off and it did to some extent, but I didn't manage to accomplish everything I wanted to accomplish on it. Ah well, valiant effort and I will save everything in case I ever want to start it back up someday. We'll see.  In other news, 24addict.com is flourishing all on its own. I seem to be finding myself linked all over the place on other fan sites which I think is uber-cool. Also found myself linked at the BBC as well which was pretty cool too. So hmmmm.. building a fansite for a popular tv show = lots of hits. Who knew? :)  What else is happening... Oh yeah, I'm still dirt poor. But I won't dwell on that. I haven't decorated for xmas yet. I actually kind of forgot about it until this morning when I began seeing everyone's lights up. Usually the kid and I decorate the day after Thanksgiving but I had to work it this year. So maybe we'll get that done this weekend. I still don't feel very festive but maybe the lights and ornaments will help.  ROTK premieres in 15 days. Of course I'm excited, but for some weird reason I don't feel the overwhelming excitement for it I felt last year. I wonder why that is. I'm even considering waiting to go a day or two after it opens so we don't have to wait in huge queues. We'll see, I may feel differently the day before it opens :) I really am excited to see the big finale. From all accounts it actually lives up to the hype. Even the most jaded reviewers seem to be over the moon about it. Definitely bringing kleenex though.  Anyway off for now. Lots to do.

      And I can't think of a decent title for this entry. Oh well.   TPS goes off the Net on Sunday. *sniffle* I had a lot of fun with that site. But I've got plenty of other things to keep me busy so I'm not gutted or anything. I said earlier here that I can't compete with the big boys when it comes to movie news. And that's okay.  So what else is going on... Hey - still poor! Woohoo! Although I was recently invited to speak in front of my freelance site members and give them the basics of how to log on to their own websit/forums and for that I got a nice chunk of change. It's all gone now though. Fecking bills. I've been spending inordinate amounts of time at home screencapping Kiefer films. How... sad. Why on earth am I doing that? I can't answer that. I'll try, but I'll fail to explain the reasoning behind it. I discovered the joys of sccreencapping when LOTR came out and I realised there were a lot of fans wanting to capture their favourite moments of a certain actor or moment in a film. So there's the 'I can provide something the fans will like' factor. As I started doing it, I discovered I was pretty good at it. Not that it takes any kind of skill, just the right equipment and a working knowledge of photo tweaking in case the scene you want is a bit blurry or dark.   Then I stopped doing it for whatever reason. Along comes 24 to provide some much-needed escapism during a rough patch in my life, and the talent and gorgeousness that is Kiefer just lends himself to screencapping. I find that I actually enjoy the tediousness of looking at a film frame-by-frame and capturing a look, clarifying some background set piece or picture, igniting the loins of the multitudes of Kieferettes out there (myself included) who demand beautiful pictures of him - it's a bit of a rush really. I like all the editing - no, I love it. I love to capture an image and stick it into my software and make it better. I love to take sound files and mix them, edit them and make them available for the drooling masses (and yes I count myself among them.) And in the process I can forget my troubles for a few hours every night. It's a win-win really.  Anyway I told you I'd fail to explain it properly and I still probably come off as quite sad for doing it. I don't care much though. It's a hobby, a weird one, but a hobby nonetheless and it keeps me off the streets :)  Ugh I put far too much Smiths on my Winamp. So depressing.Ah -  Falco, Rock Me Amadeus in German. Much better. Very peppy :) Anyway I'm not getting much work done right now so I'd better snap to it.

      Having said in an earlier post that I didn't feel the same overwhelming excitement to go see ROTK on opening day as I have for the last two films and that I would probably wait a day or two before going to see it, I completely negated that statement by going to the midnight premiere with my daughter. Turns out that on the Tuesday before it opened, I caught a whiff of that excitement and made a total last minute decision to go. I am so glad I did. It was worth feeling like a zombie the next day because I didn't go to sleep when we came home. I knew if I did, I'd never get up for work and I couldn't miss a day so close to xmas. So I just drank coffee and flitted about online.  Anyway, neither I nor my daughter felt tired or restless during the 3 and a half hour film because we were mesmerised from the very opening image. This was, for me, a culmination or anticipation, excitement and complete faith that Peter Jackson would make it exactly right for devoted fans. Did he ever. I've never followed the journey of a film as much as I have this trilogy. I've never delved into the filmmaking process as much as I have with this either thanks in large part to the bountiful extras included on all of the DVDs. I feel in some small way, a part of these films and they'll always be a part of my life just as the books are.  I knew I would cry during ROTK, I just didn't know what elements would do that to me. Well I sobbed like a girl pretty much through the entire last hour of the film. The majesty of the moments, the emotional courage and strength shown by even the smallest of people. It was simply incredible and such a joy to be in some small way a part of this magnificent undertaking. We've been to see it twice now, and I'm sure we'll go at least a couple more times after the crowds die down. I was taken out of the moment now and again by some absolutely horrible wanker teenyboppers sitting behind us who thought this was a Rocky Horror event and proceeded to crack jokes between dialogue. It was the first time in my life I've ever been angry enough to turn around and hiss, 'Shut the FUCK up!' at someone in a cinema and I think I scared them. I got an apology anyway. So please, if you're in a cinema seeing a film, just watch the fecking movie and save any snide/rude comments for after it's over. Don't talk during it. Turn your damn mobile phone off, most of all, don't sit behind me if you're prone to any of the above. I'll kick your ass. :)  Anyway, I've already seen the nitpick threads appear in a few forums online, mostly written by anal bookpurists. Argh. I can't understand how one cannot simply let go of the purist in themselves and just enjoy the spectacle of accomplishment that's been done with turning those wonderful, but somewhat convoluted, full of a million different characters, and thousands of pages long books. I always say to one particular purist I know, 'When you're a filmmaker, you go right ahead and turn those books into films yourself and see if you can do it better. Oh and be sure to have a film studio breathing down your neck whinging about the length of your true-to-the-book films, the money you're spending, execs who want to add completely irrelevant plotlines to hook that coveted 18-25 year old male demographic, etc etc.. Until then you do all of that, shut the fuck up and enjoy it already, sheesh.'  I've mentioned before I love the books. I've read them over and over for years and years. But I don't understand why it's so hard for some book fans to comprehend the monumental tasks involved in turning something like Tolkien's work into films. Why the hell hasn't it been attempted before now? Because it's fucking hard, that's why. Why is it so hard for the purists to grasp that single, simple factor? Sure we've all got favourite bits in the books we would have liked to see brought to life. But at the end of the day, everything that did make it into the film was so grand, and so wonderful, that that is enough for me. I would have liked to see Eowyn and Faramir fall in love too, but hey, it's a separate plotline that would have made the film even longer than it already is. We got a glimpse of it anyway during the crowning sequence. Let go your anal ways you wacky purist types.   Well I dunno why I went into a rant there. I guess because it just irks me that people would rather rip something wonderful apart than actually sit back and think, 'Hey you know? That was a pretty cool film.' Why would anyone want to spend their lives looking at the negative stuff? How... sad.

      I've been a bad blogger. I know. But I don't feel guilty because frankly, no one reads this anyway so who the hell cares :)  So it's a new year. New start, resolution time and all that. Blah. I've never been one to do the resolution thang because I know me and I'll never keep up with them. So why put myself through the stress? I'm all about eliminating stress. I've been doing well at not sweating the small stuff and having a more laid-back at-the-end-of-the-day-who-cares kind of attitude. Things that used to bother me, I mean really get under my skin really haven't been an issue lately. And this wasn't a conscious decision either. It just started happening. Weird eh? maybe that happens when you get old. I don't know.  Anyway, we finally ended up seeing ROTk five times in the cinema and I'm afraid that's about all my bank account can handle. I'd love to go more because there's nothing like seeing it on the big screen. But I'll have to be content with a crappy downloaded copy.   Ohhh the download debate. Everytime I see Sean Astin on telly telling me not to download pirate copies I feel a twinge of guilt. But here is my justification and you can buy it or not buy it, I really don't care:  As I said I spent a lot of ching (ching I really shouldn't have spent btw) going with my daughter to see my beloved movie in the cinema five times. I think we did 6 or 7 times in the cinema for Two Towers and again several times for Fellowship. I bought the theatrical DVDs, and then I turned around and bought the extendeds. I've bought merchandise. I own a beautiful handmade map of Middle Earth. I own Sting and the One Ring and the Evenstar necklace. My daughter saved up her allowance to buy Arwen's dress so she could go as an elf for Halloween to her first real school dance. I will buy Return of the King Theatrical and Extended DVDs. All told, I've spent hundreds of dollars lining the pockets of New Line cast and crew for these films so I don't think I should be begrudged an opportunity to download a crappy cam version of the film so I can appease my greedy nature that wants to be able to see my cherished film even after it's out of the theatre. I have no patience whatsoever and I hate waiting months on end for the DVDs. I don't make copies and sell it. It's just for private viewing.  So Sean, I'm sorry. I know you care about the script girls and the security guards and all the other 'little folk' affected by 'piracy' but really... I don't think anyone involved with Lord of the Rings is hurting ;)

      I love Google's little logos they occasionally use on their main search page. They always bring a smile. Over xmas, I think they did a snowman theme for a few days that was amusing. I've seen them do special ones for holidays and today's is kind of fun with the Mars theme.  Anyway, I think they're fun. Even though Google turned me down for a job. Ah well.  I don't feel like writing much right now. I hate money. I hate Nebraska. I hate student loans. I hate death. I hate my bank. I hate check-cashing shops. I hate far too many things right now.

      Well that last entry was a bit of a downer eh? Ah well, it was my mood at the time. Money sucks unless you've got some. but I'm feeling more upbeat today so I won't be whinging. Much. Except maybe about my gran who I'm none too pleased with atm.  Nah, I can't even be bothere dot moan about her. 24's back on tonight after a 2 week break and I'm dying to see what happens next. In my other blog I was going on about how FOX is horrible about using spoilersin their ads and I've managed to inadvertently find out key plot points before an episode has aired. Well that pisses me off. So in the little hiatus the show's been on I've been attempting to remain spoiler-free. Mostly by just not watching FOX which isn't really that hard to do given the plethora of shite reality crap they churn out. But I've also had to studiously avoid 24 forum spoiler threads and avert my eyes when some eejit gives something away in a non-spoiler thread.  I guess I'm just one of those types that prefers to be surprised. I refuse to give spoilers away myself to people who ask me 'what happens next?' (as KathrynAnn knows only too well.) I like to just go along for the ride.  Anyway, time to fix dinner (read: I can't think of anything else to write about.)

      Recently, my daughter and I were messing around with the soundboards over at  urlLink ebaumsworld , one of which has a bunch of Simpsons wav files. We were particularly fond of Homer saying, "Mmmm...feet." in that covetous manner he has. So now that phrase has become a bit of an injoke between us and we'll hit each other with it at the oddest moments. Good fun.  So I'm at my department meeting yesterday with my boss and other coworkers and you know how you tend to bullshit for a little while? Well we do that a lot and we got to talking about that German guy convicted of cannibalism (can you see where I'm going with this?) and how he'd advertised on the Net for someone willing to be his victim.  Well... I am not the best at thinking before I speak and before I could stop myself, I said, "Mmmm...feet." just as everyone was looking properly grossed out and horrified at mere thought of human consumption.  Well, I thought it was funny but no one else laughed. I never got a chance to explain why I said 'Mmm...feet' just then either. I realised after that it was totally one of those 'you had to be there' moments. Ah well. We're all supposed to go out for dinner tomorrow night too. I hope they aren't worried about what I'll order :)

      My local Fox affiliate ran an editorial piece the other day during a commercial break that irritated the hell out of me. They had some suit get in front of the camera and ask me to write my senators asking them to support the broadcast decency bill that's making its way through congress right now in the wake of Janet Jackson's boob-popping incident. They also wanted me to tell my senators to give the power back to local stations to decide which programs are suitable for family viewing.  Frankly, I believe I'm quite old enough to decide on my own what I or my daughter should or should not watch and I'm appalled that the gall the local stations have to want to step in and make those decisions for me. Fuck them. You hear that Fox guy in Kearney Nebraska? F-U-C-K you. I will NOT be asking my senator to support this bill, I will instead be asking them to oppose it. I know it won't do any good because I'm a liberal lost in a sea of extreme conservatives.  *sigh*

      So I'm thinking I need to take a class or something and learn how to fix my own car. Last week my alternator belt broke so I took it to the dealership to have this simple little thing fixed. I can afford the cost of it, no big. A couple of days after I get my car back I notice my turn signals aren't working so I whinge a little bit about it at work and one of my cowrokers tells me it could just be a fuse that shorted out. I go through my handbook for the car and find out where the proper fuses are only to find that the fuses are fine. So I decide I'm going to have to take the car back to the dealer, and see what's going on. I get caught up in meetings and am not able to get the car in until today. Oh and over the weekend I discover that not only are my turn signals out, so are my brake lights, tail lights and cruise control. And of course dealership repairshop is not open on weekends and I can't take it anywhere else in case the problem was something the dealership caused when they put the new belt on.  They call me not 20 minutes after I drop off the car to tell me it's a switch that shorted out in the steering column and that the cost to repair it will be $220 for parts and labour. 220 fucking dollars to fix a shorted out switch. They told me it's just a coincidence that it blew after they had my car as they didn't perform any work on the steering column.   I don't know whether to believe them or not because I don't know any better. It occurred to me to ask them if perhaps in the course of working on the alternator whether it was a possibility for the alternator to surge with electricity and maybe cause the switch to short out. He put me on hold to go ask the mechanic if that could happen and of course the mechanic said no. But he probably figures I wouldn't know any better so he could tell me anything and I'd still have to pay. I don't want to feel like that next time I have to deal with the fucking mechanics.   What I really want to do is learn about all of this, then next time I have a repair I want to play dumb and catch them lying to me. I would simply adore seeing the look on their face when I catch them out. It would be like the time when I worked in the pub in Engerland and the french staff were talking about the rest of us in french, blissfully unaware that I understood every word they said. Ahhh that was sweet.  of course it's entirely possible that the dealership is very honest and that everything they've told me is the absolute truth. My point is that I just don't know if I'm being suckered or not because I'm fairly ignorant when it comes to car repair. I feel like I've been ripped off, but I just don't know.  My kingdom for public transportation in this deadend town.

      Forgive any typos in this entry. I seem to have sliced a good bit of my finger tonight. I was picking up the butcher's knife to cut up some asparagus and it slipped and somehow as it fell, it managed to wedge itself nice and deep into my finger before dropping to the floor.  I'm such a weenie. But I've got some New Skin on it, which hurt like a bitch putting on, and the bleeding has stopped. Alas, my already deplorable typing skills have slipped even further because I'm afraid to bend my finger.  Other than that my week has improved. I forgave my daughter for forgetting my birthday and we spent today driving around town while I took photos of her in different parts of town. I have several of them up in my photo albums, in her directory, but here's one of them:     That was taken in one of the alleys downtown. There's a set of steps in one of them that go up to nowhere, so I thought she'd look cool atop them.  Anyway, I'm going to go watch a video. Gnighty.

      I think today was the crappiest birthday I've ever had. And I think it's my own fault really. Apart from just about everyone I know IRL, including my own daughter, seemed to forget or just not acknowledge the bday, I don't want to go into much more detail and etch in stone (so to speak) everything that went wrong today. It just sucked much, and I let myself get sucked into wallowing in self-pity all day long and now I'm exhausted.  I'm babbling now. I'm going to bed. Glad today is over.

      Soooo blogger had an upgrade when I wasn't looking. I like it so far. I've been wanting to redo the look here for a while now but lacked the energy to actually do it myself. Good job they added some spiffy new templates eh? Thank you, whomever, for saving me the work. I like this layout.  Still though, I've been quite bad about posting here and everytime I DO post, I say I've been bad about posting and make a promise to be better but who am I kidding? No one reads this thing anyway :) So to anyone stumbling onto this blog by accident, I'll post when I can and that's the best I can do.  What's new? Well not much, hence the lack of posts. Nothing's ever new around here. My grandparents bought a 2004 PT Cruiser the other day. It's gorgeous and it was quite shocking that they bought one. They've often said that the Sable and Escort they had would be their last cars (how morbid eh?) and then they called up the other day and said, 'Guess what, we bought a new car.' Was very surreal.  What else... Oh the kidlet's got a new domain. minimelia.com. Sweetiepete was a bit too childish for her these days :) so a new site and domain for her. She's got contacts now as well. *sniffle.* She's all growed up :(  Well I'm keeping it short for now. It's 24 day and I need to prepare :) :)

      Looks like all I needed to kick my ass into blogging gear was a new look here, hehe.  Not that I have much of anything of interest to write about. Today was a lazy day around our house. Apart from doing the laundry, the kid and I just watched Finding Nemo and hung out. We're having a lovely thunderstorm atm which is nice to watch. It's a little light on the thunder though. I do love a good storm. I don't know what it is about them that makes me feel good. A lot of people think I'm odd because I don't wish for bright sunny weather all the time.   We have an office cleaning lady that comes in every day around 1pm and she inevitably mentions the weather. I find it particularly cruel considering our offices are below ground and windowless :) But she's an older lady who prefers warm sunny days and gives me funny looks when I sort of cringe and wish for a bit of rain.  I think it comes from my time spent in Monterey. I really came to love it when the fog would roll in over PG and drape itself like a fuzzy blanket over the peninsula. If I happened to be on the beach at the time I took pleasure in being able to listen to the waves crashing on the beach, but not seeing them. I also enjoyed the year-round cooler weather we had there. I wish I could decently describe how... comforting I found gloomy days, and still do. I don't get depressed when it's cloudy and I don't watch the weather channel like a hawk waiting for word of the sun peaking out.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not some vampire-like weirdo who only thrives in gloom. I enjoy a beautiful clear day with a cool breeze and not a cloud in the sky. The colours seem more vivid and vibrant and the plethora of big beautiful trees around here look especially nice contrasted with a brilliant blue sky during the spring. It's just that I don't get that grey-weather scowl on my face when I wake up and see that it looks like rain. And I don't grimace and flinch when the cleaning lady comes in lamenting the foul weather.  So she thinks I'm a freak. Ah well.

      I hate the Gain corporation and all of the evil corporate greed they stand for. You fuckers have fucked up my computer with your goddamn pop up ads and dodgy toolbars that insert hardcore sexual stuff on a computer shared with my 12 year old daughter.  I would never willingly click on a goddamn popup, what makes you think I want my PC bombarded with irrelevant shit that inhibits my use of my own software, locks up my windows explorer window and basically kills my enjoyment of the internet? You are all idiots, and I would gladly light the match that burns whatever back alley building you creatures infest to the ground.  So yeah, guess what I did this weekend. I edited registry files and ran spyware cleaners and I still have this crap on my computer. This should be illegal. Really, because it's intrusive, inhibitive and just plain irritating as hell. Oh and then when I came to work today, the other chick in my office suddenly had the same problems. Just out of the blue. She wasn't doing anything she shouldn't have been doing, hadn't downloaded anything for some time. Just *boom* she's got 50 popups all over her screen and desktop shortcuts she didn't add etc. So now, we've had to call the IS department to take time from them to come and fix it, meanwhile she's unable to work because they're on her computer fixing everything. Productivity loss.  Is there a valid petition or bill going through congress right now I can sign and support? This has pissed me off no end, if you couldn't tell.

      I think someone's got a crush on me. It's quite amusing really, because it's like reliving third grade all over again. Always nice to revisit childhood :) He picks on me on TCZ, and I swear if he weren't 5000 miles away he'd be sitting behind me, pulling my hair and knocking my schoolbooks out of my arms in a desperate plea for attention. It's almost sweet in a sad, pathetic kind of way.  But who cares. The kid and I have been to Harry Potter three times now. We're quite sad and pathetic ourselves, but again, who cares :) We loved every minute of it. I think that will be all though until the DVD comes out. I do tend to tire of films if I watch them too many times close together. Now that my curiosity for the film is slaked, I'll have a nice long break, and then it will be like seeing it new on DVD. Cuaron really did well with his first venture as director. I enjoyed what he did with the franchise very much.  So apart from that the weekend was really quite hellish. Friday was the garage sale in hot humid weather with my gran whinging the whole time about a pain in the heel of her foot that prevented her from helping out. I found out I had to chip in for the ad for this sale - an ad that didn't list anything of mine and that I didn't know I'd be chipping in for until it was time to divvy up the take for the day. I made a whopping $8.75 which put me in the hole because my share of the ad was just over $11. Meanwhile the cousin and the Gs made over $200 each. I love my family. I love my family. I love my family.  Then the next day I had to go and work healthfest for 6 hours. Had to be there by 7am to set up my booth and then spent the next 6 hours pretty much just directing traffic. The kid and her friend wanted to go swimming after so I dropped them off and came home and collapsed. I was hot, exhausted, sleepy, tired... The phone rings and it's my gran wondering why I didn't come back to the sale to pick up the stuff that didn't sell. I tried to explain that I was really knackered and could I just come the next day (today actually) and pick it up then. I really didn't see the harm in the few things I had left sitting harmlessly in a corner of the garage for one lousy night. But no. My gran says 'well we're tired too and I would like it if you came to pick this stuff up, then it's out of our hair and we can rest.' As if some things sitting in the garage are a gigantic burden and they cannot sit down to rest until they're gone. And as if my gran hadn't sat on her butt the entire sale telling everyone what to do because her foot hurt too much to help out.  So I stormed up there, picked up the things and she still had the nerve to act as if I was being unreasonable about being angry at having to get dressed, put my shoes back on, drive all the way across town, pick up my meagre belongings and drive all the way back across town and chuck that stuff in the dumpster. Honestly I thought when the sale was over everything left was going off to Goodwill.  Anyway,  . But that's probably why I've been in a foul mood most of the weekend, and probably why I let the twiggy eejit on TCZ bother me so much. Normally I'm quite capable of rolling my eyes at the immaturity of others and getting on with my life, but sometimes, when that immaturity becomes malicious and seems totally without reason or provocation, I get mad.  But I reckon some Colin Firth and Rickman should cheer me up. Off I go.

      Stayed home from work today. Hate doing that, but when I woke up this morning my head was pounding, my stomach was rolling and to even move my eyeballs meant daggers of pain ricocheting around my skull. I did try to get up and take a shower and all that. I got as far as staring at the tub when I decided I just couldn't bear it. So I called work and then crashed until 11.  Head still hurt so I checked email and went back to bed.  Woke up a little later and felt marginally better. Watched Calendar Girls in bed - very funny movie btw. Laughing hurt. Would like to watch it again when the pain stops. Now it's early evening, we've eaten. The pain has subsided somewhat. I can turn my head now without feeling dizzy. I've had coffee in the hopes that it's a caffeine thing. I do get really bad headaches if I suddenly quit caffeine even for the briefest of times.  I don't think it's a migraine, but then again how would I know? My grandmother would lecture me about seeing the doc about it but I'm weird about going to the Doc for trivial things. But what if you have a tumour? That's not so trivial. Yadda yadda yadda. I like to save up my illnesses and do it all in one go :)  So that was my day today. Sleep, pain, coffee, and naked older women.

      And I don't mean just blogging. I love blogging and stuff, but I'm getting that creative itch to write. Which means I'll come up with story ideas, write a little, think about how difficult it is to get published, and give up.  I so want to write a book. I've got so many story ideas floating around in my head but other than just posting it in a blog, I've not got the first clue how one goes about getting something published. Do I need an agent first? Can you really just send manuscripts off to publishers and hope one of them likes it? Can I take rejection? What makes me think anyone would give a toss about what I write? What should I write about? Write what you know. Bah. I know my life hasn't been all that exciting, why would anyone want to know about it?   See? This is why I end up giving up on writing. Self-doubt - tis a powerful thing. Maybe I'll just purge my urge to write with some fanfic.

       urlLink    I recently found a few pix I'd taken of my sister last time she was in town. I was attempting to be 'arty' at Applebee's in this one :D  She's got a new car now, a 2004 Jetta GLS that is her first brand new car. More power to the kid I say :) I'm not jealous at all, nope not me :D hehehe.  I actually wish I could get my sister to blog on a regular basis. She's a really good writer and often send amusing emails detailing her activities. But getting her to blog is like pulling teeth. Silly girl.  Anyway I haven't got anything exciting to talk about... as usual. Not feeling too well anyway so I think I shall head for bedfordshire. Night!

       urlLink    The Birthday girl :)  Today my  urlLink little girl  is not so much my little girl anymore. *sniffle* She's a full-fledged teenager. I asked her this morning if she felt any different. "Not really." came the reply. Then again she was barely awake at the time. Now she's had a bath and is happily settled watching cartoons of all things. We're killing time until 4pm when I take her and her friends to the Waterpark for the whole evening. Well, they're going to stay there, I'm coming home to bake her cake.   I thought about letting them stay at the park from open to close but a) 10 hours in the water is maybe a bit much and b) I can just imagine the sunburns they'd have. So they'll have the entire evening, when the sun's not so strong and maybe the kid-- err teenlet will remember to keep herself sunblocked.  So that's our weekend. We may go see Spidey 2 again tomorrow, that was an excellent flick. Mucho better than the first one and I enjoyed that as well. Then fireworks of course tomorrow night. We like to put on 3-D glasses while watching them. Makes them even more pretty :) Yes, we're weird.  Off to grill some burgers for lunch!

      I have come to the conclusion that I'm not very patient. "You're just now finding that out, after 33 years on this planet?" Oh shut it.   Recently, almost on a whim, I applied for a position on the staff at my city's newspaper in their New Media department. When I say 'on a whim' I mean that before I saw the ad for the job, I hadn't even been thinking of leaving my current job. Then I emailed the hiring person and asked what the salary range for the position was. I figured that it wouldn't be worth anyone's time if it was the same-ish to what I make now. Unfortunately (for my current employer) the newspaper pays a goodly chunk more and as anyone who's trawled through my blog knows, Je suis poor. I would have been stupid not to at least try for the position.  But it wasn't without some soul-searching and advice-seeking that I made that decision. I love where I work and the people I work with. I have the best bosses I have ever had and my coworkers are fabulous. It would be really hard to leave here. I even spoke to my boss about all of this because I don't believe in blindsiding him with an abrupt departure. His exact words to me were 'You have to do what's best for you.' And he is right.   So I updated my CV and wrote a rocking cover letter, printed them on very nice paper and sent them off. A couple of days later I had an email asking me for a phone interview - the screening process. I made it through that after a bit of an agonizing wait that had me on pins and needles and then a proper interview was set up for the following Tuesday.   I prepared my ass off for that interview - something I'd never done before, but then again I haven't gone on very many formal interviews. Just a couple here at the hospital where I already knew everyone. So I poured through website after website and grilled myself on the tough interview questions: 'What are your strengths/weaknesses' (ugh!), 'Tell me about yourself', 'What's an obstacle youve had to overcome in your job', and worst of all, 'Why do you want to leave your current job?' The last one, for me was the most difficult to answer. I can't just come out and say 'Well, you're paying more moula.' hat's a big factor, but there are other reasons I think this would be a good move for me.  Anyway, I felt good going into the interview. I was nervous but not overly so. I spent an hour with the director of the department and she skipped the strength/weakness question than goodness. I could have answered it, but I just hate it anyway. But the interview, I think, went very well. I left her with my references, and she asked me all kinds of questions about when I could start, whether I'd be comfortable using a Mac, stuff like that. She kept speaking as if I had the job ("Your Mac is due to be replaced within the next year." "Your desk is in the corner." etc.) So I'm feeling like it's in the bag, and then she said, "Well&nbsp;I have a few more interviews today but I hope to have a decision made by the end of the day." Cue my brain to go into over-analyze mode.  Did I blow it somehow? I don't know. But it's only gotten worse because it's near the end of the day, Thursday, 2-ish days after the interview and I've not heard anything from her about it. Did someone come in after me who blew her mind? Did I answer the dreaded salary requirement position wrong? I know what you're thinking. "Geez it's only been two days, chill out!" and normally you would be right. I wouldn't be thinking about it much at all if she hadn't said 'I hope to have a decision by the end of the day' after my interview.&nbsp; It's that one little sentence that has thrown me for a loop and made me freak out that I haven't heard from her yet. I would think if she's moving that fast on filling the position, if I was chosen, then surely I would have heard by now.  So I haven't gotten much sleep and&nbsp;I can't seem to stop worrying about it. I do not like this feeling of not knowing. And it's ironic because 2 weeks ago I never would have guessed I'd be in this situation at all. Oh and one of my key references is bloody away on vacation as well :( Argh.   An update: After&nbsp;I wrote the above stuff, I heard from another one of my references that they had just been called about it and that the call went very well. This reference didn't go into detail about it and I didn't ask, but this person knew how much I've been angsting about not hearing anything so gave me the heads up. So if she is checking my references right now, it at least means that someone else hasn't gotten the position (yet.) I hope.  My plan of action right now is to wait until tomorrow afternoon, no matter how much it is killing me, and then I will call her and enquire about the process and how it's all going in a very nonchalant, casual way.  *fingers and toes crossed*  &nbsp;

      At 18.30 on Tuesday the tube strike started, it ended about 18.30 today. In that space of 24 hours I have been shocked by two things 1) Londoners have legs, and 2) Londoners are generous. Let me explain....  A lot of people commute into London from the suburbs and beyond. We have quite an extensive public transport network consisting of underground and over-ground trains, buses, taxis etc. The rail union for underground staff decided to hold a strike which people feared would bring London to a standstill and would cost the economy a heck of a lot of money. So this morning I walked into work - which is only like 25 mins and I often walk in anyways. The buses were packed, the roads were chockablock with cars, buses and taxis. It was total gridlock. Buses were having to drop people off half-way along the route leaving disgruntled commuters stuck half-way to work, but as I was walking along I noticed something amazing. There were lots of other people walking and more cyclists than normal. I was quite surprised, I guess when the worst happens and you have to get into work you make the effort. It does makes me wonder why these people don't walk more often.   But anyways, I can't comment coz I do often get the bus, and I did for the journey home (mainly because I wasn't feeling well - summer cold or something coming on methinks). So I waited with the not-so-large queue of people and got on the first bus that came. Well one lady didn't have change for the ticket machine (in central london you now have to buy your ticket before getting on the bus) and looked quite dismayed as she trudged off the bus having been told by the bus driver he had no change so couldn't take her. But then, from out of nowhere her guardian angel appeared, a lady who had like a carnet of bus tickets and just gave her one. How's that for generosity! Well it certainly proved to me that out there there are nice people in the world, and thanks to one of them, that lady got home a little earlier than she would have done with her faith in the world restored :)

      It’s been sort of a strange couple of days.  Every once and a while, I sort of move into brief periods like this where everything seems mildly surreal, as if I’m seeing things through a slightly skewed reflection and I’m not immersed in anything around me but instead drifting along in parallel, idly headed along somewhere.  It’s a very odd feeling of detachment that sort of permeates everything that I do.  It’s a sort of “catcher in the rye” type of feeling, isolation, sinking between curbs, and all that—I don’t really know.  I saw a play last night called “I Am My Own Wife.”  It was quite interesting and very well done, and in fact won the Pulitzer recently.  It’s a one-man performance (something which always impresses me) and the plot is fairly complex—it’s largely based on the life of a transvestite Berliner—who’s also a furniture collector and restorer and lives in a museum filled with old phonographs—born in the early 20th century and his (her) experiences as a homosexual living through two oppressive regimes: the Nazis and the communists.    The story is told, however, from the point of view of the author (an American homosexual man and the only actor in the play) who visits Berlin and tapes interviews that he conducts with her about her life for the purpose of—yes—writing a play.  So, it’s sort of both an autobiography of the author’s interactions with her, and a biography of her life, and scenes from both are interspersed to create a pretty powerful performance.  I would recommend it to anyone who has the chance to see it.  Going up to the country for a bit of a vacation tomorrow, which should be nice.  It’s summer, so I should be relaxed, but somehow I feel guilty about being relaxed, which makes it impossible to be relaxed.  So, yeah, hopefully I can just chill out.  Ciao.

      It feels sort of surreal around here right now. Saturday my babygirl will be turning 13, a teenager by definition. She definitely has moments of teenagerdom. She spends hours on the phone, she's forever painting her nails, fiddling with her hair and experimenting with makeup. The posters on her walls have changed from cuddly puppies to Orlando Bloom looking for all the world like a lecherous pedophile ready to pounce on my daughter - oh wait no, that's Ginge :)  The other day we were in the middle of laundry so she had on some old shorts and a tank that was far too small for her. Cleavage was everywhere, curves were there in places where there shouldn't be curves yet (at least not in my mind). It was startling. She looked older, and yet she was sitting on the couch playing with bubbles like a kid. I just can't get my head around this weirdness.  Of course she just laughs at me, or rolls her eyes when I point out all of this to her. She says she doesn't feel any different than she did last week and that I'm just being weird. Well, yes I am being weird, but it is a weird feeling. I wish I could explain it better. Maybe Kat will get some idea of it when her kidlets reach this age.  I find myself comparing her to what I remember of my teen years, or my sister's since Kelly (my sis) is 8 years younger than me, I can remember what she was like. I'm trying to avoid the pitfalls I remember. I'm probably more lenient with my daughter than my mom was with me; I know I talk to her more than my mom did with me about things that weren't big subjects when I was a teen (finances, sex, drugs and all that).   Anyway, enough of that. If anyone sees Arya around TCZ on Saturday, wish her a happy 13th and don't mind me sobbing in the corner.

      Stuff  Its funny how you can go in one direction for awhile, then all of a sudden, do a complete 360.  And no, I'm not talking about driving on ice in the wintertime....  I said I was going to wait till early next year to re-evaluate the whole house situation, since the previous encounter was very fustrating and unsettling.  But then before we knew it, we're thinking about putting a bid on a house.  Not completely sure if we're going to take it.  The price is perfect (Same as what I pay for rent right now).  But there is a bit of work to do to it, cosmetic and structure-wise (The foundation has a bit of unsettling, they said they could fix it before we moved in).  We're looking at a few more options, but might be moving in sooner then I think.  We're going to think about it very hard this week, and make a decision.  -- Things  Lately, my mind has been so scattered.  I will start working on one thing, then all of a sudden, I forget what I was doing before.  Fire just laughs at me when I'm typing something on TCZ and all of a sudden I just either end the sentance prematurely or just add a who and the end of it.  Heh, I find it pretty funny myself as well, but I think I seriously need a few days off work just to relax around the house and do some serious binge drinking.  Luckily I have extra money and we're coming up to a 4 day weekend!  (July 1st = Canada Day).  Mucho relaxo and golfo, with a side order of drinko.    Thats all for now  Bie!

      Greetings!  Well today was supposed to be my final post-miscarriage check-up but, as you might guess, this isn't the case.  No, it appears that there could be something wrong - they aren't quite sure yet what but I have to get an ultrasound either tomorrow or Wednesday so they can check it out.  Joy.  What does that mean? Well, they figure there are a few options - either I have a simple infection or there are pieces still left inside (which apparently could be from the one sac or perhaps therein lies the possibility that there was twins) OR it could be both.  Gross and stuff eh?  Yeah.  So if it is an infection - I get to take drugs.  And to jump the gun a bit - they've already given me the drugs.  So I get to take these orange horse pills for the next week - whee!  If its the "pieces" option then I get to have a D&C.   Yeah, I know - WTF is that?  D&C actually stands for "dilation & curettage" and basically is the scraping of the lining of the uterus.  And that means I get to go under anaesthetic too!  Its like I said - the fun never stops!  So thats the spiel.  Now as we wait for the votes to come in to see who our new Prime Minister will be, I'm going to work out.  Later!

      This weekend I was once again in Amsterdam and having been to the cinema to see Shrek 2 - I want a puss in boots! - Monster and I went to watch the Holland-Sweden match in one of the pubs in the centre. Having secured what seemed to be the last seat in the pub we settled down to wait for the match to start. It was amazing at how packed the pub became and I don't think I've ever seen so many people wearing orange - not even at the Easyjet check-in desks! Naturally the majority of the pub were supporting Holland, altho we did see one chap in a Sweden t-shirt who interestingly had an Italy sweatshirt tied round his waist - wise move methinks with that many orange peeps about ;)   Whilst it was a good match, I couldn't help feeling a little saddened as I recalled that only two days before I'd been sat gripped by the England-Portugal match and as the game went to penalties (as Monster had kept on telling me it would) I felt I couldn't quite join in with the euphoria of the celebrations as Van de Sar saved the penalty and Robben scored to win the game for Holland. Up until Saturday's match Holland had been afflicted with the same penalties curse as England - for some reason they just couldn't win a match on penalties and it was always heartache for the nation - but now for Holland at least the curse was lifted, and I felt a little jealous. I guess England just have to wait their turn for the curse to be lifted - or practice their penalty taking! Anyways, whilst I'm not switching my allegiance, I do kinda feel a warmth towards Holland so they'll be getting my support for the rest of the tournament, and as my darling boyfriend pointed out my hair does match the team colours ;)

      They are a little slow but they get the idea. When I sold my condo a few years ago I told them that they should buy a townhouse and I'll just pay them rent. This way they have a second house that they can make money off of and I can still have a house (I hate paying property organizations like Paradigm).  Of course they just hated this idea, assuming I was trying to pull something over on them (as if) and since I didn't feel like going through the paperwork of getting another house until I figure out where I want to live, I just submitted and rented out this apartment.  Now fast forward to June 27. My mother calls me and we're talking about her trip this week. She's going to be seeing some old friends, one of whom owns four houses in the Charlotte, N.C. area. They rent three of them out to their kids and just bought a fourth for themselves. Of course they've retired early and make great money off the interest rates of the homes while charging their kids pretty minimal rent to stay there. The thinking is that they can help their kids save up and buy houses of their own.  Now all of a sudden my parents think this is a WONDERFUL idea. Just brilliant. They were asleep when I sold my condo and suggested this idea but now thou art awaken.   Sounds all good but I've got six months on my current lease and I'm stuck, plus there's no guarantee I'll want to live here when it's up. So now they want to do this thing fairly quickly (they are impatient/impulsive like that) and I'm stuck in rental hell. I'm so angry I can't even give them a shit-eating "I told you so" grin.   So there are two options: either a) beg and plead the properties company to let me out of my lease (HA!) or b) Wait and see. The hope is I'll know whether I'm staying here or moving elsewhere by October and we can search for a place. The only saving grace could be if I get this particular job and I'll be forced to move somewhere in between Jacksonville and Atlanta. That could at least solve my lease problems because the paper will just give me the money to buy it out or take over the last six months and put an intern there or something.  Anyway...Parents are frustrating.

      I think my computer's slowly dying. A few months ago my CD-Rom drive kept opening and closing by itself, over and over again until I taped the fecking thing shut. Then it stopped for a while. Then I somehow lost my entire OS after merely attempting to install IE 6 again, which I was only doing to try and fix some weird .dll error. So I reinstalled my OS, and instantly became inundated with spyware all over the place. I cannot stress enough how evil that shite is and how the perpetrators of it should be dragged through a field of glass and then hung, drawn and quartered with me to slap the horses' backsides as they tear their limbs off.  That reminds me of a pub near the Tower of London called the Hung, Drawn and Quartered. But that's neither here nor there.  Anyway, I've run every kind of spyware killer I can find, edited registry files until I'm cross-eyed, and I still am unable to get rid of it all. And to top it off, my CD-Rom drive is now opening and closing over and over and it's pissing me off. This computer was purchased in 2001 so I think it's shelf-life is pretty much done. The crappy thing is that there's no way I could afford to replace it. So I shall have to Macguyver it until it finally kicks the bucket.  I'll keep it short tonight. I'd like to check my email but I have to close the browser first.

      Today I found a new apartment. well, I guess technically it's called a  'basement suite'  but whatever it's called, It'll soon be my new home. I get to move in about mid august - around the same time as my birthday. Some birthday present huh? I get to haul heavy boxes and furniture instead of relaxing. Too bad I can't call in sick and get someone to cover for me. Man, that would be sweet.  In other news, I think I'm developing a rash. and by  'rash' , I really mean  'strong relationship with my girlfriend' . I dunno what it is about her. She calls me up randomly to say weird things. Like, today for example - she called me up, and asked 'Is Rob there?'. Not so weird right? Yes - considering I live by myself, and there is no one else around to pick up the blasted phone. Then then proceeds to tell me about a dream she had involving ice cream, dancing hippos, and a couple of talking trees. The girl is insane. She's totally random, incoherent, and she slobbers a lot. I think I might marry her one day. She's perfect.  Earlier today I had what most people would call  'Breakfast' . Its the first time I've eaten food in the morning since Christmas. It was amazing. I woke up, went to the kitchen, made some eggs and toast, and ate it. All before 8:00 am. I really enjoyed breakfast. I think I might continue this tradition and explore other edible creations. I'm thinking about pancakes - I hear they're pretty good.

      Margaritas eh?  We just bought a *BIG* bucket of strawberry margarita mix which I may actually save for CAN3 now that we're up to ***24*** people! Woo hoo!  We just passed CAN2 by 2 people.  Yeah!  Well, of course, thats assuming that all goes well and they all show.  So more people should sign up!  Go on - do it! You know you want to ;)  At any rate, today has been a weird day of laziness, shopping and haircuts.  Adam and I both got much needed haircuts today - if you're bored you can check out mine  urlLink here .  Its just about 3 inches shorter than normal (due to summer and stuff).  Don't mind the fuzziness - I'm trying to learn to use PSP properly ;)  Then maybe I'll actually *buy* the program for a change!  In other news - we're finding the really weird thing to have to contend with these days is running into all the people we know and when they ask how "things are going" (meaning the pregnancy) we have to tell them that things are "not going".  Its such an awkward conversation to have - especially with people we don't really know well but we run into a lot and just know who we are (either through Adam's parents or from my work, etc).  Its just weird.  I live for the day where nobody asks me about the pregnancy anymore - I get on better day by day not having to think about it and when people ask - it makes you think about it.  So its all very weird.  Anyhoo, I'm going to go wake up Adam since he's still passed out on the couch (for a few hours now that lazy bum!).  I have to say I miss the smilies from the other blog!  Thats my only complaint :)  Bye!

      So it's party day. Jamie's birthday party day. His birthday isn't until tomorrow but we are having his party today. I'm telling you, if I get asked ONE MORE TIME how much longer til his party (Jamie can tell time btw) I'm going to commit Harry Carrey.  This morning was spent running all over Highland/Griffith/Munster trying to find hair dye. The party is Harry Potter and everyone is supposed to come over dressed like their favorite character from the book. We have been all over looking for washable hair-dye (black of course) and glasses. We FINALLY found the hair dye after I went to one of the salons to ask where I could find temp hair dye. I had been to Walgreens, Osco's, the Party Store, Target... so when I left there, I stopped by where Paul gets his hair cut and asked them and they sent me to a place like Sally's Beauty Supply. We didn't find any glasses though. I stopped by the eye place (For Eyes) and asked if they happpppened to be throwing out any old glasses that looked like HP glasses but they said no. However they did have the HP glasses in stock! So, for just a split second I got excited but that excitment faded as soon as I saw the price tag of $70. Which the lady then told me she could take $44 dollars off. I told her, thanks but that's ok. It's only a 1 time thing.   ARGGGHHHH!!! *GOES RUNNING DOWN THE STREET SCREAMING AND SHOUTING LIKE A LUNATIC*  ....yes, he asked me again... I'm sorry I ever told him he could have a party...  Anywhooo.... back to the glasses, I bought some black poster paper to try to make some glasses out of that. Goooood luck! I'm just so glad I don't have to prepare food. We are ordering pizza and having popcorn, pudding, and fruit snacks. Plus some drinks. I had thought of Butterbeer and Melia had given me the recipe, but jamie wants Pepsi (which I think Coke actually had something to do with HP) but maybe that and Orange kool-aid and that will be 'Pumpkin Juice'. I really don't like Pepsi. I'm a Coke or Dr Pepper girl. Water actually, most of the time, but I digress...  Ok I have to go, less than 4 hours now til this *ahem* !Very well put together party.  Have a great day  Oh yeah, pray this dye comes out of their hair.

      We all know that getting really, really drunk just sucks—there’s no two ways about it.  Sure, its fun for a little while, but it takes twice as long to recuperate, not to mention the fact that the process of recovery is twice as harrowing as getting tipsy is amusing (a concept that, admittedly, TCZ spods seem pretty familiar with).  However, what’s worse than getting really, really drunk, is getting really, really drunk at the same party your parents are at and then having to go home with them, sleep in the same house as them and therefore subsequently have to  wake up  in the same house as them.    I bring this up because this was exactly the predicament that I found myself in last night.  Let me just tell you, if I never have another sip of alcohol in the presence of my parents again it will be too soon.  Anyway, as you can probably imagine (or recall, if this has ever happened to you), this morning has made me greatly regret last night as it's been a lovely medley of kneeling over the bath-tub, bouts of insane awkwardness that ensued about the time of our rather rude awakenings (as it were), and other pleasant things of that nature.    So, allow me to close with two final thoughts, which are really just the same final thought repeated for emphasis: God damn margaritas, god  damn  them.  End Rant;

      Oh my good god I had to work today and boy did it suck.  You know, working in a bank/credit union isn't all its cracked up to be.  I mean you deal with money *all* day long except that NONE of it is yours.  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  Zip.  So it sucks.  It especially sucks when all day you are looking at accounts that have $20K or more in them - and again, its  NOT  yours.  Its amazing for this area - such small towns - how much money there really is.  There are so many rich people here, people you'd never GUESS had that much money... its crazy.  When is it my turn?  Anyways, as I was saying before I got onto the whole money thing - working sucks.  You know, I moved here late December - quit my job to move to a small town in the Kootenays and, maybe, hopefully, find a new job.  And I have one - its part-time/casual mind you but its a job.  But I now realize I hate working.  I had 3 months of doing-whatever-the-hell-I-want and I liked it.  I want that back.  Hell, I want a job where I can work from home so I can show up in my PJs.  That would even be acceptable.  But this getting up to go work for someone else really bites.  Especially at a job where you deal with money and none of it is yours.  Its Friday, its been a long day, I don't know what to make for dinner and I'm tired.  I'm so glad the weekend is here - not that I worked a lot this week - but the weekend means Adam will be home so I'll have someone to bug! *cackles evilly*  Okay I hear a nanaimo bar calling my name... Mmmmmm...

      It is currently 5:46pm. I've been doing laundry for 7 hours straight now. Load after load after load. It just keeps coming. I finish a load and a new pile of dirty clothes appears out of nowhere. I fear they are reproducing. I fear they will take over my apartment and hold me hostage. At times I can almost hear them planning their next moves.   They've taken over the kitchen. I still have the bedroom, but everytime I look away their army piles get closer. I fear I will not be able to hold them off much longer. I may need to relocate into the living room. I have planned an alternate way into the living room in case things get too bad.  [20 mins later...]  The bedroom has been seiged. They've completly overtaken it. I am hiding in the corner of my living room. I've been living off what little food I could find - a couple of frootloops, and some popcorn stuck in between the cushions of the couch. God only knows how long I will be here. They will find me. It's only a matter of time.   [25 more minutes pass...]  I fear I will not last much longer. The piles of dirty laundry are too much for me to handle. I have been able to fend them off for a little while using what little resources I could steal from the closet - half a bottle of tide and a few cups of Purex. My resouces are running out fast. It is only a matter of time before I am a POW.  Tell my parents I love them. Tell my sister I am proud of her. Tell my gf to move on and find someone else. Tell them all not to worry... tell them...

      My first ever blog.  From the guy who thought that writing your own blog was boring, uninteresting and pointless.  I would much rather read about other people's problems, days and lives than have them read about my own,  But oh well, I'll give this a try.  By far this is the worst year of my life.  Things from January til mid April were just shitty for my family.  Suicide attempts, job loss, heart problems, blood pressure, drug problems, deaths, broken hips and lots of problems.  Well, just when I had thought that May was great and June was almost over problem free, WHAM!  My grandmother who broke her hip in March (and was only given a week to live then) has gotten pneumonia and was found in her bed on Tuesday morning bleeding from the mouth and nose.  She is so fragile that the coughing she had been doing was ripping her throat open and causing her to bleed.  So she was rushed to the hospital where she was put on IV and oxygen immediately.  Within a few hours, she was doing better, but not much.  The coughing and such had subsided.  The poor woman is 96, and will be 97 in July.  She has Alhzeimers and knows no one.  It really hurts my Dad for him Mother to not know who he is.  She has gone from being about 180 lbs and in decent health in the early 90's to being an 80 lb person with no quality of life, who knows no one, is blind in both eyes, is deaf and doesn't speak.  I find it so unfair that young people are killed every day, all around the world, yet here is a woman who 'I haven't known in 10 years' who is in pain with a broken hip, requires morphine daily to keep down the pain.  She lies in bed suffering, and yet people are dying every day who I know she would if she could, gladly give them her life.  Anyway, enough with that.  I feel so much better now that I've vented.  And for those who didn't know, I recently started a new job in May.  I am a Support Specialist Level I at the University of Lethbridge library.  I moved across Canada to be here.  I live with Weagle (Scott) and Sydney (Susan) currently.  I am really enjoying my new job and the new area.  As my new manager said this morning, "You'll be my Jake-of-all-trades."  I will be doing html and java script, along with redesigning some webpages for the library, along with my current PC repair and media duties.  I'm excited.  The more useful I can make myself, the better chance that this will become a full time position for me after this contract expires.  Other than that, I really don't have much more to say.  For the last week, I have been watching my DVD set of Robotech, the first series, with Rick Hunter, Minmei, Max Sterling, Lisa Hayes and crew.  It's a great anime series from the early 80's.  I can't get enough of it.  But at 50 dollars a boxed set, and I have 3 of the 7, I couldn't afford more.  But then I tried Ebay and found them for about 5 dollars to 10 dollars American and started buying them up.  2 more sets are on the way and I'm currently bidding on 2 more.  This rocks!  It's exciting.  This weekend will be fairly quiet.  I hope to go to Cranbrook with Scott and Susan to drop off Susan's car for her parents, but I may just stay home and watch the NASCAR race from Sonoma, California!  I love road racing.  Anyway, enjoy your weekends and we'll see you again soon.  Same blog-time, same blog-channel!

      Well, not only is this my first contribution to the TCZ blog, it’s also my first blog post ever.  I decided it was due time that I gave in to the blog hysteria after having "lurked" on many a blog but never actually taken the time to join and start posting my thoughts.  As a bit of a disclaimer, I'll just start off by saying that I'm fairly sure that most of the stuff that goes on in my life is of little to no interest to anyone else and I'll do my best not to bore anyone here, but I take no responsibility if you end up bored nonetheless ;-)  So, for those of you that don’t know me too well, I’m a student living in New York City, which I suppose is a pretty good place to be a student (though I don’t have much of a frame of reference since I’ve lived here my whole life).  People seem to have a lot of weird stereotypes about New Yorkers in general though, which is pretty odd considering this is one of the most ethnically and intellectually diverse cultural centers in the world.  Consequently, there tends to be a lack of homogeneity in how people act and think, and that’s one of things I like most about living here—you rarely know what to expect when meeting new people.  In all fairness, though, I probably don’t fully utilize what New York has to offer.  There are literally hundreds of bars, clubs, museums, institutes, theatres, and other diversions of social/cultural persuasion, but I tend to only visit a few of them regularly—then again, another thing I like about New York is knowing that they’re there anyhow.  I like having options.  Sure, I always order Chinese from the same place, but that doesn’t mean I don’t like knowing that I could order it from about 20 other places if I felt so inclined!  I happen to live in a really nice residential area of the city right by Central Park, which makes the general urban hubbub a lot easier to deal with.  The Park is a pretty extraordinary entity.  It plays host to hundreds of thousands of people day in and day out, providing a much needed breather from the sirens and car alarms and cab drivers yelling in rabid middle-eastern languages.  It’s pretty small when you consider it geographically, and yet in the two almost-two-decades I’ve been visiting it I still always manage to find something new each time I go.  I love the city, but sometimes I really need nature, and the park can provide quick respite from the towering walls of brick and glass at every turn when I don’t get the chance to take a full fledged vacation.  On a slightly different note, after reading the Times’ review of Michael Moore’s new movie, Fahrenheit 9/11 (link  urlLink here ), I really, really, really want to see it (of course, I still really wanted to see it beforehand, but now I want to see it even more!).  I can’t say I love Michael Moore, but he does make pretty interesting movies.  Sure, they can be contradictory and at times downright annoying, but they’re also often really illuminating, and they shed light on a lot of problems in the US that are overlooked by the many people sitting pretty in its uppermost echelons (who unfortunately happen, more often than not, to be the decision makers).  Anyway, so concludes my deflowering post.  I am no longer a blog virgin. Yay.

      How I learned to love to post and stop worrying about the Bomb.  Blogging is overrated. The newsmedia likes to say that blogging is 'the new art form', 'the "NEW" new media'. Instead of writing letters to the editor, we're told that we can reach a greater audience through our blogs, where the whole world can come to our pulpit and listen to us espouse our views, personality, etc.  There are many, many problems with this:  1. The majority of people online don't have personalities. This community does, thank god, but how many blogs have you read where it's 'i went to school and she was like 'omg, look at u, she's usch a b!tch!''. An infestation of 14 year olds; the only cure, to go back in time and castrate their fathers, if they even know who their fathers are.  2. On the odd chance that someone DOES have a personality, it's most likely a female. Thus, the readership of the blog is all men, desperate men who will wax poetically about how great the blogger is for the sole purpose of getting into her pants. I've seen this happen more then once. The supposed great thing about blogging is that you can learn a lot about a person from what they write. Unfortunately, it usually degrades into "Whoa, she's hot, I'm going to read her blog!"    3. The other sect of common bloggers are nerds. Nerds who will blog about their favorite Star Trek: Voyager episode or posting pictures of their new computer case mod. You know the type. "Smarter" then everyone else, everyone else is a fool, everyone else is ignoring the obvious, everyone else should just do what I say and then everything will be ok. They are also found hanging around #2 blogs, not to mention their parents basement.  4. Political blogs are the worst. There is no grey. There are "Democraps" and "Republi-Cons". Attempting to determine meaning from these blogs is pointless. You're better off reading the hot girls blogs for all of the 'information' you're going to get.  5. Bloggers have nasty, nasty habits of regurgitating other blogs. Just like email chain letters that get sent around, communities of bloggers pop up parroting the same old information that appears on everyone elses blog. Instead of individual thought and expression, we get "SO and SO posted this on his blog, *Copy and paste*". In an attmept to be more popular, we mimic those that we want to get attention from. A lot like high school really. I always wanted to be the head cheerleader :(  At any rate, this blog is different. We all come from different backgrounds, countries, ideals and the only thing that binds us is a little thing we like to call TCZ. This forum is open to everyone, the high school girls, the snooty computer nerds, the pseudo-political-intellectuals and thus, if there was ever a blog that you should read, this should be it.  *cross-posted to Adam Online, LiveJournal, DeadJournal because that's what computer nerds do.

      It's freaking freezing in my office today. I think Joey has been messing with my thermometer. So I type this with frozen fingers.  Anyway... It's apparently Hawaiian Day at work today. I just got lei'd (har har.) I think one of the nursing units decided to have a bit of fun today and did the hawaiian theme and it's spread throughout the hospital. There are always, in every organization, those people who go all out on things like this. The woman who came in with the leis was dressed in full-on Hawaiian mumu, with big floppy hat and sunglasses and she's going around to all the departments in my building handing out the leis.  I wish I could be that unselfconscious. I'm more the 'These leis itch' type and mine are now sitting on a corner of my desk. Tonight I'll take them home and give them to my darling daughter who will probably hand them off of a nail stuck in the wall and there they will hang until the end of time. Then a year from now I'll see them and wonder where the hell they came from.  Wow two paragraphs out of Hawaiian Day. And I was worried I wouldn't have anything to write about :)  God I really wish people would refrain from bursting into my office as if it's just some closet or something. It scares the bejeezus out of me because I don't see them coming. Here I am, thinking hard about what to write in here (yes I know I should be working, but I'm on my lunch hour), staring at my keyboard, willing it to extract the thoughts from my head when the door flies open with a loud crack and some chirpy person from the Education department breezes in on her way to the *actual* closet attached to my office. I have a private office but one of the bad things about it is that the Education department keeps all of their CPR dummies in the closet here. Whenever they have a class over in my building (usually they're located in the other building) they're in and out of my office constantly all day long. It's a little annoying and disruptive, especially with the noisy door and their tendency to burst in without warning. Then they leave the damn closet door open with the light on (well, it's more of a hall actually) and it's even colder in there than it is in my office. Grrrrr.  So, speaking of feeling scared (nice segueway eh?), I'll chime in on Fire's post about fears to mention mine. I actually think I've talked about mine before when Anne posted in the BBS once asking 'what scares the hell out of you.' I love to swim. But I cannot have someone hanging on me while doing so. Not my daughter, or a boyfriend or just a friend playing a friendly game of 'dunk.' I'm afraid I'll be pushed under and then be unable to surface. So I guess it's a drowning fear. I can't even stand to watch underwater sequences in films or on TV either. I get out of breath and tense. I even know what the fear stems from because it's probably one of the most vivid early memories I have.  When I was little, we moved to an apartment complex in Palm Springs, CA which, of course, had a pool. They all did in Palm Springs because the heat there is atrocious. Anyway, I was innocently paddling around in it one day when my friend decided to jump in, land on me, and cling to me. She wouldn't let go either and I kept going under and had absolutely no control, no chances to grab a breath before going back under. All the while she was giggling and thought we were having a great time. I don't remember exactly how old I was, but we couldn't have been more than five I guess. Anyway, I'm positive that's why I can't stand anyone hanging on me in the water.  The other thing I fear is the same as Joey, and that's death. I don't like to think about my own mortality, and I definitely have nightmares about something happening to my daughter. That scares me to pieces. The more I think about it though, I think death saddens me moreso than scares me I guess. The fear is my own death and what would happen to my daughter and my family and friends. The sadness from worrying about losing what little family I have left. And I know that was never much a concern of mine until my father suddenly died, followed several years later by my mother who also died out of the blue. No one close to me had ever died before that could have prepared me for such devastating losses. Even just writing about it now makes me feel sort of weepy.  So I shall stop. I've rambled enough for one post :)

      If you know what the first part of the title means, you've obviously played in a few poker tournaments :)  Its a $30 buy-in tournament with 3 dollars going to the house.  NL stands for No-Limit.  The game in question is Texas Holdem...The Cadillac of Poker  I've been kinda a student to the game of No-Limit Texas Holdem for about 4 years now.  When I was at the Casino a few weeks ago on training (Not poker training, work training, I just stayed at the casino hotel :)), I picked up a few magazines that are delivered to all canadian casinos.  Its called Canadian Poker Player ( urlLink Http://www.canadianpokerplayer.com ).  In the May issue, they had an article regarding home games.  I was very shocked to see that there was an article about a home game right here in Fredericton.  So I sent them an email to get an invite to their weekly home games and monthly tournaments.  Tonight will mark my first NL tournament with this group, and I'm very much looking forward to it.  I've been playing with the same group of guys from home for years now, and I pretty much know their betting patterns and strategies.  When you sit down at a table with a completely new crowd, you always learn something new.  I'm very much looking forward to tonight, not only for the game I love, but to meet new people in the city.    Now, off that subject, and maybe a quick response to Fire's post regarding fears....  I never thought I did before, but I really fear death.  I sometimes get this chill in my body whenever I think of what would happen if I died tomorrow, what the (2, maybe 3 ;)) people would do if I was gone.  When I was young, I was kinda a daredevil...I never feared getting hurt, and would do just about anything people dared me to do.  Now that I'm settling down with my life, I fear dying more and more every day.  I wonder why I do.  I guess its the natural life cycle.    I never really noticed this until I started flying.  My trip to Jamaica a few years ago included me almost going nuts in the plane when it was in turbulance.  So, maybe its a combination of fear of death and fear of flying.  Anyway, I swore I wouldn't travel without Melissa on a plane again, she makes me feel more comfortable when I'm with her.  Awwwwwwwww.  Work beckons.

      Is summer over yet? Am I a horrible mother for wishing that the kids were back in school? I love my 3. I really do, but when they have absolutely nothing to do for days at a time, other than pick fights with each other and ask me the 3 same questions over and over and over again.. 1) Can I hold my hamster?! 2) Can I hold Matthew's Hamster? 3) Can Matthew/Laith/KiKi/Jenna come over? (all asked in rapid succession). Arrgghhh!! I'm signing the boys up for fall soccer on Saturday and then signing them up for July "Pal's in the Park". Pal's will get them out of the house MWF's through July from 9-12pm. Soooo maybe that will help them. Jamie had a really good week last week because he had soccer camp and he was pretty easy. *Crossing fingers* Sunday is Jamie's birthday. He'll be *gasps* 7! I can't believe. His party is Saturday night. He's invited some of the neighborhood kids over to watch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets with him. They are all supposed to come dressed as their favorite character. He's invited 7 children, but 2 of them, so far, aren't coming. That's because, Ellie, gets very scared. When Jamie said what he wanted to do, I knew that she and her brother, Dawson, probably wouldn't be able to come. Hopefully, though, the rest will show up. Unlike last year when only 2 kids out of his 24 in his classroom showed up for his party at Chuck E Cheese. It was really sad:( But, thankfully he didnt really notice or if he did, he didn't let on.  This morning, I was getting the kids dressed and fixed Sarah's hair and brushed Matthew's. Well, Jamie has a new haircut. We went to the beauty shop the other day and he went through 2 THICK hairstyle books looking for his new hairstyle:) It took him a good 30 minutes to mull over the pages and find just the right style:) Our 7 yr old now requires hair products (gel) for his hair! Oi vey.  Anyway, back to this morning... Jamie has now decided he will be sporting a mohawk:) His hair is longer on top so it's very easy to do it up down the center and well.. he did:) Melia teased me saying, next thing I know, he'll be wearing all black and coming home with piercings!! NOOO! *sighs* I called Paul and he said, "I don't think so":):) And so it begins....:) I think I'll post a picture of Jamie's new 'do'. He's got allergies or something because his eyes are all puffy and squinty. In all of the pics I took of him this morning, he looks either drunk or is blinking. Anywhoo:) Here are some pics:)    urlLink    Matthew&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Jamie mohawk&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Sarah&nbsp; urlLink     take care ~kat:)

      Having recently gone through a traumatic experience, I've spent a lot of time discussing things, stuff and items with my significant other. One thing that came up was my fear that what actually did happen would happen. Fear is a funny thing. On the one hand, it crushes your spirit, destroys your body and dampens your enthusiasm; on the other hand, fear is a necessary adjunct to living. It prepares you for extreme circumstances (Fight or Flight) and prevents you from engaging in things that may cause your bodily harm (Taking a beer away from Camerak, for example). So, what do YOU fear?  As some people may or may not know, I'm quite claustrophobic. If I'm travelling as a passenger in a vehicle, more often than not you'll see me huddled up against the window; and if I'm not at a window, I'll be asleep (or some reasonable variant therein, eyes closed, breathing slowly). When I book flights, I always using the seating arrangements to ensure I have a window seat. If I can't get a window seat, I'll take an aisle seat...but I really cannot stand sitting between two people; there's something quite debilitating about being stuck between two people. A while back, on a 1 hour flight to Calgary, I was trapped between a rather large man and a smaller asian girls, and I was scared I was going to flip out. I attempted to sleep it off, but my body kept violently jerking me awake as some type of reflex. In Switzerland, I was travelling down a gondola in the middle of a fairly intense snowstorm (enough that I couldn't see out the windows) and by the time I got to the bottom I was not a happy camper...felt quite nauseous. I discovered another phobia of mine, but I'm not quite sure the word for it so I'll have to cram two phobias I do know into one..I call it: agoracousticophobia, the fear of the noise of large crowds. I was sitting at dinner in Earls today, and sitting at my table, listening to the cacophony of people and cars and dishes rattling and the like was steadily making me more and more uncomfortable. I wouldn't say that I was physically afraid, but I could feel flight or fight impulses taking over. My ears were becoming very sensitive to the near-randomness of the conversations drifting in and out of earshot. Likewise with walking down Robson St. in Vancouver. I'm almost forced to shut off my brain temporarily and drift on automatic, focussing on some deep down need to get home to the quiet.   Thankfully, I do have an explanation for this fear. I have one regularly occuring dream that continues to haunt me. I am in a large dark cavern-like place. I hear what sounds like a ball rolling towards me. The rolling sound becomes louder and louder and the cavern I am in becomes smaller and smaller. The closer the sound gets, the worse it sounds; like static on a radio mixed with screams and horns and any noise you can think of. At the same time I feel the weight of whatever is approaching slowly pushing me. I fall to my knees, cover my ears with my hands and cannot block out the sounds or the feelings. I feel myself almost shrinking in response to my 'attacker'...I welcome my shrinking as I will be less likely to be crushed if I am small enough to pass by. The sound-ball/shrinking-cavern collapses on me and I wake up screaming. Disconcerting to say the least; I've had this dream many times.   Let's see what the DREAM DICTIONARY tells us:   Shrink  To dream that you are shrinking, suggests that you lack self-confidence and self-esteem. You may also feel embarrassed or unimportant in some situation. Perhaps you feel that you have been overlooked by others. Alternatively, the dream may refer to a time were you were young and small and thus symbolic of your childhood.   No one would say that I lack self-confidence or self-esteem so I'll have to scratch that one off.  Cave  To dream that you are walking in a dark cave, signifies refuge or the unconscious mind. It also denotes that you experience some unexpected misfortune or disagreement.   A little vague. Who hasn't experienced misoftune or disagreement?  Noise  To hear a strange noise in your dream, signifies the unexpected and the unknown. You may be expressing some fear or confusion concerning a particular situation in your waking life. The noise in your dream may serve as a way to attract your attention to that issue. Alternatively, noise may represent a breakthrough in your personal struggles. Perhaps you have burst through a barrier of resistance which had been holding you back for a long time.   Or maybe I've watched Indiana Jones too many times :)  Darkness  To dream that darkness comes upon you, signifies failure in work you may attempt. Darkness is synonymous with ignorance, the unconscious, evil, death, and fear of the unknown. To dream that you are lost in the darkness, denotes feelings of desperation, depression, or insecurity.   No dream dictionaries have anything with regards to being crushed...very disappointing :(   So, now that you know what you fear, how do you conquer those fears? Or should I save those for another day?

      I've just signed up with this new blogger, and I must say that I am enjoying it so far. Everything is easy to read and it is well organized! I guess all I have to do now is find stuff to write about - without boring you all to death...  Last week I called my 'money guy' to see if I could cash in some of my RRSP's and growth funds so that I could have some money to play with. I'm moving next month and need the extra cash to set up stuff and to get a phone line installed... yadda yadda. Today I got a call from this guys secretary. She wants me to write a letter to them asking for "Full surrender of the policy" I've never done anything like this before and had no idea what to write. So I kept it nice and simple. Hopefully I'll have the money soon so I can start planning the move - renting the truck, getting boxes etc.   I went and looked at a basement suite yesterday. It's so much better then the apartment I'm living in now. This new place has a new kitchen, new bathroom, comes with a  piano  (whee!) and has a cool security system. The only bad thing about it is that the bedroom is super small - so what I would end up doing is giving my couch and bed to my sister, and buy a hideabed, then use the bedroom as a computer room/study area. Which wouldn't be too bad :) Its close to the university I'm going to, which is the main selling point. After looking at the place, I explored the neighbourhood a bit - I'm close to the skytrain, a lake, a park and the grocery store. I really hope I get this place!

      So I've decided to venture into the world of blogging.  Joy!  Gathering from the posts I've read here for about a year, I've come to one sad conclusion...My life is just not that exciting...But don't let that detour you from reading my posts!  I'm sure from time to time you've enjoy the trivial things that is my life, so lets get this sorted then.  Most of you know I'm from Eastern Canada, which can sometimes be a great thing, and sometimes, like when it comes to airfare, a horrible thing.  I've been looking at flights to such places as London (YES MATT, I HAVE LOOKED INTO GOING TO BOMO, STOP ASKING!), as well as the recently announced Canadameet 3.  I have a hidden agenda though by going to Can3...One being visiting other friends and family.  I have scattered friends that have moved from home to venture for work, and it would be nice to finally visit them for a change.  Not to mention, I won't have to convert my canadian play money! w00t!  Anyway, flights from Fredericton are terrible, as many from the area can attest to.  Unless you get to a major airport city like Montreal or Toronto (Maybe Halifax to a lesser extent), you might as well tack on an extra 500/person just to get you there.  TERRIBLE!  So needless to say, here's waiting for a seat sale.  Today was a nice relaxing day at work, for a change.  They've having Employee Appreciation Day for the customer site I work on, and they invited us to join in on the festivities.  Very nice of them to do so I might add.  They just served us catered lunch and I'm stuffffffed.  I guess I'll end here, instead of rambling on my first blog.  So there goes my blogger cherry, and I'll never get it back again :(

      Right.  Let the blogging re-commence (and this time on blogger, so it's officially blogging and not greymattering like before, or something.)  Um, yeah.  I've finally found a free ten minute window to write something down in (although as I say that, here comes my boss to ask some random question...)  Anyway, it's been a hectic few days.  The biggest saga is that my roommate has graduated and is now off to San Francisco in a month for a job.  This leaves me considering options for housing in the near future, with the favorite being to stay in my current place and find a new roommate or two (it's a 3 BR place), but of course this requires either screening random wackos who answer a classified ad, or hunting down people I know who can get out of rental agreements in short order.  Human interaction, of course, is not something that I have any semblance of skill in.  So we'll see where this leads over the next few weeks.  Meanwhile I find myself playing on two crappy soccer teams (and before you ask, they were crappy BEFORE I joined, although I'm not going to help the situation any.)  This would be fine and dandy if it weren't nearly 90F (~32C) outside all week and we actually had subs.  As much as I enjoy running around for 90 minutes at that temperature, there's a point where there's just no more fluid to sweat out.  Hmm.  Maybe I can find a roommate who has an interest in soccer.  Oh, and book your seats now on the Lorax Express to Trail/Fruitvale in October.  We're aiming for new world record times.

      After a long few days of scanning, editing, creating sites and uploading - my pictures page is finally complete.  What did I do thats different?  Well, I basically used one of those thumbnail thingies so its easier for people to glance through them.  The hardest files were the meet photos, but, thankfully, its all done now.  The only thing is that I'm going to have to do still is upload the videos and sort through those.  I haven't quite decided how I'm going to do that so we'll see...  In other news, things are slowly calming down here. I'm starting to feel somewhat better although if it would rain and the heat would go away it would make it a lot easier.  Something about hot weather just makes me feel a bit crankier.  Apparently, we're not expecting and cooler weather till Sunday.  Blah!  I think its just because I hate cooking in such heat as well.  I like to leave things till later on days like these - like last night.  Adam and I walked along the highway to the end of Old Salmo road and walk up it.  It was really dark but so quiet and nice.  Thats the thing about this area though - its a small town and with that you can see almost every star on a clear night.  Thats what our hammock is for.  Late night, backyard cuddling :)  In the coming weeks I also will have the pain of shopping for a bathing suit.  I have no idea what happened to mine from last year (maybe left it at my dad's?) but now I need a new one.  Its a pain because its just impossible to find anything you like in a small town like this.  Well not totally impossible but it requires a lot of time and effort.  Lastly, Adam and I have decided to hold a meet here this coming October.  Surprisingly, we already have some good numbers signing up for it (even with some international people!).  Hopefully it will turn out as great as CAN2 did and with even more people.  We haven't even told all the locals yet so we'll see.  So please sign up if you're interested or even check out the website: http://canadameet.xtine.ca/  Now I need to lay down... see ya :)

      *taps on the screen* Is this thing working? Seems to be, thanks Melia!   So, back to the title. I've heard quite a few people saying something similar today - I guess when it's grey and doesn't stop raining you do have to ask if it really is summer given that it is mid-June. It's only when you realise that Wimbledon started on Monday and you cast your mind back to last year and the year before (and the year before...you get the picture!) that you realise it's the same every year. Here in the UK we've enjoyed some gorgeous weather with temperatures hotter than most of Europe and clear blue skies filled with sun - so we're more than a little pissed off that the annual two weeks of June rain has descended once more.  Hopefully summer - in the form of sun and hot weather - will return once Tim Henman has won Wimbledon and England have won Euro 2004 and we can get back to complaining about how it's far too hot ;) I guess the English are never happy when it comes to the weather...but we wouldn't have it any other way ;)

      So I got the job. Yes I hear everyone I've been pestering for the past couple of weeks with my mounting anxiety breathing a sigh of relief now that they know I won't bug them anymore. Now I shall gratefully accept all of the 'I told you so's and sit back and breathe my own contented sigh of relief.  Mo' money. Mo' vacation time. And to top it off, I can stay on at the hospital on a sort of "contract" basis. It's not really contracting, they call it 'pool' status which I guess means I join a pool of employees they can call on to do stuff. But I can transition in whomever takes over my job here, as well as carry on doing the 'outside of my job description' work I do for other departments like Powerpoint storyboards and newsletters etc. So I'll have a small secondary income which will be really nice.  Finally I can begin to dig out of the hole I'm in. It's a shallow hole, I don't have the huge amounts of debt hanging over me that some people have. I have no credit cards, mortgages or anything. I just have your basic, normal bills that somehow amounted to more than I earn currently and have been steadily piling up as I juggle them. But anyway, no more. I am not going to be going on any wild spending sprees now that I'll have a bit more cash flow but I may break down and buy myself a new crockpot :)  Anyway, that's my final update on this whole thing. I start in 2 weeks. I've given my notice here and now I have to clear out 4 years of accumulated crap out of my office. Wheeee!

      I'm all moved into the new place.  Now the fun begins: unpacking!  I hate to clean and put stuff away.  This is probably going to take a while.  Actually the biggest motivator for all of it is trying to find stuff you know you have... somewhere.  Like for the last week I've been wearing tank tops if I go anywhere outside, not only because it's warm outside, but because I have NO IDEA WHERE ALL MY BRAS HAVE GONE.  I actually unpacked a bunch of clothes cause I have to work tomorrow and, well, as much as I've embraced the hippie within, I don't think I can get away bra-less in summer in an office.  For that matter, I dunno if I want to.  I'm covering for a receptionist at a placement agency where they place a lot of factory workers with many social disabilities.  And Friday is payday.  Guess where they'll be?  Maybe I'll just be able to send them off without any sort of problems if I wear a skirt tomorrow. :)  I've spent the last three days coating the hardwood floor in the other unit with polyurethane (takes 24 hours to dry between coats).  Anyway, inevitably, the stuff ends up on me.  Mostly my legs, cause I'm working on hands and kneees, but I got a couple of nice spots on my hands too.  Now, imagine this.  The Minwax polyurethane is largely a clearcoat, but it's got a slightly brownish tinge to it.  Now try to imagine clearcoating your skin with a polymer that'll dry hard ;).  And it doesn't wash off.  It's like superglue.  You have to wait for your skin to wear off, cause if you pick at it it takes your whole dermal layer with it.  It's really frigging hot in here.  I have this nice finished attic, but guess where all the heat in the house goes, naturally :)  Kids, they're not kidding.  Heat DOES rise.  See, you can learn all sorts of useless information at school :)  Anyway, last comic standing is on!  I'm outtie :)

      Hello.   I haven't posted recently, mostly because I've been busy with work and such - these things happen.&nbsp; At present, my work mainly entails showing grossly over-paid,&nbsp;incredibly neurotic people who have incredibly short attention spans how to accomplish ostensibly simple tasks on the computer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these tasks&nbsp;become infinitely more difficult when no one listens to explanations, and no one does.&nbsp; So, after 8 hours at the office, my time comprised predominately of 20-minute segments in which I explain such computer subtleties as the difference between a "right click" and a "left click," I am usually quite ready to jump off a rather large bridge.   Sadly, I don't have the balls.   In other news, I saw a new musical tonight, music and lyrics by Steven Sondheim, starring (and written by) Nathan Lane.&nbsp; It's a very free adaptation of the Aristophanes Play, "The Frogs," in which Dionysos and his slave Xanthias go to the underworld to try and brimg back a playwright to save mankind.&nbsp; The original version of the play was laden with political satire and subtle humor, as was&nbsp;Lane's adaptation (for instance, the frogs who attack pre-emptively but then can't remember why they attacked in the first place).&nbsp; It was sort of funny, but mainly disjointed and all-together not worth the money.&nbsp; It was fun seeing Nathan Lane 10-feet from my face, I admit, but somehow it wasn't quite as epiphanic (is that a word?)&nbsp;a moment as I had envisioned.&nbsp;  You probably could've&nbsp;done something more productive with the minute it took you to read this post.  End.  &nbsp;

      So I have my interview on Tuesday morning with the paper and my nerves are beginning to jangle. I haven't done this in several years.&nbsp;I had a phone interview last week that (I thought) went very well after spending a nerve-wracking couple of days waiting for the call. I'm a worrier and I overthink everything. I don't want to, but it just happens. I'd love to be Miss Laidback, everything's cool, no worries. But I'm finding that I am just not that way.  The director set up a phoner with me for "sometime Tuesday afternoon or anytime Wednesday." Of course I said I'm available but I wish I would have pushed for a specific time. I'm also maybe a little *too* accomodating. I'm one of those people who will be at your beck and call if I'm needed (in a work situation that is. Don't get any ideas.) So of course I tell her I'm available at her convenience which I've read is not necessarily a good thing. But anyway, I figure it's like picking a jury - it's unpredictable. She may have appreciated me accomodating her, then again maybe she wasn't. See? I'm overthinking it already and it all happened last week.  Anyway, no call on Tuesday and by 4pm Wednesday I'm beginning to panic. What if she hired some else? What if she changed her mind? What do&nbsp;I do if she doesn't call? Do I then have to bother her with a call or email? What if I do that and I end up sounding desperate and annoying? See what I mean? I'm sure I drove poor Cathy (in my office) nuts with my edginess. Thankfully, she called at 4:15 and I figured she was probably just leaving it til the end of the day since she was calling me at work to do this.   The call went well as I said. We talked about the possibilty of moving to another town and whether that would appeal to me. It would if the town were Lincoln or Omaha, but the town she named is crap and I don't want to live there. So she said that was okay, she had positions open here in town as well. Then we went over my experience and what sort of things I'm comfortable working with. She cracked a joke or two, I laughed but kept my joke-making at a minimum. I crack jokes when I'm nervous and they mostly fall flat. Then we set up a time to meet face-to-face and she emailed me the official job description and rang off.  Soooo, I've been purposely keeping my mind off the interview as much as I can all weekend but as the time inches closer, I can feel it in my toes. My skin is tingly, my muscles are tense and my brain's going a million miles an hour. Tomorrow I'll be looking over example interview questions, trying to get a couple of my references to write me something because I'm not sure if I should do that or just provide their names and numbers. All this resume/interview etiquette stuff is doing my head in. I just want the job. The money would be better, the job more interesting and fast-paced, I'd get to work on a team rather than holed up in my little cave on my own working for a company with great people, but ssslllooooww progress and low pay.  I'm going to shutup now :) This is all arse-numbingly dull I'm sure. I return you to Fire's use of the word 'Meme' and Narmer's dating adventures.

      After waiting way too long, I have finally booked my ticket to B10!! Although, this will be my sixth meet, it will be the first in England, and my first trip ever to England.&nbsp; Somewhat embarassing for me, as I have now been living in Europe for 4 years. So I will have to leave my "comfort zone" of German-speaking Europe for that strange uncivilized south coast of England.&nbsp; I am sure they are no longer running around in purple paint as the Romans found them 2000 years ago&nbsp;or so ;)  Anyways, I feel a lot better now that I have finally gotten a ticket.&nbsp; I plan to go with my fellow Swiss residents, Reethi and Sunshine, both of which are Bomo veterans and should know how to deal with things unknown to me such as trains that are not on time ;).&nbsp; Hmm.. I shall have to get a few pounds (the money type) as well.  It will only be four days, but I think I should get the "core Bomo" experience. All of the previous meets I have been to have been on the European continent.&nbsp; As most of the attendees were from the UK, they have always been sort of "tourist meets," in which visits to the nearby tourist destinations have been one of the key attractions.&nbsp; I think Bomo will be different.&nbsp; For me, of course, just going to England will be fascinating.&nbsp;   I have had many a chance to go to England before, including an offer of a "free trip" thanks to the generosity of a woman who was "desperate" for company, but like an idiot, always turned them down (partly because of pressure from my father who thought England would be no challenge as they speak "English".  So now that my credit card is charged, it looks like I better go..!

      I'm probably not adding this right. Oh well, nothing else has been right today. &nbsp; Paul is home (thank God). Matthew and Sarah are in bed. I just fed Jamie. I was in tears (and still am, off and on) when I picked up Paul. I know he hates coming home to this kind of thing when he's had a long day at work. I mean, it's gotta be hell working with nekkid women all day huh? The demands on him. Poor guy:) But seriously, I know he has long hard days and I really hate the fact that he has to come home with me in tears.  I also hate the way I feel after hard days with Jamie. It always seems to be Jamie. I hate the way I feel because I feel like I am failing as a mother. I get sooooo mad at him and end up screaming at the child and I'm sure by the end of the day he's pretty sick of it too. I mean, it can't be fun staying in trouble all day. I love that little boy to death. I can not imagine my life without him. He's my little buddy but when he has bad days, he has BAD&nbsp;days.&nbsp; Tonight while he was eating supper, I was sitting in the living room waiting for him to eat and he came over to me and laid his head down on me and said, "Don't you have any medicine in the kitchen for me?" THAT broke my heart. I tried to explain that the medicine isn't what makes him a good boy, that he has to learn to control himself as well. He&nbsp; knows that something is different but I don't want him to think the medicine is what 'makes him a good boy'. He has to learn to take responsibility himself. But it's been so long since he's been that hyper and uncontrollable. All I keep coming back to though after we fight is how much I love him and don't want him to think otherwise. I would die if he thought I didn't.&nbsp;

      God I'm in such a friggin HORRIBLE mood. Horrible horrible horrible. It's just been a bad day from the moment I got up. Jamie didn't get his meds(adhd) today. I ran out. So he's been literally BOUNCING off the walls. He can't be quite for two seconds and made the biggest scene in Meijers. He's back talked me and defied everything I've told him. I've lost track of all the punishments I've given out. From what I can remember, he's grounded thru Sunday. No bicycle, no cd player, no gameboy or xbox and no one will be coming over to play and he's not going anywhere. I called his doctor yesterday to ask her for a refill on his meds. I went and picked&nbsp;it up today and rushed it up to the pharmacist who said, "Oh ready in 20 minutes". Thank GOD. Only 20 more minutes of this craziness .... I can do this. 20 minutes later, I rushed back up to the pharmacy to pick up the presciption only for them to say "We called the doctor to make sure we could give him the generic and they said sure HOWEVER the prescription is written for tomorrow and she wouldn't ok it for today". WHAT THE F***!?!?!?!?!?! Does she KNOW the day I've had?? Does she not UNDERSTAND what a parent goes through??? OMFG.  All of this on top of the stupid Dodge dealership was supposed to install our dvd player in our car this morning. I called them at 830 this morning to make sure we were still on to bring the car in. Well, no, apparently the guy didn't write the appointment down in the books. SO, no one knew what was going on. They were also supposed to give us an extra key and a driver's manual. The guy said he was going to have to order the dvd player to match our interior and no one could tell me anything about it. So, Dave (the guy I spoke to on the phone), said he'd call me riiiight back and let me know what was going on (remember this is 830) Two hours later and 3 phone calls back to them, he told me to call back at 2 and speak to Jamie (great another Jamie problem to deal with).&nbsp; I told Dave that I was not happy and that we've never had anything go smooth with any of the Thomas Dealerships (Kia or Dodge) and that it was always a huge hassle. I told him that he'd better be glad I called up there before I came, because had I come up there and had to sit with 3 kids, they would have had a VERY unhappy female on their hands---poor guy had no idea what to say... Anyway, yeah, so 2 o'clock rolls on and I call the dealership. I had about a 5 minute run around with the girl who answers saying that Jamie would just end up transferring me back to her anyway, so I mine as well talk to her. I told her he'd best not do that and I'd like to speak to him NOW, please. So she finally got him on the phone and he said, "Oh yeah, you were supposed to come in" I told him what went on that morning and he said, "Well we dont do that work here, we send it down the street". I asked him why he didn't tell me that and why did he say that they'd have to order it? He never gave me a direct answer but played it off like it was me who was the idiot for not going in.&nbsp; *deep breathes* SOOOoooo, we will be trying this again on Thursday.  Ok, I must go now and pick up my husband from the train station so he can enjoy this terrible mood that I am in. God, I feel sorry for him, bless his heart:( &nbsp;

      Well, what to rant about first?&nbsp; My weekend was one of complete ups and downs. &nbsp; Starting off with last Friday.&nbsp; I got to work, called Aliant to find out what was going on and low and behold, they'd fixed all my phone bill problems!&nbsp; That's a big woo hoo!&nbsp; Then some good stuff happened here at work regarding some bad stuff that had gone on last week.&nbsp; I wasn't directly involved, but part of my job was.&nbsp; But they got it all fixed.&nbsp; I got some major praise from my boss on a letter regarding a union raise, which I luckily get.&nbsp; But on top of that letter, was a little note from some anonymous person, which read "Thank you for being so helpful and patient with my computer problems.&nbsp; You show so much more patience than some of your fellow staff members."&nbsp; I felt really good that people appreciate that I try to be friendly with everyone and as patient as possible.&nbsp; The day whiddled on and I got some work done, working with Scott most of the morning and some of the afternoon.&nbsp; When 4:30 rolled around, I was quite pumped and excited.&nbsp; Scott and I rolled out, to head to the 'pop shop' to grab some beverages for the small trip we were going on this weekend.&nbsp; &nbsp; On arrival in the parking lot, Scott's cell rang, with Sue telling Scott to tell me to call home asap.&nbsp; That's when I found out my Grandmother Cameron had passed away peacefully in her sleep.&nbsp; She had been running a temperature of 38 degrees or more most all of last Friday.&nbsp; My parents had been called up to sit with her at 5am that day.&nbsp; So my 'high' came to a crashing end.&nbsp; We had had plans to do a lot of stuff on the weekend and I was unsure of what to do.&nbsp; My parents only had a minute to talk, because they had appointments to keep.&nbsp; So I was left sitting on the outside looking in for the next 2 hours while I awaited their return home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott, Sue and I, along with some other friends, had plans to see a musical performance that night, called Good Vibrations, and I really wanted to go to meet a few of the other people (all girls, of only one which I was interested in meeting).&nbsp; So when my parents and I talked, we decided that I would not go home for the funeral.&nbsp; And after talking some more, my Mom broke down.&nbsp; And much to my chagrin, I had to break down and tell her that since my plans for B10 had fallen through, that I was coming home on August 2nd.&nbsp; That cheered her up very much and made my night.&nbsp; So off to the performance I went, met some new friends and enjoyed the 3 hours of live folk music covers! &nbsp; Saturday, Scott, Sue and I were up and away for the fireworks display in the Crows Nest Pass called "Thunder in the Valley", which is in the valley of the mountains.&nbsp; Along on our trip, was Amanada, who had been out with us the night before and going to see the fireworks with Susan and friends from work.&nbsp; We had an interesting day, enjoyed the fireworks and had a really great time.&nbsp; I was totally doing my own personal celebration of my Grandmother's life, totally enhaling liquor like it was going out of style.&nbsp; I apparently was described as a cute cuddly bear, a total riot, and that crazy guy from down East.&nbsp; I'm glad I kept everyone quite amused and that only Scott, Sue and Katherine (Sue's friend from work, who's parents house we were all staying) knew that I was kinda in the dumps.&nbsp; I had a great time and enjoyed myself, even if some&nbsp;engaged beaver somehow found it's way out that night.&nbsp; I had mentioned to a couple of other people that night what had happened, but only the people who I knew a bit better and was comfortable talking to, like Katherine's bf, Lucas and Amanda, who was quickly becoming a friend.&nbsp; She's from 'down East' too and was a nice reminder of home for me. &nbsp; Sunday we came back, I talked to my parents several times throughout the day about the wake and how things went.&nbsp; It's suprising that close to 300 people went to an old woman's wake.&nbsp; My parents were so happy to see friends, family and people come to give their condolances for an 'old woman' that people had probably forgotten about. &nbsp; Monday, I took a bereavement day and waited patiently by the phone (as in I slept) until my mother called to let me know that the funeral had gone ok and that the Minister and a family friend had done a beautiful job with the service and the eulogy respectively.&nbsp; &nbsp; Today, I'm back to work, and things are starting to sink in.&nbsp; I've always been the 'rock' in my family.&nbsp; The one who can bottle it all up, until after everyone is ok and things are settled.&nbsp; Then I have my break down.&nbsp; I'm sure in the next day or two, it will come at some inopportune time and I'll feel like a jackass.&nbsp; Only management and my co-workers know what happened. &nbsp; But on a perky note, I'm feeling much better now that I've spammed you all with lots of useless crap, that most of you will have known or not and that it's all off of my chest.&nbsp; So I will be blogging again soon, but until then, &nbsp; Tune in next time, same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!

      &nbsp; I hate diets. I've always hated dieting. I love to eat, LOVE to eat. My fridge is stocked, I have a separate freezer to hold the mounds of steaks and chicken breasts I eat. I even took culinary classes in college to learn how to cook better. &nbsp; On the same note I love health and fitness. I run about 30-35 miles a week, I lift weights an hour a day and I do strenuous stretching three times a day. &nbsp; On a third note I hate doctors and I hate going to the doctor. I've well known as someone who gives doctors and nurses a hard time and I'm generally difficult to perform the simplist checkup. &nbsp; So needless to say last week I'm in the doctor's office and the nurse (god bless her) is getting a usual earful from me about why she's doing this and I'm paying the doctor when all he does it come in and give me a pat on the shoulder before telling me to come back in six months. She smiles because she knows I really give him a hard time about doing the things mentioned above and getting paid large sums for this. &nbsp; Anyway, I step on the scale and it reads 246, around 15 pounds above my weight. 15 Pounds!...Well the scale must surely be broken and I'm not level the office until I get a second reading from another scale...Hmm 246 again...I go to one of the supermarket scales and it's 246...Sonofabitch...246 pounds...Well I don't feel any different, I don't look any different and my clothes fit the same...So what the fuck? &nbsp; Well apparently I'm getting older and my eating habits are that of Corey at 24 instead of Corey at (soon to be) 29. So I was told to research my eating routine for the last 10 years and examine how much it changed. &nbsp; Most people don't have a documented eating routine from 10 or more years but doc knows that I used to play college football (actually I got a scholarship for playing college football and flamed out with a knee problem) and I saved my eating plan from that and actually reduced my food intake based on that chart about six years ago. &nbsp; So for the end of part one, I'm going to give you my eating schedule when I was 18 years old at the University of Tennessee, where I was on scholarship to play football. Now the football program had a group of nutrition and health workers to keep us on our schedule six days a week (Sunday was an official junk food day)...The food intake is borderline scary but be reminded that it was made for me to gain about&nbsp;25-30 pounds and get from my high school weight of about 215 to the weight of a football linebacker...So here was Corey's daily schedule as taken from my file (I'd scan it but my scanner ain't cooperating) &nbsp; &nbsp; 6:30 a.m.&nbsp; Voluntary Cardio workout &nbsp; 7:10 a.m.&nbsp; Weight training &nbsp; 8:00 a.m.&nbsp; Breakfast (Mushroom omelet of 6 eggs (4 eggs whites, two full eggs) side of potatoes or grits, two slices of wheat toast, one glass OJ, one glass skim milk, and as much water as he wants; Three days a week I had mushroom, three days a week I had a cheese omelet and a side of turkey bacon). &nbsp; 9:00 a.m. I think I had a class...or an angioplasm... &nbsp; 10:00 a.m.&nbsp; Mid-Morning snack (Oatmeal with banana, strawberries, brown sugar, and milk). &nbsp; 11:00 a.m. Probably had a class...or went to the bathroom. &nbsp; 12:30 p.m. Mandatory cardio workout (yay, running in 95 degree Tennessee heat) &nbsp; 1:00 p.m. Lunch (Two sandwiches [usually turkey, tuna&nbsp;or roast beef for me] and two bowls of fruit and at least two glasses of water) &nbsp; 2:00 p.m. Probably had a class [My class schedule ended at about 3 every day] &nbsp; 3:15 p.m. Specialized health shake (Usually some blueberry, banana, honey mix with too much protein powder) &nbsp; 3:30 p.m. Practice &nbsp; 6:30 p.m. Dinner&nbsp;(Two grilled chicken breasts (or a big steak/prime rib if I was lucky), two baked potatos, two vegetables, some sort of bread. At least two glasses of water and a glass of icea tea: On two days I'd usually have a heavy dose of pasta and salad).  &nbsp; 9:00 p.m. Late Evening snack (Usually a couple bowls of fruit) &nbsp; Okay that was what I was forced at 18...In Part 2, I'll tell you about my necessary diet and my high cholesterol (SURPRISE!) &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I usually am a strong opponent of tobacco. I really don't like the stuff.&nbsp; As a teen, I did try a few cigarettes under peer pressure, but only as in the Bill Clinton "didn't inhale" style.&nbsp; Tonight, I ran into my first new experience with tobacco in many a year.&nbsp;  &nbsp; After work, I sometimes go to a pool hall where I will play a few games and talk to people.&nbsp; Tonight, after a few games, the people I were with pulled out a small can and began doing their ritual of pouring two spots of powder onto the back of their hands.&nbsp; This powder was snuff. I have seen them do it before, but have refused to take part in it before.&nbsp; Before, I could say anygthing, somebody had already poured it onto the back of my hand and I realized I was in this round.&nbsp; Oh well..I have always learned, as was the case with alcohol, if you just do it once, people will get their kick watching you do it and then will leave you alone.&nbsp; So I decided to do the snort and just get it over with. &nbsp; To my surprise, it was nothing like tobacco, but rather more like a "Fisherman's Friend" backed up into your nose or a Vick's inhaler.&nbsp; Very strong methol rush.&nbsp; I even agreed to one more later in the evening.&nbsp; Hopefully, I am not addicted ;) &nbsp; As for web links, I won't bore you with details, but a few that I visit regularly include &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.google.com &nbsp;- I like the news summaries here as there is always more than one version of the story. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.cnn.com &nbsp;- A fast roundup of the news, but usually they have a headline dealing with Iraq which is a real turnoff to me. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.cinescape.com &nbsp;- A sci fi /fantasy movie and tv website done by the publishers of the magazine of the same name. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.trektoday.com &nbsp;- A daily roundup of all the latest Star Trek news. &nbsp; Nothing too much more interesting to post!

      Welcome to the second edition of "Adventures with Kitties" starring Tigger as "Little Bastard" and Pooh as "Little Bitch"!    In today's episode, it is early Monday morning and I've just gotten out of the shower. As I am applying moisturizer to my skin I hear some strange sounds coming from the living room. I walk towards the sounds and immediately see Tigger sitting up on the ledge looking down at the front door. At what? I have no clue. Its obviously a cat thing.    I walk a bit further in and see that the cover is off one of the heating vents on the floor near the living room window. My first thought is "Crap, Pooh is in the vents!" so I walk over, remove the whole thing and start calling to her. I hear nothing. I'm wondering what to do and I consider getting the catnip as bait for her. I replace the cover for the vent because god knows Tigger would certainly climb in (he's done it before). I turn around and, to my surprise and amusement, there is Pooh outside at the back door meowing to get in.     I let her in but I'm a bit puzzled as to how she even got out there. As far as I'm aware, I don't think the vents lead outside - at least not that quickly/directly. The only other option I can think of is that she went through the living room window. See, we don't have a screen on that window just yet - and last night I left it slightly open so as to let in the cool night air. The thing is that it wasn't open any more than 3 inches but maybe thats enough. If she did escape that way she had quick the long drop down!    Cats are just weird.  Or maybe thats just our cats :)    Anyhoo, today I feel normal. And what I mean by that is that we went to a wedding this weekend and I got really nicely toasted - so I'm now feeling non-alcoholic and, thus, normal. Its been quite some time since I had that much wine - and it wasn't even all that much! I guess we've got to get into "condition" before Canadameet though! ;)    So now Adam and I are thinking of doing something for the long weekend in August - but we're not sure just what yet. Maybe camping? We might just go back to Sullivan Lake or maybe do something else. Suggestions anyone? It has to be something close to here as we're trying to save $$ to renovate our upstairs bathroom.    But now I must get ready for work... Ciao!

      Well then. I haven't posted in a while now, and apparently my loyal fanbase is demanding that issue be rectifyed with all due haste. I'll skip the trials and tribulations of my personal life for the moment (and frankly, if you don't know me, why do you care anyway?) and instead jump to the meme at hand -- namely, where I surf on a regular basis.    Morning tends to start with a bit of cereal and  dose of the real news from...   urlLink CNN  - well okay, this is more like news-lite, but it at least tells me the world hasn't blown up overnight.   urlLink The Seattle Post-Intelligencer  - one of the two daily papers here, and IMHO the more even-handed.  And of course, as Melia mentioned,  urlLink Fark ... your one-stop shop for Discussion/Weird News before it gets posted there.    So then it's off to work.  My exciting work-related links feature some of the following...   urlLink University of Washington  - They give me a student ID, I get discounts places.  It's a great relationship.   urlLink Dept of Genome Sciences  - My department.  Find my awful ID badge picture in the Students section.   urlLink FlyBase  - The one-stop shop for all  Drosophila melanogaster  related biological information. Everything from the complete genome sequence to proteomic interaction information. Look up your favorite gene, like  cheap date  or  Npc1b  (the gene I work on!)  urlLink  National Center For Biotechnology Information  (NCBI) - the National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine clearinghouse for all biomedical science information. Contains sequence for practically every organism that has any DNA sequenced, protein sequences, scientific journal references, etc.  urlLink  Entrez-Pubmed  @ NCBI - The Google of biomedical scientific journal article references. Handy for when you want to look up if anyone has studied the effects of excessive internet usage on brain tumor formation.    Well, work's boring. So I've got plenty of fun bookmarks around to keep me occupied and looking like I'm busy annotating some DNA sequences or something.  I'll spare you the tcz ones and move along.   urlLink BBspot  - A daily satire site that also features links of the day to all sorts of entertainment, flash games and the like.   urlLink NationStates  - A website spun-off of Max Barry's book Jennifer Government. Create your own nation and rule it with an iron fist as legislation passes your desk. Come join us in the TCZ region.   urlLink Digital Archive Project  - An online project to use eMule for good instead of evil. These wonderful people have gathered listings of all sorts of quality television programming that has gone off the air and is not available for sale in proper (VHS or DVD) formats, and provides the information and wherewithal to download episodes in AVI format for your personal viewing pleasure. Their most popular item is the entirity of MST3k, but other things include most of the series from Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, and some classic shows like Pete &amp; Pete.   urlLink Sluggy Freelance  - Worship the comic.  If I was able to get Fire hooked, I can get you hooked as well.   urlLink KEXP 90.3  - A local independent music station that's almost entirely listener-supported. The breadth and depth of this station are almost beyond words, and their website is a work of art. They have shows ranging from indie rock to jazz to reggae to African beats to electronica to rockabilly. They offer live streaming of all their broadcasts in numerous formats (including 1.4 mbps uncompressed!), a two-week streaming archive of all shows and permanent archives of the numerous artists who appear and do in-studio performances. They also have the honor of being the first group to ever wean money out of me at a pledge drive multiple years running, so that should tell you something about their quality.    Nerd links (because who doesn't have a few hiding in their bookmark folder?)   urlLink National Earthquake Information Clearninghouse  (USGS) - Near-realtime listing of all moderate-to-major earthquakes on the planet, with all sorts of geological and historical information to boot.   urlLink Operational Siginifcant Event Imagery  (NOAA) - Cool imagery from NOAA weather satellites of things like hurricanes, forest fires, floods and other funkiness. Lots of good candidate desktop background images.   urlLink Astronomy Picture Of the Day  (NASA) - A new and often damn cool astronomy-related picture every day. They often have beautiful images from Hubble and the numerous other telescopes now peering deeper and deeper into the far reaches of the universe. Also lots of potential desktop backgrounds.   urlLink Jet Propulsion Laboratory  (NASA) - The home of the Mars Rovers and Cassini mission to Saturn, among other interstellar adventures. Another site for all sorts of cool space-related photographs.   urlLink The IHOZ Interstate Page  - The most comprehensive listing of US Interstate information around. I can't believe I just admitted to bookmarking this site, either. But wait...   urlLink Kurumi's 3di page  (that's three-digit interstate, if you were wondering.) - That's right, information on all 3di's in the USA. Ever wonder how many Interstate 295s there really are? (seven.) Plus all sorts of historical information about highways that never got built for various reasons.    Right. That'll do you all for the time being, along with some others that have already been mentioned below. Now go off and learn all about the weird history of Interstate 90. Next post, three weeks.

      Current Tune: UK import  urlLink Jamie Curram  singing a Neptunes cover. This guy sounds like a soulful Harry Connick without the talent that Harry Connick has.   I'm always a little wary when people ask for my bookmarks because...well frankly not everything I see I want to share.   However I like most of you so I'll oblige with just a few of my favorite daily stops. Now just so you know I'm a news guy, I'm a sports news guy and most of my day revolves around my career, which comes through in my links.    Newspapers:  All the news that's fit to print.    urlLink The New York Times:  The gray old lady is still going strong. I usually hit the front pages and the Arts section after I get up and wash my face. Occasionally I'll check sports if Bill Rhoden has a column or Chris Broussard has a notebook but usually I check sports at...     urlLink Newsday:   Newsday is the only other non-tabloid in the New York Metro area (they are based out of Long Island). The  urlLink New York Daily News  and  urlLink New York Post  are the most famous tabloids in the world excluding Europe. The Newsday gives me the information I need on the Mets, Jets, and Islanders. A lot of the baseball stuff is reaching as the Times has all the good baseball writers, but they try. And also they are the best source for anything Amy Fisher.     urlLink The Ledger:   It's the local paper. I'm pissed because they still aren't sure if they are going to pick up my column and at times the stories are so single-focused that anyone outside of Central Florida couldn't relate. However a lot of my friends work here and they are good people.     urlLink St. Petersburg Times:   St. Pete used to be the best in Florida but now they are merely the best in the Tampa Bay area. Excellent features and business section.     urlLink Knight-Ridder Election Coverage:   This is links to all things 2004 election from the Knight-Ridder group of papers (Miami Herald, Philly Inquirer, etc.). They should be getting active in the next few weeks with the conventions kicking up.     News-Based Websites:  All the news that's 90% correct half the time.    urlLink  CNN:   Cable News Network is still the best and most respected in the business. It's not quirky and tacky like FOX but CNN doesn't employ Sean Hannity and that's a good thing.    urlLink  Google News:   I prefer this over Yahoo because they link wire and newsprint stories (which are usually copies of the wire story). And it's separated by topics. For Google updates you can check the unofficial  urlLink  Google weblog  .    urlLink The Smoking Gun:   The gun is as good as anyone in finding the great odd police blotters. It's where I found much of my material in the Debra Lafave sexual assault case.     Sports:  It's what I'm all about.     urlLink ESPN:   It's chicken soup for the sports lovers' soul. They are roughly three minutes faster on breaking sports news than the Associated Press because AP has to get clearance from their National Wire Editor before posting a bulletin.    urlLink  CBS Sportsline:   Not as good as ESPN but they have many more free options and a free rumor mill, the little things that ESPN makes one pay an insider fee for.     urlLink Sporting Fools:   This is my site that I run with AP Writer Mike Branom. We'll throw some current sports news up there and occasionally relay our opinions.  &nbsp;  urlLink  Ralph Wiley:   One of the best sports/culture writers of my generation. Wiley passed away in June, a week before I would be able to see him. I can read his ESPN.com archives here.  &nbsp;  urlLink  Bill Simmons:   Bill Simmons, once known as the Boston Sports Guy, is part sports, part entertainment. One of the last remaining NBA fans on earth and he enjoys The Karate Kid and gambling as much as I do. ESPN.com finally gave him his own page.     Entertainment:  Because Man Can't Live on News and Sports alone.      urlLink Electablog:   The best political blog on the net. It's run by Dave Pell and it's a cross between The Daily Show and Hardball. Excellent stuff.     urlLink Drudge Report:   I can't call this news because Matt Drudge is a Bush-flag waving jackass who can't break a story for shit. Despite Matt's pathetic attempts at being a journalist (all the while being an hourly insult to those of us who work hard in the profession) some things on his site are pretty funny. I take him with a grain of salt.     urlLink IMDB:   Whenever I'll looking to see if my proposed Billy Zabka/Frank Stallone/Charlie Sheen movie project will ever come to fruition. I look here.     urlLink College Football News:   I really can't call this sports because it's a fan site. However it's got Fox's backing and the webmaster is writing stuff in The Sporting News on the side. Overall it's a very impressive fan site dedicated to college football.     urlLink Soul Sides :  GREAT Audioblogger for the obscure lover of Hip-Hop, Soul, R&amp;B, Jazz and anything cultural from this era and the older days.     urlLink Whiskey Bar:   Political discussion disguised as bar discussion. Billmon was a lot more fun until he got caught up in the fraud known as the Bush Administration.     urlLink Warchant:   When I want to discuss the athletics of the greatest school on earth -- Florida State University (Nah, I'm not bias).     urlLink Talk Left -- The Politics of Crime:   All things for the bleeding heart liberal in all of us.     urlLink Air America Radio:   All things for the bleeding heart liberal in all of us, but who's too lazy to read the words on Talk Left.     urlLink Blog Maverick:   Mark Cuban's weblog. Cuban is a self-made billionaire and the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks franchise. His tips on business skills are often useful.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Games:  You all know, I play a little. &nbsp;  urlLink  Joystiq:   It's all about the video games here. Updates on new games, new systems, some demo shots.  &nbsp;  urlLink  XBox 2:   Unofficial weblog for the upcoming Microsoft system. I am an XBox owner and it is the greatest video game system on earth. I will not argue this. However if you perfer... &nbsp;  urlLink  Playstation 3:   ...that buggy, slow crap from Sony. I like to read up on the enemy as well. Generally these two weblogs have similar information.  &nbsp;   Travel:  /o~/I'm an everywhere man...I'm an everywhere man../o~/ &nbsp;  urlLink  Cheapo Vegas:   If you know me, you know I love Las Vegas. I've actually been able to call my last few Vegas trips work as I've covered boxing events there. Cheapo Vegas is a funny, informative site that gives you the real dirt on all the hotel/casinos in Sin City.  &nbsp;  urlLink  Las Vegas Advisor:   This is Anthony Curtis' tip site. I pay the few bucks a month to get an actual newsletter because they include many deals and coupons. I actually stayed at Mandalay Bay for $59/night one time thanks to a secret deal uncovered by Curtis. The free site is fine, check out the top 10 deals.   That's about all I look at everyday. Hopefully you'll check some of them out.

      Well, since Melia just absolutley ADORES creating time consuming memes, I'll just have to add my tuppence to this.  &nbsp;   Movies:   &nbsp; urlLink Aint It Cool News &nbsp;which is actually run on a really crappy server that is barely running half the time (Much like TCZ) and by an egotistical fat man (Much like TCZ) with a penchant for being very dirty about the most stupid things (Much like most TCZers)  &nbsp;   urlLink Dark Horizons &nbsp;is a FAR better website for news and gossip relating to upcoming movie projects and the like. He also has quite good interview skills and his reviews of movies seem very close to my opinion. He's yet to let me down heavily, unlike Big Fat Harry from Aint It Cool  &nbsp;   urlLink Apple Movie Trailers &nbsp;contains Quicktime trailers of all the latest movies coming out in a format that just blows the pants off of any streaming technologies like WMV and Real. They also have a lot of older movie trailers (circa 1998) for those who want to laugh about how bad movies used to be, way back when.  &nbsp;   urlLink IMDB &nbsp;is THE definitive resource for movie information. Ever wonder who played that guy, who did that thing, in that movie that year...This is where to look.  &nbsp;   Geek:   &nbsp;   urlLink Slashdot &nbsp;is news for nerds, stuff that matters...even if most the time it's just endless debate over how horrible Microsoft is and how our rights are being infringed every day of the week! Some decent nerdly stuff comes out occasionally though.  &nbsp;   urlLink Spiderfan.org &nbsp;is probably the best compendium of Spiderman related information anywhere.  &nbsp;   urlLink Gamespot , full of reviews, previews and information on any kind of game you can think of. Requires a subscription for some of the best stuff, but I'm cheap so I don't bother  &nbsp;   Blog:   &nbsp;   urlLink CMON &nbsp;is a bunch of hippies trying to compete with the local telco (that I work for) except their business plan is very dodgy. They recently got a whack load of money to do a feasibility study to see how much of a sucker local governments are (Ok, I mean to say they got money to study whether or not their business plan is feasible...talk about a loaded study, what are they going to say, "No, this is impossible, you'd waste your money on us if we did this")  &nbsp;   urlLink Doug Alders Blog &nbsp;is an old boss of mine that writes his conspiracy theories and complains about being old. I like reading it just to think I'll never be that bitter :)  &nbsp;   urlLink Belt0033's Blog &nbsp;is a&nbsp;boob. Plain and simple. An idiot who thinks he's smarter then he really is.  &nbsp;  This one, I like TCZ  &nbsp;   Community:     &nbsp;   urlLink Conservatism &nbsp;is full of people who espouse how great Bush is and how dumb Democrats/Liberals are. Run by a complete MORON (Belt0033) who will sooner ban&nbsp; you then even attempt civility.  &nbsp;   urlLink Republicans &nbsp;is full of people who espouse how great Bush is and how dumb Democrats/Liberals are. Not run by a complete MORON (I think he was banned for being too much of an idiot)  &nbsp;   urlLink Liberal &nbsp;is full of hippies who like to say all corporations are evil and that we should all just love each other.  &nbsp;   urlLink Martial Art &nbsp;is the community I started to get people interested in martial arts. I try to ask a question a day for people to respond to, trying to get people involved, trying to learn more, etc.  &nbsp;   News:     &nbsp;   urlLink Rush Limbaugh , you probably know who he is. Incredibly intelligent man, always right, etc etc.  &nbsp;   urlLink The Drudge Report &nbsp;is run by Matt Drudge, an internet muck-raker who is more often more wrong then right.  &nbsp;   urlLink Media Matters &nbsp;takes words spoken by Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'reilly and Fox News and unspins it with information backed up with facts. Rush and Bill both respond with the "left wing conspiracy" that is Media Matters  &nbsp;   urlLink Fox News &nbsp;is fair and balanced  &nbsp;   urlLink Canada.com &nbsp;is chock full of information about how much Canadians hate the US, how much the war in Iraq is failing, how ahead of the polls is Kerry against Bush, oh, and sometimes they mention Canada.  &nbsp;   urlLink Bowling For Truth &nbsp;is the Anti-Michael Moore site that started it all. Takes everything said in Bowling for Columbine and attempts to explain it away.  &nbsp;   urlLink Yahoo News &nbsp;is good for new&nbsp;information coming off the&nbsp;newswire. The message boards attached to a story are pretty entertaining too.  &nbsp;   urlLink BBC &nbsp;is some kind of news show.  &nbsp;   Comics:   &nbsp;   urlLink Penny Arcade &nbsp;pretends to be edgy, but all they come across as is big fat angsty computer nerds who occasionally do really good deeds (like getting their community to donate video games to sick kids). Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, they're based in Spokane WA, which is just across the border from us.  &nbsp;   urlLink Sluggy Freelance &nbsp;is THE webcomic. There is no match. Excellent art, awesome lorax humour.&nbsp;Worship the Comic. (The only webcomic I'd pay to get in hardcopy form)&nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink It's Walky , which is quickly coming to a close (The author is killing off all the characters to start a new series) was pretty good for a teen angst with superpowers kind of dealio. Then he got bored  &nbsp;   urlLink PVP Online &nbsp;has it all. Computer nerd, fat boss, 30-something hippy, two fat ex-jocks..All in comic form. Art is really good (although it's just copy and paste of various poses that have been drawn before). Quite funny and pretty fresh.  &nbsp;   urlLink User Friendly &nbsp;is everything PVP isn't. The art is crap; it's boring, repetitive and overly nerdy. Used to be a big thing back when everyone hated Microsoft (The whole comic is basically office culture and nerd humor, much like PVP). Most people don't like User Friendly anymore, but I used to work with a couple of these guys, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  &nbsp;   urlLink College Roomies from Hell &nbsp;is drawn by a chick, and is basically the same plot line of It's Walky. Teen angst with superpowers.  &nbsp;   urlLink Sinfest &nbsp;is the edgy comic that Penny Arcade wants to be. Deals with god, satan, sluts, presidents, ninjas, pigs and overbearing Christian parishioners. Love it.  &nbsp;   urlLink Cagle's Political Cartoons &nbsp;is a compendium of various newspaper artists who do political satire comics. Sometimes it's better then the actual news.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I think that's enough for now. Melia's going to kill me for spamming the board again.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So I'm a little behind the times I guess, when it comes to reading  urlLink fark.com . I think it's a nice site, funny etc. but I also think it depends on a person's mood as to whether they want to invest themselves in having yet another website they have to check daily (or even hourly depending on how fast a site moves.) &nbsp; I think everyone who spends significant amounts of time on the internet has their 'usual haunts' and they make the rounds quite often. It might be a forum for a favourite band, or *cough* even your favourite group blog :) Maybe throw in a few news sites, entertainment sites and even a work-related site or two. It just varies with each individual. &nbsp; So what are your haunts? Show us your bookmarks :) &nbsp; What does this have to do with Fark? Oh well it's just been added to my list of daily stops. I know everyone and their dog has been reading Fark for years, but better late than never eh? &nbsp; So, here are my rounds, not necessarily in order: &nbsp; - Saint Francis &amp; Wellness Works - work sites.  -  urlLink Theindependent.com / urlLink Indie forums&nbsp; - my town's newspaper &amp; forums -  urlLink Emotion Eric forums  - I adore Eric and the forums there are fun. I mostly lurk though. - TCZ Blog/tcz.org - duh - All my stuff - I have a bit of a network of sites of my own I check to see the stats etc. A couple of forums for my show that I run (one's busy, one isn't :), my own blog, my own site, my daughter's site etc. -  urlLink Television Without Pity  - Forums for a slew of shows on all networks. The Snarkiness never ends. - FOX 24 forums - where I find news and updates on the show and cast. - Dark Horizons,  urlLink Ain't it Cool  (shut up Fire) and  urlLink Zap2It &nbsp;- Movie news, and I only read Harry's site for movie updates, I swear :) -  urlLink IMDB  - I go here quite a lot looking up movie info and reading the entertainment news and stuff. -  urlLink The Cynic  - Seminole's blog. He doesn't update it often enough tho and when he's not carrying on about sports, there's funny stuff to be found here :) - Yahoo for my news needs - I like it because I can pick and choose the headline stories I want to read. I have UK &amp; Ireland news, world news, and of course, entertainment news. I usually head for this stuff during my lunch hour at work.  - Fark - already mentioned it :) - Online banking/email etc - boring stuff. When I'm feeling too happy I go look at my bank account. -  urlLink Snopes  - I loved bursting my boss' bubble when she sends me the Allstate Warning email. Thanks Snopes! - Gmail - Woot! Google rocks my socks. &nbsp; That's about it really. So when I'm idle on TCZ, I'm probably making my rounds :)

      So last night I'm in bed reading a book when I hear Tigger start to howl really loud.  I don't get up immediately because he's done that before just to annoy me, but then after the second howl I hear this kind of squeaking sound.  I pause and listen wondering what the heck it could be and then it comes to me that maybe he caught a mouse.  I get up, he's still meowing, and walk into the hall and there is this poor cute little bird!!!    I couldn't believe it.  He actually caught a bird - the poor thing.  I felt so bad yet wanted to also laugh at the cat.  He didn't really hurt it - so it seemed.  I mean, there were a few feathers out and it seemed unable to fly away right away but it also looked like it was completely in shock.  I walk over to the bird and call Adam up from downstairs and Tigger starts meowing all cutely and trying to poke at the bird as if to say "Like the present I brought you?"  So we shoo him away and Adam picks up the bird and we bring it out to the backyard.  What do you do with birds in this instance anyways? Its not like we had a birdcage lying around and could look after it.  We bring it out back and I try to check out its wing - nothing seems to be wrong (no blood).  It chirps, leaps out of Adam's hand and goes under the rhododendron bush.  We figured it well-covered under there, make sure the cats are in and leave it to calm down/sort itself out.    I'm still amazed that that evil little fat bastard caught a bird.  If anything, I thought I'd have a mouse on my floor before a bird but I guess I underestimated him.  What I'm really curious about is how he got it into the house.  I mean if he caught it outside he would have had to put it down, then open the screen door (as I had closed it), then pick it up again and bring it in the house.  Strange &amp; slightly talented kitty.  I blame Beanie - he picked the cat out!!    No worries though - I'm assuming the bird survived and is well - I checked under the bush this morning and it was nowhere to be seen.  I hope it was only in shock and recovered and flew away.  Stupid cat won't even eat chicken cat food and he goes after a bird... sheesh.    Anyways, I actually work today so its about time I went and blow-dried my hair.  Gotta find a dress for the wedding tomorrow too!  Later!

      I've been pretty slack the past few months where exercise has concerned and every month when my bank statement comes I've been pondering what to do about my gym subscription. Last night I finally came to the decision that I'm going to start going again, and so today I pootled down to the gym for a quick session on the cross-trainer and some sit-ups.   I've also gone so far as to book a gym induction session - the third one I have booked now, I just hope I actually get a training programme this time. The first time, I got told they wouldn't give me a programme until my chiropractor had signed some form saying it was ok for me to use the gym. The second time, the instructor cancelled, but I never got the message so ended up with another wasted visit. I'm hoping it's third time lucky!  So next week I'm planning on going to the gym and perhaps taking some classes in an attempt to start getting fit again. My plan to walk to and from work every day has been scuppered by the British summer - or rather the lack of it. A little old lady at the bus stop even asked me where the summer had gone and that she'd never known a summer like it. Personally, I think it's my fault. I've bought a few skirts recently and I guess the sun has decided it doesn't want me exposing my legs so has hidden until I give up the insane notion of wearing skirts :( It's not that I'm not a skirt person, it's just that I generally wear jeans. My mum always makes the comment "oh, you DO have legs then" whenever I wear a skirt, that's how rare it is. But my problem has not been a hatred for skirts, more a case of not finding a nice skirt, and now I have - about 4 of them! The next problem is finding shoes I can wear with them. Not sure trainers are going to match all my skirts...

      Anyway, not a good Wednesday. I can tell work is starting to pick up because I'm generally irritable and cranky all day. I don't like being in a bad mood because I'm such an easy going soul (almost too easy going if you ask some).   I'm really not going to go into why work sucked today because no one wants to read that. Instead I'll talk about why work is going to suck tomorrow. Well, I can't really do that with a clear mind because I want to think tomorrow will be a better day. I'm optimistic like that.   I already feel like I'm in the busy season. I haven't returned any of my friends' phone calls this week. I'm playing phone tag with a potential dating prospect and I'm working 12 hour mid-week days. This is not good and it doesn't bode well for the fall when things actually go live. I've said this before but I mean it this time, this is my last football season working. I'm going to try to switch over to baseball or something. The pre-season rush to do football previews is taxing. Baseball is more consistent and the travel is much better (albeit frequent). And...I'll actually have more time to attend TCZ Meets :)

      When I was about 8 I, like many other young girls, wanted to be a nurse...but a televised eye operation soon put me off. I then toyed with the idea of being a pilot and then wanted to be an aircraft engineer - I think that's coz my Dad was involved in building flight simulators. So here I am at 26 (almost 27!) and I'm none of those. I have an obscure job title (Learning Technologies Support Officer) and do a job that people don't really understand so they just say I work in IT. I used to be a researcher, which was much easier for people to understand until I told them what I researched and they got that glazed look.  So why am I telling you all of this? Well today was my annual review for my current job. I've been there just over a year now and the review was to see how things had gone and to set objectives for the future, it also involved re-doing my job description. So after 3 hours of talking to my boss I have a job description that matches what I do and a list of objectives that I can work on over the coming months. But one thing bugs me, much as I like my job, is it what I want to be doing in a year, 5 years, 10 years...? I don't know, I guess I'm just going to see what happens in my field of expertise (which incidently is online learning and is growing more widespread) and take things from there.

      Every year we get a new group of interns - basically students who come to work with my group for a few months for job experience and a bit of money.  The interesting thing about our latest group is that they are all women- quite an abnormality for engineering.  The three women are quite different.  2 Austrians and 1 Swede.  One is blonde (the Swede), one is brown-haired, and one is blue-haired!  The latter is quite unusual for engineering!  So now, my office, which has until this year, been "male-only", suddenly has more women than it does men!  Now, you would think with a bunch of women, the stereo type would be that the women would be talking non-stop with each other, and I would be able to get no work done, but these women barely talk to each other.  I took them to lunch today, and barely a word out of any of them to the other...I hope the ice eventually melts between them.  Its also interesting noting the differences in how they behave.  The Swedish woman feels much more comfortable in talking to me that the Austrian women - she also eats much more but is the thinnest.  I have yet to see the Austrian women have more than a simple cup of soup for lunch.    With one of the Austrians, I could not even get a smile from her. So I had to resort to desperate measures and blackmail her with ---- Gummi cola bottles!  At least that got me a smile from her :)    Anyways, at least the women are a nice break from the bald German man I used to share the office with ;)

      Sorry for posting again so soon, but I feel a lot better about my dilemma and wanted to share :)  A comment from my previous entry:  Do you want to give that up for the extra money and less time with your daughter?    Well it's not that, the new job would be the same as the one I have now. Same hours and all. I work 8am-4.30pm M-F and I have evenings and weekends with my daughter (well, plus I talk to her all day online during the summer. During the winter she's in school anyway.) So essentially I'd be doing the same job, same hours, for much more pay. My hangup is my loyalty to the hospital I work for. I love it here. But then, the opportunities for advancement and/or transferring to other parts of the country are better with the new job.   Anyway I appreciate everyone's input and I have followed some advice and taken on board other advice and looked at all my options. Today I spoke with my current boss about it because he the kind of approachable boss who has his employees' best interests at heart and he basically told me that the hospital would hate to see me go, but his advice was that I have to do what's best for me and my daughter, and if it means a change, it means a change. He said I shouldn't feel bad about leaving the hospital because you have to go where the opportunities are.  So I feel a hell of a lot better today. More optomistic at my chances to improve my life and my daughter's life. Thanks to everyone who's given me encouragement and advice on this. You've all been incredibly helpful!

      I have a problem with my job. It doesn't pay enough. I'm constantly struggling to pay the bills and I'm sick of it. But apart from the crap pay, I love my job. I like the people I work with, I love having my own office and I actually don't mind working for a large Catholic hospital.  My dilemma is that a job has opened up with my city's newspaper that is essentially the same job I have now, but it pays more. Close to 10k a year more. I wouldn't be living the high life, but I'd be a hell of a lot better off than I am now. I wouldn't have to scrounge for dimes and nickels to put a gallon or two of gas in my car. Ok maybe I exaggerate a little, but I am quite often strapped for cash and I'm approaching the time in my life where I shouldn't be anymore.  Next year I'll be vested at the hospital. My insurance is great. My boss is so easygoing I'm able to bring my daughter to work with me now and then and she can hang out in my office, or during summer holidays, my boss allows me to work from home one day a week so that she won't have to stay home alone as much. My paid time off accrues quickly, and if I'm sick, it's not a federal case if I miss a day. The boss and upper management of the hospital love me and have told me I have complete job security because no one else can do what I do.  If it wasn't for the pesky crappy payscale, I'd be even happier.   The job at the newspaper pays more, but I'd be working for Morris Communications which my mother has worked for and wasn't all that chuffed with. I don't have any idea what their health plan is, I'd probably lose having my own office... But the pay... :(  I can't decide if I should apply and face either rejection or having to tell my hospital I'm leaving, slyly let my current boss know I'm applying for that position in the hopes that they'd be desperate to keep me and bump my pay (which will never happen as in order to bump pay, Human Resources has to do a salary survey, management engineering would have to do a feasibility survey, and then they'd have to get a budget increase past Admin Council who are notoriously tight. Or should I just keep on with my current job and try to find a part-time, minimum wage piece of crap job that takes more time away from being with my daughter, keeps me so tired I dunno if I could function, and just plain sucks.  This sucks.

      Well today was full of surprises for me.  I almost forgot about a meeting that lasted about the entire day for me.  Then when there was an unexpected pause to be filled during the meeting, I was asked to give a presentation I had not prepared for...I managed to wing it of course.  At least spending the day in the meeting brought about an invitation to go to dinner with our guests from Italy. Only problem is I left my Passport back in Switzerland.  Now I don't need a passport to get from Switzerland where I live to Liechtenstein where I work, but I do need one to get to Austria where dinner was to be had.  Thus, I made a mad rush back to Switzerland and spent a hectic 20 minutes trying to remember where I had put my passport. Finally it was found next to my laptop..and off back to Liechtenstein and eventually to dinner.  At least 40 euros of food and wine and dessert were consumed..so I guess it was worth letting my salad go spoil in the refrigerator at home.  More mixed news with respect to the opposite sex. I got an acceptance for a lunch date, but the girl has now invited half a dozen people to come along..so its become a party almost..she even has included th girl I asked to play tennis with me later in the week. I gotta watch out..my world is getting too small!

      Well crap.  What a night.  What a weekend!  We ended up going camping to Sullivan Lake this weekend (just across the border) which was nice.  I love camping :)  We also went to the Gardener Caves and Boundary Dam so I have all kinds of photos that I'll load up once I find a crack for PSP8 :)  Anyhoo - I had some weird ass dream last night.  I was out walking and I wanted to go to 7/11.   I crossed the street and some guy was there and it went something like...  Guy: Where are you going? Me: 7/11 Guy: Oh, well it looks a little dark Me: Thats odd for a 24-hour store...  Then the guy looks at me, jumps me and tell me he is going to rape me.  So I'm freaking out and totally struggling against him and trying to scream but I don't seem to have a voice.  We end up wrestling down the street or something and I finally get this string to choke him but I still can't scream and people are just walking by doing nothing.  I'm trying to tell this guy in a drive-through window to call 9-1-1 but I can't yell so he can't understand me.  I kick the assailant in the head and start to run, but he recovers real quick and easy and comes after me.  But then I wake up.  WTF was that???  Dreaming about rape?  Damn.  Brutal.  Sucky night!  Let's see what the dream dictionary (www.swoon.com) has to say about this:   Rape : Whatever form it took in your dream, this act is a warning to avoid loose companions or careless behavior that could seriously damage your reputation by giving a false impression to those whose opinions are important to your welfare.    Fight : The basic meaning in a dream of fighting is change. For a business person, it signifies a change of enterprise; for an employed person, a change of job, etc. The degree of success or failure you may expect from the change was forecast in the outcome of your dreamed fight. If your dream concerned others fighting, it is a warning against waste of time and money in idle pleasure.   Laryngitis : To dream of losing your voice is a warning not to gamble or take any unnecessary risk for the next few weeks.  Well isn't that fun?  Sounds like a lot of warnings and a big flag that change is coming.  Whee!  Tell me something I  don't  know.  Stuff, bye.

      Figured I'd try my hand at these.   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  2003?  What a weird year.  I went back for what I assumed was my last term of university, taking 6 courses.  Algorithms, Social Ecology (philosophy arts elective), Stats, Computer Networking, Programming Languages and Numerical Methods.  I pass everything, but stats, which I needed to graduate and only failed by a couple of marks.  The prof wouldn't help me out a bit, that rotten *****.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   The word reality usually makes me thing of an old roommate of mine.  He was this little dorky kid my last year of residence that I lived with.  He needed a huge reality check.   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I try to live my life as honestly as possible.  When I was 12, I turned in a purse I found on the sidewalk to the police station (which was at the bottom of the hill) without opening it or checking out what was in it.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  With a free hour, I use it to watch TV.  I don't watch a lot of TV.  I try to fit in an hour of the Simpsons or something that usually makes me laugh.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   I've always wanted to smash a plate glass window, with my body being the thing smashing through it.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I would gladly put myself on the line for family members or friends or something that I firmly believed in.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Oi! Because you never knew what life would throw your way.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  This new ad for Holiday-In Express that has Alex Trebek doing this gay jeopardy situation.  This guy who hasn't gotten past grade 7 has like 17,000 dollars, one guy is at 0 and the other person is at -200.  The guy brags about how he stayed at a holiday in express the night before.  It's stupid and on all the time.   What was your first job?  I mowed lawns for people.  It was great.  It taught me responsiblity and my parents never needed to give me money from May til Oct.   Finish the sentence: “I have never...”  done one of these things before.

      The weekend has been a rainy one in Switzerland, so I decided to go about finally assembling the 5 dvd/cd racks that I bought a couple of weeks ago at IKEA.  A couple went together with no problem. The others were however were made by somebody who could not measure out the location of screwholes correctly, and thus took a bit more effort to put together.  Anyways, a few hours and sore thumbs later, I have 5 7 foot tall dvd racks completely full...and I need at least four more..so looks like another trip to IKEA.  Yes..I have way too many DVDs and cds.  I still have DVDs that have not been opened up. For all I know, they could be empty cases.  I sometimes wonder when I will have time to watch them all.  Sometimes, I think I am just saving things up for when I go into retirement. However, I am always buying more every weekend it seems!  Some sort of addiction I imagine.  The way I am going it will only be a matter of time before all of my white walls are completely covered with racks of cds and DVDs.  Boy, is it going to not be fun when I move..

      Well now that I'm done adding to my personal blog ( urlLink The Cynic ) and my sports blog that I run with AP writer  urlLink Mike Branom  appropriately titled  urlLink Sporting Fools . Now I'm ready for your questions and my close up.   Current Music:   urlLink Big Daddy Kane    Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ). : Great I picked up a quarter made from 1965. Hmmm...nothing happened to me in 1965 because I was 10 years away from being conceived. However my mom said she got a job in New York City with the phone company in 1965 and my dad was smoking hashish while working on his thesis at Penn. Works for me.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why? : My job. Working at a newspaper is instant reality. If I'm feeling too good I read the AP wire and hear about an explosion in Jerusalem, a beheading in Afghanistan and the war breaking out in central Africa. That's my often changing reality.   What is the most honest thing you have done? : I told one of the editors that I was embarassed about a story that ran on our front page. And she proceeded to include it in the weekly newsletter. Of course the girl who wrote the story cried and I looked like an ass. I apologized but that was a lie because I meant every word I said in the criticism.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why? : Maybe take a run on the beach with Metro and Boozer (my dogs).   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why? : A stack of Toby Keith CDs.    For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why? : My family, my ex-fiancee and my professional reputation.    What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why? : Eternal. Because death is forever.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why? : Any of those male  sex pill ads. Why? Because I can't imagine smiling that wide if your stuff is hard during an entire work shift. I mean I'd be a little embarassed if I'm strolling around the office standing at attention.   What was your first job? : My first work for pay was on the watermelon farms in rural Florida before several years before I moved here. My first job selling video games at Software Etc.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…” : I've never shagged Britney Spears. I've never bungee jumped. I've never swam but I always jump in head first.

      So, I just got back from a very relaxing stint outside the city, which definitely did me some good.  Unfortunately, I have to start work monday, which is simultaneously awesome and a bummer: awesome because I'll be getting money and I won't be broke, a bummer because I don't want to go to work.  But as much as I wish money would just pop out of my ears or something whenever I need it, it doesn't (nor does it pop out of my parents' pockets, ahem), so that leaves me to try and scrounge up my own cash. Bah.  Yesterday I read a memoir by Augusten Burroughs about the first sixteen years of his life and how he spent it living with a psychotic mother who then pawned him off on her crazy psychiatrist who ran a makeshift mental hospital from his beaten old victorian house, all the while engaging in an intense sexual relationship with a man more than twice his age.  The book is called  Running with Scissors , it's a good story and a quick read so I'd reccomend it (it's certainly one of the best memoirs that I've ever read, as the genre is by and large pretty boring and dry).  I also saw both Fahrenheit 9/11 and Spider-Man 2 recently (rather appropriately, I saw the former on July 4th!) and liked both of them.  Moore succeeds in making a really excellent propaganda film and luckily it's my propaganda so I'm happy to see it!  Although really, the important thing is that people go to see it and start actually  thinking  about the political situation rather than just blindly following or ignoring it all together, and I think Moore's film definitely does provoke thought.  The one problem I had with it is that I thought he critisized too many people, which I felt lessened the overall effectiveness of the film.  Focused critisizm is really important when making a statement, and it's one of the things that activists in general seem to have a hard time with (e.g., it can't just be anti-war, it has to be anti-war, anti-racism, anti-poverty, etc.). Spider-Man 2 was fun, just what I'd expect from the sequel to a movie based on a comic book.  Such has been my boring life of late.

      Well, ok that wasn't the question really, these are the questions and like a sheep I follow with my answers ;)   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  A one euro cent coin sitting on Monster's desk. It's sooo tiny I can barely read the date but it looks like 2002. Hrm, 2002, I was living in Manchester and experienced my first earthquake - and then about 30+ more as we experienced an earthquake swarm. Although the quakes were only tiny compared to the ones in Japan and California etc, they were still enough to wake me up or scare the hell out of me as everything shook about.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  The phrase "Back to reality" which is the title of a classic Red Dwarf episode in series 5 - ok I'm a geek at heart ;)   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I can't think of one major honest thing that stands out really.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Laze around, watch tv, read a book, phone home, tidy up and spod ;) Depends on my mood really - and how good my latest book is!   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  I'd love to say there was some hideous ornament I would take pleasure in smashing, but I don't have one. Nor do I want to display my violent hatred towards any one person or object - so I guess I'll be topical in a sporting sense and say "I'd like to smash a winning volley at Wimbledon".   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  Hard to tell really until the situation occurs. Probably like most people, for my family and for my country.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Pedant. I guess because that sums me up :) I toyed with the idea of "dead" but then that might just be stating the obvious ;)   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  Bothers me? I can't think of any that really bug me atm.   What was your first job?  I delivered the local free paper. First off I helpd my friend with her round, then managed to get a round of my own that my sister helped me with. In the end I had two rounds a week (Tues and Thurs) - it was ok in the summer, but the dark evenings, the cold, wind and rain and having to lug round god knows how many papers - which a selection of glossy adverts - was a nightmare. Still it earnt me some money :)   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...been to Norway. Been to the rest of Scandinavia but Norway has eluded me thus far.

      Um yey well I didn't know what to blog anyway so yey for random questions! Here we go...   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   1992...hrm. I think I've killed off the braincells that can remember that far back. Doing the maths, that would have made me 10/11. I don't think I did a whole lot back then, certainly nothing I can particularly remember from that year... Now 1993 I started high school!   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  Reality TV. But that's cos there's so much of it on TV these days and it's mostly a pile pile of pants :(   What is the most honest thing you have done?  Are there different values of honest? Being honest is just being honest, and I try to be as much as possible, even if it means saying that yes your arse does look fat in that!   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  If it's a spare hour off of doing something hectic then I'd probably snooze. I like sleep. Sometimes it's even better than sex! However I've had too many spare hours the past year so I tend to fill them with anything going.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  Well last week I was all for throwing Ginge's computer out the window...but only so I could have mine online instead. Now we have them networked I don't have to. Yey. Other than that I can't really think of anything right now... No PMS needing venting ;)   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I'm rather selfish and scared of death so I can't really imagine me beign all heroic. But if I really, really loved someone... you never know until it happens.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  BLONDE - sums me up really!   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  Those stupid Esure adverts with Michael Winner...nuff said!   What was your first job?  I waitressed in a smokery coffee shop...which has given me a taste for expensive smoked things, dammit. We got free lunches and got to take home leftovers (including yummy cakes and smoked salmon).   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...left Europe. I am trying to, and hopefully next year I will have saved some money for a North American tour! So watch out!

      One interesting thing about Europe in comparison to the USA is how much more important vacation is considered to be in Europe than the USA.  Whereas people in the USA are often asked to move their vacation to another time, in Europe vacation is sacred. So sacred that entire companies will close for weeks at a time so that all their employees can take vacation at the same time.  Now of course July and August are the favorite times for vacation.  This can be a great inconvenience if one does not have vacation him or herself during this time period and relies on other companies that do shut down for vacation to get work done.  Thus was the case for me. I find myself under pressure to prepare numerous steel samples for some experiments.  I have the samples cut at a laser company and I find that this company closes in the middle of July for 3 weeks..so I realize I had better get all these samples cut before they go on vacation. NOw to cut the steel, I first need the steel and I realize the guy who is going to get me the steel is going on for a month's vacation starting at the end of this week. Hence, I made a desperate dash today to pickup steel at the other end of Switzerland before his vacation began.  The trip started off nicely, but clouds quickly closed in, and just as I entered downtown Zurich, I noticed it was looking almost more like evening than lunchtime..the sky was that dark..not a good omen.  Next thing I know, my car is being pelted with hail and the streets of Zürich look like they are covered with snow. I worry about my dings on my hood and roof as well as not having an accident. Luckily, I survive, but have to repeat the process a few more times during the day.  I am always wary of hail storms as I remember a student who got killed at my university driving during one.  Luckily the actual retrieval of the steel was relatively painless.  Now to get it cut..that is tomorrow's wild trip ;)

      There are a number of things I'm seeing that sort of weird me out. On a few American cable networks, they've tried to enhance the viewer's movie-viewing experience with a separate 'show' that airs during commerical breaks. Sometimes it works, and sometimes you're left going, 'WTF?'  I was watching 'Die Hard' last night on F/X and it was one of those 'DVD on TV' type things where we have 'hosts' (male and female) to talk about the film during commercial breaks. I think TBS' Dinner and a Movie started this trend and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. DVD on TV is cool because they show a lot of deleted scenes and extras from a particular movie as it plays out and sometimes they come out with little tidbits about the film that aren't even on the DVD. I think that's cool.  Dinner and a Movie on TBS... sort of works because the phrasing goes together and has been around for a while, if you know what I mean. People have been going out for dinner followed by a movie for years. The format of this is a couple of hosts (again, male and a female) prepare a meal, usually one that's got a clever name related to the film they're showing, during the commercial breaks. There's witty banter, sometimes a guest chef or maybe even a no-name supporting actor who never really made it big.  This is all fine and dandy. But Movie and a Makeover? I think that's on Lifetime or Oxygen or something, but the hosts - yet again a male and female - 'makeover' someone, or something, like a room, during the breaks. What the hell? That's an odd combination.  And why always a male and female host? Covering their bases? Why - and this is what I really wanted to blog about - why is it always a dorky and/or dumpy guy and a hot girl? That's the weirdest trend I've seen lately and I've seen comments and articles about it. The hosts of DVD on TV consist of a hot blonde chick and a geek she wouldn't be caught dead with in a club. Why can't the guy be hot as well? Or better yet, hot guy, dumpy woman. Ok maybe not necessarily dumpy, though I'd have no objections about that, but at least a more realistic, natural woman instead of a tower of silicone, with a fake-bake tan and voluminous blonde hair.  Then there's the sitcom 'According to Jim' - Jim Belushi and... Courtney Thorne-Smith? Eh? I suppose the question is, are the execs at the Networks trying to help break down the stereotype of beautiful women only seeing beautiful men? Or is it just more like wishful thinking on their parts? You know those execs are all short, squat, George Costanza types dreaming of dating the hot chicks :) If they can't get one, they create a show that they can live vicariously through.  Now, don't get me wrong (and here's me covering *my* bases), I think it's great to have a TV show like Belushi's that breaks the stereotypes perpetuated by your soaps, your OC's etc. But it does seem like it's one extreme or another. Hot guy, average wife/girlfriend/host or vice versa. Let's have a little equal opportunity averageness/hotness. The perfect example that I can think of right now that's still on the air is Malcolm in the Middle. Okay the family's a bunch of nutters, but you're not going to find Jane Kaczmaerek working the runway (she's far too elegant for that) and the show's a big hit. 'Roseanne's another show where the stars were far from supermodel material and yet the country embraced it with open arms.  I'm rambling now and don't really know where I'm going with this so I shall stop that thread :) The only other thing that sort of had me dumbfounded last night was watching an ad for Denis Leary's new firemen show on F/X and in one of the clips from the show, a character says the word 'shitload.' I nearly fell out of my chair. 'Shit' is a BIG no-no word according to our censors so I was gobsmacked to hear it would be part of that show, *and* used in the advertising for it. Granted, F/X isn't one of the Big Three networks; it's a cable network, but one that comes with every basic cable package and therefore more accessible than say, HBO. So I'm wondering if censoring for those channels has relaxed at all or what's going on. I'm confused :) It's the same with another cable network, TBS which is showing Sex and the City now complete with a little nudity and the use of the word 'asshole'. Normally 'asshole' has 'hole' bleeped out.  I did find it amusing that F/X was showing a heavily edited version of 'Die Hard' where the 'God' in 'Goddamn' was bleeped out, yet let 'shitload' be uttered during a commercial :)

      Well, might as well answer the latest set of questions as I always do...   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).    Ok..its a Swiss 20 rappen piece from 1980.  Ah in 1980, my father bought our first home computer, and my life definitely took a slant in the geeky direction ;)    What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   I guess I think of the concept of a real life, one outside with others and with a real significant other.no computers or geeky engineering stuff that I spend my day doing.   What is the most honest thing you have done?   Call to the police to admit that I had made a prank phone call that had gone to far. I had to go to court because of it for "false reporting to authorities," but got let off.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?   Hmm..usually its try and organize my place or at least make a bit of progress with it.  If I am not at home though, I guess its just to catch up on a bit of reading    If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   Hmm..the speed bump I have to go over with my bike on my way to work and back.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?   Probably for a group of people that I cared about. I guess movies like Titanic try to make it look noble to sacrifice your life that way.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?   Thanks.  Hey, it was one interesting experience ;)   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?   Any of those pay per minute chat line ads that get repeated over and over during late night tv.   What was your first job?   Ok..outside of various yardwork type jobs, it would have been fabricating ceramic superconductors in a laboratory.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  done an illegal drug   Ok..through that list of questions.  So what else is new besides having laid bare several aspects of my life, I finally worked up the courage to phone a woman up for a lunch date.  Although she told me she usually did not go to lunch, she agreed to make an exception in my case..so I was relieved there...still gotta set the date though.  Everyone seems to be going on vacation at work except me.  Looks like I may get stuck trying to figure out what to do with an intern whose boss will be gone for a month. Oh well, I am sure there is slave labor to be found

      I've been at a conference for the past two days and I wasn't really looking all that forward to it. It was in Loughborough which is a nice enough town in the East Midlands - about an hour and a half by train from London. So it was an early start on Tuesday having to leave the house at 7am, not nice especially since I'm never normally out of bed til 8.30! The conference was about Computer Aided Assessment - so getting students to do self-assessment and exams using a selection of online tests using objective question types (like multiple choice). Anyways, the conference papers were ok - some were great, others not so. The best bit for me was the evening's entertainment - a casino!  We were all given 4000 (fake - boo!) pounds to play with - apart from those of us who managed to convince the guy giving out the money that there really WERE two additional people sitting at our table ;) So I had 6000 pounds worth of fake money (boo!) in my pocket and headed to the poker table first, exchanging only 2000 to begin with. Started off ok, won a few hands - didn't win all that much but managed to get up to about 3500. Moved onto another table where they had wheel of fortune and managed to win another couple of thousand on that. So feeling lucky I moved over to the roulette table.   I bet cautiously at first, betting on odd, black and the occasional number or group of numbers, and I started winning. I'd managed to get up to about 18,000 (ooh and a bottle of champagne for having number 22 come up!) when I felt a bit tired and decided to try and lose all my money before retiring to bed. So I placed a few chips worth 5000 on various numbers round the board. Monster had texted me earlier and said to remember lucky black 3 - so out of loyalty I placed one on number 3 - it hadn't won me anything earlier in the evening, but what the heck I wasn't after winning. So the ball goes round and round and drops....into number 3! 175,000 (fake) pounds was mine! Highest win of the night....bugger, now I had to get rid of all that lot ;) Eventually managed to lose it all - it's amazing how quickly you can go from winner to loser, and toddled off to bed.  I'm hoping that lady luck will be looking out for me this saturday on the lottery superdraw :)

       Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   1993...Hmm, 13 years old. What did I do..Hmm. OH, here's a good one.  Ever year, schools from around BC have a kind of math championship. It's a source of great pride in a school to have people their. It's essentially like a jeopardy competition. But first, everyone has to write a test that will rank them 1-10 for the final competition. We do the test, a room full of kids ages 12-14, and I finish first...Mostly because I hate taking tests with a passion and want to get them over as soon as possible. After I finish the test, I sit around and wait for the guy sitting next to me to finish (as he's got a gameboy and the game he was playing looked neat..C'mon, I was a kid :)) He finishes, and we're sitting there playing gameboy and waiting for the rest of the people to finish the test.   Eventually, everyone finishes and we're told to go have lunch or some such nonsense while the tests are marked and we're given our rankings for the competition. We all troddle back inside and sit down and we're given our competitors for the final round. It turns out I was first seed (Yippy skippy) and will be playing against some chick who looks 2 years older then I do. We are seated in our chairs, with Jeopardy buzzers sitting in front of us linked to an alarm system with a light (So you know for sure who hit first). The puzzle goes up on the screen in front of you, and you've given 3 minutes, a pad of paper and a pencil to figure out the problem. I may not like tests, but I love competition so I get right down to it. I scribble out a couple calculations, slap my head with the OBVIOUSNESS of the problem, and with a big smile, put my hand up...while the girl next to me takes an extra second and hits the buzzer.  FUCK ME!  At any rate, I got kicked out first round, and the rest of the questions were pretty easy...*sigh*   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   Virtual. Completely and utter tripe. The closest thing we have to accessible virtual reality are those games you play in arcades. Y'know, with light guns or the big headsets that go over your head and you stand in the middle shooting at people. I like games like that (especially the boxing one, an excellent work out). I'm also very appreciative of those lightgun games that require you to duck and dodge and move. It's funny, video games would be an excellent way to make kids get off their lazy fat asses and do something (Look at the asians and Dyason with their Dance Dance Revolution!)   What is the most honest thing you have done?  Told someone I didn't love them and we should just be friends. I burst out laughing afterwards at just the clicheness of it. From then on, I vowed to break up with women the old fashioned way. Be a complete and utter misogynist pig, slap them around, drink a lot and sleep around! WOot!   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Read, browse, snuggle. The first two I can do on the internet, the second requires Christine. I like snuggling :(   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  TELUS management. I don't think they realize how many awesome people they have working for them, and the fact that they spend so much money doing stupid things like nightclubs instead of giving these people RAISES to keep them working hard just makes me want to start my own company up that treats all of its employees like gold, and kicks the ass of the big companies who haven't a clue how to remain a good company to work for.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  In the event of a world war, I'd be the first in line to sign up as a volunteer for my country. There's just something so valiant about feeling so strongly for a cause that you'd be willing to die to protect it. My grandparents all served in WW2, but none of my uncles or aunts did anything relating to Vietnam or Korea. I think it's my duty to have served in some way, shape or form.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  'OOPS', because I'll probably die in some hideously hilarious fashion that people for years will look back and shake their head at. Like, say, sneezing really hard and hitting my head on my desk, knocking myself unconcious and swallowing my tongue.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  TV, whassat?   What was your first job?   I delivered papers for about a week before I learned I have no respect for old people, nor am I very sure-footed on icy surfaces. I was delivering papers across the valley here in Fruitvale and I was a little too rambunctious.. I jumped down onto someones walkway, slipped and did a nice flying faceplant onto the ground. I hate flying faceplants :(   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...posted something on the TCZ blog that's less then 1000 letters and I dont think I'm going to start now :) HAH!

      Well I seem to be into answering all kinds of weird questions the last few days so I don't know why this should be an exception.  Here it goes:   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  Luckily, Adam is good at leaving coins all over the house.  Out of the pile on the desk I have a quarter that looks like its got blue ink on it - its from 1976.  The only thing that happened to me in that year was that I was born :)   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  Bites?  Wasn't that a movie?   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I think the one of the hardest honest things to do is when you have a bit of information that you know could REALLY hurt someone and you still tell them.  Not because you want to hurt them, but because they're your friend and, as far as I'm concerned, thats what friends are supposed to do.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Back in the day it would have been something like walking on Kits beach, scrapbooking, or something of the like.  Now if I have a free hour I just want to be with Adam.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  The Bush Administration - starting with George Dubya himself.  HULK SMASH!!!   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I don't think there is any 'cause' that would make me want to do that - I'm pretty much opposed to war and that sort, but I would most likely do that for family - mine and Adam's.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Um, I think I'll be dead and I won't really care what is on it.  Although, it might be funny if it had something pertaining to evil stuff or world domination.     What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  I don't have cable so I wouldn't know :)   What was your first job?  Being that my dad was in the military, my mom always worked up at the mess halls doing military functions and weddings and such.  So I basically got a job as a waitress doing all this stuff.  It was actually quite fun sometimes as it was a pretty big military base and we'd always get these young Americans or some of our own militia.  Being a young girl, well, it was nice to drool over these guys or have them talk to you ;)   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...tried karate but will later tonight :)  Whee!

      So I kind of like answering these silly quiz questions. I don't know why. Maybe a strong desire to give total strangers a little insight into my inner being? I dunno. Anyway, I did a short list of ten questions from some sort of fun icebreaker things we do at meetings every now and then. Handy for those times when you don't really have anything to blog about :) You lot can answer them, or not, it doesn't matter. It's all in fun :)   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   Well I grabbed a quarter from 1998 which is easy for me :) That’s the year my daughter and I spent in Engerland. I worked for a Nazi who owned a pub/B&B in Little Hampden called The Rising Sun and we lived above the pub with the rest of the staff. Mondays in London were great :)   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   I end up thinking of reality tv because I watch a couple of them. Survivor when it’s on, and right now I’m kind of hooked on Blow Out on Bravo.   What is the most honest thing you have done?    I have done the ‘return the wallet with all the money still intact’ thing.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?   Depends on where I am. If I’m at work or something, I’d probably blog somewhere. If I’m waiting for an appointment, I’ve got a book. If I’m at home, I’d probably read there as well. Or play Spider solitaire on the comp.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   Easy. My fecking computer.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?   For a cause or something? I don’t know if I believe in anything that strongly. I’d be more apt to lay down my life for my family.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?   Mine would say ‘Byeee’ or maybe ‘WTF?’ or something silly.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?   Carrottop should be shot on site and never allowed to make another ad for 1800-CALL-ATT.   What was your first job?   I was an ice cream girl at one of those old-fashioned soda fountains on Cannery Row, in Monterey :) I could make 3 or 4 shakes, whip out a Fudgebana Split and throw an orgy together at the same time. They still talk of me down there. The legend that was Stephanie.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  I have never, ever seen a single episode of the following: Baywatch, Melrose Place, The OC, The Apprentice, CSI-Anywhere, or Alias.

      Hidy Ho Good Neighbors:)  How was everyone's weekend? I feel like our's is still going because it's Tuesday and Paul is still at home:) I LOVE having my husband here at home:) I'm not ready for him to go back tomorrow. I've been spoiled.   Our weekend started out on Friday:) The kids and I picked Paul up from work early. It is impossible to go anywhere fast in the summer. It took us an hour and a half to get into Chicago. It usually takes, at the most, 45 minutes. Anywhoo, so we picked Paul up from work at 4pm and went to the Taste of Chicago:) It's Chicago's biggest festival. It runs from the Friday week before July 4th and ends at 9pm on the 4th. This year something like 4 million ppl showed up. Local restaurants set up their booths up and down Columbus Drive and around Grant Park. There are different stages for different performers and every night there is a big name that performs at the Petrillo Music Shell:)   WELLLLL, I was so excited because PAT BENETAR was performing Friday night:) So we got there and walked around for a bit. The kids got grapes and we got ice cream that was realllly soooo good:) After walking around the Taste for a little bit, we headed across to the lakefront and walked up and down there looking at the yachts and other assorted boats. Chicago is so pretty. The lakefront is amazing. If I didn't get so seasick from being on a boat, I'd have me a yacht and park myself out there all summer long. But, alas, I get sick just watching the boats bobble.*sigh*. The weather was gorgeous as well. It was the lower 70's and the wind almost made it a bit chilly:) We were leaving to come home and heard Pat Benetar come to the stage so we tottled on over to the Grant Park to watch and listen:) It was such a cool time:)   We got home about 9pm. Saturday we all went grocery shopping.. probably a huge mistake. It was the day before the 4th and everybody and their brother was at the grocery store. Sunday was the fourth and we went to the fair at Highland's Central Park. We do this every year. The kids love it and they did have such a good time:) Yesterday we didn't do much of anything. Paul went mountain biking and last night we had date night:)   Apparently, Paul has never just gone for a drive. Going no where in particular. Just driving. So that's what we did yesterday. We started out toward St John and then went past there to Cedar Lake then across to Lowell and then up to Merrillville:) We stopped at the Outback in Merrillville and had supper then came home. I think that was one of the nicest dates we've had:) I havent been riding in quite a while and I think he enjoyed it himself:)   Today I've been doing stuff for the garage sale. Paul has been working from home. They launched the Women of Home Depot *big eye roll* today and he's on call to make sure there aren't any serious glitches.   So there is our weekend. It's been a long one, but I'm not ready for it to end just yet. I have been spoiled I guess:).  Hope everyone else had a nice one as well:)  take care

      Ah..so my last post did make it.  I thought it was down when I tried and that I had wasted a good 10 minutes or so of my time.  Last time I mentioned my new iPod..now I am feeling quite guilty about it these days.  I accidently let slip that I had bought the iPod during my trip back from France for the 4th of July with a ladyfriend.  What followed was one of my greatest guilt trips of the year as she went off on me about how there was no good reason for me to buy it and how I didn't listen to anything she told me about how to better manage myself.  It was a lousy end to a great trip that included a private showing of the King Tut artifacts, a very spicy Thai dinner, early morning jogging in France, visits to 3 interesting French towns, and pizzas topped with apples and plums.  Anyways, I managed to mend things with the woman by telling her I would consult her the next time before I made such a purchase and by leaving some gummi bears on her desk at work during her lunch break.  I now realize that I do have some sort of buying addiction of technology-related items.  Those of you who have met me know how many gadgets I have and how I love to always have them about me.  The problem is I have too many of them and am always struggling to keep up with the newest ones out there.  So I gotta figure out some sort of course of action to deal with this problem.  Another interesting problem I have noticed about myself is not being able to come home before 10 pm after work.  I am now doing a break from language classes, but I still for whatever reason can not manage to get home..tonight after a bit of spodding at work, I went to the local pool hall and played a couple of games till 10pm came around..for some reason I just don't like going home......

      Ok, my brain has been completely fried by today.  I work in London and atm I am commuting from home which takes an hour or so by train.  Today I got as far as Marylebone, feeling sick, promptly was, and ended up having a panic attack.  Marvellous.  I have ended up spending £19.80 on a return trip to Marylebone station.  Since this morning I have seen a doctor, realised that I am very scared about this increasingly delayed operation, and slept almost all afternoon.  Not the best day in the world although I have had worse.  On the plus side, a friend is hopefully coming down to visit Saturday so that should be cool. :)  In the post I got two keyrings - a Lego ghost and a Lego vampire which are excellent, very cute and cheered me greatly.  Thanks to Ragdoll :)

      Well, here's what's good in my life, followed by a quick phone company rant!  So where did I leave off last time?  My grandmother is still hanging in there, she'll be 97 next week.  Her pneumonia symptoms are slowly clearing up.  No more cough, but still has laboured breathing.    Since last Wednesday, I've been living on my own, and that will end today when Scott and Sue return from their vacation to Fruitvale and Kelowna.  I've been feeding their cat Kittles for them while they've been gone.  She is the strangest cat I've ever seen.  She's so anti-social, she makes hermits look outgoing and friendly.  Since they left, she's become a recluse, hiding here and there, only coming out to eat and look for Scott.  But in that time, I saw Spiderman 2, possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Totally enjoyed it!  I really enjoyed the performance of Rosemary Harris and Alfred Molina.  They really made the movie for me.  Their characters were very well performed.  James Franco did a good job, NOT!  He played the easiest role of all.  The spoiled rich kid who wants revenge cause someone has wronged him.  Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst did well in their roles, but they didn't change all that much from the first movie, which I loved as well.  Friday night was a night in enjoying the Busch Series race, while Saturday night was the same, except I enjoyed most of a quart of rum and the NASCAR race from Daytona.  Sunday was a day of nothingness.  Lots of sleep, a really good supper and lots of Simpsons.  Yesterday was back to work.  A good day of photoshop-ing some pictures for the library screensaver!  THANKS STEPH!!!  I got lots done and enjoyed a nice quiet shift on the media desk.  As for my ebay winnings, last Friday, the boxed sets of Robotech started to arrive.  Sadly, set #5 arrived on Friday, and as you can guess where this is going, Boxed set #4 arrived last night.  So last night, I cleaned up the little mess I had made in the house, had a nice supper of fish and green beans and while watching some of the Robotech Masters series.  Dana Sterling, Marie Crystal, Bowie, Angelo Dante...just like I remembered them.  WWE RAW was on, then I played around for a bit on my PC, read some more of the new book I started, The Lone Drow and hit the sack.  Now for my rant!  My Mom called last night to say my phone bill from Aliant had arrived.  I was like cool, 5.75 for my email account right?  Nope, 300 and something in miscellaneous charges.  w00t!!! Those rotten dumbasses.  And to make matters worse, if you need help, Aliant's business hours for help are 8am to 6pm.  So if your phone is fucked any time after 6pm, you're screwed without service until the next day.  Isn't that great.  So I called internet support to see if they could tell me if I was billed for the adsl modem I had returned in April.  They couldn't tell me anything.  Just as I figured they couldn't.  So I get to work and call this morning.  37 minutes and 16 seconds of being on hold and I get the billing department.  I explain my problem and ask to know what I was billed for.  The woman's response, oh.  I can't see that information.  That comes from the credit department.  HELLO!  You billed me for this stuff and you can't tell me wtf  you billed me for?  HELLO!  Wake up!  I want service, not to be more pissed off.  So she puts in my complaint to the billing department.  So anyway, I ask how long will that take.  Your complaint will be held up due to the strike.  How long will it take?  Oh, anywhere from a month to two months to resolve this.  Ok.  Well, I'm not paying you anything.  No, you shouldn't.  We've billed so many customers for stuff that is wrong, it's sad right now.  Ok.  Well, cancel every service I have with you, which should only be an email account.  You can tell me I have an email account right?  You are billing me for it.  Yes, sir, you do have an email account and nothing else with us.  Ok.  Cancel it.  What's your email address sir, I can't see what the account name is!  It's drizzt@nbnet.nb.ca.  Oh yes, I see that right here.  This is pathetic.  I'm wavering on sending a complaint to the CRTC about this.  This is the worst service I've received from anyone.  Anyway, I have the slip to prove I returned the modem and they won't give me a number for the department I want to talk to so I can resolve this.  It better be dealt with ASAP, because I hate this crap and like to get it resolved right away.  Telephone companies, they should all be shut down we should all become telepathic.  Anyway, tune in next time, same bat time, same bat channel!

      Well, at least for a little while.  I've been cleaning and packing and reading and running all sorts of errands I didn't have time for.  I'm sure in time I'll get reeeeeally bored.  But until then...  It's hard to believe, I take posession of my house a week from this Friday.  Go me!  I'll have to take my cam and take pictures for everyone to see.    Shit.  There's so much work to do.   I think I'm going to dig up something for lunch.  I'm starved.  I've got a potroast in the crockpot and that's not helping much either, cause it's starting to smell goood.  TTFN.

      OK, so I've finally realised that i have to come to blogger to post, not that I was trying hard, I was in shock from not being able to use my computer in so long. I therefore would like to dedicate this post to Matt! Yup, finally I no longer have to risk Ginge's bed to spod ;)  I am now settling into life in Dorset quite nicely. It took me only 3 weeks to get a job (and I wasn't really trying that hard the first week, as you do). So yey! I start on Monday so am making the most of my last week of freedom...well not really, I'm sat here at the computer as normal but never mind!  I have to do a three day induction course next week which is sounding worryingly like those dodgy 'managerial courses' they send people on to 'bond' and so forth. I need to take with me three items...which is a bit of a bugger as I didn't bring every bit of crap down south with me! 1. A photo of family or friends (lets see which dodgy meet photo should i pick?) 2. a momento of my best ever holiday (i don't have momentoes other than sand in my suitcase) and 3. an object that helps describe your favourite interest outside of work (sex, drink, err?). So I need to get thinking...  Oh and what the hell are penguin videos doing on our blog? Has Russ infiltrated blogger to add his personal collection?

      So I've been slacking in the TCZ posts, I know.  I've blogged elsewhere (*cackle*) but have been too lazy to get this far.  Not to mention that I've actually had to work quite a bit in the last week so I've generally been busy and extremely tired.  Not really much is new in our world.  Adam is combatting the evil pollen that snows around here (STILL) and we've actually spent more time with his family this past weekend then we have in a while (including his grandmother!).  It was actually nice - and I drank lots of red wine so thats reason to be happy on its own.  We got to see Rob/Snarf on Friday which was nice - hopefully he wasn't too wired after having some  Tarte au Sucre  ;)  For a recipe see KathrynAnn's website.  Tonight we are most likely going to see Sue/Sydney & Scott/Weagle as they are also in town.  Last time they were here we played this great boardgame (Cranium) so we'll probably end up doing the same ;)  Nothing major planned for this week - maybe I'll get my butt back into gear and finish up my scrapbooks which have been sitting idling by since I lived in Toronto.  Perhaps I will also do more yardwork - I don't know.  Depends on how many shifts I get this week (so far, only one).  As for how I'm feeling myself - physically, much better.  The pills they gave me seem to have the done trick and I no longer have any sort of abdominal pain.  Hopefully it stays that way and everything returns to normal.  Emotionally, I'm a little bit up and down.  I was pretty down by the end of this weekend due to feeling exhausted from work, etc so that rather sucked.  Hopefully things will improve.  Right now I just feel like I need a vacation somehow (no dear, not an Alaskan cruise - thats next year ;)).  But then again, in the past when I have felt kind of crappy I always took some sort of vacation - whether that was to my dad's in Ottawa or somewhere in Europe or flying transcontinentally - it just sort of happened.  On the brighter side of things - I'm down 3lbs.  Yeah okay not THAT much but its a start and I'm happy with that.  I'm looking to be down 20-30 lbs by CAN3 in Oct so I'm totally getting my butt in gear.  I love having an elliptical trainer at home :)    Anyhoo, must be off...

      Damnit all to hell and back.  As I mentioned in a previous blog, I'd never seen Sex AND the City (thank you Corey for setting me straight on the title). I haven't had HBO in yonks so I never was able to watch it. And I'm not really one to rent DVDs of television shows - well, until out of boredom one day I rented 24 and well, most of you know how that turned out. So when Sex and the City premiered on TBS I decided to see what all the hype was about.  I liked it, laughed with it, but on the whole I found myself troubled by how I couldn't relate to much of it at all. I couldn't find a single thread to attach myself to that would suck me into it. No pun intended. I was regarding it as a light, fluffy fun little show but I wouldn't be devastated if I missed catching it when it aired.  So now it's the 4th of July weekend and my daughter's birthday is over, it's too feckin' hot and humid outside to go do anything and frankly, I live in one of the dullest places on earth anyway so I decide to spend the day seeing the real Sex and the City, The episodes with the swearing and the nudity and all the good stuff they just can't show on network television.  I definitely like the dirty version much better :)  Not that the show is like watching porn or anything. It just seemed a little deeper (again, no pun intended) and less fluffy with all the juicy bits back in. But in my haste to get out of the hectic crowds in the only Blockbuster in town, I grabbed the wrong season. I blame shitty labelling actually. Anyway, I ended up renting the sixth and final season. Or what I thought was the whole season anyway. Luckily SatC seems to be one of those shows where it's ok to jump in anywhere. So I watched episodes 1-12 and I found that there were many threads I could grab onto and enjoy the show - but my favourite thread was seeing Misha again. I had forgotten that Baryshnikov was a part of the final season; I had read about it a while ago and I remember thinking, 'Oh my god Baryshnikov!'  I love that man. I saw him in White Knights when I was a little older than my daughter and ohhh, he just killed me in that. The accent, the body, the glow-in-the-dark-eyes, the beautiful dancing.... *girly sigh* I know White Knights was no Oscar-worthy movie but it will always be on my Top 10 list of favourite films just for the interaction between Misha and the legend Gregory Hines (R.I.P.).  I won't gush anymore about Misha, who despite Corey's determined declarations that he is not aging well, looked just as beautiful to me now as he did back then when he showed up in episode 12. Man oh man. So when I finished that disc I was all fired up to rent the final episodes and see more of him. Yes I know how the show ends and stuff but I wanted to look at him some more :)  Unfortunately the fecking final episodes haven't been released on DVD yet. I'm so crushed. And I can't for the life of me find out anywhere online when they will be released which is even more disappointing.  This post is in danger of reaching Fire lengths if I carry on about it, but I've decided maybe I should actually start watching the show from the beginning and kill time before they release Misha for me. So if you'll excuse me, I saw a cute pair of Manolo's and they are calling my name.

      Oh joy! Rapture!  Today, at 4:35am I stepped off the bus and back into vancouver. My trip back home to Trail was a short one, but it was well worth the trip. I got to see my family, a couple of my friends (including Fire and Trinity!) and even get in a little sun. I left tuesday afternoon for Trail and was planning on staying two weeks. However, those plans got muddled up when I received an employment opportunity (which starts tomorrow) last thursday. This guy wants to to help him fix up his 7 bedroom house - he says it should be for the rest of the summer. The guy is selling the house in september so he wants a good worker to do some grunt work for him. He chose the right guy!  Today I've gone shopping and am getting things ready for my job tomorrow. I bought a water container, a hat to keep the sun off my head, and new shoe laces for my work boots. whoohoo. I'm already to go! Tonight I think I might even take my woman out to see Spiderman 2. I hear it's pretty good! I can't wait to see it.  It is now 2:15pm and I am about to make some cookies! I might also surprise my woman with dinner when she gets off of work. I hope I don't burn the place down - but just incase, I've put the fire department on speed dial (which really wasn't worth the effort, as all I'd have to dial is 911 :P) Wish me luck!

      Finally, finally I have managed to get myself on the Blog.  Due to various hitches a) my lack of proficiency with anything remotely technical and b) the fact that I have a distinct feeling that Blogger doesn't like me anyway as it killed my last account...  I am here!  Unfortunately I don't actually have much to say, other than hullo again folks :)

      Heidi ho, neighborinos.  I've been reading someone elses blog (Completely and utterly unrelated to TCZ) for awhile now. I had accidently stumbled across it while hard at work and I found the circumstances he was undertaking quite interesting, if only from a "God I would NEVER do that" perspective. The quick summary is: He met this girl online through LiveJournal (He lives in Las Vegas, she lived in Wisconsin), they fell in love over the phone, and now she was going to move in with him and they were going to live happily ever after. Well, my Adam-sense went off and I lurked both his and her journals for about two months (The whole courtship -> moving thing took about a month and a half) and oddly enough, they both stopped posting for about 3 weeks after "THE BIG MOVE".  One day, I'm reading the  DearAsshole Livejournal community   and there's a post from her being completely and utterly BITCHY. Now I have to say, I didn't much like her from the beginning. Her profile was a big ball of bullshit wrapped in horsepucky. She had an IQ of 172, she was an attorney at 17, she was lead editor of major newspapers at 16, blah blah blah; altogether, she was the queen bee on a honeypot of vinegar (Oooh, mixed metaphor).    Her post, in this big journal (Which she KNEW he read) is as follows:    Okay, let's talk about consideration......  Dear Asshole:  I moved across the country to be with you. You said you loved me. You said a lot of things.  I understand you don't have tons of relationship experience. I understand you've never lived with a girl before. And that is okay. I understand that means you'll have to learn some things about being in a relationship. And that is okay, too.  Let's talk about what isn't okay.  I don't care how little relationship experience you have, there are certain things that are about common courtesy and human decency.  Let's say your girlfriend comes home after a 12 hour long shift at her brand-new, stressful job. And this girlfriend needs to wind down, so she goes to watch a baseball game on TV - quietly, because she knows you're napping in the next room. And let's say half an hour later you wake up. And you go out to the living room and you see her sleeping, dozed off in front of the game. What do you do, what do you do?  Here's what a reasonable human being would do: a reasonable human being would either put a blanket on her and turn off the tv, or possibly wake her up so she could go to the bed and be more comfortable.  But here's what YOU did instead, by way of contrast. You came to the living room, turned the TV to a different channel, and raised the volume, waking said girlfriend up - in spite of the fact that there was a TV in the bedroom you could've watched if you needed to see The Simpsons that badly.  But the girlfriend was understanding and just went to the bedroom to sleep some more.  What would a reasonable human being do at this point? It's pretty easy - they'd be quiet while she napped, or keep things at a generally reasonable noise level.  What did you do? You decided to do dishes. To run the garbage disposal. And to play music loudly enough that you could hear it over the garbage disposal.  No reasonable man would expect to be able to do this and still have his testicles attached at the end of the day.  But your girlfriend was so nice that she didn't even mind this so much - maybe, she thought, the music wasn't as loud as she perceived it. So she put in earplugs to block it out and finally sleep.  She realized when she did, that not only could she hear every lyric of the song playing, she could feel the bass line in the floor.  This made her upset, incredibly upset actually. She'd had a hard day at work and was exhausted, and now she couldn't sleep - and what the hell kind of person would do that, anyway?   The more she thought about it, the madder she got. And while she usually is the first to say when something is wrong, she decided she shouldn't have to tell ANYONE not to blast loud music while someone is napping in the next room, regardless of their lack of relationship experience.  So when she finally does tell you, is it your fault for being an asshole, or is it her fault for failing to ask you nicely to turn down the 80 dB music you felt was fine to play while someone was napping?  Reasonable person survey says: the first one.  You said the second. You said you didn't know the music was that loud. When I insisted you must have, you said you didn't think I could hear it through the bedroom door - in spite of the fact that you've turned down the living room TV as you were going to bed before so it wouldn't bother you. Then you used the usual "I'm new at this and if I make mistakes it's just because I've never been told." Never been told? THREE YEAR OLDS know not to disturb people with noise as they sleep. Then you resorted to calling me a hypocrite because I ask you to bring me relationship troubles when they happen - you know what? Doing that isn't a relationship problem. It's a problem with being a human being and existing in society. No one does that shit.  So when we fought, I ended up saying you were totally inconsiderate, to which you replied "but I'm not TRYING to be," as if that made it okay. Let me tell you something: no one tries to be inconsiderate. You have to try to be considerate. Well, ok, so I told you, and you agreed to be more considerate.  We also agreed I wouldn't go up this weekend to meet your family, but you'd still go on the trip - leaving me alone at the apartment over the long weekend (some alone time I desperately needed). And you asked me if I'd get the oil changed in your car today so you wouldn't have to skip lunch and do that instead on your lunch break. Fine, I don't mind doing you a favor, even after all that crap. I got the oil change, which came to $32. You gave me $40.  When you got home, you asked me for the keys and your change. Because of money things, that change was the only money I had to spend all weekend. And now it was gone, and you didn't even think about it. And you didn't even thank me for getting it done for you.  And then you left. I went to grab a soda from the fridge - and then realized you'd taken all of it and there was nothing left to drink in the entire house.  Fine, I decided to brew some iced tea - I'd just filled the ice cube trays the night before, so I brewed the tea, poured it into the pitcher, and then looked in the freezer - you had emptied the ice cube trays and put them back in the freezer absolutely empty. I was holding cold, hollow plastic with not a single cube of ice.  These are not the actions of a person who's just inexperienced at relationships. They are the actions of someone absolutely inexperienced with life. You are the most socially retarded person I have ever had the misfortune to meet. I have known autistic kids who know that loud noise wakes people up. I have known developmentally disabled children who know better than to leave empty ice cube trays in the freezer.  What's your excuse, asshole? Sincerely,  me   So, the guy is a big dweeb. Some of her complaints are relatively legitamite, some are just what you naturally go through in the first couple months of a relationship, some are just weird. She's venting, so let her vent. Anyways, not a day later, comes his response....awesome :)    His post:    Dear me:  So you want to talk about “reasonableness” and “consideration.”  Well I don’t know whether I should start from the beginning, or from now and work my way back. Either way there is no conceivable way in which I could possibly cover all of the examples of how you’ve done oh so well at exhibiting the highest standards of both. [/sarcasm]  Since my mind has a tendency to go all over the place, I suppose I’ll just let it out as it comes out. I suppose the 12 hour work day would be a start. Actually, I suppose we could go into what a rough week of work you had…..wait a second, a week?!?!? I would LOVE it if I could have gotten away with working less than two weeks in the previous two months. But no, that’s not an option I’ve had. You see, while you were busy sitting at home talking to your friends and playing on the Internet all day, I was busy working EVERY day because quite frankly if I didn’t, I’d be writing this from a cardboard box right about now.  You moved out here by giving me the understanding that you’d save up enough money to support yourself for a couple of weeks while you got settled in.   And I realize we got off to a rough start. After your mother went to the trouble of warning me about the shittiness of your car I asked you if you were sure that it would be okay to make it across the country (especially through the Colorado Rockies in snow season). You assured me that it would be fine and not to worry. I trusted you, obviously that was my first mistake. Because obviously a “reasonable” person would believe that a 10-year old Cadillac with nearly 200,000 miles on it and a host of problems can be trusted to make it 2,000ish miles in 2 days.  After said car died on us in Denver I rented a car with the assurance that your parent’s oh so wonderful AAA Gold membership would take care of it. Well, what choice did I have? We needed to get home right? So even as I dreaded that, and the fact that it meant we’d have to drive back the next weekend, and drive 24 hours in two days, I really didn’t have a problem with it. I loved you and I was willing to do whatever I had to in order to make things work.  Later when we realized that we wouldn’t have the money to pay for the repairs (after I’d already obtained a pay day loan to cover the charges for the rental car that I thought I’d be recovering at some point in time) I did something I haven’t done in years. I asked my father for money. Due to his generosity, inspired by a desire to help us start out on the right track, he obliged. But much like other fiscal matters in the months to come you didn’t show me the slightest bit of gratitude for what I had done. Even after I told you how hard it was for me to ask him for money you couldn’t even acknowledge that and thank me for doing it, for you, for us.  I was relieved when you told me the repairs would be far less than we thought they would be. I didn’t think the car was worth keeping for the greater amount. So you can imagine my shock (or at least a reasonable person would) when you paid the bill and it ended up being nearly twice what I’d planned for. Oh well, what was done was done. Again, no thanks, no acknowledgement.  But enough about that damn car, even if after we went to all that trouble to bring it back here it died less than a week later. And even if as of YESTERDAY I was asking you to help me move it so that it wouldn’t be towed you said “I don’t want to do it now, we’ll do it when you get back.”  That’s always your response, “I’ll do it later.” That seems to have been your attitude for everything from making an appointment with a temp. service, to giving them the information they need when you finally do work. Last Saturday I had to get yet another pay day loan (both of these the first time I’ve done so in well after a year, and previously it was because of dealing with my dead car) because you couldn’t be bothered to go to the temp service at a convenient time. When I came home sick from work on Thursday I asked you if you could take care of it that day, since obviously I wouldn’t be needing my functioning car for anything for the rest of the day. “I’ll take you to work tomorrow, and do it then” you said. This was BEFORE you knew that you had a phone interview at 2:00 that day. After that I was fine with it (although you could’ve still done both). But no, you couldn’t even stop to consider for a second that doing it that day would’ve been a helluva lot more considerate of the fact that doing without my car (especially unnecessarily) is a huge hassle to me. So anyway, as a result, it didn’t get done in time and I was left borrowing money so I could silly little things like put drinks in the fridge.  Oh yes, the drinks in the fridge. I love your renewed attitude of guilty until proven innocent. So I guess I’ll jump ahead a bit and move on to yesterday. I gave you $40 for the oil change, because I figured that would cost about $20, and it might need a new air filter, so then $20 wouldn’t cut it. According to the receipt in my car it came to just under $20. You gave me $8 and some change and told me you’d purchased a few other things. I hadn’t planned for that, but oh well. I figured you wouldn’t buy anything you didn’t really need right?  Of course a conversation about this probably would’ve been much easier to have if you hadn’t been on the phone the whole time. Silly me. If I say I love someone and they’re going away for three days I think I could get off the phone long enough to give a proper goodbye to that person and work out any necessary details.   Oh yeah, so speaking of that paycheck that you couldn’t be bothered to take care of last week. Well you managed to receive that check this week. Over $200, well over the change I took back from you so that I could eat on my way up here. When I got in the car I noticed your wallet with your ID was in there. I knew you couldn’t cash your check without that or a car, so I made a trip upstairs to make sure you had both (your ID, my brother’s car). You’d asked me the day before where the check cashing place was, so I had stupidly assumed that since you had the means to cash your check, you would so. This seemed especially reasonable as you had given me NO indication that you needed any other money. Had you said ANYTHING I would’ve had no problem taking out more than $40 and having you keep what you needed to get by. I’m still baffled as to why you claim to be broke this weekend based somehow, on my actions.  As for the drinks issue. Wow, here’s where your lovely tendency to assume the worst in me really comes to shine. When I went to hit the road I saw there were two sodas left. I grabbed one figuring you’d have the last one and that would tide you over until you could get off your ass long enough to get money and to the store. Obviously I was wrong, but this is proving not to be a first for me. It wasn’t until I’d gotten on the road that I saw John drinking one that I figured out he’d grabbed the last one. By then it was too late, but I figured you’d manage. Afterall, would it really be THAT wrong of me if I had intentionally the last in a pack of soda that I’d paid for?!?!?  So you went to get some ice, and apparently it wasn’t there. Again you assume it was somehow my nefarious motives that precluded those ice trays from having ice in them. Sorry, that’s not the case. Upon some investigation John tells me that Robby used them on Sunday night and may have not refilled them. I haven’t touched them in weeks, but thanks for assuming that if I did I wouldn’t refill them. Before you came along if it weren’t for me they never would have been filled.  But the dishes, oh yes, my washing of the dishes, the most egregious sin of all. But geez, did anyone reading this stop and ask WHY a guy with no relationship or living with a partner experience would have cause to do dishes? Anyone who knew me or my lifestyle would know that doing dishes used to be rare event for me. Why? Because I live like a bachelor. I don’t cook, I don’t mess up my dishes, and when I do I rinse them off.   So the reason I was doing dishes is quite simple. I was cleaning up after you. The problem is to say that is a gross (and I do mean that literally) understatement is putting it incredibly lightly. I really fail to see how someone that leaves half consumed food on the stove (and that’s assuming they turn the stove or oven off when they’re done with it) and unrinsed dishes anywhere has ANY room to speak about lack of consideration. The fact that Robby got so frustrated with it after your first week here that he cleaned it himself and that you still didn’t figure out that it was a problem boggles my mind.  So why did I have to do it that night of all nights? Well up until then I thought we were going out of town together to enjoy a nice weekend together with the relaxation we both deserved. I looked forward to showing you around the place I grew up and sharing the things around here that hold significance to me. I wanted to share everything with you. But even after I thought we’d made up you didn’t want to go because you’d “rather sleep.”  I can’t help but be more than a little blown away by that after you complain about my sleep habits. And ahh yes, sleep. How dare I create noise while you try to sleep? Even after I told you repeatedly that your incessant clacking of the keys and the glare of the monitor prevents me from falling asleep you keep doing it. You told me to just tell you if it was bothering me and you’d come to bed. It would be just that easy! And yet every time I tried this it took you AT LEAST an hour to do so, and that was during the times you didn’t yell at me for expecting someone that has to work EARLIER than I do to come to bed before 1:00 am. No, all you could do was stay up all night further validating my theory that you’d rather talk to or associate with anyone who is not me.  I’m sorry, did I say you were on the computer to much? Sorry, you were on MY computer too much. That’s right, yours has been down the majority of your time here and even though it would only cost a few bucks to fix (per your claim) you make no effort to do so. And why should you? You’re on mine if you’re a) awake b) not on the phone running up my long distance charges when you haven’t paid for any of the other expenses you’re using since your first week here and c) not busy making a mess in the kitchen. And then I’m made to feel guilty if I spend five minutes on it. Remember when I’d been using it, was in the middle of the game and I got up to use the bathroom and you were on it for the next hour? Yeah, real fucking considerate.   But you know what? I could get past a lot of this stuff if I thought it was worth it. But I don’t know if I can get over the passive-aggressive manner in which you’ve chosen to address this. I mean really, a post in a LiveJournal community that you had to know full well that I was a member of? (If you didn’t, all you had to do was check my user info page, and I highly doubt you were unaware).  Heaven forbid that you talk to me about this. Heaven forbid that you call me (my cell phone is rarely more than two feet away from me, but that would require you not being 	on the phone already I suppose….). You couldn’t even be bothered to validate ANY of the horrible things you’d assumed about me. This continual pattern of assuming the worst of intentions in me has to stop if we’re going to have ANY hope of working this shit out.  Your inconsideration runs far too deep. As misguided and stupid as I may have been, my motives that ended up upsetting you that night were based in consideration (if I clean this stuff up tonight neither one of us will have to come home from a long drive to a smelly and gross kitchen). You on the other hand, are just innately inconsiderate. You may be incredibly intelligent for your age, but you have a LOT of growing up to do. And if you can't acknowldge any of your role in this, then I really don't know what you're still doing in my home.    And my jaw just hits the floor. Best Online Fight Ever. Point, CounterPoint, a drag down punch out KILLFEST of incredible proportions. I just found it so fascinating to have this veil of 'perfection' ripped away to see what a person is really like, and there we have it. I had to contact this guy so I mailed him and said "OMG u R S LEET!" or something to that effect.  Moving on to this week, he leaves the coup de grace, PICTURES! And my friends, nothing says "I love you" more then   finding out just how much of a sham a person is  . I swear, by my puppies grave, I will follow this beeyatch around the Internet making sure that no one gets suckered in as much as this poor guy did.

      Ok..its been ages since I last posted..or so its seems.  It does appear that I had the honor of the last post using the old system :).  Its good to see so many other people blogging.  A year ago this time, I think 90% were made by myself, Madness and Star.    I'm watching the Greece-Czech semifinals in the Eurocup.  I have actually found the Eurocup football more interesting than the World Cup even without no American team. I am beginning to think that the final, which ironicaly, will be on July 4th, will be the closest thing Europe has to a superbowl.  For the 4th, it appears that I will be spending it in France.  Oh well, like Switzerland or Liechtenstein make any more sense.  I just got a new IPod today.  This is my 5th MP3 player in 4 years.  Although it looks the classiest, I am somewhat disppointed in that it does not allow you to delete files directly from the Ipod (have to use iTunes) and that it appears to want to connect to only the first computer you initialize with.  This sucks as I was hoping to use it to swap music around various computers.  We will see..I have already read about ways around this.  Ok..Melia..there you go. I am back :)  Happy? ;)

      Its now a little after 2am on Sunday night, and things are starting to quiet a bit at B10.  Some conversation is going on about rides scratched at Alton Towers, but for this blog it is more important to reflect upon the events of the last 2 B10!  When I last left off, we were off to the beach.  Upon arriving, we broke up into a couple of groups.  Some headed straight for the sand, while another group of us decided to see some fish up close and personal at the aquarium.  We got to see shark feeding time from a submerged transparent walkway in a rather large tank full of sharks, stingrays, and giant turtles.  After boing up on our natural sciences, the others I was with decided to do bumper cars, but I decided to take the rare opportunity to allow this land-locked resident of Switzerland with no closeby beach to walk along the Bournemouth coast and take in the the local scenery and beach babes!!!  We then all met up and took the train back, linking up with another group of spods who had chosen to forsake the beach wonders for the safer realms of a local pub.  It was time then to prepare for the big night out at Jazz Juice!  We first went to a couple of watering spots in Bournemouth to soak up some liquor and then made our way back to near the beach and into the nightclub.  JazzJuice was basically a 70s retro night.  We danced or sat on the edge of the dancefloor until about 2.00 am.  Then we grabbed taxis and headed back to consume a midnight snack before hitting the sack.  We also got to observe why it was not a good idea for a taxi company to ever dissapoint our meet host ...  After the spods finally awoke on Sunday morning, we went to a local establishment for some traditional English breakfasts.  The Sunday afternoon event was either bingo or the water park, depending on one's tastes.  Your blogger personally chose the waterpark choice, and despite the long ques, he was not disappointed with the miriad of slides and tube rides ...  It was then dinner at KFC (a treat for me as there are none in Switzerland) and then bowling, followed by some goes at the Dance Dance video game machine.  Then back to Matt's for another renedition of "Fire Wire."  Its now 2.30 am and time for some sleep!

      So here I am, bloggin live from B10!  Its only my second day ever in England, but luckily the learning curve is not as steep as worried about :)  The fun all started on Friday, when I awoke at 3am after only 4 hours of sleep to drive to Zurich, where I would meet Reethi and Sunshine and catch a flight to merry olde England.  The day started out with lousy weather. Most of my driving was through rain and I could only hope that my decision to have brought only warm weather clothing would not be a horrible mistake. About 5.30 am, I arrived at the Zurich airport, parked the car, found the check in termal, changed some francs to pounds and waited for my two travel companions to show up. Luckily, they were not too late.  Sunshine looked the same as ever, but Reethi came with a new hairstyle, now without the blue..  The plane ride to London was for the most part uneventful..we nodded off a bit, but I awoke to discover us in a circling delay to land in London Heathrow.  Although we were delayed a bit, I enjoyed the circling pattern as I got to take in some of the sights of London from the air.  I even recogniyed the snaking bit of the Thames that one sees at the start of every Eastender episode!  Eventually, we landed, and we took the next leg of our trip southward starting with the Underground Tube.  Thus, I also got to see London from below ground - although I admit there was not much to see except a lot of people packed like Sardines reading their morning papers which either talked about the English football coach being cleared of his latest problems, or the more amazing revelation that one of the Big Brother candidates was actually a man earlier in life, but female now.  The headline read, "Father of Big Brother candidate - I always wanted a daughter!!!"  When we reached Picadilly circus, it was time to change from the Tube to the Train. Now, as a faithful follower of the Chevy Chase Vacation movies, I remembered Picadilly Circus as this huge roundabout, which Americans seemed doomed forever to drive around in circles in.  I looked forward to seeing it and Big Ben, but alas all we had time to do after getting our tickets was to get a Burger King Breakfast to go.  We took our seats and we were finally southward bound to Bomo!  A few naps later and a few scares from some clouds, we arrived close to the MudMeet Mecca.  As we stopped in Christchurch, we noticed Ginge, Zebedee, and Trax walk bz. Christoph banged on the window, but Ginge in his dark glasses could not see us frantically waving at him.  The train went off to its next stop, where Sunshine and Reethi departed to check into their hotel and I went on to Pool and finally got the other spodders attention in their car though a text message.  Finally, Parkstone came!  It was a much smaller trainstation than I had expected.  But probably it was good as it was small as Matt's place was literally right next to it.  There I quickly found old faces such as Lorena Huxley, while meeting new spods in person for the first time, although it could feel quite strange, having spent hundreds of virtual hours with them.  People were just finishing breakfast despite it being more like 1pm.  We broke up into a couple of groups - one consisting mainly of women for shopping - and the rest at the pub next door.  I opted for the latter option and found myself quickly going through beer after beer - and then cider (not the American apple juice type) - and quickly worked up a buzz as spod after spod appeared.  I found the people quite easy to chat up and met a few non spodders, including a woman from the English Birmingham, which I found interesting, as my last job in America was in the other Birmingham (Alabama).  Finally, it was time to move on to the event of the evening - B2.  This was a small, but nice pub with a single pool table - which seemed like something for children as it was smaller than the standard Americna pool table.  The B9 tournament was finally finished, with Dafty beating out host Matt.  Games of Twister were to be had, but I never managed to get past 3rd place, despite my trainings in yoga.  Although most were wide awake, my early morning start was starting to get to me, combined with the heavy fish and chips I had for dinner.  I had to take a walk outside to clear my head. About midnight, we headed back to Matt's and listened to his heavy beats, including the favorite, "Fire Wire."  I was dead tired and managed to actually get some sleep despite the loud music.  Everyone crashed around 3am.  Saturday morning started with me being the lucky second for a shower, giving me plenty of time to enjoy a "Vegetarian Breakfast" at the small coffee spot down the street.  Its now almost 12 and am waiting for the last to finish their breakfast..then the beach comes!

      Sometimes I might refer to my biological father, Gary, as Biodad when I'm talking about him. I kind of like it. It has a superhero quality tone to it (Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's... Biodad!) The reason I refer to him that way is because I've only known him for the past few years and most of that was just via email.  I grew up knowing of him, but he wasn't a part of my life. I had a wonderful stepdad who was and always will be my 'dad' and so I can't quite bring myself to refer to Gary as dad and I don't think I ever could. So I like Biodad. Anyway, after my dad passed away I began to feel curious about Biodad. But I didn't really pursue it. It wasn't anything more than an 'I wonder what he's like' curiosity anyway. All I knew of him was his name, that he and my mother went to high school together and dated for a bit and I was the result. A typical story really. I also knew he worked for a newspaper in Montana. That's it.  Well around 1999 or 2000, I can't recall which, I stumbled onto his address and email online when I put his name in on a lark. On a whim I decided to contact him via email and just see what happened. I figured it would be nice to know whether he would care or if he didn't want anything to do with me. That way I'd never go through life just wondering. I'm so grateful I did.  I wrote to him, though I can't recall exactly what I said. I do remember saying something along the lines of 'I promise not to drag you onto Jerry Springer for a surprise reunion' or something to that effect. Nervousness brings out the comic in me. Anyway he found that amusing and after the shock of my email wore off we began corresponding. Then I introduced him to instant messaging and we began actually chatting. I found I had a sister just a little older than my own daughter whom Gary brought with him the first time we all met. It was just a dinner at Applebee's that first time but it was very pleasant if a little bit awkward :)  Since then we've talked a lot more and hooked up a time or two when he's in town. His own father, who would be my grandfather lives here in my town, though I've yet to meet him. He's retired and I'd occasionally see him doing the greeter thing at Walmart - I imagine he did that to get out of his wife's hair :) It was weird seeing him knowing who he was, but he didn't know who I was. Very odd feeling.  So that's a bit of background on Biodad and the reason I'm writing all of this is because I think a new step has been passed after his last visit this past week. I miss him now. It's another weird feeling. He and his wife have divorced in the time that we've been writing to each other, and he has a new girlfriend now. This past week was his family's renunion in another city here in nebby so he brought her down with him for the week and stayed at a hotel across the street from my place. This meant we got to spend a lot more time with them. I adore his gf and think she's really cool - she's a junior high school teacher which means she was able to get along really well with my junior high school kid and both of them were incredibly supportive for me while I was going through this whole job thing.  It marked the first time I went to him for advice and support and he came through for me bigtime. It also marked the first time he spent time with my daughter without me around as they "borrowed" her for the day and took her with them as they did an 'About Schmidt' tour of Nebraska, hitting the pioneer museums, the Imax, a planetarium and all that stuff. My kidlet told me later that night that she had an absolute blast hanging out with them. Later that evening they met me for dinner which happened to be on the day of my interview and then we retired to the lobby of their hotel while Gary restrung her new guitar with some nylon strings he bought for her and showed her how to use the electric tuner he also bought her. Then they had a few lessons which I managed to capture  urlLink here  :)  Unfortunately after that they had to get going to the reunion but yesterday as they passed through my town on their way back to Montana we were able to see them again for a quick coffee. And now today I find myself really missing them and wishing they lived closer or we lived closer. I'd like to get to know his daughter better because from what I know of her, she's a pretty incredible kid - a music wiz, a science wiz, wants to be a published novelist before she turns 21... I think that's really cool.  The other times we met Gary for a quick dinner and a stroll through a park it was really nice and all but I didn't have the feeling afterwards that I do now. Maybe because we simply didn't have a lot of time to really get to know each other in person and even though chatting online is nice and convenient - it's still just not the same as being there.  Anyway I'd better wind this up. I thought I'd write about it because you always see those long-lost reunions on TV where the reunited family members greet each other after years apart, or after meeting for the first time but you never get to really know what happens after that initial meeting. So this was my story :)

      CamdenTown is a part of London which became famous in the sixties and was a regular hang-out for lotsa rock stars. Since then it's become a place which attracts all manner of freaks (as well as plenty of tourists) coming to embrace Camden's alternative feel and shop in the markets. So I guess it was only natural that my first encounter with Camden would be at a TCZ meet back in 1997.  Well 7 years on here I am living in Camden - having been here for over a year and much as I love where I live, there's one small part of Camden that REALLY riles me up. It's a small stretch of road starting at Camden Tube and progressing about 200-300 metres up towards Camden lock. This is where the markets are and many, many shops selling things like clothes, shoes, tattoos and food (including magic mushrooms). And it's on this small stretch of road that a large number of people descend every weekend - so many people that they have to close Camden tube on a Sunday to make it exit only.  Now I don't mind lots of people, I've had to catch the tram back into Manchester after a United match with about 40,000 other people. What really annoys me is people who seem to have an inability to walk properly or to be aware of everyone around them. These people seem to meander on at a snail's pace obvlivious to those of us who just want to get home. They stop randomly in large groups which means you have to walk in the road just to get past them. Or they decide to stagger themselves right across your path and have a discussion about which shop to go in. They stop to take photos, with the photographer standing like 2 metres away from the photographee and then getting stroppy when people walk in the way. So I'm pretty frustrated by constantly having to negotiate this slalom course of idiots and I'd imagine they all think I have tourettes with the amount of evil glares and muttered curses ;)  And then, when I've just about made it to Camden lock I have to endure the drunk punks, the leafleters, the weed salesmen and today a nice man selling what initially looked like cakes his grandma had made - how sweet I thought, having only baked some fairy cakes myself yesterday. Well, I'm sure you can guess, these cakes would have you seeing more than fairies! His selling slogan was "Hash cakes - get seriously fucked up for only a pound".  So welcome to my world, and the small part of it that can seriously piss me off within seconds. But much as I hate this part of Camden, I know one day I'll be grateful when I'm going to a fancy dress party where the theme is goth/punk/freak - I know I'll definitely be able to get an outfit ;)

      So as I write this blog, daylight is rapidly disappearing, but definitely not the activity with it outside.  For this is the Swiss National Day, or as it seems for all the neighbor kids, fireworks day.  Actually, many did not wait till today. I heard many a firework exploding last night as well as throughout the day. But only now is it getting really loud.  Surprisingly, it does not seem that much different than the USA 4th, but instead of red, white, and blue, there are only the first two colors.  The Swiss channels are filled with music from the 4 different cultural areas of Switzerland.  Throughout the mountains, one can probably see many a bonfire.  I'm not Swiss of course, so for me its a manner of curiousity.  Perhaps a bit of annoyance, in that its a holiday that I don't get off as I work in Liechtenstein, and only live in Switzerland, but it doesn't really matter as it fell on a Sunday this time.  Incidently, I don't get the Liechtenstein holiday off either in 2 weeks as it will be on a Sunday as well. Oh well.  So how am I spending my Swiss Day?  Doing nothing..or close to it.  I woke up with a back ache that was most likely caused by my running down a mountain on Saturday at full speed. Thus, it was filled with me playing the odd computer game and lots of television, including 3 hours worth of East Enders on BBC Prime.  Amazing, how I managed to get myself hooked to that series.  So, a week from now I shall be at BOMO if all goes to plan.  It should be a nice change of place from the Swiss way of things :)
