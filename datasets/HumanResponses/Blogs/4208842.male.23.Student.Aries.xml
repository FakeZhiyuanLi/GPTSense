      Below are posts of some of my poems.  Did someone just say,  "Why?"   Because I fucking felt like it, you un-cultured douchebag.  To all of you who can read, feel free to comment.  And to those of you whose machismo prevents you from reading poetry, ever...     ...well, shit on you.

      How could this chrysanthemum or virgin carnation grow up to be a potato the shade of crumbling drought-raped dirt? Pressing down out swelling bucking against her roots  Outstretched arms dangle deadly ivy vines in her dark fairytale forest She sees past their poison. Yellow-brick-road shimmering like voluptuous asphalt on I-12 flanked with speeding pines and running dead smash into that heaven on the horizon  In her freshly rewound dream the city basks in the humid sunset She is a misunderstood harlot of opportunities and she rolls on the river a rotting red stick

      His hand wet and white smashes itself palm smoothly splayed across her cherub rain-slicked cheek.  Her eyes wet and white smash themselves shut tears slip smoothly out vanishing like a whimper in the rain.

      Blink? over and again the contortion of life and limb twisted into obscenities swearing it will never get you. Down you cascade spiral sweetly to the pinpoint ground zero of this cataclysm. This is  you. Colliding sight and mind out of which escape never occurs. We will dream with you as you mutilate your psyche, slashing furiously at the pupils of your mind dilated in terror. Fly from light and faith now  trembling sweetly she touches your hands drowned in blood.  -----------------------------------------  "Rave? We certainly did..." - Anonymous

      Limb and limb disjointed tumble wheeling-cart bisect the sky streamers dancing, breezing lightly fill the world inside my eye  Freely asked her love was given freely bound the choice was lost freely weeping held she hope out that each time would melt the frost  Whole is half of how I saw her universal lock and key marching onward - destined? chosen? leaping, took my heart with she  Red corona crowning head she seemed, smiling, hardly dead

      His pork remained untouchable, a little captive audience intent upon his rambling rant regarding my wholeheartedness about the cause of eating meat that, while not kosher, tastes so sweet. “This tiny pork,” he then lambasted, “may have such germs and filth fantastic, that inherently to eat may be a suicidal feat.” And having left the wiener ‘lone, he cracked his wallet while on the phone and idly dropped a tip of bills more rife with germs than any swill. The moral is, said I, the nuisance, enthused is great... let’s not be stupid.

       "demure”   eyes appear pink in afternoon light strained smoothly through cherry blossoms   “demise”   pink blossoms upon the dead girl’s cheek when day like a curtain closes   “design”   though waking lips taste tears like dew, he dreams again of the cherry trees

       urlLink     ALL HAIL THE MOST QUOTABLE MOVIE EVER!!    The Big Lebowski by Joel and Ethan Coen is arguably the best cult flick ever. It owns you. Just watch it and I guarantee you will walk away with at least one line stuck in your head.   "Hey, man. Nice marmot."  "Smokey, This is not 'Nam. This is bowling; there are rules here."  "...Also, Dude, 'chinaman' is not the preferred nomenclature. 'Asian-American', please."  "This is what happens, Larry! This is what happens when you FUCK a STRANGER in the ASS!!"   The list goes on... feel free to add your favorites after you have experienced the film, first hand.
