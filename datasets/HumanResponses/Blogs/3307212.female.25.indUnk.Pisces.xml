      So this is my first entry. I dont really know how to even start this. It seems strange  to think people would want to read what I have to say but it's a cool concept. I am a 25  year old girl from Maryland orginally, but bounces between 2 states now. It's been a hard year for me, my mom was killed instantly on December 11th of last year, when the car I was driving got struck head on. I had a broken arm in two places but I am still here, lonely without her. I have to say I struggle between depression and lonely a lot. Sometimes even guilt, I struggle  with the fact that she's gone and I am here alive confused on what my next move should be. I feel like God has left with with this huge burden, and I have no clue what to do with it. The feelings of guilt are the hardest for me, I have two younger sisters, one of which doesn't like me at all I think that maybe they wish I were dead instead of my mom. There are days where I get angry, mothers day and easter have been the hardest for me, Christmas I feel like I was still in shock. Maybe I am still in shock, there's this over whemling need to do something, yet I feel paralized dead and cold. I am lonely all of the time, and I feel myself shying away from old friends, my old life is just a distant thought. It's so cliche' to say I didn't know what I had, but I did, my mom  was my best friend, my world. Now that there's no one to share it with... how do I go on? It seems like death may give me comfort although I am not suicidal, there are days where I hope I don't want to wake up. My heart ache's and the day of the accident flashes through my head as though I was doomed to live with it  the truck heading into my lane, my screams filling the air when my unconcious mom was lying on the seat next to me, I often ask myself why did I have to see that, why did I have to watch her die.  There's a lump in my throat now, and tears are welling up in me... I don't want to be this person I don't want pitty, I just want my life back. Nothing will ever be the same. She'll never see me married she'll never see her grandchildren, she'll never see me be anything more than the loser I was before she died. Sometimes I think that's the hardest thing, that I never did more to make her proud. I never showed her  that she was a great mom, by anything more than telling her everyday. What to do what to say now? I am  a fraction of the girl I was.    I do not make excuses for the burden I must bare you were my hearts most esteemed cargo indifferent you were swiftly thrown overboard you read my eyes just like my diary  I will not urge you,  I don't want to grieve I need freedom from the winter freezing my soul I am not contented, nor am I somber I am disassociated from any feelings of normalcy that I once had your a parasite you infected this ache with wholeness and took it with you in the same fashion I have no time to heal I know I am weak you will someday know... what within you the changing seasons could not take    05/11/04  ( I moved this blog from my old blog... it was written on May 11th and not May 26th)
