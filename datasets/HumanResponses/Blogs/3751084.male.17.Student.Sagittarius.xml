      Hmmm today.... was an up and downs day..... up side- i got to see my really hot friend, and taught her to to play the guitar... seeing her just makes me fantasicly happy. and Just a year ago, we were more than friends (well.. she denies it ). Shame that has all ended now... Though, the down side was... i reversed my beautiful 206 into a really really high curb scratching the rear bumper quite a bit... IT goes great with the already scratched side pannels, and a dent that car gave me in a car park, probably some mother at shcool.. picking up their son... and reversed into my car.. and just left it there. ARSEHOLe.. thats what i say... but hey... my car is already scratched.. and if anything.. i can always blaim my brother....  But... this accident as such.. doens;t spoil my day... because i got to spend half of it with the most beautiful girl i've ever seem. and hopefully... we could get back together

      Just found out today, about the long and distant past. My neighbour, whom also is my best friend had reeeeaaaly liked this girl, only problem is, This is the girl I like, The girl i picked up myself. (funnily enough, she lives 10 houses away from me- and it took me 10 years to work out that she was hot!) Well anyway, back to this story, I had been spending loads of time with her, going round to her house like everyday in the summer going to places with her, gernrally the period of time before you finally ask a girl out. Infact, she was leading me on sooo much, such as holding her hand everywhere we go, stuff that you would normally do when you're on a date... but not physically being a BF and GF .But, my mate, whom i introduced to her ( that was the biggest mistake of my life) , has been getting close with her, However, as she is not exactly my girl friend, i cna;t tell my mate to back off. Through the summer months, i;ve noticed that he REAAAAAAALLLLLY like her.. and he goes round to her house at like 1 am.. (sneaky) ... but he can't bring himself around to ask her out, because he KNOWS that will upset me.  And i just found out today, at a party like 6 months ago, he got reallllly drunk, and was lying on a sofa with this girl in a innocent way, so i thought. As i left the room, he started to grope this girl. This is when his true feelings come out... When he was PISSSED! Soon after that "incident" she started to distant herself from me, and go with him...... though he still didn;t ask her out, cos he knew perfectly well that i would probably hate him for the rest of my life. In the end, she told me, that our friendship was not able to go to another level, and doens;t talk to me very much, Nor did she go out with my mate, though they are still tight.  And, such an ass hole he is... made me lose all chances with this girl   And now.. my anger for him has grown to a explictable level. I want to shoot him in the back, and leave him in the drain. course this is eventually go away.. a month... a year... maybe till i am 30... All i know is this... this girl is damn hot... and i had a very very good chance, and all being spoilt by my best friend, who i thought i could trust.!  And the lesson that i learnt, is.. if you meet a girl that is not part of your social group.. DON't introduce her into your group, unless you are sure that she is yours!
