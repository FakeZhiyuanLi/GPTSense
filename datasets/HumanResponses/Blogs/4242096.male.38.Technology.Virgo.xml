      Ok , here we are...Sunday Night....  Saturday was a busy day...up at 9, quick shower, and had to be in Dover, De. for my kids football game at 10.....Jon, my middle son, brought his g/f so of course she spent the entire day w/ us...well, Rita took Kimmie (sons g/f) home at 11pm and was back at the house about 11:20...I was on the front porch having a cigarette...she basically stepped around me and said "well, i'm going to bed"...I asked if she could spare time to talk and she hesitantly said yes...I don't remember the exact wording, but I basically told her that the longer that we are together, the less interest we seemed to have in each other...she agreed w/ me on that one (and immediately broke into tears)...She tried to make alot of excuses, alot of them having to do w/ the kids or being tired when she gets home from work, in which I replied that it was "Us" which was growing apart and had nothing to do w/ the kids...as a matter of fact, the kids are the reason that I was still there..I said that i was tired of it and could not take it anymore... at this point, she walked in the house ...before i could finish my cigarette she came back onto the porch..She agreed w/ everything that I had said, but asked that we give it one more try..maybe even try some "marraige counselling" (which I'm not that thrilled of)...we never set any kind of "date" or "trial period", but she promised that she would "try" to change...I explained to her that was all well and good, but i didn't want to "pretend" to be happy Well, this morning Rita let me sleep in and made breakfast...she actually cleaned house today too... Sunday night is usually "family night" in which we all sit around and play a game or rent a movie (or something to that effect)..Rita usually goes back in the bedroom and does her own thing, but tonight she actually stayed out in the living room and watched a movie w/ the rest of us... and beat this shit, she even asked if i wanted to lay on her lap and she would rub my head...(Ususally it takes a migrain headache and hours of begging for that!) But I am not going to Lie..I still have feelings for Sue, and when I think about her (which I do often) and when I think about her, I get really depressed, because I think I have lost her for ever..I'm even afraid to "IM" her cause I just can't stand her rejection or her hating me...I really care what she thinks...I would do anything for her... GOD! HOW DO I GET MYSELF IN SHIT LIKE THIS!

      Well, I've spent the last 2 hours on the phone w/ ppl calling me to tell me what a fuckin' mistake it would be to tell Rita the whole story...Maybe i was brought up wrong...maybe honesty is NOT the best policy...I even talked to the most unlikely person to give me advise on instant messenger (you figure it out) and said not to hurt her...to try and work things out...I've even got ppl here at work giving me advise ...what the fuck!! Don't know exactly what i'm gonna say yet, but when i do, I will post something here....

      well, things are getting really complicated (gee, why did i make them that way)..i actually talked to a couple of friends about this today (no names mentioned to protect the innocent)...really do need a beer (or 2 or 12)..have to mellow out...heart and head are racing 100mph...thousands of thoughts racing thru my head in reference to this (and thats on top of all the clutter in my head on a daily basis)  I "i.m.'d" Susie this morning and just wished her a good day and then took off to do my "chores and running around"...much to my surprise, she sent me an offline message before i got logged in @ work(that i still don't have the nerve to reply to)...i don't think i'll post it, but i will say that she did read "blog"...i never should have sent her that this link, but thinking back on yesterday i guess i wouldn't have sent it if i didn't want her to read it...  well, tomorrow night...thats the night...it's either all or nothin'....i might need a drink for this one...gonna sit rita down and talk...open up and tell her everything! ..not gonna mention any names, but i can't keep lying and hiding...it's tearing the ass out of me...no matter how the outcome, i've made my bed and i am ready to lay in it, no matter how bad it may get after that, at least maybe i can feel some relief (lose alot of respect from friends and family, but at least won't have to hide)

      Well, I just spent about the last 30 minutes "chatting" to sue on yahoo...she sounds about as confused and frustrated as I do (w/ good reason)...I really fucked up...But at least I got to talk to her onling and ask alot of questions...she basically summed everything up in one statement " its caused by being in love with the right person at the wrong time"... I even gave this URL to see what I have been going thru for the last week...I kinda hope she does read it and then again kinda hope she doesn't...

       urlLink   I know that it may sound stupid, but Sue changed her profile today, but the "hobbies" and "latest news" notes...this really tore the heart right out of me..It was "Hobbies-loving my man" and "Latest news -he makes me more happy every day" to "Latest News: I have learned that I need to put myself first sometimes and that its ok that I do that. My happiness and my sanity are most important."...I tried to IM her but she won't respond...this is killing me..but I can understand that it is also hurting her greatly...i want to make her happy...the way things used to be...she was (and still is) everything to me...there isn't a moment during the day that I don't think of her...I keep having these feelings of "i've already fucked up my life, maybe it would be better for all parties involved if i was dead", but then I cannot do that to my kids..i can't quit...oh well, lemme go do something and try to get my mind off this "shit"..i hope to post more later Sue's profile pic  urlLink

      Ya know, I am still kind of pissed and hurt at the same time...I don't know exactly what Sue read on my profile, but God Damnit, I have supported her thru some really tough personal shit....I was really excited about my non-drinking, and thought that she would at least be happy for me, but no...fuck it....(Deleted everything from my yahoo profile and will now just use "blog" to express myself

      Well, Sue and I have been kinda chatting on yahoo tonight, but you can sense the tension...I said that I was alcohol free still and she freaked out on me...said she was tired of me manipulating her....she said that one day I wrote on my yahoo profile "why on one of your profiles you put that you had just lost sober days then turned right around and said you were still sober?", then she was gone...  I haven't drank yet...July 12th was my last drink...I SWEAR! I have not had anything "YET"   urlLink http://profiles.yahoo.com/bob_thetoolman2003

      Ok..Maybe I am focusing on the wrong "side"...Lemme try and look at what I do have on the other side... I have a wife (Rita) and 4 kids:: Russell is 18 and at the moment living w/ his Mom in Indiana..But she is a really worthless piece of shit and Russell is beginning to see this 1st hand and is thinking about coming back to Md to live... Jon is 17 now ..he thinks that the world revolves around him...he is a good kid (besides being a lazy ass teen ager... Bobby Jr...HE is a good kid..always does what i want him to do and is very helpful...he may not have the booksmarts that his brother Jon does, but he is a very "hands on kid"...Bobby is bright in his own way Brittany...10 years old now...my only little girl...maybe this is why my feelings for her are different...she is the typical little girl...loves barbies and polly pockets..enjoys cheerleading and riding her new bike  Ok, all this being said, I would do anything for my wife Rita...she is my friend..I don't hate her..but I don't feel that "spark" that we once had...it's more like someone that ya'd take bowling on Friday night than someone ya' take to a fancy resturant for a candle light dinner (not that there's anything wrong w/ bowling)...Rita is very "cold" ...not very personal or intimate..this pretty much drives me crazy...she will cry at the drop of a hat when ya try to offer a suggestion or correct her (that always plays on my conscience)...when we first dated, we were very "touchy-feely" and romantic but now it seems like holding hands is even a chore...I love my wifes hair...it's long and silky and so soft to the touch...i used to love to sit for hours while we watched tv and run my fingers thru it, but no more...now it seems if we are even watching tv in the same room, we sit on opposite ends of the couch...when we sleep, she used to lay on my chest...and we always used to kiss, but very seldom anymore...seems like the only time we kiss is when one of us is trying to get the other ready to "fuck" (which happens few and far between)... The only reason that I can find in my twisted warped little mind to Stay w/ Rita is the kids...brittany in particular...I am her sun and her moon...night and her day...I can't have my little girl growing up thinking i am a dickhead oh well, gotta go for now...more later

      Well, Sue wrote me tonight...I am excited that she still wants me to be a part of her life (even if is only in a friendship capacity)...but the rest of the letter sounds as if she wants no more than that from me...  Bob,  I thought all day and night about the e-mails. This needs to just end. I dont ever wanna feel the guilt for what happens to your family and worse then that I dont want you to ever hate me for a choice you may regret later. I also can not stand the thought of the pain it is going to cause to hear you are not leaving and to have to hear what will make me feel as if Im not good enough or worth it agian. Its just a no win situation.  I do love you Bob and I know you feel the same for me but you also know I can never make up for a big house and a place at the beach and nice cars and my parents are not her parents and im not the happy home maker, I dont even cook for christ sake.  I will always be here for you. We can talk whenever ya want as much as you want. As far as seeing you? Well, thats a more painfull part. Give me time to work up to that please. But you are my friend for life and I wont shut you out.  Im sorry it has to end up this way babe but I wont set myself up for hurt and disapointment anymore. But I will love you forever.  Susie

      Well, the clutch went out on my car Saturday night, so I have been driving my truck...1 thing wrong...the radio is out in the truck...and my commute is one hour either way...since i work 3:30pm to midnight, my drive home is quite boring ...my mind has time to wonder ...i start fuckin' up and thinkin'!...Either way it turns out, I am going to hurt someone that I love....Why don't I just take the easy way out...I drive over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge every day and night...at night there is very little traffic if any maybe 1-2 cars a minute?? Well, the "road heighth" is 198' over the water / and the Tower heighth is 354'...nice belly flop off the roadway??? less than 5 seconds falling 100 mph and hitting the water??? DAMN! Sue used to kid me about calling her when I got home so she wouldn't worry....she used to say "I'd never even know it if you fell off the bridge" and I'd give her some smart ass answer like "sure ya would, it'd be all over the news the next day"...lol...guess that's not funny   urlLink http://www.ce.jhu.edu/mdcive/lanebay.htm

      I feel a little better today after Sue E-mailed me a couple of times...I wish she would have IM'd me but hey, just to see that name show up on my mailbox made me feel better.. She was basically saying that I need to make my own decisions and that she did not want to influence me..she says she understands how hard this is for me and how much I love my kids... she said that she really loves me and always will...and I do love her...but from the way I understand it, for women it's either all or nothin'...you can't have a loving relationship and then go back to being friends (thanx for the advice Kathy ;))... I love her and really DON'T wanna lose her...blah blah blah...ok, if ya don't wanna read my "blog" than go away..get your own!...see, i am in a better mood today....i got a hell of a sence of humor...also started giving this URL out to a few friends...hopefully I can start getting some responses too  Bob

      Well, here it is, Monday Morning...Feeling a little down this morning (not suicidal tho')..just sittin' here having my coffee...  I miss Sue...She does daycare and I work evenings so we always had the mornings to "chat" together...we'd turn on the cams.. and every morning, we would have our morning coffee together online..(Ok..I know that sounds corny, but it got to be a ritual)..I loved to watch her sit there and smile...(I love her smile, she has dimples)...she also has long curly dark hair, and has a tendency to "flip" it over her shoulder (definately sexy)...i used to beg her to do the "hair flippy thing"  more later

      sue im'd me tonight to "just wanted to see how I was doing".... I feel real bad that I resonded w/ "fuckin' peachy, you?"  I really feel bad, sometimes I feel so selfish...she needs someone there for her full time...  Lemme explain, she is divorced w/ child ... I am married w/ children...she is ALWAYS alone...I always have someone to go home to (even tho' we don't always get along and over the years my love for my wife has turned into more of a friendship thing than a relationship)...but I would do ANYTHING in the world for Sue...She is one terrific woman...  delima is.....should I stay w/ my wife and hurt Sue or should I leave my wife and hurt her and be happy w/ Sue?...My wife makes me somewhat happy, but Sue makes me really happy?? Remember, I have kids  youngest of which is 10....she is my pride and joy...i can't disappoint her!!  It got to the point the other day that I was making myself sick and I scared myself...I actually started thinking about the easy way out...that's right, suicide...no descisions to make...only how many oxy-contins to pop and how much "Jack" to chase them with...  That's why I am on here....kinda like therapy...I have no one that I can talk to about this, so basically talk to myself

      I was doing ok this morning, but my thoughts are really fucked up right now....This is a song by Ozzy Osbourne called "Changes"..It really sums things up right now::  Changes (4:41) I feel unhappy, I feel so sad, I lost the best friend that I ever had, She was my woman, I loved her so, But it's too late now, I've let her go  I'm going through changes I'm going through changes We shared the years, we shared each day, In love together we found a way,But soon the world had its evil way, My heart was blinded,Love went astray  I'm going through changes I'm going through changes  It took so long to realize, And I can still hear her last goodbyes, Now all my days are filled with tears, Wish I could go back and change these years  I'm going through changes I'm going through changes
