      Okay, so this is how my heart got broken...it all started yesterday. my best friend, chrissy came over, and she has this boyfriend named mark. they've been going out since like forever, well, this is like the 6th time, they're pretty much on and off. but anyways, we decided that mark would pick us up and take us to his baseball playoffs b/c we just wanted to go. that all went pretty well. i've always had my eye on my ex-bf named nathan... we met at this party, and i really like him. well, i still liked him even after he broke up with me the first time. so, he is the pitcher on the team. anyway, i thought for sure we were over. meanwhile, me and my friend chrissy went back to marks house with his friend danny. next, they dared me to make out with danny, so i did, the sad part was that i was supposed to be going out with his cousin kyle. but, then, danny said, forget about Kyle, will you go out with me? and i basically said no. then, mark invites nathan to come over and i secretly get all excited. when he gets there, we have a water fight and me and nathan were totally flirting. we all decided to go to marks aunts house to swim in her pool. nathan and me are still flirting and i get on his shoulders to play chicken. but, to make this long story short, we flirted alot and inbetween the part where he keeps dunking me, we start holding hands, it already seems like we're back together. im psyched! he was everything i wanted and now it was like i had it. then, on the way to drop me and my friend off back at my place, nathan and me make out the entire way home. at that point, it was like i knew we were together, and he promised he would call me. i was sooooo happy. i felt like it was all too good to be true, well i was right. especially when all the guys stood me and my friend up the next morning b/c "they thoguht their games got cancelled" that was a crock of shit if i ever heard one. they wouldnt even pick up their cells. then a few hours ago, the guys finally call me back, i was so glad they did, but it was just danny and danny says, "do you want to go out with kyle now?" and im like, "i cant, b/c im going out with nathan" and danny says, "i hate to be the one to have to break this to you, but lindsay called last night. (nathans exgf of only like 2 days) and she asked nathan back out...he said yes."  at this point im already near tears. i ask to talk to nathan so they put him on. i ask to make sure everything they said was true, only to hear exactly what i wished was a joke. im then heartbroken. i call him an asshole, and all he has to say is, "i know, im sorry" i said, "i thoguht we were going out after last night." and he didnt say anything, then i said, "then what was last night for?" and he said, "i dunno" i just felt hurt. i was nothing more than a rebound chick to him, i felt like no one cared about me or my feelings, how could they say that to me like it was no big deal?? i finally got off the phone and just laid in my bed and cried. now my emotions are so mixed, like, im hurt, depressed, stressed out, and really pissed off. this really sucks, my heart is broken.  *STAY TUNED FOR MORE ISSUES FROM THE DRAMATIC LIFE OF MY TEENAGELYHOOD*

      You were here and gone in the blink of an eye you missed so much, we all still cry.  You can't see Trent, the way we all see him you can't be here for steph, her days are so grim.  you never met benny the way mike did couldnt see him on angie's wedding day, death took that bid.  trent was so brave, but still so young he doenst understand what death has done.  if i could just see you, or even touch your face it would still take a lifetime to fill in your place.  You left so soon, we just werent ready though you walk the streets of heaven, slow and steady  although i was young when you passed on i still wiped her tears and said, "mommy, whats wrong?"  the heart is so fragile, and yours was so weak you sat at your desk, your face so bleak.  within a few moments the day went black momma lifted her head, "she not coming back.  gloria died of a heart attack."
