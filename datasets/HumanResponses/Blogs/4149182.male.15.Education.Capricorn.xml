       As the title says...    Too many sappy love songs, to be honest. The adapted title of this blog comes from a song by Savage Garden, from way back in the day when I  used  to like pop music. But the feeling is the same. Actually, I remember dancing with Sam to that song way back in Grade 6... oh well.      Well, perhaps prayer will help. I  did  try, after all. And I should talk to Britney soon. From what Taylor says, she's actually a decent person... something rare to come by these days. And from what she's told  me  in the past, she and Courtney may be great friends on the surface... but there's an unpleasant side to the relationship.      Oh, and then there's the Chauncy problem. Don't get me started on  that  little asshole. He's probably one of the biggest causes of this whole mess, and if he stays at Regi, I'll make his worthless life as miserable as an English winter day. Mark my words. I can just imagine the shite he's been feeding her. He's so... Machiavellian. Bastard deserves punishment, and what he doesn't realise is that he's all alone. Nobody cares for him. Everyone hates him. I have the advantage.      This isn't going away, dammit. Looks like I'm in for the damned long haul. Just like the British in World War II... I got knocked on my ass, sure enough, and put on the defensive: but like Churchill said...      "We shall fight on the beaches; we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and the hills and the towns; we shall  never  surrender."      Amen, Winston. Amen to that.

      Well, time has passed.  The rather regretful love continues to consume me at the same rapid pace. I think just seeing her again started it all over again...  This is not hell, nor am I out of it.  That girl simply did not realise what she did to me. It was something that was hard to describe, even back in the day when it was pure and untouched. Now, it's even worse. Because she fuckin'  hurt  me, and what the hell did I get for it? Lies, pain, and sorrow! I simply cannot believe that girl. But I still want to talk to her about it, at least in a circumstance where I can tell her what happened, and where her "friends" can't screw it up.  Bloody hell, but I want payback. I still  want  to forgive her, but that's more of a forlorn dream of days past. Forgiveness is something that's very hard to give, especially under such circumstances as these.  My taste in music isn't helping either, since much of it is shifting towards sappy rock love/regret songs... probably because of the mood I've been in since June, when I started downloading craploads of the stuff. A coping device, if you will.  All I can do is hope and pray that Britney will come on MSN sometime soon, and I can begin dealing with this shite again.  But , this time, I'll be prepared. I'd better be. I better get a plan.  "Yer average Russky don't take a dump without a plan, son."  Well, except I'm not Russian. But the comment still applies.  Alex said that I could just substitute names in this, and make a romance novel out of my life. A possibility, I must admit. But for the time being, I'll just wallow in misery, mull this over, and create a plan to fix all of this. It'll fail, no doubt, but sometimes people have to sacrifice something so they can find the truth. That letter was an example. It  did  show me the truth, after all.

      Ok, this is just too weird for me to believe its a coincidence. These last few nights (including last night), I've kept having dreams about Courtney. When I went to see  The Manchurian Candidate  at the Cineplex, I saw her. I don't know if she noticed me, although I suspect Britney Brown did. I think she did, and merely chose to ignore me. I  do  stand out in a crowd, what with the height and the hair. God is not happy with me, to toy with me so.  The odd thing is, when I saw her, my stomach began doing somersalts. This is bloody proof that I'm not over her. Fate is playing games with me. God, but do I ever hate Fate. This afternoon, I was pondering whether I was over her: now I know. I'm not.  Know what's really horrible? The entire time, I  knew  I was going to see her there. I kept thinking, "What if I see Courtney?" I had no information, and it wasn't something I expected, but it happened. Now I'm  really  freaked out.  I  should  hate her. But I can't. In fact, I still think I'm in love with her, against everything that  should  be happening. I want to hate her... but I also want to love her. I want to take back everything that happened. I want to change it all.  Why, oh why, is this girl playing on my heartstrings like a fuckin' banjo? Why did I have to fall in love with the Goddamned, shallow, beautiful, ignorant, two-faced tease that I did? The sight of her... it's the first time I've seen her since that bloody incident in June, and it was like smacking me across the face. It was like electricity shocking me through and through.  I really need to start talking to Britney Brown about all this. I'm getting... weirded out. I need to deal with this head on. Prayer might not hurt, either. God helped me last time this shit rose up, and perhaps He will help me again. All I can do is hope, ponder, and try to seek out that elusive grain of truth. Although talking to Britney will help me enormously - I'll get Taylor to contact her. Speaking of which, I'll have to talk to him  extensively  about this. God, but is this ever frustrating. It's like June 24th, 25th, and 26th all goddamn over again.  As long as I live, I will never forget the moment that I first experienced heartbreak. I will never forget that moment when she stood there, looked me in the eyes with those cold, uncaring glassy eyes, and said, "Frank, I don't want to talk about it, if it's going to make me upset," and then walked away without a glance backwards. It continued after, but like a chicken with it's head cut off. The 26th, and what she said to me over the rather impersonal interface of MSN, cinched the deal. I thought it was gone.  It's not.

      Ok, so I was sleeping last night (as usual). And I've had dreams about her numerous times before. But this was different. Very. Different.  But this dream was completely contrary to all the dreams that I've had about Courtney. In the rest of the dreams, she avoided me, she didn't say a word. In this one... she was like... an actual person. I bumped into her in the hall, and I remember thinking, "Aww, God damn it, she's going to be a bitch." But she wasn't. She apologised, talked to me, and said she was sorry about what happened, and that she hadn't meant for that to happen, all of what she said was just to preserve her reputation, etc etc. She also looked... very beautiful. I was like... "WHAT?!", at least in my mind, but had a major conflict of interest. I couldn't decide. In the end, I remember talking to her, and that was that. That was the end. It was weird.  Why did this happen? Are my feelings for her resurfacing after all?

      Ahh! Bored. So bored.  My allergies are almost gone... and I went to go buy  Return Engagement . But guess what? They had it in stock... but not on shelves. WHAT THE HELL!? Damn Chapters.  I had a dream last night. It wasn't a pleasant dream. It was about the first day of school... and it was realistic, unlike most of my dreams. Courtney was there. She looked... exactly like real life. She looked... good. But guess what? She didn't say a word to me in the entire thing. Ever. She didn't even meet my eyes. It was creepy. It was realistic.  I hated it.  I'm really thinking about her too much. After what she did to me, why should I? She deserves  punishment . God damn it, I want revenge! But I also want to forgive her, not matter what happens. Turn the other cheek, if you will. But, it's pretty damn hard to do. Jesus had it right, but he didn't give any pointers!  Damn her.  I also have the nasty feeling that when I get back to school, there are going to be massive "social" consequences from this (even though that bitch sneers at consequences). She's probably going to do the typical chick thing and get all her friends to hate me for doing something genuinely nice and humble. Fuck, but does the world ever suck. Damn her.  Arg. I should shut up about that.  "And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man in the moon, when you coming home, son I don't know when, we'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then."

       Man oh man, but allergies REALLY suck. I mean, seriously, come on. I've got a horrible cough, sneezing and sniffling (the headache and plugged ears are gone), and even a slight fever. Its horrible.      Read some more out of  The Rise And Fall Of The Great Powers . Excellent book. It covers pretty much everything from 1500 to 2000 (even if it was written in '87). Combined with  A History Of Warfare , you get an enormous amount of information. It's even helped me to do some more work on Entente, but I still have to figure out the income triggers.  C'est la vie.       Couldn't go to see  West Side Story  today, even if some of my friends are going and someone I know is starring in it. Why? Damn allergies. Or if it's a bug, I'd infect everyone in the Grand Theatre. Oh well.      I've also found alot of good music lately. Helps keep my mind off that certain... person. Even if much of it is sap-tastic music (its still good!), it still helps. Even though Bryan Adams is way too despressing for normal listening.

        Well, what a boring day.      Not even any crazy weather to comment about.      Not even anything political to comment about. Well...      Ever noticed how George W. Bush looks  exactly  like a monkey? Here's proof:    - well, there would be, except the link ain't working. -      Small wonder the Yanks elected him. Err... wait, a  big  wonder. Oh yeah... he didn't even really get elected at all.      Whatever.      Worked on the StarCraft map today (Entente: Europe 1900). It's utterly painful to do, and I'm apparently one of the most patient people on the planet for being able to do it. It'll be worth it in the end, and there are  some  tangible results so far. Might post a link, sometime.      Oh yeah, and Eric Clapton is the shit. Seriously. He rocks. And rap sucks. Don't get me started on rap.      Wonder what I'm having for dinner.
