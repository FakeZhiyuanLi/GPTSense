      Thieves!&nbsp; Evildoers!&nbsp; While I was over at a friend's house last night, I receive a call from my husband to not drive home if I've been drinking because cops were crawling all over our neighborhood looking for the fool who attempted to break into our garage.&nbsp; Yikes!   Why on earth would someone want to break into my garage?&nbsp; To steal a few bikes?&nbsp; Granted, we have some nice bikes, but really, as one of the cops said to John, "There are plenty of easier ways to steal a bike."   To steal our '56 Chevy?&nbsp; Good luck on that one.&nbsp; First of all, there are numerous locks and contraptions to make your way through on the garage door for it, plus a Club on the steering wheel.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that you'd be quite obvious driving down the road in a bronze-and-tan '56 station wagon.&nbsp; I don't think that was it.   Was the cable guy we threw out of our house for being incompentent getting back at us for yelling at him and John calling him an incompetent hack?&nbsp; Wouldn't you just throw a brick through the window?   The thing is, John's car was unlocked, inside is quite a bit of valuable stuff-tools, CDs, etc.&nbsp; But nothing was taken.   So, what the hell?&nbsp; There have been a few garage break-ins in the area lately.&nbsp; Don't we just have a band of unruly teenagers on our hands who think it's cool to break into garages and steal bikes and sell them for cash?   The thing is, we live in freakin' Mayberry.&nbsp; We don't lock our doors at night.&nbsp; We leave all our first floor windows open, and if my daughter can sneak in a window when I'm not home to change her clothes or get something when she's playing down the street, certainly some burglar can climb in my den window and steal my tv and my computer, and be out again in two minutes.   I hope I'm not giving anyone any ideas!&nbsp; Ha Ha.   Well, nothing got taken.&nbsp; John and the dogs heard the loud popping noise when the thief was attempting to pop open the locks.&nbsp; The dogs barked their heads off and the guy fled, John watching him go through the upstairs hall window.&nbsp; But I have an odd feeling he'll be back.&nbsp; I'd like to be sitting in the garage when he comes back, with a cold piece of metal in my hand.&nbsp; That'd scare him, wouldn't it?   I feel so violated.

      Okay, I've figured out how to post pictures to the blog now.&nbsp; How easy is this.&nbsp; Yet still, a complete waste of my time unless anyone else looks at it.&nbsp; Well, we'll see.&nbsp; Must go get ready for the Comcast guy to come and fix the mess yesterday's Comcast guy made of my cable/internet connection.&nbsp; I could probably go on and on about that, but I won't.

       Well, I've discovered yet another way to waste what precious little time I have available to me.&nbsp; A blog!&nbsp; I honestly have nothing to share with the outside world, and this is purely to give myself something else to play with on the computer.&nbsp; I'm a dork.    So what can I put on this silly blog?&nbsp; Pictures of my lovely children and dogs, so I can be perceived as a weirdo dog lover and one of those people who foists photos of their children on other people.&nbsp; Info about my other time waster-knitting.&nbsp; Lists of favorite yarns and free patterns, photos of finished projects (ha!), etc.&nbsp; More pictures of my dogs.&nbsp; Honestly.&nbsp; Like I said, time waster.   &nbsp;

       Okay, now that I've set up this silly blog thing, I find I have to actually update it periodically. And why? Who on earth is going to have any interest in reading this, besides me? I write in my journal all the time, but I know no one is going to be reading it. And although I am fairly certain no one is going to be reading this, there is still the possibility, the chance, that someone is going to stumble across it and say to themselves, "how boring can a blog possibly be?" Well, this is how boring a blog can possibly be. Boring Boring Boring.  I took the kids downstate to see Amish country yesterday. A lovely (okay, boring as all get-out, straight down 57) three-hour drive. And once you get there, you have to be careful not to run down all the Amish people riding around in their horse-and-buggies or on the side of the road on their bikes. We spent several hours in this bizarre "theme park" called Rockome Gardens, the point of which I didn't quite understand. The "Amish home" that you could self-tour (for a fee) had a lightbulb hanging from the ceiling and light switches in all of the rooms. So much for "historically accurate" 1950's Amish home. Light switches my ass. It was just somebody's old house that they threw some old furniture in and called it an attraction. Weird. The best part was that the kids could sit on a horse attached to a harness and ride it around in a circle while it operated a buzz-saw, which a decidedly non-Amish man used to cut a slice of wood from a log. Then we took the wood slices and trotted across the path to the blacksmith's shop, where Patrick the blacksmith, whose specialty is cursive for $1 extra, burned their names into the wood with a red-hot piece of metal and displayed (quite prominently) a wood-burned sign next to an old coffee can that read "Help me go to college. Tips are appreciated." There were a few genuine Amish people working there, but mostly the people seemed to me to be out-of-work carnival workers. They could at least dress like Amish people, for christ's sake. Jeez. However, I suppose it is different than a living-history farm or museum like the ones we've visited. All these pioneers and farmers are gone, as is their way of life. So it is interesting, and not insulting either, for people to dress like them and pretend to be them. But the Amish are still around, are a huge presence, actually, in the Arcola/Arthur Illinois area, and anybody dressing up like them would just be insulting them. But they could HIRE real Amish people to do these things. It was just weird. The few Amish people we did meet, like to woman working at the side-of-the-road quilt shop (which featured some absolutely stunning (and stunningly expensive) quilts), were just regular people dressed plainly. I really did feel an overwhelming desire to sell all of my expensive clothing, shoes, and other accessories, sell my house, my car, and head on down to Arthur Illinois to buy a farm, a horse, and a buggy and wear a prayer cap and a baggy homemade dress and do a lot of chores. But I got over that.  Well, gotta go.
