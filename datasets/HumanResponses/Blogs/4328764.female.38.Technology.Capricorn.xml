      Hoss is my bulldog (for anyone that sees this but doesn't know me), and he is a spoiled one at that. This how we have found him when we came home on several occasions. You can't see it in the picture, but there was a Corona on the railing and his daddy was grilling hamburgers for us...including him.  I wonder what he does that we don't see...maybe I don't want to know, eh?  Anyway, he does weigh at least 62 lbs here. He still thinks he's small enough to be a lap dog, and will climb up in my lap every time he gets tired just to prove it. Of course, at that point I am pinned and have to move a mountain to get up out of the chair. But he has more kisses than I can stand sometimes, and plenty left over for anyone that comes to visit.  I'm definitely a Bulldogger!

      Well, I took Hoss to get neutered this morning. Poor thing, he was so excited it makes me think he has no idea what is to come. He was like a wild thing this morning, playing and running around this morning. The ride in the car was great! We were stuck trying to find a place to get across to the vet's office through all the traffic, and he just watched all the cars and trucks go by. He really loves to watch the cars and truck moving.  Then we got there, and I had to take him over to the side to go potty before we went into the office. He was a total spaz there! I could hardly contain him and in fact, he got loose of his collar and scared a poor little shih-tzu. They called someone from the back to come get him once I put the collar back on and I appologized to the little dog that was just shaking.  Anyway, he goes under the knife between 11 and 2 today, and I can call to check on him later. Then tomorrow he gets a bath before his daddy goes to pick him up. He'll be like a whole new dog!  Here's a little pic of him when he was a baby...that seems so long ago.  He's only about 7lbs there, but he weighed 62lbs last time he went to the vet.  He's 9 months old now and so handsome!
