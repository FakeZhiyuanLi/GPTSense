      finally got a gmail invite, only after a few days of browsing, well all I can say is that it is pretty nice to know that I'll never have to delete another email again, no im not gonna try to fill it up by signing up for spam and the sort but I saw a site that did and sofar after like 2 weeks ofc incoming mail and mailbombs they have only filled up 30% WOW.  *wonder if I can use direct html in this place? oh yeah and once the invites start comin to my box and after I fill family/friend requests... you guys get um

      just finished a pre-calc final today, wasn't that difficult except I skipped a problem on the test, and then not on the answer sheet, Had to go back through and fix it all. Hoping to discover how to add a counter to this place and some links, and categories and other stuff. mostly though I'd like to see a comment on what you'd like to see.
