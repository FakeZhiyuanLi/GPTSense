      I was thinking. What is up with this government? They act like a hypocritical parent. "I know what's best for you" "Do as a I say, not as I do". Since when was this a democracy. I guess conservatives can't really run a democracy. At least not if most of the country isn't. It's like one of the toughest things about being a parent who raises your kid to think on their own and make up their own mind... is when they do make up their own mind and they don't agree with you. You don't want to accept it because you are sure you're right, so how could they come up with something different, and be right?

      Starting an online course this week. And from the looks of it this online thing is pretty rad. I'm looking forward to getting started on it. I did do the first part of the first week's assignment, but I have to get my computer at home online and running before I can do the rest. (Better get going on that huh?) Starting course work again is fun and exciting.  As much as I sucked at school my first time round, and as much as I always ended up hating it 3 weeks in, I still remember the optimism I would start each year, each semester with. A new beginning, a fresh start, I would always be determined that that semester would be the one where I showed up for all my classes, with all my homework completed, and my reports done 2 weeks ahead of time... Yeah right... Good intentions always gave way to boredom, fights with the parents, boyfriends, friends with various crises, and well drugs. A few years ago I did actually successfully complete a full semester of three classes and good grades. Making it the first since sixth grade... Maybe this class will lead to a renaissance

      Oscar Wilde.  We watched An Ideal Husband this weekend. A very cute movie. Zach and I both bemoan the loss of wit in this world. I did not tell him about how I wonder if I lost my wit because of him, but this is because I don't want him to think I regret anything about us together. Because I don't, I willingly suffer the loss of wit, and flirting for him rolling over, pulling me close and whispering he loves me in my ear in the middle of the night...  But back to the subject.... Oscar Wilde was definitely the master of wit. I've decided to pick up some of his works and actually read them.... For being such a well read person I feel as if I am missing huge parts of what is considered essential reading... There must be some list somewhere of the top 100 must reads, classics, what-have-you's... I should find that list, and start working my way down it. I am at work, wishing I was at home fixing my computer, so that I can start my course work. Ah well. Thus is life....

      I thought that this would be a good outlet for those letters I never write because I don't know where to send them. This one is for Kev. Kev- I saw a Mallory-dog today and thought of you.... I wonder, do you like Texas? Zach's going to end up splitting off from Gina and start his own thing. Seems to keep happening to her... Oh well. Life goes well. Evie leaves for Ghana way too soon (next weekend). Mom and I are getting along extraordinarily well. We've been gardening up a storm. Dirty kneed, sweaty and bug bitten... It's been more lovely than I can tell you to have a backyard.  It seems funny to me that I don't have a slightest clue where you are or how you are. We were going to spend the rest of our lives together.... And while I don't regret our decisions... I wish we hadn't lost touch. Though, for now maybe it's better. I'm starting a class next week... Computer programming. Yes, I finally gave in to the inevitable. But it's only as a means to an end. I will start pursuing my CPA soon enough after the programming classes are over. With Zach starting his own business, and this being only the first of many I see the need for a good accountant in the act.  I hope you are being watched over. And that all your plans go well, and when they go astray that at least you don't. I hope you know I just always wanted the best for you. And I miss you.  Always, Ursa D. Bear

      Further thoughts on our parental government. I was thinking that a lot of the controls the government places in our lives are side effects of this country being a Christian country. The interesting thing though is that according to Christian doctrine God gave us free-will. But by placing so many regulations on us, the conservatives are trying to take that away. Of course we can still "choose" to break the law, but the idea being that most won't (christian or just good citizen). But shouldn't it be up to each of us. I mean we're not banning fast food, and while we ticket speeders, we very rarely actually jail and prosecute them. So why would we ban marijuana? Shouldn't that be up to us? Why is it the government gets to pick and choose what's bad for us? And what is merely unhealthy? (Aren't they the same thing?) As an aside, brew is going well...

      Zachary (the reason I'm no longer a wit, see below) and I began the grand adventure of home brewing. And from what I can gather we are joining an horde of other hobbyists. The reasons we wanted to do this? Well we're incurable DIY'ers, it's ton cheaper, and by all accounts creates the best beer ever.... A wonderful little homebrew shop down the street from Jenny and Casey's house supplied us with everything we needed, and we spent Saturday evening, brewing, cooling, measuring and finally storing the brew. Now patience.... If all goes well in three weeks time we will be enjoying our first batch of homebrew....I'll let you know how it goes

      So I was cleaning out my email box. (I was bored at work). And I was reviewing old emails, seeing if they were worth keeping, and I noticed something. I used to be witty. My emails, long or short were entertaining. Why is this? And why am I no longer a wit? Did I just write more then? Therefore in order not to bore myself have to be clever? Or did have to do with the company I kept? I still keep clever company.... Was it because I was single and flirted more? Flirting is an art form that I enjoyed.... But no longer. Now that I am no longer honing that sword, does the wit also rust and grow dull in the corner? Was it a survival skill that once not needed retreats to the subconscious? I would hate to think of flirting as a survival skill....

      It was a success! Wild, delicious, clean, and cheap!!! I love our beer, and I'm looking forward to going full steam ahead with it now that we know it works so damn well! While looking around I found a wonderful website filled with recipes... urlLink The Cat's Meow , is searchable by ingredient, which is what I needed. (Looking for a coffee stout). But the links are a little screwy and I found I needed to take a few words out of the address every time to pull up the actual recipe. This weekend is the 4th, I don't expect to see fireworks this year. Which is slightly disappointing. Maybe I'll try to talk Zach into it. Actually I will, and see if I can get our other (non)friends to come as well. Well, at work, and have much homework to do....
