      Tuesday, July 20 2004 These are just a few selections from when I was a lowly, 1st quarter copywriter. Browse through them if you’d like. Please note, just like Heddy’s lecture disclaimer, I frequently use foul language. I’m Irish Catholic, what the fuck do you expect?  Shitty writing at its best  Monday, January 19   Big Al’s BMW So my friend Mike is in town for a couple of weeks. He's the only one left who's still in an academic institution of some sort. The kid's a year away from getting his degree in pharmacy from the University of Montana. It's so fucking cold and snow laden there this time of year that they give the students practically the whole month of January off.  At about 1:43 this afternoon my bedroom door flings open.  "Get up, pussy," my roommate Ackerman grumbles at me in his usual baritone.  I'm hurting pretty bad from a night of boozing it up that lasted until about 5 AM. I say nothing. He begins berating me, now with movie lines.  "Stu! You're rent's do mother fucker! Don't pull that falling down the stairs shit on me. You conscience."  "Get out of my room you damned communist," I fire back at him behind closed eyes."  "No, seriously dude, get up. It's 2 o'clock. Mike's taking us to get your truck."  "Fuck my truck."  "Well he's coming to pick me up in about 15 minutes and we're going to get food in the Highlands, so if you want me to take you to your truck this is you're only chance. I'm not going back over there later. Besides, he's got his dad's new Beemer."  I guess I should clarify a few things before continuing. Mike's dad, Big Al, is a pretty damned brilliant lawyer and consequently, friggin' loaded, hence the Beemer.  Ackerman is always playing angles. In this case he's probably correct in assuming that I'll ask him to take me down to the Highlands--where I left my truck the night before because I was too shitfaced to drive 4 miles home. Sometimes, however, his constant effort to make decisions based on his interpretation of the law of averages pushes his personality towards out-and-out paranoia, especially when girls are added to the mix.  I am extremely fucking lazy and difficult to deal with when I have just woken up. When I was in college I had to alarm nearly 2 and a 1/2 hours before I actually had to get up because of my propensity for mashing the snooze button over and over and over again. This drove my roommates crazy.  I've gotten a little better about it, but alcohol consumption the night before can certainly make me revert to my docile ways, as it did tin this case.  "His black Beemer?" I ask.  "Naw, nugga," Ack explains sensing his opportunity to close the deal. "Brand new two thousand-fizzo, 525i. He's only had it for two weeks. He just left for Kansas City this morning so Mike's got it for a few days. We're gonna take it out on the highway and see what it can do."  By this point he's got me. I start to accept the fact that I'm going to have to get out from under the warm, wrinkled covers and be a citizen of the world once more. Yes, the Beemer's the main enticement, but also the need to urinate is becoming critical as well. All the forces of the universe are conspiring with one another to push me towards my bathroom.  "Alright. Alright, just get the fuck out of my room and I'll get up," I tell him.  "Bullshit," he replies as he flicks on my overhead light. "You'll go right back to sleep, man."  Bluff called.  I throw the covers off to the side in one swift, violent motion and immediately spring myself off the right side of my bed and onto my mom's old oriental rug. As I pass by Ackerman, who is still standing in the doorway—now scrolling through his cell phone—I flip a quick bird mere inches from his face. He flinches slightly.  "And don't take one of those twenty minute showers either, I'm hungry," he parks at me as I close the bathroom door behind me.  "Fuck off," I retort.  After pissing for what seemed like a minute and taking an economical shower, I reenter my room, throw on some clean duds, toss my cloths from the night before in my closet and head downstairs for my daily 2 glasses of morning OJ. Mike has just arrived and sitting on the couch flipping through channels in the living room.  "What's up, slacker," he says, remote in hand.  "Hunger over, my man."  "Oh yeah. Y'all get pretty wasted at the bar last night?"  "Kinda," I respond as I pour glass number 1. "We were drunk enough at the bar, then we came back here, played Palace and killed two bottles of wine at Steve's request. I'm fucking dehydrated."  More clarification. Palace is a game of cards that my friends and I quasi-invented and play quite often. Steve is one of my other roommates. The other, Chris, is the only one who actually had to go to work today.  "Did Ack tell you about my dad's new ride?" Mike asks.  "Yeah," I say in between gulps of orange juice, "sounds pretty slow."  "Wait until you ride in this thing, man, it's fucking amazing."  I didn't have to wait long. Ackerman had us out of the house within five minutes, and there it was in the driveway. Beautiful piece of machinery covered in glossy Navy blue with some sort of dorsal fin sticking jutting out of the back part of it.  "Holly shit, Mikie," I offer as jaw drops a little.  "She's a beaute," he agrees.  "What's with the fin," asks Ackerman.  "GPS system, man," says Mike. "Al doesn't fuck around."  "Shotgun," I declare.  So we hop in, back down the driveway and pull onto the curvy, residential street that runs by our neighborhood in Toco Hills.  Mike has always been a very aggressive, if not dangerous, driver and he's always been blessed with expensive, fast cars with which to fuel that fire. The car starts beeping.  "What the hell is that?" asks Ack.  "That's Rye not putting on his seatbelt. It'll keep doing that until he does," explains Mike.  "You're shittin' me," I say as I reach for my belt. Those Germans sure mean business."  In addition to all the amenities one might expect in a car of this magnitude--leather interior, fancy pop-out cup holders, floor mats, etc--there's a fucking TV screen in the dash and a joystick sticking out of the console that controls the GPS, radio and whatever the hell else you can pull up on it. Pretty cool stuff.  The goddamned machine takes turns like a champ. Mike is sure to get it up to speed before stop signs so he can demonstrate its superior stopping ability even at high speeds.  "Feel the weight being redistributed?" he asks as we transition smoothly from 45 to a sturdy stop.  "That's fucking awesome," offers Ackerman. And I tend to agree. At this point I'm completely enamored with the vehicle, and we haven't even gotten on the highway yet. We continue to wind around back roads before hitting North Druid Hills, which is the road that most conveniently takes you from my house to I-85 South.  "You ready boys?" asks Mike.  Oh sure. And why not. I've personally never owned a fast car and for good reason. When I wrecked my last pickup truck in August, my rental was a Poniac Grand Am GT, white. That motherfucker was entirly too fast for me. I do not need that kind of horsepower at my disposal. I tend to develope a lead foot. Not safe for me, or other drivers for that matter.  So we pull onto the onramp and Mikie steps on it. The thing really does purr, I mean I'm not even a big car guy. It' rather impressive. We merge over to the HOV lane climbing into the 90's. At this point we're pretty much blowing the doors off are fellow travelers.  "Jesus Christ," exclaims Ackerman.  We hit 100.  Out the passenger side window is a blur of 18-wheelers, soccer moms in minivans, and other less privileged motorists.  "You can't help but be a little arrogant driving a car like this," confesses Mike.  "A little arrogant?" I ask sarcastically. We're in an airplane fer crissake."  We max out at 112 before the traffic becomes too heavy in front of us and Mike is forced to shut it down. Deceleration is so smooth in a that bad boy.  "How 'bout that, fellas," asks Mike.  "Very nice," I agree.  "I'd definitely fuck it in the tailpipe," confesses Ackerman earnestly.  We hit up the 10th/14th Street exit and work are way through traffic and pull up in front of my old house on Greenwood where my alumni status allows me to park and leave my truck overnight if need be. I get out, Ackerman takes over shotgun, and with that, my joyride is over. The Germans, for all their faults, can build one hell of an automobile, that's for sure  We eat a sandwich in the parking lot of Alon's Bakery and I follow them back to the house, albeit not closely.  Tuesday, January 20 Q & A-Deuce style I recently came home to find a large Ziploc bag attached to the windshield wiper of my truck. Inside was a note from a young couple new to the neighborhood.  It explained that in their effort to become better acclimated with their new surroundings, they would like for everyone in the Mason Woods Neighborhood Association to fill out an attached questionnaire and submit a picture of everyone in their household.  They, in turn, plan on taking this information and using it to create a comprehensive Mason Woods directory.  Being the resident scribe at “The Deuce”—our address is 1072—I decided to fill in the necessary information. Here’s how it turned out:  1072 Mason Woods Dr.  “The Deuce”   1) Q-Your names, ages, college affiliations and cell phone #'s   1) A-Chris Prince, 26, Florida State University, 404.386.8962  Ryan Dean Waite, 26, University of Georgia, 404.310.2221  Matt Ackerman, 26, Carolina School of Broadcasting, still uses carrier pigeons  ‘Deuce’ Alumni  Chef Steve Sharp, 26, Johnson & Wales University  P.F.C. Robert Burns, 25, United States Army   2) Q-Any kids that no longer live at home  2) A-Not that I know of, although it was rumored that Bobby paid for an abortion or two in high school  3) Q-Home phone #  3) A-No house phone  4) Q-Any pets?   4) A-Pricilla, a 5 year-old ball python and whatever varmits can squeeze their way in through that hole behind the fridge  5) Q-When did you move in?   5) We moved into ‘The Deuce’ in August, 2001—just shortly before all hell broke loose.   6) Q-Where are you from originally?  6) A-Chris-Atlanta  Ryan-Leesburg, FL  Matt-Leesville, LA  Steve-Atlanta  Bobby-the UPS guy’s penis  7) Q-What are your vocations?   7) A-Chris-high school English teacher  Ryan-graduate student/contractor  Matt-video/film production  Steve-chef de partie  Bobby-trained assassin   8) Q-Hobbies, interests?  8) A-Chris enjoys The Simpsons, getting stoned and blacking out at bars.  Ryan enjoys good head, racquetball and waving his fist at stupid people in traffic.  Matt enjoys “sexing up his girlfriend,” Grand Marnier and Coen brothers’ films.  Steve enjoys being stubborn, tennis and athletic sex with Asian women.  Bobby enjoys drinking, fucking and killing.  Collectively, we also throw two huge parties per year—as many of y’all have surely noticed—including our annual Halloweeen in June party (June-O-Ween) and one helluva post X-Mass bash in which the theme changes yearly. But there’s always a theme. That’s key.   9) Q-Something that might surprise us about you?  9) A-Chris occasionally gets off the couch  Ryan occasionally doesn’t start a fight after a night of bourbon drinking  Matt occasionally doesn’t use Aveda haircare products  Steve’s actually not a very good cook  Bobby is yet to record a confirmed kill   Wednesday, January 21, 2004  The Cabin Classic Okay, so this is all being written post-mortem, sorry. I spent Saturday, Sunday and this morning up in Blue Ridge, Georgia at the second annual Cabin Classic Texas Hold ‘Em Tournament—which actually consisted of about 12 separate tournies throughout our stay. Basically 12 of my buddies and I rented a cabin in North GA, provisioned ourselves with what you might expect, got drunk/stoned and played poker tournaments all weekend. I brought pen and paper to record the weekends festivities, however, it never quite made it out of my bag. I did get some good video footage of both nights—a clear indicator that I was out of a couple of tournaments earlier than I would have liked—and after viewing that this afternoon, I can real off a few high/lowlights. Friday night was rough. The first tournament saw me exit quickly. I went ‘all-in’ early with two pair—kings and threes—and got burned when my buddy Jesse pulled out a straight on the last card, otherwise known as ‘the river.’ So, seeing as I was the first to drop out and that tournament went on for a good two hours after that, I did quite a bit of whiskey drinking. Tournament #2: same result. Although my friend Davies got knocked out first, I wasn’t too far behind him. This time it was on a much worse hand. I was pretty much itching to take someone down and the first time I pulled a pair of aces on the flop, I went for the gusto. Caplan promptly called me and sent me packing with two pair. Another loss. At this point, my luck turned around. A couple of other guys got knocked out, so we decided to open up our own ‘real money table’ while our more fortunate cohorts were still battling it out for the tournament prize.  My good friend and old roommate, Sean Beattie, had gotten there too late to enter into the first tourney and was knocked out of the second one shortly after me. Due to his aggressive nature at the table, I decided to go after him with guns blazing if a truly ‘unbeatable hand’ came my way. It didn’t take too long. About 7 or 8 hands into the thing I was up about 10 bucks over my initial chip draw of 20. Beattie was about the same. I pulled king/eight off the deal and watched him raise two bucks. I knew he had an ace with a good kicker. The flop was gorgeous: king, six, eight. He had to call my $3 raise this time, but didn’t re-raise. The turn was a three—no help for anybody. I bet $5. Tater, the other remaining player, folded. “You ain’t got shit,” said Beattie after staring me down for about 45 seconds. He called. The river was an eight. I had the nuts.  Allow me to explain. In Texas hold ‘em, you’re playing poker with only two cards in your hand. The other five cards are flipped face up on the table in increments of 3-1-1. The first 3—the flop, the 4th card—the turn, the 5th and final—the river. There’s betting in between each of these cards being flipped, as well as before the first and after the last. By ‘the nuts’ I mean I had a hand—8’s over kings—that I knew he couldn’t beat, unless he also had a king and an 8 which was an astronomical improbability. So, anyway, back to the action. I figured, at best, that the little Cajun bastard had two kings, two pair—kings and either a three or six—or something else I could beat.  “I’m all in,” I mumble as I start to count my chips. “Watcha got there, Dubya,” he asks. “19.75,” I respond. “I’ll call ya, Dubya,” says as he flips his king/three. “Sorry, brother,” I lie as I drop the bad news on the table. “Ohhhhhhhh,” the rest of the table erupts as I scrape what remained of Beattie’s stack. So that’s poker for you. I lose $20 in two tournaments in a matter of 45 minutes, and it only takes me about 15 minutes at the real money table to make about $50. Gotta love that. Sunday I woke up Sunday morning on the floor with my trusty gray sleeping bag and my green fleece from the night before as my pillow. My friend Flounder was passed out on his half-deflated air mattress to the right of me. It was 11:45. I crawled upstairs towards the smell of coffee. It was waiting there for me along with about 9 of the 13 folks that had come up the night before. I grabbed myself a cup and sat down at the table.  Steever and Blatt were preparing breakfast burritos. Phil sat down next to me and we traded war stories from the night before as we sipped on our mountain grown Folgers. After breakfast, the tournaments got rolling once again. At about 1:30 we came to the unfortunate realization that our satellite TV system didn’t pick up local channels. This meant no AFC or NFC Championship games for us. Of all the fuckin’ luck. The first tournament saw me finish 4th, merely one spot out of the money. The second, 5th. We took a break, re-tapped the keg and a couple of he guys who were only staying one night began to gather their belongings and discuss who was riding with whom. At this point, I got hot. I finished 2nd in a tournament, netting me $20. Then, came the crowning achievement of my weekend. I came back from virtually dead to take down Jesse, on a straight flush, en route to my first all out victory and a $70 payout.  The last tournament of the weekend saw me finish 2nd again and net $20 before cashing the keg and going to bed, this time on my very own double bed. I drooled all over the pillow in my sleep.     Thursday, January 29, 2004  Luke: the Aussie Plastic Fuck Doll My name is Luke. I’m a plastic fuck doll. G'Day.  I have a 10 inch penis that has been fully erect as long as I can remember. I live in the basement of a 36 year old woman named Mistress Victoria. We live in two story condo just outside of Sydney.  Mistress Victoria is 5’2” and weighs about 245 lbs. Believe me, it feels like much more from time to time. She isn’t afraid to really let me have when she’s on top. She’s usually on top. Mostly though, Mistress Victoria is a fine shela. She’s very thoughtful and attentive to my plastic fuck doll needs. She always remembers my birthday and sometime even picks me up little gifts just to show she cares. Just like the other day when she brought home a new set of hand carved mahogany clothes pins for my nipples as well as a new bullwhip to stick up my ass.  I must say I could do without the inanimate objects up the ass. Last week she crammed a milk carton up there for crissake. I’m not familiar with the concept of pain, but that shit just isn’t right.  Sometimes, Mistress Victoria leaves the TV on for me in the basement while she’s at her data processing job in the city. We have satellite TV, so I get to sit back and she what real people do all over the world. It seems to me that many of you Americans go to court to sue one another over petty squabbles and that most of the judges in the US are black. If I were a real person, I’d want to be one of those black judges on TV in America. They really seem to have it good over there Even though my nametag says “Luke,” Mistress Victoria usually refers to me as her “bitch.” I can’t be certain were the nickname came from, but it sure has stuck.  I often find it odd that Mistress Victoria, being a real person and all, seems to always be asking me, a plastic fuck doll, questions about what’s going on. She’s always asking stuff like, “Are you ready for Big Mama, bitch,” “Do you really think I’m done with you yet?” and “How would you like it if I crammed a tin of Altoids up your bloody bitch ass?”  Oh how I wish I could answer the Mistress’ questions for her. Sometimes I think if I could, she might stop cramming things up my ass.  Monday, March 08, 2004  Monday 8:00 AM: Get out of C’s bed and take a piss. She is running late for work. 8:03: Get back in bed and watch her get dressed. 8:10: Steal a cigarette on my way out and head directly to school. 8:25: Reroute to Einstein Bagel where at the drive thru am unable to find wallet. Curse myself for stupid, apologize to the lesbian at the window and wheel my truck out onto Monroe in disgust. 8:27: Before reaching the light at Piedmont, realize I have $200 cash in my jeans pocket. Curse myself twice more. 8:35: Roll into school and immediately start cranking out shit for Sylvia’s class. 11:30: Having thrown only a small portion of garbage together on Photoshop, prepare to just draw the rest of it. 11:31-noon: Look all over the place for colored pencils, but just end of having conversations with other students about how we are all lazy and procrastinate like we’re getting paid for it. 12:01 PM: Resign myself to the fact that I won’t get everything finished on time (1:15), and just fuck off for an hour and 14 minutes 1:15: Leave what little shit is finished in Sylvia’s classroom and return home to slap the rest together. 1:30: Arrive at the Deuce and eat two bowls of Wheaties.

The meeting is good. “You really are a turtle, you know,” she asks rhetorically. “Yeah, I guess so,” I admit. Hey, she was right, and she didn’t even say it in a mean way. 5:45: Get the fuck out. 5:46-7:00 Grab a half a Publix sub and chug over to Blackburn Park in Dunwoody. 7:30-8:30: Go 0-3 (FC, 6-3, F-8) with a run scored.

Posted by: ryan / 10:01 PM   Sunday, March 07, 2004  Confessions of a disgraced insomniac Pulled another one of my quasi-famous all-nighters last night. A very productive one, too, might I add. Okay here’s the drill, I somehow conned my landlord into allowing me to rip the nasty, corroded, mildew-laden wallpaper of my bathroom walls and replace it with a couple of fresh coats of primer and semi-gloss. Here’s the kicker, she’s knocking $300 off my rent for the job. Yesssir. So, I decide to do the whole fucking job last night. Here’s the boring play-by-play.   Thursday Night  9:30- Get out of copywriting class 9:31-10:45- Fuck around with Photoshop comps for Sylvia’s class. Two computers freeze on me and I leave in disgust. 11:00- Arrive at home; Chris is only other roommate present and is already asleep. 11:01-As I begin to tear the moldy shit off the wall, I notice that I’ve been showering in a bathroom with canary yellow wallpaper prominently featuring flowers in pots for going on a year now and am horrified. 12:00 Midnight- Matt gets home and we smoke two bowls 12:15-12:30- Stoned now, I slowly drudge through fifteen minutes of fruitless labor before our friend C.Dubya rolls by. We smoke two more bowls. 1:15- With all the paper down, I make a few minor repairs with dry wall mud.  1:45- Matt goes to bed, I make a cup of coffee and start taping the tile up for the primer stage. I forget to ask him for a nug to puff on periodically throughout the night, I decision I come to regret. 2:30- Priming begins; one layer is completely on there in less than 45 minutes 3:15- Steve comes home jacked up on cocaine. He proceeds to complain about the slack asses that work for him at his restaurant, then walks around the house mumbling to himself about not wanting to be “this fucked up.” 3:40- Steve’s muddles off to bed 4:00- The shit’s still too wet for the second coat. Bring large fan into bathroom for circulation purposes. 4:03- Scrape up some ‘ash tray pot’ and smoke a nasty excuse for a bowl. 4:30 second coat of primer goes on in 30 minutes. 5:00- clean up, putz around, lift weights for about 15 minutes straight, stretch back. 5:45- leave for Waffle House. 6:00- there out of chicken, so I order a patty melt plate, no onions, steamed hashbrowns, a waffle, three cups of coffee and four waters. I buy a paper and read about how old and religious Julio Franco is 6:45- Foolishly go up to school is this delirious state with the naïve notion that I could actually get some work done. 7:45- After fucking around on Internet and getting virtually nothing worthwhile done, leave. The security guard is dead asleep both times I pass him. 8:00- Get back to the house just in time to catch Matt on his way out. We smoke a bowl. 8:15- First layer of paint hits the walls.  8:40-Done. Make another pot of coffee. 10:00-After watching Sportscenter, eating a bowl of cereal and jerking off, I start the second coat. This is done in about 20. 10:20 Start final clean-up preparations, as I am satisfied with my work. 11:00 Steve wakes up and calls me crazy for staying up all night. He is hung over from drinking and from doing the Bolivian marching powder. 11:15 Steve and I watch the last 20 minutes of Seabiscuit. 11:45-3:30-After 25 minutes of taking the tape down, putting the supplies back in and around the tub and taking a moment to marvel at my work, I basically fuck around, make some calls, sit in the hammock, and download music until I can no longer keep my eyes open. At 3:30, Broha comes home. 3:31- I plop my self down on the couch and slip in and out of consciousness for three hours; periodically batting an eye at my phone, which seems to ring about 38 times. Now- I’m up, I’m showered and I’m driving to the bar……
