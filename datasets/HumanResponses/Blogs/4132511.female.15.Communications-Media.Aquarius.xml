      …and I never did think that I would have him back. After all the inauspicious happenings, we’re here back in each other’s arms.  When we were both at the peak of giving up, I did nothing but ask help from God. I couldn’t bear thinking that after those cherubic moments and intrinsic dissensions, we were there struggling for our relationship’s survival. Should we carry on or just restrain whatever is between us? The possible answers make my tears roll down my cheeks. From that day on, I conditioned myself that anytime, God may cart off the life He has endowed in our relationship for the past months. Yes, it was a blessing and forever it will be, but I never know when it is going to close its stage. I was so hopeless then. All I did was to hide myself under my blankets and to cry myself to sleep.   One precious day, with God’s help, I gained ample confidence to express whatever is inside me. I asked him to help me clear all things and God permitted us to be with each other once more.   God indeed moves in mysterious ways. While it is true that we never know what happens next in our lives, it is important that we know how to get close to Him. It is vital that we should hold on to Him, and offer Him our lives no matter what it takes.

               My family had built the foundation of my entire being. It is within the four walls of our abode that my life is established, developed and further enhanced. Aside from this, I am further shaped as I sail on the world beyond the four walls. I encountered things that helped me become what I am now. These are what I call experiences. I had a lot of these experiences as I cruise through the sea of life. These experiences made me define myself more as a person.   	During my elementary years, I used to be the representative of our class in the declamation and monologue contests. The exposures I gained made me realized that I can be a person of full confidence and proficiency. From that time on, I was given more chances to continue exercising my skills in public speaking. I was then a sophomore in high school when my school sent me to compete in the Kingdom wide Search for Young Maria Clara, an oratorical contest. It just did not give me the chance to contend and the opportunity to win the title, but it also helped me boost my self confidence. I did all the necessary preparations before going to the competition. I equipped myself with a lot of faith and belief that I can make it through. I started to become a woman of self-confidence.  	Just last year, I received an invitation from the Global Youth Leadership Conference. It encouraged me to join the leadership seminar in Washington DC and New York City for two weeks. It would have been a great opportunity for me to meet face-to-face with the world’s renowned young diplomats. It is also my desire to step foot on the place where everybody dreams to see. My parents had already made all the needed preparations for my enrolment and flight reservations to join this big event.  However, due to some acts of terrorism which hounded the security situation in the Middle East, my parents had opted to postpone my attendance until next year. It gives me an insight that not all dreams are in easy grasp. I have to learn how to wait for my turn.   	Although I happened to knock upon a hundred doors, some eventually did not open for me. But, how blessed I am to discover other ways to reach my other dreams.  This year, I was asked to run for president of the Student Council. How really grateful I am to be the elected as the head of this most prestigious organization in our institution. It gave me more assurance since I learned that not only the teachers are the ones who see my abilities, but also my fellow students. The experience made me realize that I am more than just an ordinary student who sits and listens as the teacher explains in front of the classroom. I had proven myself that being in this position will make me show the school that I can even excel outside the classroom.  	I almost spent my whole teenage life here in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  My stay here made me a woman of simplicity.  With the strictness of the laws in this country, I grew up without too much fanfare … no dating, no parties, no discos, no movies, because there are no such things like these in Saudi Arabia.  Although I do not live a life of ease, I still manage to continue to pursue this simple life, focus myself through education and finding simple but accurate solutions to my problems.           For four years now, I firmly believe that life here is a lot different compared from those of my age who are in the Philippines. I got more curious to know what is in store for me when I go back home to my country next year.  	I read a lot of newspapers and scan the news at home.  If I find time, I bury myself in front of the television to watch the news on The Filipino Channel.  I browse the internet for the hot issues surrounding the Filipino communities not only in the Kingdom, but also in the Philippines.  This is how my daddy spends his free time when not at his work.  	This gave me the inspiration and confidence to pursue a career in the field of journalism and communications. With those exposures I gained through the years, I know that I am now a person who is high-spirited, confident and globally competitive. These little experiences made me a lot of a better person now.
