      the best i can say is that the movie was  interesting . also it wasn't very great. i don't have any overwhelming recollection of the movie being  bad  per se, but considering i don't feel strongly in the other direction either i believe that makes it just another flick that barely hit par.

      monday nights are now official 'feel-good movie' nights. so whenever monday night rolls around, be sure you've got at least one flick packed full of the warm fuzzies. if you're like me and not a huge fan of the genre, well, just do what you can to suck it up and take one for the team. i mean, it  is  official, can't really go against official.

      went to church, did some necessary shopping, sorted through our collective archive of photographs and put them in albums (or on the wall), cleaned the bathroom, ate some  delicious  leftovers, and i think that just about brings us to the here and now. i just realized that the here and now has just become midnight so i'd better get to bed so i'm well rested for my upcoming 9am phone interview!! if it's half exciting as it sounds, i'm sure the thought of falling asleep halfway through it won't even cross my mind. not one bit...

      well, maybe i should say that i love GOOD movies. i've seen plenty of good ones and more bad ones than i care to recall. tonight i saw one that was a pleasant surprise, the  stepford wives . i was skeptical when i saw the previews but there is some funny stuff to see, which is something i never thought i would be able to say about anything that includes bette midler. it must have been the presence of christopher walken, one of the greatest actors around, that was able to de-midler the movie to an acceptable level. even if this is the movie i had to see instead of  the chronicles of riddick  (two of my favorite things in one movie,  space and knives! ) it turned out to be a nice night at the movies. i can't help it, when good movies come out i just want to go see them. if you get a chance, go see  super-size me . although it is sometimes gross and disturbing, it's also rather funny and eye opening. serves to reinforce my opinion that mcdonald's food is the most disgusting stuff i've ever seen.

      yep, that's what i do for the moment. the job thing is moving along, i've finished the preliminary screening for both jobs i'm after so next comes the actual interviews. interview for SBC is monday morning at 9am and will occur over the phone. i was told to expect to take ONE TO ONE AND A HALF HOURS!!! not really looking forward to that, but hey, who cares so long as it's a way to make some cash. the dell interview won't happen until the 23rd which sucks. that's where i'd rather sit around for 40 hours a week but at this point it looks like i will just do whichever is willing to donate more to the fisk fund. supersize me was a pretty funny flick, go see it if you can. apparently the closest movie theater to where we live plays a lot of indie flicks so it will be interesting to see what else shows up there. it seems that launch.com is finally beginning to figure me out, i'm not seeing nearly as much gangsta rap and booty music as i used to, which i count as a nice bonus to the already free music vids streaming to my computer. that's it for now, i think it's time for me to get dinner ready for my wife! later

      this is me, in austin, on a different blog. i'm a married man now. more specifically i'm an unemployed married man. i'm working on that though. right now it's a toss-up between SBC and DELL. i know that at first those might sound like some nice opportunities, but both jobs are just working in call centers. ahh, the prestigious life of a letourneau graduate. anyways, it's nice to be in austin and it's great to be married to such a wonderful (and hot) woman. updates to follow when the mood strikes me.  hey yellow project people, why did miriam get taken off the blog list? she's such a great blogger!

      it was pretty nice just hanging around the apt for a few weeks with nothing really to do. actually, if i could choose what i could get paid for doing, it might very well be for that. however, seeing as no paychecks were arriving for me, i started my job at sbc this past week. it's not very fun. well, i can see how some people might think it's fun, but things like 'learning games' and 'group activities' have always ranked extremely low on my list. at least the first week is done, now i only have 13 more weeks to finish the training course. that's right, 14 glorious weeks of training. 14 weeks during which i'm allowed to be late twice or i get fired. but it's something i can endure, pretty much just because it pays me a lot of money and i like money (as does  urlLink my wife !). i've got to get used to being gone from 7:30 to 5:30 (darn traffic!), but mostly just the getting up at 7. not having early classes my last semester was great, but now i need to readjust. anyways, i'm going to see spiderman 2 tonight, so that should make everything better.
