      Had a horrible Physics exam but whats done is done, cant change now. Recently A bunch of us started up a limbo radio station, and its soo coool. We got about 5 Dj's lined up and its great. I did a bit of Djing using the mic and a few songs, but once everything gets worked out it will be a lot of fun. Only 2 more exams then i am finished, should be good. HP3 should be good tonite, i am really looking forward to it, im also looking forward to see my bev again, becasue i dont know where she is lol. Mom and her went flower shopping 3 hours ago and they were suppose to be back. If anyone wants to go to the radio station go to Holletts Blog (link below) and click on his link for the mylimbo radio, and it will tell you how to get it to work.  In the next fews weeks things shall be different, but in a good way.    "Mazzy Star - Into Dust"

      Well Exams are going good so far, only did two, but my hardest one (physics) is tomorrow, i think im going to do horrible. To much stuff to know and i dont know it. Once friday is over it will be fine, even though I will have two exams left they are both pretty simple. A week from today we will be graduating, its kinda hard to believe, i have so much stuff to do in so little time, but it will all get done. Got bev's Bday gift with the aid of Lisa. we ended up getting a Betta (pet fish) and bev loved it. I hope she enjoy tomorrow.

      I got Paid! Income tax check finally came in the mail and i got $215. Im no longer poor. Its a good time to, with someones birthday comming up, grad, fathers day, all soon this money will go to good use. Hollett got me back into biking again, went 11 Km today in about 40 minutes so it works out to about 16Km/h i think which isn't to bad. Hopefully I will be able to do that a lot quicker. First exam tomorrow but I feel pretty good about it, after 6 hours of studying i think i am prepared. Should be a good week.   " The Pogues - Sunny Side of the Street"

      Well we had a monster Garage sale today in which everything was outside in my yard. A lot of it sold and we got a lot of offers for out Skidoos/Quad so it was good. I never sold much of my stuff, but I still got $40 for helping from 6AM to like 2PM. The weekend is going good. Spent a lot of time with Bev which is always fun, but she had to go babysitting tonight when we were suppose to go see Harry Potter 3 so that kinda sucks. I think i might do a bit of studying. Since I havn't started that yet, it might be a good idea   "Dropkick Murphys - Never Alone"

      Booyah! i am done! I've only got 5 exams left and then Im outta there. Got a 79% on my math test that I thought i failed so I was pretty pumped about that. Did nothing on our last day of school. Finished off my brick in school, and did a little bit of WG but nothing much. Went on a romper bike ride with H-Dawg, back to the old swimming hole and looking at the tunnell. Good Times. Gotta go help paint tonite for the grad so that shouldn't be to bad. A change for a few of us to get together and have some fun.   CCR - Proud Mary

      5 more hours of Classroom time and I am done Highschool forever. Did really shitty on a math test that I thought I did good on, but oh well, i dont really care at this point. We started painting our bricks in school today, almost got mine done, the accodion is looking good. Me and H-Dawg went to CB today and it was pretty good. Got a lot of stuff done, well not really, but it was fun hahaha. I bought Training Day so it was worth it. Damn Parents are bitching yet again at my "not so great" mark. Sometimes I wish they would just relax, its not the end of the world if I get a 64% on one test. The weekend shall be a lot of fun. Espically friday, since i will be with Bev, and those times are always fun.    "Billy Joel - Piano Man"

      Man oh man, i dont think i ever want to learn HTML, its hard enough putting a links part to this page(look below). But thanks to Holletts smarts in the HTML feild I got it done, I may learn it if I get bored. Brutal Math test today. Dont think I did good but I dont care, 2 more days and its all over. Booyah! Once exams get over I dont care. Then its off to work then off to Qatar, Woohoo. Only 67 more days till I leave. It may seem like a lot of time but its not. Way to much stuff I have to get done in that time, but it will all be done. Started the brick at school today, The accordion looked like garbage, but I think it will turn out ok once I paint it.

      Its the last week of High School ever. Well execpt for exams but that isn't really a week of school. It only seems like yesterday that we started Grade 12 and now its almost all over. Although i am not fond of it all i will miss it. Being with the same people day in and day out for the last 12 years, even though you might not talk to them much, you still build friendships. Things will change soon, for good and for bad, but they will change. Next year will be different, but it will be good i think, or at least i hope, its a big risk to go that far away, leaving the people you care and love for. But in the end i think it will be rewarding.   Hockey game tonite, go Tampa.   "Tenacious D - Dio"

      Well H-Dawg said I should sign up so I did. And here I am. Just testing it out. I dunno how faithfull i will be to this, or how serious. But i shall try my best. School is soon to finish which is good and bad. Nice to finish up, but sad at the same time becasue friendships will be lost.(and maybe relationships) But we will see how it goes. play it a day at a time. Im Gonna Steal Holletts idea about his mood with the song lyrics, but instead i will put down the name of a song and the band/singer.   "Alice in Chains - Goodbye dont follow"
