       my chocolate left today this morning around 7am since then i have been left in a daze, hurting, crying but most of all being angry...mostly at myself for not having the courage 10 and half years ago to stand up to that man and fight him for my son....His name is DeAndre..he had it hard from the start i almost lost him twice, then when he was born with a stomach defect i almost lost him when he was one month old..thats how long it took the doctors to figure what was wrong with him. So there we were me and him at one month old in the hospital waiting...waiting...finally finding out what his illness was and finding out it would take a whole year of medication to get it under control. so my baby has been fighting all his life pretty much..so i did not have the heart to put him through any more pain at two years of age, yet my ex's exact words were i dont care what it does to him I will fight you....there you have it, me backing off for fear of hurting my baby and now paying for it on a daily basis. i look into his eyes and see pain..mostly lonliness...he misses me....i miss him...he loves me i love him he needs me and i sooooo need him....I pray to the Lord help me....guide me....take care of my chocolate..I used to say when DeAndre was a baby he would look at me like i could do no wrong, I said if I ever met a man who looked at me that way I would marry him...Enter Mark....the love of my life..I can think of five other men on my love list...my father, who passed this past year...my brother, who I admire...and my three angels....DeAndre, Josh, and Devin...Mark my foundation, best friend..soul mate, my friend...my friend...yes my friend....does not judge me, but just loves me, even when i dont love myself..this is one of those times...I hate myself for so many things....i want to jump into my car and go get my baby....the law..i think&nbsp; of the law and how they would lock me up for kidnapping my son...sounds so stupid..for taking my son I would be locked up...i gave birth..i carried him....IIIIIIIIII did not him...Im so angry.....so Ill end this endless chatter that is probably not making sense anymore...cause i hurt....hurt...%$# i hurt......

       i listen for the sweet sound of my oldest son...there it is the sweet sound of his street slang"why you all up in my koolaid dont even know the flava?" not what every mom wants to hear..huh?yet as long its his sweet voice saying it i dont mind. my son lives 500 miles away from me physically and one million, congillion..trillion miles away from me in my heart. my lonely heart that breaks each time he leaves my side and dies each time he says&nbsp; goodbye. keep in mind he comes every summer and holidays but each time he leaves me he grows another year and each year i see him my mind races to what i missed... cant miss what you dont  urlLink have...bull#@*..I  miss what i want...I WANT MY BABY BACK!!!!!!!! the story is long and by all accounts should be on a Jerry Springer Show so I could knock my ex's lights out...until this past year&nbsp; i could not say the ex's name without it being followed with shit, ass, bastard....and its not that i have become a better person but i caught myself in front of my son just about to say one of those choice words when i looked into my chocolates brown eyes and realized it hurt....him....he loves him, i cant remember why or if i ever did but dammm he loves him. so i must contain my anger towards this man who i affectionately refer to as sperm donor and bear it...all the anger must be put aside and ignored in his presence. so it all started when he was two and a half...the seperation..not by choice but by necessity long story, my son is now 13 and saying mom i want to stay with you....with that i choke back the tears and look into those brown eyes and promise next year baby...next year...my son replies I'll be ready mom..next year... what to do except bear it the seperation again, swallow my pride, harden what is left of my heart and go on...as i have for the past 10 and half years loving my son and living to love him...and as he walks away seeing the two and half year old waving goodbye to me and dying inside as he fades into the horizon for another year... my sweet chocolate ...next year....next year....next year.....next year....next year....next year...yes, next year.

       I would like to take the time to thank the one who gave this idea to me, my sis in law, thank god I only have one..just kidding...but I only have one none the less. We both seem to have alot in common besides my brother. I love to laugh she loves to laugh..i love my husband she is obsessed with her husband..i love my kids she loves her kids..she loves her dogs i used to have a dog i loved. my brother one day came to me and told me of this female friend(winking eye) he met, she gave him this tape to listen to when he was going through a rough time. i listened intently...to him not the music it all sounded like nails going down a chalkboard..lol.. but nonetheless i listened as he spoke of this mysterious female...i came to realize he was in love...sad to say i dont recall ever seeing or hearing my brother this way until then. fast foward to now, it has been years, yes i say years since this mysterious female entered my life and completed my brothers and i still feel like we are in the honeymoon period of our relationship..still learning...still pondering one another...still laughing at each others quirks...my maybe we two should be married....bare with me cecekins we have a long way to go..... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love you......the jules..

       My day starts the same way almost every day but I have a few guilty little pleasures along the way. I awake tired even though my old tired body has gotten about 7 hours of sleep, I look over to the Devinmiester's crib where he is exercising to the music he no doubt hears in his sweet head, there he is on all fours rocking back and forth in sync with his little drummer boy, he hears me he turns and looks and does what most men do he acknowledges my presence with a mere chin tilt. I then look over to my husband who does not acknowledge my presence but so peacefully snores away...I leave my angels and go to bathe , I unlike my husband who showers in the night must wash the night dirt off, no my bed is clean but I have this feeling of sleep dust that I must shower away. After my shower I go to the laundry room and let the dog out, who by the way just had five puppies, one passed so now she has four, two boys and two girls..couldn't be me I can barely manage with one. I let her out to pee and crap as she comes back in to start her motherly duties allowing those puppies to suck the life out of her she passes the donor..(Salem) an appropriate name for this murderer of life ..later I'll explain she turns and tries to bite his narrow ass in passing, I then in symphony with her call him appropriatly "bastard" he turns his ugly face up and walks away, I finish it off with peebag, he still pays me no mind..so I shake my little hand at him, in the form of a fist...oh well Stop in the kitchen and fix a bottle for my Devinmiester, heat some extra milk for the dog ..allow her to gulp it down real quick so she can go back to having the life sucked out of her, she gives me this look of "help me", I say what my mom would say to me if I complained of motherhood"you should have not opened your legs if didn't want a baby" with that  thought out  I go to the room with the warm of nectar of what oddly smells like rotten milk but my baby likes it so go figure and ask the question I ask my husband every morning"do you want me to get ready in the other room?". Of course the answer is always no and so I proceed to get my war paint  to attempt to dress up my plain face. I go to wake up my other angel..Josh and remind him another day to work towards his Playstation II, he will get it regardless for his 9th birthday but I want him to work towards something...I return to the  room and realize I have 20 minutes to finish getting ready for work so I apply my war paint in a hurry, tear up the closet frantically and bitch about how fat I feel, my husband listens contently and says "I told you, you are beautiful to me" I respectfully roll my eyes and hurridly finish dressing, yell at Josh to get his shoes on and then run to the car, load up and then drop him off, at times he's lucky I stop and don't just slow down and push him out...(kidding)...I then drive by speed racer to my job I kindly call my "hell hole" along the way I call my Cecekins and let her in on all the family DRAMA, I then proceed to bitch about all the bad drivers, excluding myself of course...Then I work!!ok so I pretend...my pleasures, watching my baby work out ...hearing my husband snore....seeing another poor mom having the life sucked out of her...calling (Salem) choice names...fixing my babies first meal of the day..getting dressed every day faster than the previous day...bitching about all the bad drivers on the way to work...driving like a bat out of hell..talking to my cecekins on the way to work...talking to mark on the way to work...and Thanking God for one more day....Thank you.........................................Julia

This woman, my mother, wife to my beloved father..the great giver of life...anyway, I remember coming home one day and telling my mom or rather crying to my mother the boys at school are calling me a boy, keep in mind I am 14 at the time, this angers my mom, my hero, my beautician..yes beautician...picture this..wings plastered to my head resembling a helmet, of course kept in place with enough hairspray to finish off the hole in ozone.anyway, her reply"mija, (this is what  she called me when she was trying to comfort, I of course held other names when she angered)mija, just lift your  shirt and show them you are not a boy" what????????no!!!i did not do it, can you imagine(chuckling to myself). my mom is the queen of come backs..i come home and say  that bitch at work told me i should have turned in the paper work alot earlier. mom"you should have said why so your damn job would be easier?"..I say at the store a car parked too close to me..she says you should have left them a note with "next time leave me a can opener asshole to open my door next time"..My mom, my hero, my wonderful comebacker...the one I can always count on to talk shit when I can't, ok, I can but when I feel like having someone else do it...the funny thing about my mom is she will say"I dont know where you girls get  your damn mouth  from dammit, but it sure is hell wasnt from me"..gotta love her dammit...gotta, so mom have fun you fun loving gal and say a few choice words for me,,,shit.....

       This is in reply to my sis in laws take on Red Devil...how dare ye be jealous of the mighty red devil...I too like my brother have developed quite the fondness for the sauce of the forbiden pleasure...my dad started this whole obsession one day for me when he took  boiled eggs and potatoes and gingerly cut them into slices and then lovinly poured the sweet nectar of chilis all over them....he then delicately picked up each slice with all the love in his hands and savored the taste of the tasty morcel he had made , I sat in the back ground, hovering in the darkness like a criminal..a criminal I say..ready to steal a piece once this man turned his back, all I needed I would tell myself is one second...one second...tick...ok maybe two seconds....there he put his plate on the counter..I move in like a shadow of darkness to covet the plate of  love   urlLink  food...#@%   &, there is no more.. that man, my mom's husband, father to her children, son to my grandparents...brother to his siblings ATE IT ALL!!! Well now, now what ? I am left to suffer ..but wait the juice is on the plate...ahhhh, the juice I pick up the plate, let out a laugh, you know the one, the evil laugh, like the citibank commercials and then I do it...I put it to my lips and allow the juice to slide into my mouth...first my  tongue burns ...a sweet burn, then my  throat burns...the kind of burn that you feel when you consume some guilty pleasure...ahhhh, there it goes and then its over..its gone..so I put the  plate down and stare at it as if by some miracle some more may appear but alas it does not...Life moves on and I start to walk out of the kitchen...and then it happens, it calls to me one last time so I look back and a tear wells up as I stare at IT..the RED DEVIL..and I hear it...until next time Julia, until next time...now  some twenty six years later I still hunger for it..the love of the devil..THE ALMIGHTY RED DEVIL...so woman take your place where you should and accept it..for the love does not die...NOT I SAY!!!!

        Today was interesting to say the least, how do we have debates that do not make sense? let me rephrase that don't make sense to women.Picture this two men and two women in  one room and the men make their opinions known to the women. subject women who are too big for them...one man 6"1 about 240 and the other 5"9 pushing 240...now they tell us  they won't date women who are bigger than them..what the fuck!! there I am staring and wondering what is bigger than them so I ask ...they clarify women who are bigger than them or rather wider...wider???confused to say the least I have many a times walked behind both these men and had to look at the junk in their trunk as the saying  goes..but with these men it looks like tires..flat tires in the cadillac size trunk...now this is where it gets even freakier....one man, the shorter of the two tells me he  will not date a women who has children..perplexed look on my face....his justification...all women who have children seem to have large asses..yes he said asses...ass is what  I am thinking at this point...then I get mad I have three beautiful boys how dare this pig make me wonder if my ass is large because of my angels...who by the way will one day be men...oh lordee...one day will they have the same mentality of this 240 pound pig that barely fits in the chair next to me ???Please noooooooo....   I can not and will not leave the subject alone so I start  the war of words..oh painful words how they roll of my now forked tongue of hellish thoughts...I continue to probe this man's tiny organ he calls a brain ...oh all the while the other man is agreeing with the first moron...his reasoning... I dont want a woman who has children from a previous relationship he calls them luggage...Shoot now and take no prisoners...I sing the song from "Martina Mcbride" "This ones for the girls" I raise my sword and swing hoping to chop someones penis off and its not mine....what the hell makes you think a woman would want you around their children, what kind of positive role model could you two be..look kids this is how you let yourself go...not having a waist line but instead a donelap belt..(stomach done lapped over)..this is how you deny you are going  bald and do a bad imitation of the Great Donalds do....the reason you say stupid ass things like that is because you cant get woman who have children...they (women with kids)already have one dumb ass in their lives..their exes they dont need another one....oooops did I say that outloud???shit i guess I did...   Women of the world with kids..dont pay attention to the dumbasses that are looming out there...they are single for a reason..no man is worth putting your angels to the side one day the one will come along who loves for the sake of loving and living..and for the record I love my ass!!!and as for everything else you can buy a man in a box for 59.99 at Dolar Video and best part is it does not talk back or get fat and when you want it to shut up you turn it off....enough said.....                                                                                                                                   Julia

       This piece is dedicated to my sweet canadian, my man is turning 35 on Monday August 9, oh where to start... My sweet husband and I  met on the internet..and well we did not hit it off exactly he was going through a breakup of a ten year marriage and I was coming out of an engagement...His marriage had hit the rocks five years earlier and I had just figured out the man I thought I should marry was not the man I should have been with at all...any way we started conversing on the net and a while later we started talking on the  phone...He e-mailed me a picture of himself and there were the prettiest pair of blue eyes I had ever seen...Red hair, blue eyes and so much sensitivity....He then became my best friend and before too long he was the first voice in the morning and the last voice at night....He divorced and we talked about our future, a future I really did not think would ever happen, you hear all the stories of the internet, someone always turns out to be not what they said they were and your'e left with mixed feelings and alot of confusion...he told me he would be here in March and I thought yeah right...but I'll be damned he came down and three and a half years later he still takes my breath away ..I left alot out but trust me it's all good...He is my best friend..my foundation..my heart and my soul live for him...He has listened to my fears and laughed at my jokes..not all are funny ..hard to believe...he has taught me love is not supposed to hurt and I am allowed to love  without fear of everything falling apart...he held me when me dad died and understood how I felt without me telling him...he finishes my thoughts and loves me dispite of myself...he gave up his life in Canada and took on mine here in Texas..he understood when I cried and told him I could not leave my mom alone because I need to make sure she is ok...he has done all this and not asked anything in return except that I be honest...So honestly Mark James Iliffe I love and adore and cherish, thank you for all you have done for me and my kids thank you for giving me your son and thank you for loving me..I finally know what love is and I finally know what it is to love someone other than my kids unconditionally and without judgement...Te Amo Mis Ojos....                                           I only ask one more thing from the Lord may he take me before you, I would not be able to live without you, and as always may your voice be the last one I hear as I leave this earth.....

       This piece is directed to any poor beer drinker who has had to hear that saying "how can you drink that, it tastes like pee".Ok, so where to begin...I like beer, take that back I love beer, my favorite saying is after a long hard day at the office.."I'm going to stop by the store and pick up six of my closest friends...I know could it get any cheesier? Well probably not, but oh well.. Anyway, back to I LOVE BEER!!!!!!Don't get me wrong I don't live on skid row because of this love but I will admit if I did not have to work, and did not have a wonderful family and did not have to pay bills and could afford to be unemployed I might consider that address... Just the other day a lady at work askes"how can you drink that, it tastes like pee?". My heart stops for a second I feel my blood or rather I think I actually hear my blood pumping through my veins and before I know it, there it is, the remark****How do you know what pee tastes like? Have you ever had any? The room gets quiet and everyone waits..tick...tick...tick...tick...and so on and so on and so on..... Well(pause)no, (pause) ....sigh...this person has made me , well upset..and then I think about it..made me mad for what reason? Is it because she does not understand me?or because she said it tastes like pee? no, sigh, I think it's because ...well ..hell...I don't know why... So I leave the office not happy with the ending to my near battle to protect my hobby..drinking beer, but nonetheless satisfied that somewhere in the world a fellow drinker is picking up six of their closest friends and enjoying the urine of sweet hopps and barley..so until then my fellow weekend drinkers...drink on...drink on...for  come this weekend I too will make the trip to the coveted urinal which carries the name BUD LITE...

       I was thinking of what my wonderful sis in law wrote in her blog of the conversation of this wonderful procedure that has somehow managed to find its way to a billboard near my house..as I drive past that sign everyday my imagination developes a mental picture from the words "VAGINAL REJUVINATION" I imagine somewhere in the world is a vagina that has just had that procedure done and it when exposed to the world has rays of light luminating from it..and the sounds of horns can be heard as this great organ is exposed.. Now, what I ask could they possibly do to a womans organ to rejuvinate? give it new life?a new face? a new liplift?yes I said liplift...HHHmMMMM... So I find many people have a theory of this glorious procedure...my husband says"they tighten it" tighten it? sounds odd I think...My co-worker says they clean it, clean it?another co-worker says, they buff it, buff it? So I am now left to ponder what the ___do they do to that simple organ that just sits there for the most part and minds its own business..my sis in law and myself listened as our wonderful husbands gave their theories.. None of which make any sense to me...I think YIKES...that area is so sensitive I cringe at the thought of any one doing any of those things to it...so there I am, curious , but afraid to find out what really happens to that simple organ..that does many a glorious things...the best is that it is the entrance way for children..so the thought of it needing rejuvination sounds odd to me...perhaps a vacation after all that hard work.. I think I'll leave that procedure to the women who need it...mine well it may not have rays of light shining from it and it may not look like it just came out of the factory but it is happy...and most important its safe ...  So as I drive past the sign the music fades and the lights fade away and we drive home(unrejuvinated) but safe.

       well today started as normal as i guess any day can start if you call the baby throwing up on you, some dumb female driver cutting you off and realizing you have more work than time on your hands...oh well...interesting thought i had today or rather a few interesting thoughts. let's start those boobs..yeah you read right boobs meaning breasts...there i said it...i sat and thought how over rated those %$#things are..when i think about it they are almost like children...they want to be dressed up in nice clothes, ei. lacy bras...overpriced lacy bras that is..they need to be held and loved like kids...they need air and water and cream and food to keep them in tip top condition...that is if you do not want them to look old before their time...and then in the long run they let you down or rather they let themselves down...they  give in to gravity and they realize they are getting older and they decide they do not have to hang around they decide to hang down....way down....you see how things work??hmmmm , leaving me being grateful i am not that well endowed dont get me wrong i am not the president of the itty bitty titty commitee but i am not hung like well you get the picture...peter piper has a billboard up a purple dinasour holding up a slice of pizza with a pepperoni on the end of on the side of the road i imagine that is what my boobs as i affectionately call them will look like when it comes their time to hang around or rather down. so ladies of the world whether you have small, medium or large take care of them for you will one day find they like children have their good, wonderful and sad to say lazy days. it all comes down to the same thing one day you will wake up and find that the children (booobs)have decided they just want to hang around or down what ever the case may be..and you of course will be left holding the bill or bra.....until next time...
