Brad seemed to be the only one that cared.. thanx Bradford.Ty got stabbed by Ethan and his dam knife Ty's hand was covered by blood  horror movie style   after that we went to get milk and eggs milke for my mom and eggs to throw at stuff so we drove to OOB and when we got there i switched from McGinn's car to Tyler's cuz Brad was driving Matt's car and didn't have his liscence but when i got in Tyler's car Ethan was gonna drive his truck which was okay tho cuz i've been in the car when Ethan was driving and hes a good driver so we decided to go play pool at vacationland but they closed 15 min after we got there so we went to cinemagic to see is Hondell was still there but they got kicked out of there too so we went to Wendys and i was in Ty's car by now Deechi had to get water to take his pill so we all drove thru the drive-thru and got free water lol then when we were leaveing to go hang out at my house Bubbs threw the cup ,that the random guy gave to me for pukin, at Ty's car and&nbsp;Ty got pissed and it was rainging and&nbsp;he was speedign and&nbsp;we almost hydroplaned. i held onto Brads arm for dear life...so we got back to my house and just hung out Sam and i were on my couch talking about grandparents , i dunno why, and i started to cry about my Grandfather whose about to die.. for some reason I feel like i can tell Sam everything and I love him for that i mean i tell everyone everything cuz im a blabber mouth as Ethan would say , which i guess i can't deny but&nbsp;anyways we made smores on my stove and everyone left by 11 30    wednesday i went to work 7-12 and it was Lindsey's Birthday and it was a very fun day at work then after work i came home and Sam Tyler and Demetri came over Sam had a wheelchair it was funny he took me for a ride and i screamed 3/4 of the time . then we went up to my rom and everyone was just hanging out and then i fell asleep at 3 and when i woke up it was 7 30 and theywere gone But Tyler stayed and then BUbbs and him left to go play tag i was gonna go but since i just woke up i didn't feel liekr unning and then Justin called and was like lets do something and i was liek what and he was like comeover we'll watch a movie.. so i did we watched the best of Will Ferrrell lol and i laughed and he laughed at me lol... then 10 30 came around and my mom and daddy picked me up&nbsp; kinda early but i was soo tired we went to rapid rays and saw Lindsey and Jessica and Marissa all the girls i work with they were going out for Lindseys birthday&nbsp; so i said hey and then i went home and read a little and went to bed  today thursday i woke up at 6 even tho i have work at 5 tonight and went to breakfast with my parents and their friends&nbsp; it was&nbsp;good lol i saw Heather she was working and she said she'd call me later to do sumthin   I SEE SUN IM GONNA GO TAN finally i need color  but any ways work 5-930 tonight not that i was gonna have plans anyways .. i wanted to hang out with Sam and stuff but i guess he has plans..      l  a  t  e  r      haha i thought this was gonna be a short one hahah speaking of short one

      RZEn 213: well.....ahem....today......i saw erikas life flash before my eyes, and i think samand jake and stewart did too, *bubbs wasnt looking*, neways, whoever it was (erika cough*) had the bright idea of going on the rope swing at salmon falls aka the coolest place in maine, neways, she grabbed onto the rope, and said i feel like having a near death experience today, so she swung from the depths of the little woods area we were in like jane ( you know, the one from tarzan) except she let go a little too early (and we all know jane is nasty on the rope swings), erika went plunging down to the jagged rocks, asking for pain, but instead, uhhh, well she kinda curved over the big ass rock , then which i dont know who this happened, she didnt even hit a single rock in the water, pretty weird, so i was like, oh F(word),&nbsp; that is not good, but erika arised from the water laughing, while we almost all shit ourselves, and that was it,the end   thank you Ryan Zenahlik,&nbsp;best portrayal of my day anyone has ever done for me   &nbsp; i wrote this whole big thing earlier and maybe at a later time i will re-write it but not now   &nbsp; i almost died today... kinda weird thought   nite kids
