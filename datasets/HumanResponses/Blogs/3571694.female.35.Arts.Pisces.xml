      My mosquito net fell down on my head for the second time in 24 hours.  I also have a humidity headache and Oscar and I haven't felt dry in almost 36 hours.  Apparently there will be more of this to look forward to for another 2 months.  Needless to say I cant sleep.    Beside my 2 lessons today, I have to reinstal my computer which has an Asian flu!  Apparently North Korea has a special unit to attack south Korean computers, and much like my own immune system, my anti virus doesn't seem equipped for the Asian viruses.  I have deicided to go back to Mac.  None of this would be happening if I had a Mac!  On a brighter note, kick monkey continues to kick butt in TaeKwon do.  I am no expert by any means, but I am doing better than I expected, and the constant sore feeling in my body is not entirely unwelcomed.  I am going to try YOGA on Monday morning.  Well,  I am going to try to get more shut eye.  I don't have to teach for another 3.5 hours.  K

      Well, I don't hate Seoul any more. As a matter of fact I think if I had to spend another year in Korea, Seoul would be a good place to spend it. We spent most of our time in Etaiwan, which is a district (Dong in Korean) that is supported mainly by the US military presence, where you will find "hooker hill" and a Mosque within a few feet of each other, and a place where you can buy middle eastern groceries YAY!!!   We got in Saturday evening, and the first order of business was finding a place to sleep. We checked out a place that seemed clean enough, but was very much like the Iranian caravanserais, and the room didn't even have a window. I "X"ed that place though it was only 30,000 won. We went to another place called the Seoul In (Original name eh?) and the rooms were much better- still no window, but a full on A/C and it was only 45. SO I said "Let's take it", and we did, dumped our things, and went out to discover.   Among some of the incongruous things I saw in Etaiwan, were a couple of Ecuadorians selling handicrafts on the sidewalk, a lot of non Koreans and really up to date fashions. The Korean population was definitely outnumbered by the foreigners, and it was not only surprising, but a bit refreshing. No one stared at us, we just blended in!   We went to "Spy", a very chic little club for a pre-dinner cocktail, and enjoyed a rum and coke in the "Red Rum- oops Room" covered with velvet walls, and snazzy decor- very "Wallpaper". I know now not to go for the 151 proof Rum on an empty stomach!!!  We considered many dinner options, Thai, Indian, and a real N.Am. style pub, but settled on a French restaurant which served us the best meal I have ever enjoyed in my entire life! As Chris likes to say "There were real live French there so you know it was a good establishment". Yes, no dead French in sight, and the food- oh the food! I had a beef tenderloin with Béarnaise sauce, and Chris had a cream soup with Saffron and seafood Paella. Yum yum YUUUUUUUMMMMMM! No room for desert! though I am certain it would have been heavenly.   We then hit the Salsa club. I was so pumped I could barely stand it. I had a bad feeling though as we went up the steps, I couldn't hear any music! We walked into an absolutely empty club, and to my horror they were playing Bachatta! We asked the bartender when the place got going, and we were told that the "US army boys" were given a curfew of 9pm, so there would be no action tonight. Nothing- NADA! Deeply disappointed, we went on to find another club, when we both realized our evening had been perfect already, so why ruin it by carting ourselves half way around Seoul to get more exhausted, and not find a good Latin club? Plus, every step was more difficult due to the heat, and humidity, and more painful, due to my red heels, PLUS we had an air conditioned room awaiting us. So like a couple of old coots, we called it a night and went back to our hotel.

      I was told blogging’s addictive but I didn't believe it till now.  I brought my computer to work today because one of my kids was wearing a Bob Marley shirt yesterday and didn't even know who he was, so I brought it in to play some Bob for them.  Why wear the shirt if you don't know who is on it?  But then that’s kids for you! (Again- I sound OLD!)  There is such great light in my classroom at this time of day.  It is a quarter to five and it is brilliantly sunny outside.  I just went out to get some kim-bab (the Korean version of California rolls, but a little bland unfortunately) and it is so perfect outside, its almost a sin to be in here.  But since I am here I might as well write a blog.  I have a spare right now.  I ride my scooter to work every day.  There are many women who ride scooters here, and I can tell they are women because they don't wear helmets here very often. But still it is an unusual thing to see, and a female foreigner on a scooter, in a skirt must be really unusual, because I get very surprised looks.  A few weeks ago I was riding down my street and two boys on a bicycle were riding up, and the kid sitting on the handlebars was SO shocked that his jaw dropped and his eyes popped out.  I half expected him to tip the bike because he was trying to tell his friend what he was missing.  It was so funny that I started chuckling.    There is a lot here that makes me chuckle.  In a lot of way Koreans are so much like Iranians.  They have been so insulated, and they are so homogenous, that there is little “political correctness”.  I have to say, most of what irritates me comes from the fact that I have lived in a very uptight PC city most of my life, where people can say things like “What are YOU looking at?” and that usually means “F-off and stop staring“.  Here there is no secret made of the “spectator sport” and if you ask such a dumb question, you will get the obvious response: “You- what else?” That is of course if you speak the language.  I like staring at them too.  Believe it or now they DON’T all look the same and I have found Koreans to be profoundly beautiful.  I prefer the dark skinned ones though they are big on the China-doll look and use everything from powders to laser surgery to obtain that look.  I have two girls in my classes who are very delicate, with fine features and beautiful lines.  I will photograph them all before leaving.  I guess that means I better start soon.  The other thing I would like is to have a web-cam and show you what this class looks like, but then the parents have to give consent and it gets complicated.  Two very popular surgeries in Korea are having your eyes enlarged by cutting a section of your eyelid out, and lypo suction because they like to be very very slim.   So as a result, these operations are relatively cheap here. It is about 800 dollars US to get lypo done here, and I know of one foreigner who has had that done here, and was very happy with it.  So for those of you looking for an excuse to make your way out here, think of how much you can save on plastic surgery :)  I am home now, and spent a small fortune on beef for dinner tomorrow.  What the hell, its payday, and I want to make a decent curry.  So, I will wrap this up by making an observation.  A week can make a hell of a lot of difference.  I am in such a different head-space now than a week ago!  I am much better, livlier and really looking forward to seeing Seoul.  I will keep you posted.  K

      Pain, such sweet pain.  Who ever said "no pain no gain" was BS?  I know exactly what muscles I have used.    My deal is I am not having any babies till I am in good shape.  There are too many things to worry about so I will at least start on the right foot.  Fortunately I don't think I am that far from being in good shape (don't laugh too loud now)- though I am a little farther in the baby department.  And who knows what work they will put me up to in Nepal, so I better be in decent shape.  But oh sweet pain.  I went to the Yoga class this morning, only to find out the instructors wife doesnt know Tuesday from Wednseday.  So I will try again next week.    Also I have no water.  I cant shower and with the heat as it is, this will be a bad situation.  They are cleaning the tanks in the building and the water will be off from 7 to 7 tonight.  Of course the signs in the building are all in Korean, but my friend who lives in the building next to mine always calls me and tells me these things.  When I first arrived, they cut off my cold water because the girl before me hadnt paid the maintenance bill.  I had to shower using scalding hot water.  If anyone thinks cold showers are bad, try a boiling one.  Still, I would take that over no shower today.  Good thing you are so far away.  More later...

      Well I am going to have to type slowly, since I injured myself in my first TaeKwondo class.  I was supposed to fall face forward to the floor, landing on my hands and touch my forehead to my hands and I bent my wrist the wrong way.  Plus this is an old mountain biking injury and it doesn't help that it is humid as a wet cat out there.  I sound SO old!  Here is how it went.  I got the gear- the white baggy pants, the white shirt and the white belt even.   I got dressed, and came into class.  The class in underground underneath my grocery store- God I wish I had seen it the first week I was here. Anyhoooo, the "master" (a very nice, lean, tall man with glasses that don't fly off his face no matter how many times he twirls) started saying something about me.  I was standing next to him at this point.  I understood Canada, TaeKwondo when I was young (since I told him I did a few classes) and some other things I didn't get.  It is very strange being spoken about in front of a bunch of strangers.  It is even stranger when you have NO CLUE what is being said.  For all I knew he was saying "yeah, this foreigner here thinks she can keep up with us but we will likely never see her after this class".  Regardless, he turned to me, put on my white belt, tied it tight and everyone applauded.  We began with stretching exercises which is where I earned my gold stars.  Gymnastics was my thing when I was younger and I am still incredibly flexible, so while the green and brown belts couldn't straighten their legs while holding the bottom of their feet, I did it without batting an eye.  I can kick very high too and I was impressing the pants off them.  Fortunately there are 3 other girls in the class and 6 kids, who thought I was really cool, and asked me after class to go have ice cream with them (which I declined). I have modifiedmy nickname (christened by Chris- from fighter monkey, to kick monkey)  Well, I will write more details about the actual exercises later on.  My wrist hurts and I am feeling sleepy.  I am also getting progressively more sore...  THIS ought to be fun!  NEWSFLASH!!! My intercom just rang as I was typing and my doorman said "Motorcycle, vroom vroom" and I went down there to move it, thinking it was in the way of someone.  Well I got there and he was all flustered and I knew something bad was up.  I went out and NO scooter!!  He was blabbering on in Korean and I got it that someone was trying to steal it.  I saw it about 500 meter down the walkway.  The other security guard who never says two words to me spoke in clear English that two men had picked it up and were on their way with it when he saw them.  They dropped it and ran.  How lucky am I?  You can bet I locked it now.  And I keep getting told that there is no crime in Korea.  Well I guess its starting.  To think I almost lost scooty :(

      I have been meaning to write about this in several emails but now I will write it here.  There are very few Koreans who own pets, or even like them.  As some of you know they actually breed a kind of dog for food, yet they also have another breed of dog that is considered very intelligent and not for eating.  In October a man was fined and later imprisoned because he ate his neighbors "smart dog", and his neighbor asked him to compensate him.  When he couldn't, he was jailed. Now I am getting off topic.  I live in a 15 story building, and I am on the 10th floor.  I have to take the elevator to take Oscar for a walk 5 times a day.  I always dread having other people in the elevator, because if they are not trying to play with Oscar (which is fine) they fear him.  Oscar is a Shi-tsu and about the size of a fat cat.  I have had varying reactions from kids gluing themselves to the wall of the elevator, to a woman and her child actually squealing and leaving the elevator yesterday (I had to laugh out loud just to show her how ridiculous I thought she was being).  My dog was on a leash, by my feet, minding his own business, but there you have it!  People will even cross the street to avoid him- at least I think its him they are trying to get away from....maybe it's me?!?!?!  So as I see it, this culture is full of contradictions, as is any culture really.  I picked up Oscar from the street too.  He was somebody's pet at some point, but Koreans generally like tiny dogs that they can carry in bags. They also like puppies, so when they get too big, they sometimes just put them out on the street.  I do believe Oscar was one of those dogs.  He had no leash, but he was very well trained.  He is my favorite Korean.

      Well, after a week of hell at my school and feeling rather down in the dumps, I sent a "cry for help" email to all my friends and family to see who'd say what?  And by far the best response came from Teresa, who reminded me of  Yoga philosophy that boils down to "enjoy the here and now". I sat back thinking about my hippie friend and her cool outlook on life and realized that Korea was the same it ever was (as I had known it anyway) but it was MY outlook that has changed.  I still loved my kids, and they were still the same kids, so I turned myself around, and I am having a much better week.  Thanks babe!  We are heading to Seoul this weekend.  I will continue my quest for a nose piercing.  I have 19 weeks left to go folks, and I really dont know where I am going next. Yippie!    I know I am going to Nepal for my volunteer humanitarian gig for two or three months, but after that, it depends where Chris ends up I think.  Well, this is rather short for a first posting but there you have it.  Feel free to respond.  K

      Chris is coming home Friday.&nbsp; YAY!!!! &nbsp; The last&nbsp;couple of weeks&nbsp;have been less than pleasant.&nbsp; I didnt have my usual weekend&nbsp;visit from Chris to look forward to, the weather was&nbsp;(and still is)&nbsp;unbelievably hot and clammy, and it seems the neighbors conspired to make my life hell!&nbsp; Not a day went by where someone didnt get in my face about Oscar and why do&nbsp; I keep a dog in the apartment etc.&nbsp; All in Korean and all in the most aggressive tone.&nbsp; One of two doormen is still a sourpuss, and really I can think of a few more colourful adjectives for him, but I am too polite. &nbsp; Today, however Oscar and I had three great walks without any interruptions (knock on wood).&nbsp; Maybe the heat was making everyone irritable.&nbsp; It was me! &nbsp; I havent even been able to go to Yoga and TaeKwon-do because the gym is not air-conditioned and the last time I was there, it didnt smell so great in there and I got seriously light-headed.&nbsp; I need to go back to the pool. &nbsp; So with all the stress, I needed to put a fresh perspective on life, and that involved getting completely destroyed on Friday night.&nbsp; The foreign bar "Soul Train" was celebrating its one year anniversary and for 20 dollars it was open bar.&nbsp; I am told I had 6 Long Island Iced teas and a Baileys.&nbsp; I only remember counting 4, but then, I also remember losing my cookies three times  :(&nbsp; Havent done that since that since I lived on Gloucester! &nbsp; Now I feel more like myself!&nbsp; This week has actually been pretty good. &nbsp; As Allison put it, all I need now is some snow and things will be perfect.&nbsp; I never thought I would wish for snow.&nbsp; What's next?

      Every few months, my doorman (actually there are 2 on 24 hour shifts) changes.  As soon as they get to know me and I establish a rapport with them, and they save my scooter from being stolen, they are gone.    The two new ones are not so friendly, and though one seems to be warming up to Oscar and me, the other is downright sour and I am pretty sure has it in for me. As Oscar and I came in from our mid-day walk, he was sitting waiting for me by the mailboxes at the front door.  He sprang to his feet and ran ahead of me to the elevator.  I wasnt sure if he was trying to take the elevator, and leave me behind (wouldnt be surprising) or get the elevator door for me.  He stopped in front of the elevators and pointed to a notice on the bulletin board as if it was something I should know.  Now keep in mind that everything that goes up on there is in Korean, and uncerstandably so, but I usually do check it b/c they put a notice about water shut offs etc, and I can generally tell from the dates what to expect.  This didnt have a date on it but from his zeal, I could tell it pertained to me, and he had a smug gratified look on his face at "showing me".  Well, I looked at him and uttered my three most useful words: "Hnagul mal moolayo" "Korean I dont know" (verbs always go at the end of the sentence- try re-programming kids when teaching English grammar), and got in the elevator.  Now I knew this was a note to be addressed so I asked my boss to call the office and ask if this was something I should know.  They didnt know what note it was and gave her the number to call the security guard directly. Well, I knew it was "about me" because there were 2 things addressed on there and both were "things I am guily of"!  ONE: If you are to have a dog in the apartment, all your neighbors have to agree to your having a dog in your unit. TWO: The hallway is not for garbage.  Do not leave your garbage bags in the hallway.  Now I admit, I have been guilty of neglect in the garbage department, but I wasnt the one who went away for the weekend with an open bag of compost at my door for five days.  Our balconies are open on one side and I could still smell the compost when I got off the elevator.  But no that was a month ago, and THEY didnt get a notice!  And so my boss laughed.  She said that they owned this unit and there was nothing the management could do.  I said: let them try!  I was only here for another four months anyway!  Like I needed another reason to want to move on.  Up up and away..............  Well, when I got home, guess what was no longer by the elevator?  That's right my friends- the notice!  Which leads me to believe the doorman did it himself, and when the office got wind of it, off it came!  WHATEVER!  Tonight Oscar and I proudly pranced in front of that doorman on the way back from our walk.  I find ignoring him gets him steamed, so I didnt even look his way- oh was there someone there??Sorry didnt see him!

      I am sleepy and my head feels hollow.    And it is only 8:30pm.  Why you ask?  Well my superintendant has knocked on my door at 7:20 am for 2 days in a row.  Apparently they have no record of me paying my maintenance bill and so they wanted to have me sign a waver that if I didnt pay it in three days, they would cut off my cold water.  Well, I have paid it and I showed the super yesterday, but they change shifts every 24 hours so the one today didnt know-AND the one yesterday had me sign one for apartment 1108 while I live in 1009.  I think he was so flabergasted at seeing me at the door that he grabbed the wrong one.  To give them a break, it is about 100 degrees here in the shade and so humid, you can drink the air, so I guess we are all at the end of our thether.  On a nicer note, I got a phone call from Chris from Thailand today.  That BUM! Off on a beautiful beach drinking Pina Coladas and smoking big fat reefers!  I am SO jealous.  He did say he is going to take me there in November though.  THANK GOD he didnt get the job at Chunnum Univ., and we can get the hell outa here onto greener pastures.  He has a scheme and is working something out for us to go there for a while.  I cannot wait!  Honestly!  I am very excited about the prospect.  Very excited about leaving Korea.  As my friend Allison said: "This place is just not working for you.  Stop beating yourself up over it".  Yes I have been feeling rather guilty at the hate-on I have for this place presently, but in all fairness, it has a lot to do with being uncomfortable and hot and sticky all the time too.  I have VERY low tolerance for heat.  I rather be cold ANY DAY! So most of the time I walk around with a scoul on my face and I saw a couple of my students today in that state and felt very bad, so I started smiling and my mood improved! GO FIGURE!  So, I better ween myself off the Kimchi cause there wont be any where I am going. YIPPPPIEEEEE!!!!  OK, folks, off to ride scooty home, and walk my scraggly dog.  Poor thing is covered in heat rash, which is slowly going away. Kat

      I am currently ina much dishevelled apartment with two Korean workmen installing my air conditioner.  OH THANK GOD!  Though honestly, a month ago would have been so much better.  Alas here it is and Chris and I will not have to resort to booking ourselves into a "love Motel" just for the cool air.  Out of the blue, my boss informed me that they were coming to install this thing and I was speechless.  He himself was here until a few moments ago and was "supervising".  I showed him some of my prints and was reminded of my past life as a photographer.  I told him I had to have a show soon to remind myself I was a photographer, so he asked me for a profile which I will start working on after I blog here, and he will try to get me something soon.  He also knows a professional photographer who has a darkroom and will ask if I can print there, so the B&W I have done of Ecuador and Korea will slowly get printed.  Thank God I brought my negs.  My friends Lori and Jason just had a baby girl.  I got a photo and I must say this baby is the most beautiful thing I have seen in a long time.  I want one of my own and I do think both Chris and I have good genes, so we will make beautiful kids, and hopefully they will be intelligent and dilligent like him and sharp and adorable like me (hey someones got to stroke my ego).  I await the day, though it seems getting divorced might be a bit of a pain since neither of us are in the country.  DAMN! Six months or so.  OK, gotta go make some lunch.  I am starving.  When it is hot like this I dont want to clean, cook, or do much but watch tv.  All that will change now with AIR CON!

      Well, I am in the second week of "Summer vacations" which means the kids dont go to school and we work harder. Both my private students have asked for extra lessons and all during the week, so I am teaching each and every morning.  This morning, at 9:15 I was sitting in the study of one of my students when the PA system came on INSIDE the apartment. I thought it was a warning for everyone to vacate the building, so I asked what it was saying. My students who otherwise seemed uneffected by this loud speaker announcing Korean into their home, stopped and listened and then said: "There is a trip someplace and they are telling us in case we want to go".  It might not seem like much, but it seemed really intrusive to me to have this thing blaring out useless information into an apartment and especailly at 9:15 during summer vacations. Quite frankly I would have been quite peeved if I was trying to sleep- which I would have been doing if I werent teaching.  On a brighter note, the weather is not quite so oppressive today and Oscar managed to walk all the way to the dog groomers where he is at now. I pick him up at 2.  Off to have my second shower of the day and it is only noon.
