      Werd... I'm drunk... Still, from last night... I'm getting ready to go to my cousins wedding today. (uh oh, more drinking!)  Yep, I went to Euphoria again last night, haven't been for a couple of weeks so I had many penny's spare! lol... And for some reason the bartenders know me too well or they have recently become telepathic because each time I went to the bar they had a shot of  urlLink Bacardi  waiting for me!!  But I've got to stop drinking that much when I go out seriously... It's not good. I'm no alcoholic let me stress but these thursday nights do tend to get a teeny bit "bingy"!  Big up to the "Snells", "PB" and "Chobes"... 'Twas a splendid evening chaps! Oh and the new "Fairplay" T-Shirt will be on the  urlLink store  as from next week!

      Hey folks!  Today has little sad tone about it as a group of friends of mine keep bickering and putting each other down lately so I've taken the  urlLink "executive decision"  to give them all a wide birth... Which is annoying to have to do but I feel it's needed.  Oh well moving on! I've been left with more money than I expected in the old bank account so I'm off to my favourite nightclub this week!  What's that lodbert? You have a social life?  Darn tootin' I do! And I'm gonna go crazy with this week an' all!  Must get back to work now as I have three Shmoawerpowerpoint presentations to make...

      Hey people!  Today was college, I think my  urlLink website  is pleasing my tutors... Which is nice... I bought  urlLink Battle Royale  on DVD today, I'm watching it now in fact... I know, you're thinking... "What? You've never seen it before!?!" Well no I haven't, wel now I have... ANYWAY!  I also bought  urlLink Yojimbo ... A samurai film made back in 1961 by Akira Kurosawa, About a samurai who wanders into a village where two clans are having a turf war, he decides to stay and "help things along"... After watching it, I realise that 70% of the storyline for this film was put straight into the PS2 game,  urlLink Way Of The Samurai  by Capcom. I love the film, I love that game and I can't wait til the second WOTS game comes out...  The first scene of Yojimbo shows the samurai, at a fork in the road, he pauses for thought, he throws a stick in the air and when it lands he goes off in the direction it's pointing... I love it!!! lol... It's a perfect example of a Ronin's way of life...

      Now I'm not one for checking my horoscope everyday in the paper, or once a month even... But I do like reading the chinese zodiac descriptions for peoples character. Now this page behind the link has LOADS of info about my sign...  urlLink The Rooster  Now some of this stuff is not accurate as you have to take into consideration that I am Piscean aswell as a rooster SO... When you get to the page hit the "END" button on your keyboard first and read the section there. Then go back to the top and scroll down til you get to "the metal rooster" and that, combined with the piscean bit is me... Apparently.

       This is actually an old post... From my old blog site... Which is hiding away on my server still...   May 7, 2004 4:17 PM The greatest van slogan ever... Volume none.  Well today I woke up very late... So it was manic getting ready for work... I could only spend 10minutes on the net lol! Anyway so there i am on the train rummaging around in my bag and I realised... I'd forgotten my blummin' camera!! DOH! I needed it cos we were taking pics of run down communtiy centres that need rebuilding, yes very riveting stuff let me tell you... So there you are, on the train hurtling in the opposite direction from the one and only thing you really need to take into work there's way back without being over an hour late for work. Who ya gonna call?! MOMMY. Yep like an injured young fawn I grabbed my mobile phone... Cos you see 'em do that dont you? You can just picture it cant you, a close relative of Bambi, with his leg caught in a snare or something, reaching round with a free hoof grabbing his moto and...  "Mom? Yeah hi, um I'm in a bit of a spot...pause...Yeah well I was looking where I was bounding but those buggers keep covering these things up with foliage! Now please get dad down and get me out of this thing before I find my head hanging in a game hunters living room!"  So anyway, mum came to my rescue as she often does and I snapped happily away and finished work early! - Okay now rewind a bit... back to my lunch break to be exact... I was shopping in Tesco and I got my food and went back to work... But before I got in I saw this dusty old van with some writing in it... I know you think you know whats coming but you dont! No I just thought I'd mention it cos it's the first time I've seen... "I wish my wife was as dirty as this!" written on the door of a transit van...

      Okay okay, so I'm a feeble blogger... So fong me!  I've been finishing off my college work and running round with headless chickens under my arms trying not to panic... It's over now and I know that at least for my Final Major Project I got a Merit, YAY!!  Right now my friend Chobes and I are designing an online Mag or whatever you might call it which will serve as an online portfolio an blogesque rant site.  It'll be hosted at www.riskymag.co.uk so check it out in about a week or so...

      Hey there... Today I am going to talk to you about Max Barry. He's an author. He's from Australia and he has the same birthday as me.  I've read one of his books, "Jennifer Government" and I loved it! This book is so easy to read the phrase "hot knife through butter" comes to mind. The story is set in a time hmmm, not so distant in the future, more like 20 years maximum. People now use the names of the company they work for as their surnames, and many other quirks feature in this cool novel with a "this could be a movie" vibe to it.  Max has site...  urlLink Max Barry.com  which doubles as a blog and work in progress update site. This week the entry is about people who type "um..." all the time when emailing or chatting... He's threatening to name bad characters after people who email him with "um" in them... So you can imagine how many people emailed with requests lol...  Just to join in... Um... Seriously, you thought no one would pick up on that Max? hehe...  Great sounding bloke, Great novel! Buy it, read it... Other books by Max Barry:  Syrup
