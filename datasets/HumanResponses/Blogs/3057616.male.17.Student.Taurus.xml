      PheW!! haha... Today I woke up at around 10, and realized that my bro had resetted the computer again (thus the server) and screamed at him.. lolz... Then realized that I had Piano Lessons at 11:00 as replacement for next week because I was going to Desaru.... so I had a very rushy morning..  The piano lesson was like... err... kinda horrible.... because this was one of the few times that I actually went to my teacher's house to have lessons... her piano is so sensitive... i barely had to touch it to make a sound... so my controlling was already in disarray...   Then after that I rushed to Suntec because I told my fren I would go with him to his Youth service today... New Creation Church's Youth ministy is called TeenZeal.. and.. well... the service was pretty cool... Points to take note of 1) The keyboardist did not leave his seat while the preacher was talking (positive) 2) There were 3 backup singers, 1 backup lead and a worship leader, making the whole setting not only impressive, but it creates a professional scene (positive) 3) There were 3 people at the sound control panel, each controlling different parts of the setting (positive) 4) The paster had intercession with the music at the background still, the worship leader still singing - however with a lower volume [thanks to the sound control panel crew] (positice) 5) The guitarist coordinated with the keyboardist VERY well... (positive) 6) The drumset, being electric, was generally controlled by the sound control crew, and therefore, had no piercing effect and was very well controlled (positive)  a) The lead singer's voice was somewhat less resonented then the backup singer's voice (negetive) b) The 3 backup's constantly stumbled (as in unable to independently aid the worship leader while working as a team ), maybe because they relied on the worship leader too much... (negetive) c) The paster loses his seriousness in some aspects of his sermon as he cracks some un-related jokes (negetive) d) Properity teaching - as a whole, is a factor that sometimes can attract the wrong attention... We must know that God gives blessings, yes, and blessings abundantly... however... we must also realize that Christianity is not a bed of roses... God wants us to be prepared for terrible times....  After going to the TZT with cPazo aka Yuan Long, I went with my family out to eat at Crystal Jade Palace restaurant... my bro was not joking.... When he said we were going to eat at Crystal Jade... the first thing that came to my mind is Crystal Jade Kitchen... but when we reached Taka, instead of going down to the basement, we went up... I was shocked... so I thought it would be Crystal Jade Steamboat... but then... he didnt stop there..  Then... I nearly fainted when he stopped at Crystal Jade palace restaurant...  The meal cost over 300.... Knn...  Haha... kk.. sleepy le... tml got camp some more.. lolz... Got to sleep....  Mood: Happy, excited.... Optimistic...

      My heart has been broken too many times...  I now start this blog with a heart that is harder then a diamond, colder then ice, but longing for someone to melt it once more...  Its been so long since I've written a blog, and I shall begin once more...  Devastated by my ordeals in my epic when I was an AJ, I decided to try once again to turn over and become a straight, but I know that it is almost impossible, so I shell slowly do it, and with God's help....  Recently, I've been more active with the Christian communitee in Singapore, now that I've moved my focus away from the AJ communitee... My two best friends, Simon and Haryanto are now closer to me then before, I went to play soccer with them too, even though I much prefer swimming, I still did tag along...  On a friday, I went to the Festival of Praise along with the Agape youth, it was cool.... Darlene Zach and her whole Hillsongs team was there! We spent a very enjoyable night praising God and worshipping Him....  Coincidentally, Yuan Long, aka cPazo was there too, along with the infamous Hobbes.. ( i have nothing against hobbes, really! In fact, i treat him more like a fren then most myplacians). Yuan Long is a passionate Christian, who... I do not know for what reason, stumbled into the AJ communitee... I pray tat he will not be lured to become an AJ too...   It is absolutely true... Once you're an AJ, it's almost impossible to turn straight again, unless you have help, and I mean supernatural help...  Recently, I've become less active in #Myplace and #AJ and more active in #Christian and the new channel #FoP... It is there when I met a new friend, Nerrine... She is quite a new Christian, taking from the depth of knowledge of the bible, but I admire her zeal for evanglism... She wanted to take us to her church service along with YL and a few others, however, in the end, only me and YL ended up going... Her church service is full of life and vigor, and I find the speaker, a bit abstract, but nevertheless, meaningful.... I wish her all the best in her future endevours....  I've also taken a post as an MD at #MP3Downloads, from there, I can receive latest information on the release of new albums and artiste etc, however, I will be sharing my vast library of songs with 100+ people who leech songs day in and day out...  During the past few weeks, my didi told me that he liked me... I really dono what to say... Because my heart has grown too cold towards outright love... I really cant accept it... Moreover, I've already told myself to try and become straight... Its hard.. but I wont let anybody stop me....  Yesterday, I went with the agape youth to Marina Bay... We eat and eat and eat and eat.... haha... to celebrate Jasons last day to be with us before going into NS.... (celebrate? lolz)... I then rushed to the nearest arcade over there to play Para para... Then i met a long long long long lost fren... JY... This cute little boy.. sigh.. haha..... He stood by my side while I was playing para para.... and said he wanted to learn too! haha... wow... i really dont mind teaching him... haha..... but I'm still not flawless... Matthew is still better..... for now....  Today has been a hyper uneventful day... I got worked up over the computer in the morning, formatted the computer in the afternoon, and came back with 8x as much speed in the evening.... Fast... but I think I lost some important documents...  I'm also wondering if I should open an account for Nicholas le...   Mood: Blank, Dreamy.....

      DaY 1:  We departed the church at around 3:00 up the bus... Haha.. i thought we were going to Habourfront.. end up we go Changi Ferry Terminal.. lolz... When we were at the terminal, I suddenly had a wave of depression... I felt that ppl were ignoring me... and I felt very left out... I just wanted to cry... Luckily.. once we boarded the ferry, I slept it off... On reaching the Desaru ferry terminal, we had to sit a pretty long ride on a "bus sekolah" which was hot and cramp... which made me feel worse... but then somebody complimented me on my piano playing, and that kinda cheered me up a bit.... Once we were at the resort, and I got my key, I rushed all the way to the villa and well.. the facilities there were kinda good... better then chalet bah.. but the neighbouring room's aircon was spoilt.. haha... but who cares... That night, I played for the worship... Kinda nervous... this was one of the few times I was performing on my own...  DaY 2:  Woke up at about 7:30... and we had to be at the breakfast table by 8:00.. haha.. everybody was like rushing here and there... We had a pretty rushy devotion the rushed to the table... Dennis was the camp speaker... His topic was focused mainly on revival... He was kinda good... We went to the fruity farm in the afternoon... saw all the different variety of plants, bees, and not forgetting our very friendly neighbourhood mosquito... We even set on a hellish hot van.. Mainly becoz the van was painted black...  After the farm visit, me and Haryanto went to swim... The pool was not to say exectly very clean.... diaoz... There was another talk in the evening and I was the pianist too... But this time, David was helping me... After the talk, we went to the lounge to have a game of pool... Jowyne was drinking Singapore Sling... I still dont get why people like dat... Its like vodka, cough syrup and orange juice mixed together.. At night... I slept next to Haryanto.... I thought back of the time when I had a crush on him... and kept looking at him sleeping peacefully.... part of me wanted to hug him... but another put of me pulled me back... in the end.. i resisted... fortunately...  DaY 3:  Woke up quite early today... had ample time to bathe... Sometimes I still find i have quite a nice body also... but... dono bah... Jealousy can do wierd things.. Nothing much happened in the morning, and I had a nice doze in the afternoon, and was woken up in the late afternoon by Haryanto and David to go play games...  Haha... The sea was magnificent! The tides were 8 or 9 times higher then Singapore's, and they were really strong... Spent my time breakind the waves and riding the tide... haha.. a surf board would really be useful now.. lolz!  Haryanto stepped on a sharp shell and it injured him... gave me a scare... In the evening, we had a game of treasure hunt... lolz... It was really scary.. they hid the sticks in all the wierd dark places... and it was really dark... pitch black... the scary shack we went to find one of the clues was so dark that we could not see anything beyond the torchlight's light! And the house gives me the creeps too... At night I suddenly had a bout of stomachache... It was horrible.. I was vomiting the whole night... I suspected I had food poisioning (again)... haiz... Whole night spoilt...  DaY 4:  I woke up in the morning feeling terribly weak and sick,... I couldn even sit up... I juz lied down in bed the whole morning.. I couldn attend the talk too... haiz However, by God's grace, my stomach became better by the afternoon and I could eat some food.. In the afternoon, we had to go... I slept on the bus and ferry and bus... haiz.... stupid stomachache...   Overall, the camp was fun... if not for the stomachache... Oh yeah.. during the whole time there, David and Matt played Hillsongs, Sonicflood... all the time... It was cool... we really came closer to God and bonded together much more...  Mood: Sick... Tired.. Happy.. dono what lah.... sleeeeppy

        Romans 8:1 = Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ.      [As christians, we believe it is finished (because this is the right answer what.. the bible says so) - but... really really believe? We often fall on the 1st part, his blood for our total forgiveness. When you sin afew mins ago, do you believe its forgiven also? Or maybe the handphone you stole from your friend? - Big sin or small sin, recent or not.. It is all forgiven, totally if you are a christian - That is what happen when the divine exchange took place on the cross. Jesus took all your sins to the cross, and God the father punish the sins on his body, God cannot punish our sins now, because its all been justified. ]  TeenZeal Sermen taken from Hobbes' Webby     I'm so confused... Haiz... The message of Grace, the Gospal of Grace... We all need grace... But does that mean that when we receive God's grace, we will be able (even if we dont like it) to do things that are bad, and still be able to enter the Kingdom of God?  I have already attended a number of New Creation Church's services.. they are inexhorably excellent, you can feel the heavy presence of God in the place...  But why do churches condamn this Church?  Is it because.. 1) Their teaching's in incorrect? - But then each teaching is back up well with the scriptures! So how can it be incorrect if the scriptures is God-breathed?  2) Their teaching's are one sided? - Does it matter? Moral virtue is man made, and only by doing what's right in God's eyes is most important... And given the new covenent, we only need Jesus, to love him and to honour him...  3) They are jealous? - [Financially]Possibly... With a revenue of over 100,000 a week, its not surprising.... - [Strength] Possibly... 10,000... need I say more? - [Holiness] Nah.... But let he who is without sin cast the first stone...   Haiz.. I can go on for a long long time...  Recently I've became much closer with Yuan Long and David... David is actually a really nice guy... Unlike what Jeremy has been spreading.. Charming, cute... act cool sometimes.... Only thing is that he's a bit hot-headed...  Both Yuan Long and David come from reach families... Unlike mine... So they all can afford alot of things that I cant.... Lolz... i haven even been to fish and co. to eat before without my parents....  Dono... I kinda like Hobbes... but never mind... I'm straight now.. lolz... Restrain!!!  Mood : Blur. Confused.. hope ppl who read will get tag an opinion to the answer...

      The orientation was crazy... all the people in Mass Com are so cool.. lolz Our characters are so alike... Talketive... Fashion Savvy... Good at english....   When we first met up, it was as if we already knew each other for a hell of a long time.. lolz.. we talked as if we were long lost friends or something.....  I thought I would be very left out in the poly.. because... maybe I wasnt cool enough or something... but it was very different... within the first few hours of my poly life, I have already started making a quite a number of friends... In fact, my class is the only class in the whole school of business and information that is so closely bonded together that we could win almost every single ice-breaker games.... lolz  My closest friends would be Timothy, Jason, Sarah, Sonia, Shi Hui, Sabarina.. lolz..but the rest of the class is still very close to me... lolz..  On the first day of orientation, we were all already quite close to each other, already knowing our interests, our past lives and for many of us, what we used to do during the holidays even... Then the games came.. the icebreaker games were so easy for us as we knew each other's name already... so it was super easy.... Then came the more tougher team games.. which we passed much more easily then the other teams, mainly because they were not very united while we were glued together like a family... lolz  The second day, we had a farni oriention... Fers started with a very long winded dumb speech by a geeky looking old man, then came the different slide presentations *yawnz* But in the afternoon, we had the elections of Mr and Ms SP, at which our class took out most beautiful and handsome couple out.. lolz... We managed to get to the finals because Sabarina said something wrong... lolz.. but our class didnt get the top place.. lolz  On the third day was the President's Charity Flag day, and we were kicked out onto the streets to beg people for money... lolz.. Timonthy and me teamed up and walked around the whole of Tanjong Pagar and Raffles place to ask for donations.... but that was one of the biggest mistakes we made.. lolz.. because we wont get money from walking around the streets, we shuldve stayed at one spot and ask for money.. lolz.. like a traffic light or something... Jason, Sonia and Sarah came up with the most money, finishing all the stickers that they were provided with... Our class came up with a total of 970+ dollars.. which was quite cool, considering our class isnt really very big.. lolz  Lolz.. then today, Jason, Timothy and me went to Jurong Point to buy a present for Becky and Sarah cause their birthdays are coming.... Spent quite some time searching for the right presents... lolz...  This is a class that anybody would dream off.. cooperative, friendly, supportive... yeah.. can tell we're going to have a good year ahead...  Mood: Happy, Cheerful.. Contemplative...

      The&nbsp;bitter wind stung my face.... Nothing mattered then.... only him... The coarse sharp sand cut at my soles.... Nothing mattered then.... only him... The icy waves spat my feet.... Nothing mattered then.... only him...  He camed into my life... turned it upside down... Took away my strive... and left it there to drown... Why did he do it... why did he let go.... Didnt he see it... how it pierced my soul....  My heart then, harder&nbsp;then diamond, colder then ice... Lock in a chain of an endless vice... The door to freedom seemed so near to me.... However i could never reach it you see...  Grace to me by hand, and gave me a smile... Warmed my heart and cleansed my vile... You see my fren, it isnt hard to let go... Cause what you reaped may not be what you have to sow...  The&nbsp;bitter wind stung my face....  It didnt matter, I didnt give chase... The coarse sharp sand cut at my soles....&nbsp; It didnt matter, I took&nbsp;its toll...&nbsp; The icy waves spat&nbsp;at my feet....  It didnt matter, I was freed...  Begone from disaster, that you may know... That I did not have to plunge to save my soul... For neither fire not frost i need to fear, Drenched in light, so you may hear...  I now spin high, with grace and freedom... Taking the leap into the depts.... That humankind may soon once know... That we may no more fear out debts...  The&nbsp;bitter wind stung my face....  &nbsp;but I was saved by mercy, saved by grace The coarse sharp sand cut at my soles....&nbsp; but I was warm by love, no more by cold...&nbsp; The icy waves spat&nbsp;at my feet....  but it never mattered, because........ I am freed...

      Poly life is great.... really great.... God is great!! ReALLy gReaT!~!  haha....  We've already received our CA project already...  Working together with my group is so fun... Everybody is so actively participating in it... in fact, we're participating so actively that if we do not participate it would be awkward!  Everybody in our group is cool... well... at least i hope i didnt spoil it! loLZ!!  &nbsp;  Timothy, Sonia, Jason, Sarah..... and mE!!&nbsp; I love YOuuu You LovE MeEE wE aRe 1 BiG FaMIleeee... haha...  &nbsp;  Campus crusade for christ... I'll soon be actively participating in it soon...  Heard that their schedules are pretty busy.... I'm still caught between joining campus crusade or youth for christ... Like it or not, this two teams are subtly and constant loggerheads with each other... stress!  The people in both teams are so friendly, and I have friends on both sides as well....  Some more... nobody, when in YFC or CCC is in the other... It is kinda like an unwritten rule...  &nbsp;  Dear God.. Lead me.. I'm so confused..&nbsp;I pray that you will guide my path and let me walk in Your light....  &nbsp;  Today I played the synth in the main Sanctuary as well as led worship in the Agape Youth... So stress.. haha.. but I enjoyed it... I always enjoy serving God....  I found out that i could coordinate with Alvin as my 2nd synth then Karen.... Dunno why.. but guess it is because I have been playing with Alvin in the Sunday school to the Youth for 6 years already... lolz.... We forged out friendship out of the passion for music and God...  &nbsp;  I've finally changed   completely  ... for those who know what I mean, I'm sure you're happy for me too... It's the path for God from now on....  My past.... at least for the past 1 and half year has been a year ridden with misery and sorrow, sadness and fear... That life I know is not what God wanted me to live, and for that matter, anybody to live.... And thats why I know, through God's grace have I suceeded in changing...  &nbsp;  I hope those people who read this and found out about my past will not look down upon me... But know that I took great strength to change... For it is almost impossible to change...  but with God,  all  things are possible....   &nbsp;   ~-=TrAnSForMaTioN!!!!=-~   &nbsp;  Mood: Happy, Happy, Happy.........  &nbsp;

      DMC 1A/02 ROCKS!!!!  Our class is super united... I love my class.... I love everybody in my class... Cheerful, bubbly, sociable and thoughtful... (like I said before) Its like a dream come through for anybody who wishes to restart his life all over again...  Wishes fufilled, dreams framed... My life would never be the same...  For frens like never before, With wings we will soar....  When they tried to split us up at the Connect event, they apparantly weren't very successful because in the end we still met up and set together.. instinctively.... lol.... what a frustration for them... [aint it?] I think I over-stuffed myself silly at that event.... Dunno why I was feeling so hungry... I ate and ate.. so much.... ugh.... Haha...  But I think the music that they played at that event wasnt exectly very good.... in fact... *snigger* haha... nvm....  I love all my frenz... and I hope I can be with them forever and ever.... really... especially my 2 close frens Timothy and Jason.... We kinda click really well and we talk a hell lot.... haha.... sigh....  Today we presented out CC presentation Le Potato Aardvark de Ghost... a hilarious joke of a cook book... but still all the more entertaining...   I juz came back from eating with them after watching a pretty spectacular performance by the strings enssamble... It is really not easy for them to coordinate in a concert hall......... but still they played rather well...  Hope that God really will take care of them and bless them.... =)  They're my great friends!!  What am I thinking now: Err... Le Potato Aardvark de Ghost? LOLz!!!  &nbsp;

      Thing happening so fast nowadays....  Carefree days are relatively over... now it is the CA time... Everybody seems to be studying... and thats no exception for me too... but marketing seems so difficult.... I just cant grasp hold of the concepts surrounding it... Then there is the CCC involvement and the partial involvement in YFC as well... then I guess I would be in Strings Enssamble too... arrrgh... so busy... dunno how to manage my time le....  If this continues to go on... I might have to drop some of my involvement in church liaw.... and I guess this would not be very good....  I've told Timothy and Jason about my past already... I really really wonder how they think about me now that they know who I was in the past... do they secretly dispise me?... I... I dont think so... but... there is a high possibility too.... My past would throw a person who know me for the first time into either hatred, a stunted friendship... or a really beautiful friendship.. because... that is the only secret I have to hide.... Once you know my past, you know 99% of me... basically because i dont exectly know that 1% either...  Tests are coming tests are coming! Stress stress stress... haha... but I'm sure with God's grace, I will be able to pass the tests.... However, for now, I must put in my best effort....  Until now I wonder if it is a mistake that I revealed myself so openly to my 2 frens who are so close to me....... but new...  I hope that God will take care of them and bless whatever they do.......  What am I feeling now: Stressed (?) ... Rather deep in thought now.......

      I wish upon a star....  To know just where you are...   Star light, star bright... A simple wish I have tonight...   Stars... The magnificent creations made by God... Such a perfect universe, such a perfect place...  Science in itself has been created so perfectly that there is no flaw, and everything that it bases is on a question, which is at the origin. So what is the answer? The answer is the the almighty being that created the entire universe by just saying a few words. God - Infinitly powerful, boundlessly loving....   What creatures are we that out of the zillion of things He created, He should love us so much that just to be with us, He sent his one and only Son to die and take our dued eternal punishment and curses, so that we can spend an eternity with him...   People worship nature, people worship dead objects, but... why? For what purpose? Why dont they look up to the real person who created all these things in such a perfect balance and wide spectrum that is entirely beyond our comprehension itself?  So beautiful is the world... God's gift for us, and like a child who is bored with a toy, starts to destroy and dismantle it... But God did not stop us... because He, like a father, wants to see&nbsp;his son&nbsp;happy.... and even when we hurt ourselves by doing so, He is there, right beside us, giving His shoulder for us to cry on... Using his love and sweet words and wiping away our tears....   Will any god do that? People seek knowledge and philosophies to find out their meaning in life, and they end up worshipping role-models they think did the right thing, making them a diety. They worship the belifs and values they hold, thinking they will be able to become like them... but what for?  Our God is a God of love, and holiness... and that just summerizes about everything that goodness is made of... Love is everything that God has done for us, and holiness is everything that causes us to be unable to reach Him without being holy ourselves... Thats why He gave us Jesus, His&nbsp;Son, the ultimate sacrifice, so&nbsp;that we may all be able to&nbsp;see God face to face, to&nbsp;hug him and talk to him personally...   Tell me an innocent person that you know, that from young, healthy and strong, already knew and had a destiny in mind - to die a terrible death and be a living sacrifice?  I love Jesus, because He first loved me... He took the fall, the piercing, the torture, and in His eyes He knew that he was doing this for me, and He willingly did so... That is His love for us, so great that He eventually died the most terrible death at that time, to be hung up on the cross, bleeding and suffocating, He took the sins of the entire world and the future generations upon himself, and His Father, God, for a moment lost Him...&nbsp;Dying, He gazed down from the cross, before His last breath, He reached out and cleansed all the present and future belivers from sin, and died.... and all our sins died along with Him...  And as long as we belive, and trust in Him, we will be able to be with Him forever and ever, in a place more perfect then you can ever imagine...   I love Him, will you love Him too?   I pray that if you read this blog, will come to know that there is somebody who loves you so much, that He would leave behind everything just to be able to hug you and comfort you, to wipe away your tears and make you happy... and that He only want one thing from you.. and that is that you would love Him back...
