      I am making a little section for animals because well I am a fan of them, and I am hoping to work with them when I'm older, for a job. So every week or two weeks I will be telling you some sort of animal thing that is going on in the world. Example: Every day tons of (water habitated) birds and other animals are dying because of pollution. Most specifically oil pollution. Its like this- a stupid ship or boat will dump their oil into the water, all or most; animals, fish, creatures, etc., will die because of the oil that ship or boat dumped. The birds, will also die, because when they go to get fish out of the water, they cannot tell whether the water looks different or not because first, it is too dark to tell, and second THEY ARE BIRDS, THEY AREN'T THAT SMART. So they will go diving in the water to get fish and they will get stuck in the oil, their wings will get coated in the oil, so they can't fly, so they die. This one section was mostly related to pollution and why we shouldn't pollute the world. And also some oil that is left by ships, is not dumped on purpose, there is sometimes simply a leak. I know that isn't their fault, so if that happens there is nothing I can say. But sometimes ships pollute the water on purpose, even though it is illegal. And they might not even get caught, so you have a ship who is going around polluting the waters, and you don't know who it is. That's when you have a problem. So I made this section to maybe make people to stop polluting the world, or make other people, make the people who are polluting the world, be stopped. So please try to make a difference. Help stop pollution. That's my section for this week and please feel free, once after you have read this, to e-mail me what you think at Nicklachey1lover@yahoo.com  Submitted and made specially by: Ellie

      "A good friend can tell you what is the matter with you in a minute, he may not seem such a good friend after telling"  - Arthur Brisbane    I think that, that quote meant that a good friend can tell you what's a matter with you in a minute, but they really aren't such a good friend though, if they are saying something is a matter with you. I'm not exactly sure as to what that quote means, so if you think it means something else, feel free to e-mail it to me at    Nicklachey1lover@yahoo.com
