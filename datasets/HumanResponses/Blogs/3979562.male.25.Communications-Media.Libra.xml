       but you can't use my phone.  I'm finding it quite hard to be motivated by the  urlLink seti@home  project anymore. I'm running it on less machines as the days go by & I have to admit that I appreciate the lack of heat in the room. Sure it's very helpful during the winter but at summer time, it makes getting lost with no water in the Sahara desert look like a fun game.  It's also a very good tool to realize how obsolete your system is. When you notice that people who buy PCs to "surf the web or do some word here &amp; there", can crunch work-units twice as fast as you, if you've had a good head start, might as well quit while you're ahead. & when you finally get your ass handed to you, you can always say that it's because you're not running it anymore. ;-)  Things haven't been very calm here today. The morning started out with  urlLink a gas explosion  taking away 14 people so far. If some relatives were to read this (I doubt it but you never know), I present my condolences to them.  Almost time to go to the pool again. :-D

       4 weeks later & my desktop still looks the same, I must've lost my mind with the heat. It was definitly time to make things right again. ;-)      urlLink This  is what currently looks like.

       This morning, I got a letter from the tax office & I was already wondering how I was gonna pay whatever it was they were asking me when, get this, they worked out that I had paid them too much during last year &amp; so I'm getting a refund.        You damn right I paid too much. You better gimmeh my money back !!!  Uh just in case, lemmeh check the name on the letter again. Ah yes, it's mine. So as I was saying  Pay me !!!  :-D       It's not much but my wallet will surely appreciate the exercise. Not all is good is lazyland though. The laptop left. My dad is going down to Rome to see his grand - daughter & decided he might want to play solitair on the plane. I'm glad it's being put to good use...

       I hate Mondays, I wish it were the week-end already. Worst thing is, I'm not even working right now. That's a frightening thought.       I'm writing this post from a laptop & I pretty much made my mind that I should get one as soon as possible. What really made me decide that is the discovery of the following formula : Internet + cozy bed = ooooooooh.       This is my dad's laptop &amp; I'm supposed to be fixing it for him. I got tired pretty fast so I just saved all his documents, did a format then a clean windows install. It's actually working perfectly but I told him I needed to test a few things to make sure all was fine. :-D       It's quite a surprise to see him here. He lives in Tanzania 90% of the time & has the habit of showing up without letting anyone know. So last night, the doorbell rings &amp; here I go to open thinking it's probably just the wind trying to piss me off (I could swear it did that once already). I see my dad standing there with a suitcase.       "Oh hi Dad !!!"         It was a nice surprise but still, contrary to popular belief, phones are not instruments of the devil. ;-)         PS. I ripped the album yesterday &amp; the songs play fine. Huzzah !!!

        Copy Control Technology       Well great.      This is on a Edith Piaf album by the way. I cannot call it a compact disc for Philips made it very clear that these "Copy Control" enhanced devices are not compliant to the CD standard. Does EMI really think this is necessary ?      My mom bought this album & wishes to do a copy for her sister. Clearly she's liable for a lawsuit by the RIAA. Anyways, I still got dBpowerAMP to load it &amp; rip it. I'll need to have a listen to see if the songs skip or something like that.      Stay tuned.

          Tall and tan and young and lovely, The girl from Ipanema goes walking, And when she passes each one she passes goes...   What the hell is she wearing ?       If you happen to be impaired on the sex appeal side of things, I don't think wearing a thong is doing you any favors. Not even a little bit. It reveals part of you that shouldn't be revealed. The same way the tooth fairy could actually be a bald guy wearing a pink tutu, certain things should remain a mistery.      Besides that small "detail", the pool was nice & I might actually go more often from now on. I went to bed pretty late last night but I still wanted to be at the pool at 8.00. I went, did a few laps, took a shower, got back home &amp; went back to bed.      Can't talk now, sleeping.

       Since when is it normal for it to be 28Â°C in Belgium ? It never got that hot when I first got here. It's not really making me wanna go out either. As much as I realize how hot it is inside, I'm afraid to go out & not find any shade. For someone who panics when sweat runs down his forehead, I bet you can already see the picture.     What's good about warm weather is that you don't feel like eating warm food. I find cold food to be much faster to prepare. Just get some salad ready, mix some kind of salad dressing, bread, cheese of some sort, olives &amp; of course something cold to drink (it could be dishwashing liquid, as long as it's cold I'm up for it). I call it "lazy man's feast".     It would be nice if I'd get the chance to go to the beach this summer. When it gets too hot, you just walk a little & jump in the water. The only thing I don't like about it is those "warm spots" in the water. You can always pretend it's some hot water current but most of the time it's some guy that's been drinking too much &amp; decided to relieve himself in the water. I myself let go a few bubbles every once in a while &amp; pretend it's the fishes. :-P     At least during my latest day of inactivity, I got to watch  urlLink Secret Window . It's a pretty good movie but before the end I had actually figured out what was going on. I guess I've read too many Stephen King novels. Meh...

       "When you have a lifestyle to maintain, health is a secondary consideration"      That's what I like telling myself when I look back at a whole day spent indoors. Although it really wouldn't hurt me to do some sports every now & then. I guess I could start with swimming. There's a pool right next to my house. It doesn't cost much, head caps are obligatory &amp; with enough chlorine in the water to make your eyes red even before going in the water.     I only stopped going when they changed the rules on the bathing suits. You could go with a bathing short at first but now anything that doesn't allow them to count your testicles is out of the question.     It's not like I'm ashamed or anything. I mean I, like everyone else, have three of those so what am I worried about ? I guess I'm just paranoid. I always figured I would be wearing one of those "suits" & out of the blue some sexy girl would show up with some sexy bikini &amp; I'd end up with a "joystick". With a bathing short you can always pretend it's a gun or a flashlight. Since I can't anymore, I'd have to wait in the water for everyone to leave the pool before going out myself.     That's not really an option. I mean there's enough chlorine in that pool for me to turn into an albinos in more or less 30 minutes.    Bah, staying inside &amp; away from the sun got me pale enough as it is. Maybe I'll go to the pool this week-end after all.

       I guess not many people expected for this last more then a few hours (me the least). Oh well, I might as well do a few more nonsense filled posts. After all nonsense never really hurt anyone.     Well...     If it did, you can't sue me for much... (ha!)     Today is the Belgian independence day & what a perfect way to celebrate that then to go see the fireworks, eat some apple candy, maybe even some fries, all that under the warm         RAIN       Yes it's raining. Not just a little bit either, I'm expecting some guy to show up through the clouds & ask me to gather a male &amp; a female from each species. There's no way I'm taking any gorillas though. Saving wildlife should not include me cleaning pounds of gorilla poo after each meal.     I already hung a flag from my balcony so I guess I've done my duty for this year. If I feel like it I might watch the fireworks on some website feed (my patriotism knows no limits).     For those who are wondering, I did not change the looks of my desktop today. I actually have a life.    I'll do it later tonight. :-D

       As you know by now, I'm quite into computers (the absence of chocolate bar abs is a very strong hint). Recently I've been finding myself quite occupied with the looks of my desktop. Spending more time organizing the looks of your computer then actually using it means you should seriously start exploring the outside world a bit.     I know that, I just ignore it to the best of my abilities.     I generally start off by finding a wallpaper that fits my mood, from there I look for a XP visual style that goes well with it & finish off with icons. I call it the  art of rendering the desktop pretty to look at but more or less completely useless . It doesn't really take into account ease of use, not much at least. Oh ok not at all. There I said it. Happy ?     I could probably click on of the "oooh pretty" icons & format my hard drive without even noticing (I love backups).        urlLink This  is what it looks like right now &amp; I'd rather not say how long it took me to come up with that...

              Well it's everywhere.        You find more people with blogs then with Emails these days. I just had to see for myself what all the fuss was about.       Will this blog last long ? I can't tell. I might like the idea of a personal blog, I might hate it. I could actually seem to like it & a few months down the road, I'll look back at the posts &amp; think to myself " What the hell am I doing ?" .        I guess I should at least say a little something about me then. Well there's not that much to say, really.       Computer science student with more online friends then offline, currently single, who can't keep a room clean for more then 2 hours & with physical capacities that went down the drain once he discovered computers.       Take my name out &amp; you have the profile for 90% of computer programmers (although in my defense I can honestly say that some suck at sports even before discovering computers). After all the saying goes "It is better to have shot a free kick &amp; missed then to have never shot a free kick". Tell me if I'm wrong.        :-P       Oh yeah, welcome to my blog, blah blah blah, bathrooms are last door on the left, blah blah blah, happy hour on Fridays from 9 to 10pm, etc.

        What's worse then being at work ?  Answer : being at work with nothing to do. You know things are bad when you look at people crawling under work in an envious way. On that note, I'd like to give a shout-out to  urlLink Cedia , who's been fighting that fight before me. I feel your pain. ;-)  Anyone know of good websites with good prices for flights ? So far, I've looked at expedia, travelocity, orbitz. I still need other options.

       Working on an "industrial" location for a while now makes me realize the only game that took place in one (Half-Life) didn't really follow the rules. By the way, if you haven't guessed by now, I'm bored to death & will now try to make you as bored as me. Keep following the leader. ;-)  After my extensive research on the security matters of industrial installations, I've come to the conclusion that this is a more reasonable look for Gordon Freeman.

       but I took two extra strength tylenols &  I still want to shoot somebody !!!   If headache was a category in the Guinness book of records, I'd be in the top 5. Judges would give me 9/10 in headache tournaments. If I also had a throbbing vein on my forehead I would have the perfect specimen of a headache, hands down. You'd see my picture next to that word in the encyclopedia.  If you're wondering how bad it is, imagine Black Sabbath playing inside your cranium. Not bad enough ? Imagine them playing on their first day of detox. Well that doesn't even come close to it. :-(

        so you better treat her right...   Well does she have to wear a construction helmet & look like one of the Village People all day ? I do. I also have to wear glasses that make me look like an 80's basket-ball player. The cafeteria is pretty nice &amp; the prices are pretty good. The only problem with that, is that I eat well at lunch & feel like taking a nap right afterwards. I guess I'll have to wait to become some chief of some department before I can do that and get away with it. ;-)  I also noticed a trailer put out for a  urlLink new exorcist . Great. I never liked remakes much. Very few actually pay a good homage to the original piece & so at first I liked the concept of a "prequel". It doesn't modify the original movie &amp; tries to bring something new (eventually). But then I saw the Phantom Menace...

       The bed felt so good this morning. It always feels good when you actually have to get up & leave it for work. Argh. It's like the last meal before going to the electric chair (minux the priest). The sheets feel warmer, softer, the sound of the birds outside your window don't annoy you as much as it usually does, well at least not to the point where you want to get a gun to shoot them down &amp; you could probably spend all day in bed without a problem.  Instead I'm going to be doing some work that I don't really like, but when you're broke you can't really afford to be picky. I guess it's still better then  Welcome to McDonald's, may I help you ?   At least I hope...

       Even if you're not a Star Wars you've probably seen the Star Wars gangsta rap animation. Well it's been updated & I like the  urlLink new version  a lot.  We got Death Star...   I also downloaded the final trailer for  urlLink Doom III . I wasn't really looking forward to it, way too much hype & the fact that it seemed way too scripted. After watching the trailer...    me wants !!!
