      time.. 1.18am...  haiz.. today is friday... marks the start of long weekend somemore... and guess where did i spend my friday nite??? at  STANFORD!!!!   doing business case some more... life is so depressing... and yet the students must have a party somewhere near the place where I'm working on my case?!?!?!?!?! =(  Anyway, today is the friday that marks the long weekend for many of us.. or should I say all of us???? since monday is memorial day.... my office is like a ghost town.... most of them did not come for work today.. either that or they left early... and what was I doing in office??? not work.. but BUSINESS CASE!!!!!!! I just want to get it over and done with.... then I'll be happy.. hehehe.....  Had a drinking session in the afternoon with my collegues... feel kinda funny.. drinking in the afternoon.. and with collegues some more... in the office!!!! this is something that I suppose would not happen in Singapore I guess... we call it HAPPY HOUR!!! luckily I'm still sober after that to continue with work.. haha.... how does happy hour increase the efficiency of the workers?? some guesses -> employees become happy so more willing to slog their life off for the employer.. get the employees drunk and you'll know what they are unhappy with the employer.. hehe.. is this all a scheme?? does that signify why there is a fridge filled with alcohol in my office??? *thinking*  Only consolation today I guess was the firework display in Stanford... though not very sure what event it is for... but it sure tells one thing...  STANFORD IS FREAKING  RICH !!!!!!!  cos one thing for sure....  NUS will not have such display except during the closing of commencement!!! I simply love fireworks... =)  Fireworks do trigger some thoughts in me though.... they are so beautiful.. just like sweet memories.. but yet short-lived.... sounds depressing?? well i guess that's life.... so grab on to those sweet memories.. record them!! or whatever!!! as long as you remember them... that's all that matters isn't it??  meanwhile.. time to ZZZZzzzzzz...... more business case tomorrow.... =(

      Time.. 12.46am  Today I shall attempt to sleep a bit earlier.. feeling kinda burn out recently.. maybe too stress.. at work got tonnes of stuff to do.. but kinda mundane since now my dept is doing some housekeeping on all the header files.... no more creation of fun apps.. =(.. miss those days.... when i get to play with so many gadgets and apps..   Business case is another big headache... arrgh.... just realize that I've been complaining about it everyday.. why is it that it is so difficult to tell a story!!!! why why why!!!!!!!!! I'm just not talented.. =(  Today Jo finally left California liao.. she should now be boarding her second flight back to singapore or is she still in transit at Korea?? Wonder if she is ok with all her luggages... kinda miss her.... she left me so much chips!!!!! Jo!!! you just refuse to let me go on diet even after you leave right???? hahahhaa...... *munch munch*  Anyway, a tiring day.. guess I didn't rest well yesterday night... stayed in office till 9 plus.. but no motivation to work.... in short... I'm BORED..... is there anything that is interesting or exciting for me to do?????? hmm......  Today is my second last coaching session already.. and somehow.. the ending tone didn't seem too pleasent... seems like it is a real serious issue that I should think about.. I think my coach is really very good at making me realize things about myself.... Suddenly it dawn upon me that I have been living my life base on how others see me... living my life base on others expectations.. and that's NOT what i want!!! I want to be myself!!! So from today onwards.. I will be myself!!! hehe.. living by my own core values... in the process.. some of my peers may find me changing.. they may not like the new me.. but that's who I  REALLY  am!!! I'm sure if they are my true friends.. they will like the REAL me too!!  I have been irritated in the past.. but that's becos I feel that I can't live up to certain expectations that I feel my peers are setting on me.. but am I obliged to meet those expectations?? answer is NO!!!!! I dun have to!!... I'll just be true to my friends.. be true to myself.. should anyone try to change me... then I can only say SORRY!!! But my life is mine!! and I decide how i live it!! =)  hehe.... kinda over reacting eh??.. hehe... but it seriously feel so good to be me.. and I'm sure my true friends will behappy for me too!!..   Time to ZZZZzzzzz...... nites and sweet dreamz to all...

      time.. 1.13am.. =P  I'm sitting right by the window listening to music.. just decided to stop doing my case.. Kinda tired from all those typing and stuff.. and thinking.. somehow or another.. the structure just seem so wrong... 8 Modular Credits..... Stress.. if I screw up this paper.. it is as good as gone..... sob sob.. ='(  Why is it that some people can write and write and write... while i simply dun have that kind of talent??? =( What kind of talent do I really have?? I wonder.. and I shall wonder hard.. =P  Tonight is Jo's last night in the Valley... she'll be leaving here tomorrow afternoon.. =( I guess I'll miss her a lot.... we had so much fun cooking and stuff... and the ransacking of fast food chains!!! not to forget our cheesecake and donut feast!!!  I wonder how is she feeling now.. Will she have mixed feelings just like me now that my term here is coming to an end now??   Mixed feelings cos I'm happy to be with my parents again.. my friends back in singapore... and not to forget..  AUTHENTIC SINGAPOREAN FOOD !!!!! haha.... happy cos I'm leaving this place to start a fresh?? Sad cos I'll miss the freedom that I have here for sure... the weather.. my car...  roadtrips.. financial independence... Worried cos would the friendship forge here be lost???? Questions questions....  What about the memories?? would I want to bring those once happy and sweet memories back home with me??? or are they too hurting to be brought back??????? Dunno..... questions that may never be answered.... but oh well... i guess.. be it a nightmare or a sweet dream... it is still something that had change my life... my perception.. my thoughts...  meanwhile... time to knock out...Zzzzzzz.......

      time is now 1.28am.. and here i am waiting to eat cheesecake.. hahhahaha.... (tomorrow still have to work.. how sad..=(... )  anyway, today i woke up with the feeling of doing my business case.. so i ended up taking the day off today.. hehe... but oh well.. can't do this everytime.. =P but apparently, I'm not having much progress also.. all the information seems to be overlapping here and there.. which boils down to a point... I'm NOT a good Story teller... sob sob... want to cry liao.... wah!!!!! super stress and irritated.... no wonder how come i get irritated so easily...  anyway today had super lots of food.. hahahahahhaa.... well Jo's stay here is coming to an end soon.. she is leaving on Thursday.. sob sob... so we went on a fast food feast today.. haha... cos there will be a lot of food that Jo will be craving for once she is back in Singapore.... no more cheesecake factory.. no more krispy kreme... no more McDonald yogurt.. no more Taco Bell.... on top of it there is no Carl's Jr in Singapore!!!!!! hahahaha....  think now I'm so much familiar with all the fast food that can be found along El Camino... haha... from Stanford towards Mountain View.. there will be Jack in the Box, McDonald, Taco Bell followed by Carl's Jr.. well may miss out a few.. but kinda comprehensive isn't it... hahahahahaa....  hehe.. wonder what sort of cravings I will have when I'm about to leave Sunny california... bye bye to all the fast food... and welcome to all the newton hawker centers!!!! hahahahaha....  meanwhile, I shall go and rush Jo out for my cheesecake.. hahaha...... now I know why I'm gaining weight liao... hahahahaha... shall dream about food in my dreamz later.. hahahhaa

      time now is 12.41am... slightly earlier today..  Today is another Monday.. but this week will be different.. cos of Bisnuss Case!!!! Gonna be rushing like mad.. how am I able to generate a case in 2 days?!?!?! maybe if I dun sleep?? but oh well, it'll all be over in just 7 more days.. can't wait for that to come...  Anyway, I noticed something about me... I tend to wear blue on Mondays.... I guess it kinda fits the term "Monday Blues" haha.... Ever wonder where the term Monday Blues come from??? from Garfield maybe?? since it hates monday so much?? and why blue?? why not pink, yellow or black or gray??????? why Blue???? kinda curious recently.. =P  Anyway, started the day on a tired note.. dunno why.. just feel so tired everyday no matter how much I sleep.. just what is wrong???? but oh well.. maybe I'm really burn out...  On the whole.. the ave grading for today was only 6 out of 10.. What makes it a 6 and not a 10?? (Typical qns to be ask by my coach) Well, cos halfway through the day.. kinda got irritated?? and I start to wonder.... is there something that I did wrong?? or am I being too nice??? or am I simply too naive.. Why is it that just when one decides to forgive and forget.. the whole cycle starts again?!?! or could it be becos he reminds me too much of him??????? of the pain and the hurt?? and subconsciously though I keep thinking that it is not due to his presence that things have change..    "Confronting the truth" is what he once told me.. but where's my chance of truth?? who can tell me the truth?? Though I have decided not to pursue the truth but is it really what I wanted?? or could it be that I'm just fearful of the truth.. but one thing for sure is that not knowing the truth could have cause the cycle.. the way I see the situation and the way I react.. could staying away be the only way to make my life better?? or happier.... I just want to bring joy and laughter back into my life....   Well.. maybe I'm just agitated and irritated and kinda felling down... shall go to zzzz...  tomorrow will bw a better day.. =P

      now is 1.34am.. why do i always blog ard this time?!?!?!?! well... I guess probably this is the time when I normally try to knockout and go to bed.. =P  Today, I finally manage to get started on my business case.... something which I should have done like 1 month ago.. but the procrastination devil keep coming to bug me.. haha... oh well... guess i'm always trying to create some challenge here and there.. either that or I'm just pushing it.. haha...  Had a terribly good laughing time today.. it had been a long time since I had such a good laugh.. all thanx to my two very good friends here.. Jen and Ray.. =).. I love both of them so much!!!! and I think I'm kinda blessed to have their friendships...  Anyway.. today we had a discussion on who have the most distintive laughter here on this program for my batch.. and guess who's the winner????? ME!!!!!! hahahahaa.... but I thought the award should really go to someone else.. someone whose laughter is really like "HAHAHAHAHAHA" literally.... even his face seems like a smily.. kinda able to picture his face doing the "toungue sticking out" smily.. sort of like his trademark to me... but haven't been seeing it for a long long time..... =(  hey.. wait.. not suppose to let all these memories creep back at me.. *shoo shoo*.. anyway, some cute combinations form today.... next time if people dun say sorry when you want them to.. hehe.... can say "Say sorry please.." weird combination.. sorry + please... haha... what a polite way to get others to apologize... but we are all polite and gracious Singaporean aren't we.. =P  That's all for now!!! meanwhile time to Zzzzzzzzz...........

      Time is now 1.24am..   well kinda late now to blog.. but then.. woke up pretty late today and kinda felt really guilty for sleeping too much.  I guess the habit of having little sleep is kinda "programmed" in my biological ROM?? no longer erasable.. HELP!!!!!! or is it just becos I'm lagging too far behind in my work???  Well, anyway.. was eating really way too much today I guess... but it was good!! hahahaa.... well at least some good nourishment for my past week of hard work.. haha...   Had a good lunch at Miyaki today.. well.. long time never been there since my classes at Stanford ended.. kinda bring back some memories.. =(.. went to cheesecake factory at Palo Alto for cheesecake too!! but oh well... dunno why.. but kinda brings back some memories too... felt kinda sad.. dun anyone just hates it when those once happy memories crept back into your mind?? but oh well.. I shall not think of those things anymore.. need to concentrate on my work.. =P  I made soup today again!!!!! hehe... thanx mommy!!! for sending me those herbs... the soup turn out great!!! hahahaha.....(but i still miss Mommy's soup..) now I finally know why I put on so much weight for these past 8 months.. been eating way too much.. hahaha... I wonder if my mum will still recognise me at the airport when I'm home.... shall do a before and after picture.. =P or maybe send my picture back home first so she can pick the correct person up from the airport.. haha...  anyway.. that's all for today...  Tomorrow will be a better day... =P

I WANT to do MORE travelling!!!! but then.. with WHO??? I would want to go travelling.. but with pple who i enjoy.. and not find someone just for companionship!!!! feels like going to florida.. or miami!! or even Hawaii!!!! but alone?!?!?!? hmm... wonder if it would be fun.... or maybe it would be exciting?!?! but probably would give it a try.. hehe.. time to take the CALtrain and go somewhere!!!! finally can put my backpack to use.. but before that.. probably I should go and get pepper spray.. well.. no harm to be safe.. :P  Another thing.. my good fren, jenny... she needs to go back to Singapore early... cos she's having problems with her leave with her new company... =( less time to spend with her... i'll miss her...... no more Tokyo trip with her... *sob sob* but i guess it's all fated.. but no prob!! if there is a chance.. we can always arrange another trip when she is back in Singapore!!! =)  Anyway.. we went to the Winchester Mystery house today!!! indeed it's a mystery.. we have to take 44 steps just to reach the next floor!!!!!!!!!! and everything is all around the number "13"!!!!! Door to nowhere!?!?!?! interesting!!!! and our tour guide keep saying "Please watch your steps and follow me closely.." so much so that it's kinda creepy..  =P wonder if i would get nightmare tonight.... *thinking*  now i'm watching a show as I'm blogging... show is called "Ever After" typical hollywood fairytale love story.. and a verse strike me --> "a life without LOVE is not a life".. how true that is... but where can one find and how does one know if it is true?? what an interesting thing it is..

      time now is 12.43am..  i haven't been blogging for the past few days.. 3 days to be exact.. reason?? cos i was freaking busy with the business case!!!! but oh well.. it's finally over!!!!! *celebration!!!!* hahahaha.....  ok so let's recap what happen for the past few days.. well on fri and sat I was at stanford with jenny.. rushing our business case.... two of us so poor thing... long holiday and yet there we are stuck with our business case.. all tired out.. we were falling asleep on the couches in stanford!!!! imageine.. that's how tired we both are....  On Saturday, met up with my friend from singapore.. my gossip and IM khaki back in HP when we were both interns..:P.. he is here in the bay area with his girlfriend and prospective mother-in-law.. hehehehe... so I kinda met up with them and chit chat a little... gonna miss their commencement back in NUS.. so sad... :(.. but the meeting was great!!!!! it always feel good to meet up with friends who you have not met for such al long time and yet still have so much to talk about.. too bad I couldn't stay later due to business case plus the fact that I have to rush home to select my final year project.. sucky... I took like 4 hours to go through the list and select my projects!!! hopefully i get one of those projects and not some sucky one...  Anyway, Sunday was good... went white water rafting... it was so much fun!!!! just that i slept for like less than 2 hours the night before and was feeling so freaking tired after the whole thing... Chandra was my partner in the raft and when we were going thru the "Mother" the so call most exciting part of the river.. he fell out of the raft!!!! I was shocked!!! and worried..... luckily his injuries only involve a few cuts on his leg and nothing else.... jenny had injuries too.. tonnes of bruises on her legs and a bruise cut eye.... all from the peddles from Stephen's paddle when he jumped into the river..  we ended the trip with a dinner at this place known as "My Thai"  The food was great!!!!!! but we kinda underestimate on the spiceness of the food.... Jinx, Xin Rui and Stephen ordered "FIRE" and it was indeed on fire judging from their looks as the swallow their food..:P but it was still great!!!!!!!! lastly the high point was.... I saw fireworks as I was driving along 237!!!!!! and boy do i love fireworks!!!!!!!! will there be anyone to set fireworks for me one day??? i wonder.. hahahhahahaa.. well in my dreams perhaps.. :P  alrite.. kinda tired now.. shall continue more tomorrow.... ZZZZzzzzzz........

Singapore and today is National Day.. so may i say  HAPPY 39th BIRTHDAY SINGAPORE!!!  and i must say.. This year's fireworks is simply AWESOME!!!!!!!

I must say that I MISS sunny california so much!!!!! miss my friends there.. my car... everything!!!!!! and i must do admit that i can't help but sometimes feel a little out of place at times.. =(  Even back in school.. i feel kinda old.. haha.. seeing all my juniors.. and my frens all having started their work.. and somehow.. it is like you are all alone... ='( and well i guess i'm having the kind of stupid mentality that i'm disturbing my frens if i call on them too much.... haiz..... just what is wrong with me??? hmm...  Another issue... having quite a short temper recently... haiz.. dunno why.. but somehow simply gets piss off very easily???? or are there pple who are simply pissing me off... i wonder..... or maybe my mood is really not as good.. so maybe that's why i get irritated very easily??? hmm.... interesting..  Anyway tomorrow is the start of sch.. and I need to wake up real early cos I'm still unsure of how to get to my classroom!!!!! So.... time to go to sleep!!! nitez and sweet dreamz......
