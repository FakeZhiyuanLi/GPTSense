      Ok everybody. I'm going to admit I'm  not the most unfortunate soul out there. And I feel bad. So I want all of us to start praying for Kellie's friend who just lost everything in a fire.   Psalm 23 A psalm of David. 1 The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,  3 he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  6 Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.  Wow I love that passage.

      As some of you might have known I had an interview with Dierburgs and it went really well. But today I got a letter from them saying Thanks but No Thanks. I guess its back to job hunting for me. This really sucks I was so ready and I really needed it too. Totally of subject here but would those stupid telemarketers (no clue how to spell) please stop calling us, were on the no call list thingy.  Later

      Ok, every one else is like doing things every single day except for me. I just sit around all day doing nothing. This is so stupid. OOOOO I get to go to Texas. I'm so excited Texas. Can you catch the sarcasm. If not then um yeah. That's all for now. I just thought I would share that.  Later

      Well I can tell that it's summer now. I've already slept into 12:00 pm one day, I've stayed up till 2:00 am and I'm waiting to pull an allnighter.  It's starting to get really hot outside, man am I happy that we have a pool. Not that I use it that much. But if I ever need to I know that it is there. O yeah, I saw Shrek 2 it was awsome. There are still some movies that I wanna see. Well I'll post some more stuff later.
