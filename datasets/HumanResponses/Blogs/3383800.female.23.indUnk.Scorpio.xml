      i tripped the other day with my friend, honky.  we day tripped at the park, in the grocery store, in osco, in the corner, and in my treehouse.  we heard a lady tell her friend that she is allergic to polyester and that if she ever laid down on a bed with polyester sheets and went to sleep she'd never wake up.  ha ha.  honky also was willing to try some yoga poses from a yoga deck and did them all!!!  first time she ever did yoga!!! at one point i was reading the directions on how to get into the pose and concentrating really hard on my reading then i looked up when i heard an OUCH  honky looked like a pretzel!  in total position!  anyhoo, dr. octogon rocks!  and this stuff is totally legal. and i am tired...  and i have 3 kinds of buds to smoke!

      I had a friend that burned bodies for a living.  dead people.  she is really wierd anyway, but she decided to take 5 hits of acid with about 9 other people, and all of them sat on a church bench to watch some chick be incenterated.  i heard her lips bubbled and she was thrown staight up from the heat's power and there were mad flames violently shooting out of her eye sockets.  lo and behold she was swept up into a urn and my pal had a new glow in her eye.  i wondered why she never invited me.  probably cause i smoked out in my friends new herse but puked cause i could still smell all the formaldehyde, but i was youger then.  this same pal o mine also introduced me to a awesome movie called necromantic.   i was talking to some guy last night.  what a yapper!  i have gone about 3 months without saying very much.  I'd like to say that i said nothing, but i just said what i needed to say.  i have always thought that talking was overrated and a step in the wrong direction. then another time after my brother died i only said three words for about three months: "i don't know." more on this later... tired of hearing myself
