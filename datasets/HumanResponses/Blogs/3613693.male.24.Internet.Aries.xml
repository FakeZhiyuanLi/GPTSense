               This is a story of sometime during the last Christmas festive. The sound of jingle bells tuning in the breeze, the  morning sun was shining through the mist & all the folks here in namma bangaloru were busy crooning the Christmas carol....In between all these, there awaited an alluring love story to bloom, to add some flavor in that merry season.         It was one fine day when I woke up as usual with the first ray of  the sun on earth. As I was getting ready for my regular morning workout, I never thought for a moment that the day was also geared up to unfold a new mania in my life.        Then I went hopping to my gym, a place where I jog myself  not only physically but mentally too.In the midst of my exercise, my  fleeting look caught up with an eye.It was hers........Out of the blue, a facinating aroma hovered around the corners of  the gym. She was dark with twinkling eyes, with ease to carry on character & having a small curve on her face that lit many hearts to glow.  After gazing  her few seconds,I rouse from the trance.Then after, during the whole workout period, I gazed her recurrently. Needless to say, I was also getting her glance frequently....Afterwards we both went our way back  home without uttered a word.         Atfirst I thought it just as an infatuation. But as the day was nearing to end, this simple infatuation was shaping into  irresistible fanatism. The second day again passed as the previous one....all my try-outs for the icebreaking with her went in vain. On the third consecutive day,as I was determined to break my  silence to her, I went to the gym bewildered. With the stroke of minute hand at 2 & hour hand at 7 in the clock, she gushed into the gym.My heart started whipping vigorously & the whole body was shivering at the thought of proposing her.          Somehow I gathered courage & geared myself to  put forward my heartfelt  proposition. Then I saw she was about to go away. Me without wasting any time went downstairs with a thought of encountering her in the middle of  staircase. Since I'm a very cool person atleast in front of  my gym mates,I never wanted to appear as a local majnu(romeo) before them.That's why I preferred this staircase episode.Wlile waiting for her, I was continually recalling the famous love packed  dialouges from the evergreen films & repetedly memorising a few from them.	         Then I heard some foot tabbing sound .  Slow & steady she was stepping down the staircase. Its sound was making me feel as if somebody was punching my heart with different sizes of dumbell. All of a sudden she landed  infront of me, the same moment I forget all my memorised dialouges. As she stop for a while,again our eyes glued to each other for few seconds. Then  she was about to make her move , I roared "Excuse me.." She paused & turned back. Then I said "I wanna tell u something but I don't know how to start". She raised her eye brows quizzically & asked what's the matter. Uffh !!  That was enough to stir butterflies in my stomach. I responded " I feel I have a crush on u......."    Dishum....Dishum...   I felt somebody beat me ......O Oh !! That was my imagination.....She said smartly smiling "I don't know how to react on this......." .  Smart girl.....atleast more than  I expected.....And since my smartness never lag behind, putting a solution towards her, I said " If you don't like me.....slap me hard on my face Or if u have any soft corner for me then allow me to get into ur heart", the dialouges which were best than the memorised one & I feel that to win atleast an oscar.         Looking at  my face she said " I can't slap u...." ( there I took one wicket) then she smiled (here taking another wicked believing the principle that Ladki haasi tho samjho fassi ), and put forward her hand for a hand shake, introducing herself as Sita.(Scoring the final wicket for hatrik.....I Won.) I too followed her same custom. Her hands were so smooth & velvety that one could feel like holding a silk in their hand. After  few tête-à-tête we departed each other by wishing for Christmas in advance with a hope to meet soon. The next day was Christmas & a holiday in the gym. I enjoyed the whole day by dreaming about her. Then for another two days, she didn't come to the gym .Since I got my exam dates near,  I took a week leave to study.Later when I went back to gym, everybody was sharing their place other than my sita. Later I learned that she was coming in the evening....I thought of joining her in the evening but that was not possible for me as I don't want to miss out  my lab works & the time I daily sharing with my friends after sunset for just to meet her for an hour. I was thinking, why can't she come in the morning to meet me & why should I go in the evening ??? My ego bought me to a standstill. Later for couple of days she came in the morning hours during which I learned that since her college was on vacation she was working somewhere for part time . So it was not possible for her to turn up to the gym every morning. But whenever she visited the gym in her holidays, we exchanged a lot of momentary looks. Both of us were feeling to open our hearts. But somewhere something was pinching....not allowing each other to come closer. Then slowly she went far away from my visibility......Later I came to know that she shifted from their previous dwelling place. By this time she has left the gym also.....leaving no stones for me to turn upside. I don't know where she is now & there is no real possibility for me to find her in this large people's arena......But today I'm still living in a hope to meet her someday to express whatever I missed without her. Sometimes I see the flikerring stars in a hope that if accidently she happens to glance at them the same moment, atleast I could see some shades of her eye inbetween those filkers.           If she could ever hear me......here are my lines for her......   	  	I'll love you, dear, I'll love you 	            Till Chine & Africa meet                 And the river jumps over the mountain                    And the salmon sings in the street.                   I'll love you till the ocean                   Is folded and hung up to dry                  And the seven stars go squawking                    Like gese about the sky.       ***********************************************************************
