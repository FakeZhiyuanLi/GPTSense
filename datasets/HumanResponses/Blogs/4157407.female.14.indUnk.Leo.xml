Grace and Erin- you better ride the Drop Zone for me :-D    It's late in the evening   She's wondering what clothes to wear   She puts on her make up   And brushes her long, blonde hair   And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"   And I say, "Yes, you look   wonderful   tonight."      We go to a party   And everyone turns to see   This beautiful lady   That's walking around with me   And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"   And I say, "Yes, I feel   wonderful   tonight."      I feel  wonderful  because I see    The  love  light in your eyes   And the wonder of it all   Is that you just don't realize   How much   I love you .         It's time to go home now   And I've got an aching head   So I give her the car keys   She helps me to bed   And then I tell her, as I turn out the light   I say, "My darling, you were   wonderful    tonight.   Oh, my darling, you were   wonderful   tonight."
