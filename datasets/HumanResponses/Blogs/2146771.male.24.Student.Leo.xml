      Not much happened today.  I waited all day to get my wheels and then they didn't fit.  They are for a front wheel drive and my car is rear wheel drive... WONT WORK!  And now they are supposedly sending me Lincoln continental wheels, WHICH IS ALSO REAR WHEEL DRIVE.  Who knows... I just want my old fury back :(  It drove so nice.  I hope I can get it back to the way it was.  Well, now I wait for tires.  I'll update you tomorrow and see what I get!

      Well, it's sunday and I'm not working on the Fury.... But I am excited for the wheels to come tomorrow and see what they look like on the car.  I'll take some before and after pictures.  I forgot to tell you that I tried to move is yesterday after Butch (a friend of my grandpa) adjusted the carburator a little.  But the wheels that are on the car were only held on by two lug nuts and they were to big so one of the wheels fell off :(  Anyway... we had just put those steel wheels on to keep it off the ground.  I'm sitting here thinking about the offset of these new wheels and if they will stick out or not... I really hope not... we'll see tomorrow I guess!

      Today my grandpa went to a friend of his and checked on a transmission for me but he wasn't there.  Then I went to the junk yard and found an old set of temporary wheels.  They are off of a 1995 Chrysler Sebring.  They are chrome 16inch.  They should do for now.  Better than the steel wheels that are on it now.  I got the Sebring set of wheels for $200 with tires.  Later today I went to our mechanic's shop and told him my plans with the car.  He will be doing things such as transmission work.  He says that he knows a guy that can fix my transmission that I have.  I would rather do that since I've already spent money on the transmission I have and know it has good cluches and new parts, just needs the bands worked on.  He also says he has a set of shocks at his shop he was going to put on for me once but I never came over and had them installed.  So, once the wheels get here monday, I'll put them on and show a before and after picture. And I'll take it to get the tranny worked on.

      Ok, this blog is going to be specifically for my car, which is going to be a story in it's own.  I should start off by telling you about were I got the car and it's past...    The first memory I have of the Fury is when I came to visit my grandfather and he took me out to a new car dealership to buy some cars.  (He owns a carlot that I now run that that is a different story)  When we drove this car back to the car lot I was thinking that it was a pretty kewl car.  Now you have to realize that I didn't know the difference between the wheel and the tire back then.  (If you don't know yourself, then you might as well stop reading this 'cause you're not going to enjoy it.)  (Speaking of tires, I have to go air up another one...brb)  Ok two tires done, 2 more to go.   So, back to the story.  So I found out that it had a big motor and that a two door was kewler than a four door so I said, I'll take it!  We had the vinal top replaced and the seat had a little tear so we fixed that too.  Later, after I beat the crap out of the poor car in high school, I got some kewl wheels and tires for it.  That was about 4 years ago and now the top is bad again and the wheels and tires have been stolen.  I have also changed the carburator to a edelbrock 4 barrel instead of the factory 2 barrel.  Currently the transmission is out of commission and I even paid to have it fixed but the guy that worked on it only changed the clutches and things and didn't repair the bands.  I've tried adjusting them but I get nowhere.  Other things that need immediate repair is the radiator and the valve cover gasket seals.  Oh and the tire that are on it, I wouldn't trust them to get me 5 miles to home :(    So, the plan is to get it running and use it as a daily driver.  Did I mention it only has 66,000 miles on it?  I know this 'cause it was a one owner and had around 47,000 miles when I got it.  It was in perfect condition and was traded in by an older couple.  The only accident or dammage the car had was in the parking lot of the dealership they traded it to.  Some one back into them and put a small dent by the tail light.  I'm planning on taking some pictures today so I'll let you know where I'm starting from.  Wish me luck!

      Oh wow, you should see my TOE.  Yes my toe.  I stubbed it this morning before church.  I actually cried... Now you're prolly thinking, what a wimp.  But you gotta see what it looks like before you think that.  I took this picture tonight right before I posted this blog.     Yeah, see, I told you so.  Well, I think I will live, what do you think?  Anyways,  Look, I got a webcam.  And it works, most of the time.  Um... Seriously, if you come to my site, or view my cam, write in my guestbook, or send me an instant message or email, just so I know you've visited. Thanks.  Oh, and I'm sick.  I got it from Gpa, and I hear Lacee and Gma has it too.  Sucky.  Ok, gotta go watch a movie with my wife.  Gangs of New York, we'll see how good it really is.

      Hi, can you tell I've been busy that last week?  I haven't written for a whole week.  So let's start kinda where we left off.  We went to Minnesota with the Curtis's.  We went to the Mall of America that Saturday and then just hung out in Rochester the rest of the weekend at Brooke's Dad's house.  We took a Dodge Caravan instead of the Blazer.  It has room for 7 and it's all wheel drive.  After driving it that weekend we decided to trade it for the Blazer.  The Blazer we were driving has a few problems.  A van has way more room and since it's all wheel drive it will do well on trips in the winter.  It has all the options and the bigger motor.   So, can you tell I'm a car salesman.  I talk more about my car than my trip.  We didn't come back until Monday night 'cause we all took Martin Luther King day off.  Tuesday night we help with Impact so we were there all night doing that.  And Wednesday we have AWANA.  Tonight we went grocery shopping.  Busy, busy, all the time.  Not much else to say.  Business is picking up, but Gpa has been sick.  He went home today right after the auction.  It's ok though, 'cause there wasn't any customers.  Well, now I'm going to send some emails to see if I can get any traffic on this site!!  Oh, and write me a message in my guestbook!

      Hey, just got back from Bible study for Impact and Awana.  Check out our churches website under "PLACES" at ahhyeah.com and see what it's all about.  They were both really good tonight.  Brooke wasn't able to come to Awana 'cause she had to study, and now we're getting back from Bible study so late we're going straight to bed.  Last night we had impact in our new church.  Well same building but remodeled.  It is so kewl.  I'm eating a brownie Brooke made, Mmmm.  This weekend we're going with Brian, Andrea, and Mattathias to MN.  I'll try to keep up with the blog while I'm there and let you know what's up!  Ok, goodnight.

      Great, I missed another day.  Oh well, I'm just going to have to realize that I'm not going to make in on here every day.  You didn't miss much yesterday anyways.  There was just the typical work.  Brooke has classes on Monday nights so I usually get to work on my website those nights.  I did get another fish last night.  It's called a giant graumi or something.  I seriously don't think people that work at pet stores really know what they are talking about.  I tell them what kind of fish I have and they look at me like I'm crazy, 'cause I have fish together that aren't supposed to get along.  But they do.  I can't help it.  I just think someone has told them that they can't be together so they just believe it.  Ok, so now that's off my chest... hee hee.  Ok, I'm going to go 'cause Brooke just got here and we're going to eat lunch :)

      OK, two in one day, makes up for ones I've missed.  We just got home from going out to eat with some people from church.  It was fun.  It's hard to find people to hang out with once you're married.  Especially decent people.  I'll have to say My favorite is still the Curtis family.  But it's kinda cheating to pick them, they're family and they have a cute little boy. Hee hee.    My battery went dead on my video camera tonight at church.  I always forget it doesn't charge when it's on and plugged in.  Oh well, now I've learned.  Now it's back to my website.  I just got done checking out our churches music pastor's website.  www.trentsmithmusic.com  Check it out, I'm going to have to remember to buy his CD.

      Dangit, I've done it again.  I've missed 2 days of my Blog.  I hate when that happens.  Well, Friday I just worked all day.  No customers as usual.  I came home and Brooke and I watched a movie.  Saturday I worked too 'cause Gpa was still out of town.  No promising customers.  After work we went to meet Brian, Andrea, and Mattathias at the mall.  We just wandered around the mall and then went to Fazolis and ate.  We prolly sat there forever after we ate and just talked.  They are going to MN next weekend with us to go to the Mall of America.  They just want to have a weekend away so we're going to Brooke's dad's to stay.  Ok, so today we went to church and I video recorded the service again.  This is my second time.  I'm capturing it right now on my home computer.  Brooke is reading a book for college right now.  Later we're going to church and I'm going to get the service on video again.  Oh, and one quit note, one of my fish died in my home tank :(  it was my black and white molly.  I think one of the kissing fish kissed her top lip off and she couldn't eat anymore, how sad :(  Ok, Not much else to say.  My video is captured so I'd better go edit it.

      Well this day started off great.  After taking my sister to school, we ran out of gas on the interstate.  Sounds like I'm an idiot I know, but not completely.  The gas gauge is broke on our Blazer.  I think it has a bad ground or something.  Anyway, to make a long story short, we sat for about an hour until Steve Green(another car dealer) brought us some gas.  Have you ever sat along the highway for a long period of time?  It sucks.  We initially stopped on the shoulder, still on the blacktop, but the traffic was heavy and I really wanted to be off the road more.  I had tried to start the Blazer before but it wouldn't even sputter.  So I said, "Lord, just give us enough gas to get us further off the shoulder."  So I tried it again and it started.  I didn't have enough time to celebrate I just put it in gear and got over in the snow and grass.  Sweet!  The scariest part of all was after about 15 minutes of sitting in the snow, a camper came by and was way over the white line and would have hit us for sure if we were on the shoulder.  We eventually made it to school and work so it's all good.  The rest of the day was the same as usual.  Corey stopped by for a little bit 'cause he didn't have any work today.  So now I don't know what else to write.  I'm sitting here in my living room with my beautiful  urlLink wife  laying on my shoulder waiting for me to go to bed... so I'd better go.   Goodnight.

      Ok, I finally found this again.  I'm not sure who's ever going to read this... But I'll put this out there for people to read if they really have that much free time :)  I'm not going to go into the past much, just start today and go from there.  Today is a typical day.  Work and AWANA.  I work at a car dealership that my grandfather owns.  Our website is  urlLink www.steenauto.com    I don't keep it updated very well 'cause we sell stuff to fast, but it will give you an idea what we have.  Right now my grandfather is in Oklahoma city at a race called the "Chilli Bowl"  My grandparents go every year for a week or so.  I'm sitting in my apartment right now with my  urlLink wife ( urlLink Brooke ) and  urlLink sister ( urlLink Lacee ).  My sister is staying with us for a week since she lived with my grandparents and it's not kewl being alone for that long.  They are both doing homework.  Last night I got them to watch 3 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation and they actually like it a little.  They even said yes to another episode tonight.  Sweet, so that's where I'm going.  Oh, and I also started lifting weights again.  I got a little depressed when I was wearing out really fast by just playing basketball a little before AWANA.  I used to be able to run 5 miles and never feel that bad.  So I'm going to try to work on that.  Oh, and AWANA is a thing at church we have on Wednesday nights.  I teach some younger kids around 4-6 years old.  Ok, talk to you later.. I'm also going to figure out how to link this to my website... Which is  urlLink www.ahhyeah.com

      The forum is up and running great and I have a whole 3 members.  Of course I am the first, then Brooke.  The only real member is my cousin Brian.  Well, hopefully more will join and this can become a great community for people to share their opinions, beliefs, ideas and experiences.  I sent an email out to you all about adding the forum.  If anyone would like to be added or deleted from the list please let me know.  Also, Brooke's mom is coming this weekend!  She is bringing a couple girls (5 & 7) with her that she is watching for the weekend.  It's the first people we've had stay over besides my sister Lacee.  And the first kids.  It will be fun.  I still haven't gotten those pictures from Brian about the "huge equipment" we moved the other night.  Of course we all lived to tell about it as you can see.  I'll try to post some pictures.  We're going grocery shopping now so I've got to go.  Bye!

      Hello!  I'm so excited!  First I just added a Forum to my website.  Most of you probably know what that is, but for those who don't, it's just a place where you can go and join discussions on a variety of topics.  Right now I only have a couple topics, but I will get more as the site grows.  So just click on the word  FORUM  in the upper left corner and a new window will open with my forum in it.  Then you can browse around or register as a member and start typing!    Also, I went last night to see the movie "The Passion of the Christ" and I really don't know what to say.  I have heard from two people that went with me already today and they both had great experiences at work to share about what Jesus did for them on the cross.  It is already an opportunity to share the Lord.  Yes it was "gory" but I honestly don't think it was "gory" enough.  I can't stand watching those surgery shows and I cringe when people talk about needles and blood, but I just grit my teeth and watched.  I honestly didn't even cry.  I feel that I didn't deserve to focus on my feelings, but to focus on what Jesus did for me.  I was in continuous prayer through the whole movie.  I was first angry at what people did to him, but then I remembered what Jesus said, " I lay down my life for you ."  He did it.  I was reminded of this greatly when, in the movie, Jesus dropped the cross where it was going to finally stand, and then he, himself crawled up on the cross.  Now I know that this is a movie, and is not EXACTLY what happened.  But I now understand that this was voluntary and not something "done to him" by the Jews or Romans.  It was done for us.  I thank the Lord for opening my eyes to what He did and allowing me to accept Him into my heart and life.  I pray you will do the same, whether you watch the movie or not, realize what Jesus did for you to keep you from eternal separation from him in hell, and accept the free ticket to heaven by accepting him as your savior today.

      Goodmorning!  I had to get up early, ON A SATURDAY, to take Brooke to a "Woman of Faith" conference where Beth Moore is speaking.  So now I'm hanging out before I go to work.  Tonight I'm going to my cousin's house (Brian) to help him move a 500 pound UPS.  It's basically a battery system that is used to keep your computer running in case of a power failure.  Although they are usually the size of a microwave or smaller.  This one is HUGE.  I'll take some pictures and post them tomorrow to show you how we got it off, (if we do).  Ok, now when I'm sitting here writing this I wonder who is actually looking at this.  I notice my web statistics show that I've had up to 50 visitors in one day recently.  That's unique visitors, not repeats.  Well, if you read this, send me a message, it's easy, there's a guest book, and a ICQ pager on the bottom of the main page where you can just type and click.  Let me know if you like (or hate) my site!

Well let's see it this one will post :)  I'm headed to work and just thought I'd update you on how things are... normal stuff going on, nothing new.. the weather is warmer so time to start working harder.  No excuses now.  I gotta go though, so I'll write more later.

      Hey, how is  everyone.  Well, I just want to write about a new website that I'm all excited about.   urlLink www.HeLives.com   Go to it, check it out, tell me what you think.  I guy from my church started it and now him and his wife and his mother are running it.  Check out the forums and read about all the people learning the truth about God and His Word.  Talk to you again soon!

      No, I didn't die of infection of my toe :)  I am alive.  Wow, I've been really busy, can you tell, it's been like three weeks since I wrote last.  I'm sorry.  I can really tell that I haven't written in a while 'cause my website traffic has been low.  My own fault of corse.  The first thing I want to write about is the concert I was at on Saturday.  The bands name is "The Trent Smith Band"  You can check out Trent's new CD at  urlLink www.trentsmithmusic.com .  His next concert will be in Ames, Iowa on Febuary 29, 2004 at Campus Baptist Church.  It was really fun because I ran the PowerPoint screen with the lyrics and Brooke ran the stage lights.  It was awesome and I'll be running it again at the concert in Ames.  I love working with Trent, his music is great and he's easy to work with.  I also love working for God.  I'm always waiting for God to show me what to do, but I think that there are just a lot of little things he wants me to do.  I'm not going to list them all, 'cause it's not important to everyone what they are.  It's important to God where my heart is at when I'm doing them.  It's just hard for me to find productive things to do for God when I haven't been to college.  That's why I don't expect one huge thing for me to do, but lots of little ones that need to be done.  Besides the concert, not much is happening.  Business has picked up a little bit.  The Lord provided yesterday when a customer came and paid off a car that I had on payments.  It was exactly what I needed to pay my taxes this year.  Now I don't have to worry about it at all.  I love that God is always thinking about me and preparing things ahead of time when I'm distracted by other things... He is all knowing.

      Well, I just wanted to tell about some doors that have been opened for me in the past week.  The church has come to me and asked to do many new things.  First is the church directory.  Basically I have to build 10 pages on the computer of pictures of people at the church, kinda like a year book at schools.  I've been taking lots of pictures and trying to figure out this program I'm building it on.  It's a lot of fun.  Then when I was in the church office trying to figure out some things for the directory, I was asked to help run the new video camera for the church.  I'll just say it's not a home video camera, this is a serious camera.  When I figure out what model it is I'll post it under the Technology section of the forum.  Well then one of the pastors daughters wants me to video her wedding with it.  And set up her lights.  A few days later the head of sound for the church asked me to come train in the sound room.  I can believe it.  The verse that says, "...He is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope."  That verse has been proven in just a few days and I wouldn't be surprised if there's more to come.  Of course I did pray that God wouldn't give me more than I can handle.  I want to do my best for Him and not be distracted with too many things.  I just want to encourage you that if you've been waiting for God to show you what to do... just wait.  'Cause when it rains, it pours.

      Well for some reason my website is down.  I did go to my providers website and they looked like they upgraded their site, so maybe that had some effect on me.  So, I decided to write on my blog since I can't do anything else :)  We are going to MN this weekend to see Brooke's dad.  My sister(Lacee) is also going with me.  It's supposed to be cold and wet while we're up there.  We've been trying to go for 3 weeks but we've been too busy.  Now we're going to miss my uncle Robert's retirement party.  Worse yet, his mother just died recently and I would like to be there just to cheer him up.  It's hard to balance family when they live so far apart.  And when I have my own business and Brooke is full time in college.  Speaking of which, she'll be in school constantly now until she graduates and then even the summer after that.  This summer she is taking 2 classes at DMACC so she can graduate after 4 years of college.  The one summer class after graduation is actually an internship not a class.  I'm planning on starting next fall at DMACC.  Ok, I'm going to see if ahhyeah.com is back online.  Sorry to all who tried to get on and were unsuccessful.

      I've been working on the forum a lot lately.  Last night I added a bunch of new smilies.  It took forever.  I was worth it not only for the smilies, but now I know I can modify my forum to the way I want it.  Next I'm adding a calendar and voting polls.  Last night we went to "The Big Steer"  Mmmm, it's supposed to be a steak house but we got onion rings and fish :)  I get the left over for lunch today.  Should be better than the peanut butter and jelly from yesterday.  It's raining and raining.  We actually had flood warnings yesterday.  I can't wait until it gets warmer so I can start working on my fish pond again.  Last year I was at the pet store and they had a grocery cart full of water plants.  I asked how much the whole cart would be and they gave me like 75% off with a managers discount of like 10% so the whole cart was around 15$ when the plants themselves are around $5 a piece.  So my pond will be a swamp with so many plants... I have a sweet plan drawn up of how I'm going to do it.  I'll show some pics of before and after later on this summer.  Speaking of pictures, here's some pictures of me and Brian unloading that HUGH power supply.

      Mmmmm, I just got done eating breakfast...scrambled eggs with salsa! Mmmmm.  Well, I just thought I'd let everyone know that I'm planning on starting school this fall.  I wanted to start this spring but it just didn't work out.  Business is just starting to pick up again.  It is so up and down all the time.  The kewl thing is that God always provides so I don't have to worry.  Sunday we did another concert with Trent.  The church we were at was built for great sound but it was making everything so loud.  Everyone had to hold back so it wasn't as good as the first concert.  They also had 45min compared to 75min last time.  It still went really well.  Again, if you want to check out his music just go to  urlLink www.trentsmithmusic.com   Ok, time for work soon, gotta go.

      Well, it's been a while since I last wrote so you can probably tell we've been busy.  Brooke is finally done with Grandview College for a while, but she is still going to DMACC for another week.  Then June 1st she starts summer classes at DMACC.  We went to MN last weekend for 4 days.  We went to see her dad play in a pool tournament in Rochester.  My cousin Corey was in MN working with my dad so we hung out with him.  And Devin, Brooke's sister, came down for the weekend too.  Brooke's dad took us to a shooting range.  I shot a .22, .357, and a 9mm.  All hand guns.  It was fun and we got to keep our targets.  We also went to a big church in the cities.  The pastor was John Piper, a famous pastor and author.  We stayed in the twin cities with her mom Thursday night and came up to eat lunch with her after church Sunday.  We also got bikes!  I bought one at target and she got her mom's old one.  We haven't got to go yet, but we're going to try this weekend, weather permitting.  Business is slow again, but it's always up and down.  Other than that I've been REALLY busy with stuff at church.  Sound, making videos of services, creating a video presentation for a girl going to Israel, working on new software that uses moving back grounds for our music lyrics on the screen during worship, wedding videos, and.... Obviously not my website.  Sorry about that, we need to get some more topics going on the forum.  Hopefully I'll get some more time here soon to add some new funnies and stories.  Don't forget you can add your own stuff too!

Actually enough to pay our taxes even!  We have some busy months ahead of us with 3-4 weddings, the church directory, Brooke is doing finals now and then she'll start the summer semester.  We're coming to MN the weekend of the 24th of April.  Anyone want to hook up let us know!  Our numbers are under the contact section.  Hope to hear from you!

      Wow, 6 tornados last night, and more expected tonight.  I'm going to bring my camera just in case.  We are now driving the Avalanche again.  I figured I'm loosing money on it anyways so driving it ang putting miles on it won't hurt much.  Besides, now it has full coverage and we are driving what we are paying for.  I start school in one week.  Not nervous yet... but I gotta get signed up for classes still.  We're looking for a new job for me so Gpa can sell the business and I can go to school.  It's a long story but I'll let you know how it goes.  We are headed to Brian and Andreas so I will write more there maybe.  There's lots more to update you on...

      Well, you may be seeing more blogs and more of me writing on the forum in the next few days.  I had to take my new laptop in to get repaired.  Basically I think I shorted it out from static.  Not sure though.  I was hooking up a projector to my VGA port and my computer just shutdown.  When you turn it on only the power and fans come on.  No screen.  No hard drive light.  So, they hooked up my hard drive to their system and they can access it.  So tomorrow I'm bringing in my one day old external hard drive to copy all the info on if they format my drive.  They have to send it straight to Toshiba and it will take 7-14 days.  I'm really bummed.  I'm just going to have to video tape services with tapes...  and have a lot of catching up to do once I get the laptop back.  The biggest thing is the church directory is on my laptop.  And... I have to figure out how to get it finished using my home PC... Good thing I have a EMachine!!!  Ok, that's enough for now.  I'm going to bed... rough day.

      Hello.  Church got canceled today.  I feel kinda weird getting up and having nothing to do today.  Church got canceled because there was a sewage backup in the basement.  :(  I shouldn't say we're doing nothing today.  We got up and got ready and read our book we're reading called "The purpose driven life".  It is really good.  Brooke is also reading a book called "In The presence of My Enemies".  It's about the missionarys that got captured in the philipines by terrorists.  I'm also editing a video from Impact last week.  It's hilarious 'cause we were messing with the sound effects processor after the meeting.  It can change your voice and add echo and all kinds of other kewl stuff.  I guess we have two machines that do that.  I'm going to have to learn what they do so we can use them better.  I got a new external hard drive last night.  160GB.  I need it to copy videos onto to edit them.  I can do small 1-2 hour services with what I had but now I'm going to do weddings and I have like 6 tapes with 1-2 hours of video each and my hard drive wasn't big enough.  I felt really stupid when buying it 'cause the asked if we wanted the 2 year warranty and I said no.  But then I thought about it and changed my mind in the car.  I came back in but they were closing and I had to wait for another person to leave so I could sneak back in.  But now if anything happens to it in the next 2 years I can take it back for a new one.  Anything... I can drop it in my pond and it's no problem!!! :)  Here's a picture of it.     So far it's working great.  I transfered all my videos and files of my old external hard drive. (which seems to corrupt files every once in a while randomly)  Ok... so now Brian and Andrea are coming over and we are going to saylorville lake for a picnic.  Maybe I will take some pics!!  Bye!

      Well the first thing I want to say is SWEET to the new blogger.com website.  It is designed so clean and sweet.  Next I was just going to say what we did today.  Basically after the wedding yesterday (which went great) we went to My aunt's house (Brian's Mom) and ate dinner and played some games.  We were going to go bike riding but the weather got bad.  Today we were pretty busy with church.  After church we went to a restaurant called Ryan's which is a buffet.  Like you walk in and work like an assembly line to get your food.  Kinda demeaning.  But the food was good, and it was packed because it's Sunday and Mothers day.  After that we went and saw Nick's new townhouse which is pretty kewl but would be kewler if they were really the $520 a month they advertise.  Anyway, Brian, Andrea and Mattathias came over and we hung out till church.  Brian and I worked in the sound room and we learned a lot.  I learned a lot more by doing a "sound check" with Lucas tonight after the service, setting up for Impact on Tuesday.  We messed with the new program we might get for the church.  It worked AWESOME.  With this program we can use moving backgrounds for our lyrics on the screens, or LIVE CAMERA VIDEO.  So the band can be behind the words.  Chris is going to be there to see how it goes.  Ok, so that's about it.  In the morning I have a meeting with DMACC college to show my "portfolio" and see what they think about be getting into the commercial arts program.  That's all I have for now.  Bye!

      Goodmorning... I didn't have time to write last night because I was doing some repairs on my website.  I'm adding a quick links section on my intro page.  I'm also going to be reworking my homepage so it fits well on all computers.  I went to DMACC yesterday to talk to an advisory and seem to have gotten no where.  I have to take a placement test, which I expected and totally understand.  But I just don't understand what each degree has to offer and where they fit with what I want to do.  I have to set up individual appointments with two degree heads to figure it out...  Speaking of college Brooke's last final of the semester is today.  Then she will finally be off for about 3 weeks.  We are planning on going with my grandparents on Memorial Day to Wisconsin for some graduations and just time off.  Tonight is the Friends Finale!!!  We will be watching that and then I'm prolly going to be working on a powerpoint for a wedding.  Tomorrow we're going to run a practice video taping of the wedding at their rehearsal.  This weekend I think we're going with Brian and Andrea to both of their parents.  Oh, and of course we have the wedding Saturday to video tape...  Ok, so I'm off to mess with my website and then to work... Bye bye!

      Ok, Wow I am awake!  I slept for 12 hours last night.  Is that crazy or what?  Brooke was studying for her last final this semester and fell asleep reading.  I came over to wake her up but ended up falling asleep too... at 7PM.  I didn't wake up till 7AM this morning.  That's weird when you usually only sleep 8 hours or less.  I had my usual this morning, and egg with soft yolk and toast.  Mmmmm....  Brooke came to work with me till 1PM and we've been working up a storm.  First we worked on a website we created for my aunt.  She is selling her house.  It's called  urlLink  .  We added all the details and Brooke added the title and background.  Then we had to extract some audio off of a video we taped from the church.  I had to download like 3 programs and a decoder to get it to work but now I have an Audio CD of the service.  I have a list of about 20 other things I have to do so I'd better get to work.  Tonight we are setting up lights for the pastor's daughter's wedding like we did ours.  Oh, and tomorrow I have a meeting at DMACC with an advisor about starting school this fall!!!

      Kewl! My wife is so smart. Thank you Brooke for writing for me. It shows you how busy I am lately. You can also probably tell by the website. I need to spend some "quality time" with it. Brooke is making french toast this morning and I'm getting ready for school. I think we are going to a graphic design "place" to day for my class. I can't remember the name but the guy does some sweet work. Well I'm done eating my french toast and it was excellent as usual. I have to go now. I'm going to try to keep this updated again.&nbsp;I'm so busy and it never works :(

      Hey look what I found out how to do!!! Hi everyone....I'm Brooke (Doug's wife). I don't think my husband has written in a while, he has been really busy with school, work and church stuff. So, I thought I would write for him! Well, we just got back from spending the week-end at my dad's house in Minnesota. Brain, Andrea and Mattathias went with us. (that is Doug's cousin, his wife and their one year old son) Anyway, we left on Friday around 2:00pm or so. On Saturday we went tubing and canoeing down the Cannon River. It was really fun we had a group of about 20 of us. I tubed, but Doug, Andria, Brian and Mattathias canoed. I must say the water was slightly chilly. But overall the day turned out to be perfect for going down the river. Another answered prayer!! Then later that night we went to Doug's dad's house and road four-wheelers. It was really fun, they had a great trail. I love sitting on the back of a four-wheeler and hanging on while my husband gets us up and down hills and through rivers. I just get to sit there and enjoy nature and all that God created...until it gets really scary (like through the river and then up a really steep, muddy hill) then I just hang on and pray. After that we went to fireworks in Mazeppa. They were awesome for such a small town, they were better than the ones we saw in Iowa! Well, we headed back to Iowa Sunday afternoon after going to church. The church we go to in Iowa has about 700 people, the church we went to in Minnesota had about 25 people. It was a lot different, but it was a great church. The pastor is the father of Doug's friend from high school (Katie). Anyway, it was a good change from our big church and the pastor had a great message and preached the Truth. Praise the Lord for even His small churchs who are spreading the good news about salvation and who are learning about God and His Word in a Biblical and accurate way. Besides that it's just another week of school and work for both of us. Though in five days (or six depending on how you count) we will have our one year anniversary.....how exciting!!! I love you hunny and I can't believe it has been a year. I think that we will be going to the Omaha Zoo and then probably eating dinner, we have to eat the top of our cake!! Well, I'm sure Doug will write and let you know what we did!!    ps. Doug, thank you for being a wonderful husband so far and I know that you will continue to be the wonderful husband that God has made you. I pray that you will continue to be a Godly influence and leader in our household.

      Man... My website is messed up again... My boycott france link is gone... wonder what I did with it.  Well, we're heading to Minnesota today.  We're planning on going tubing but it's rained all night and this morning.  My cousin Brian and his family are going with us.  We're going to leave around 5:00PM.  I have so many things to do and no time to do them.  I'm going crazy!  And since I'm leaving this weekend I am missing a bunch of stuff at church.  I'm kinda worried about the sound room too 'cause the guys that were supposed to do it forgot they were this weekend and were planning on going camping... so they kinda weren't prepared.  I tried to show them as much as I could wednesday night at practice.  I can't wait until someday I'm full time at a church somewhere and my job and school won't get in the way.  Ok, I need to get ready to go to work.  I might write more later or during this weekend.
