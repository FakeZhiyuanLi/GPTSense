      Alright, I've moved everything from my old room across the hall to my new room...and  I already feng shui'd it...so I'm feeling great. lol :) ha!   And just for good measure I put two wine bottles in my window to help activate my love and relationships corner. lol.  Later tonight my roommates might be going to lady's night at the stripclub. I might just go along. ; ) Some choices are just so hard to make.  Pay $5 and see naked guys  or stay home. Hmm. Oh yeah I'm going. lol.

      I'm in the middle of my Computers in Education exam...apparently the blackboard site our  urlLink university  uses isn't up to running tonight, so we are slowly taking our final as the prof can print them off.   In the meantime, my friend Becky is still taking her T/F test next to me..so  I am carefully sneaking away the cookies  that we grabbed from our awesome buffet dinner at Fresh Food. .... cookie   cookie    cookie!...

      In the midst of my crazy stressed out geography condition, I managed to find myself having a cozy talkative subway dinner with my friend E. Oooh. I went with my all time subway standby: the subway melt with provolone, lettuce, cucumber, honey mustard,  and of course extra bacon .    After having a gabfest, I protested coming over to his place for a back massage. But moments after I was home, I saw the error of my ways and thought  "hey, that back massage may really help my geography project".  And so here I am, still working on the damned geography project. The victory, however small it might be, is mine.

           So needless to say I'm still working on that  Geography project  that was due yesterday. I'm seriously sick over it. If it was English I could look at all the information and churn it out in a day; but with Geography somehow I can't do that. And I keep second guessing myself. If only I could just finish up this damn project, I could  urlLink relax  since this was supposed to be my easy day for finals. All that's left is my computers in ed class, as of yet I'm still not sure just what the test will be like and its not posted yet on blackboard.        Here I sit in the computer lab trying to cool down because it's too hot to do anything in my room and I  just keep stressing out . Lucky for me I only had to sit and spread my stuff out at three different computers til I found one that was connected to the printer. ack! Atleast I got some money from the book buy-back.  And I'm being a rebel for having pop and chips on full display in the lab. mwuhahaha. I hope they don't kick me out because I just  love sitting underneath this flickering overhead flourescent light.             I'm just waiting for the moment when I can purposefully spread out over my bed and cover myself up with the cold sheet. Wait, that can't ever happen, my room's far too hot to ever allow for  such a luxury as a cold sheet.

      There's this place on campus...it sells  urlLink the yummiest, freshest bagels this side of campus.  lol. (A far walk from my apartment).  I finally broke down and bought my favorite bagel  combination today. A whole 23 days into the semester. Ahh well...I'll burn it off in dance class tonight. Anyways, I highly recommend you try the  everything bagel with honey almond cream cheese . The  cinnamon sugar bagel  is yummy too, but really messy and then after you eat it, everything gets covered in cinnamon sugary-bits too. Third on the list would be the  chocolate chip bagel  though it too is messy..and the chocolate doesn't look good smudged in the  crevasses  of your hands. Well, I'm off to eat my still warm, freshly baked bagel...and to read a psychology article on cognition and language, ethnicity, or gender..print it out..and then write a one page article review that is due at 6. Whew look at me,  I'm a real party animal.  *Hunched over a table in the computer lab that is.

      Yesterday began the first week of going to dance classes again. I don't know why I was so nervous, after all *if you've read before* I somehow went from invisible dancing nobody to part of a trio for the recital. Now my ballsy-ness was gone, totally gone, I swear I couldn't find it. So, chicken-shit me, lol, I spend the whole day at class and at the lab, debating whether or not I even wanted to go. (The first week is mainly going to the classes, meeting the student choreographer(s) and seeing whether you can do/or like each dance.)    First up I tried to take an advanced jazz class, yes I knew it was already a little out of my means, but I still wanted to try anyway. I was the only person there that hadn't been dancing since the age of 3. *Damn rich kids*...anyway they then proceeded to have a try-out of sorts with 40-60 girls lined up into four lines and then given directions very quickly.  "Pomerey, pomeray, double pirouette. Pomerey, pomerey, double pirouette."  I could do the pomeray's and that was it. Then the next batch went like this "ball-change, step, leap, leap, leap while arching your back as far as you could go, and emotionally throwing out your left arm."  I got so nervous that I kept forgetting what the hell I was doing with my legs that I used the wrong leg everytime. Did I mention the choreographer girls were watching the whole time, along with the whole group of dancers. After this, they wanted step ball-change side leap (toe touch) and then repeat. Um, there was no way I could possibly do this,  so I tucked tail and went downstairs to the beg/intermediate jazz dance . Good thing all my friends from dance were there because I was really flustered.  Next was the Britney Spears "Toxic" advanced jazz dance, (sidenote, I didn't want to do another britney dance at first since I'm going to my friends "Me Against the Music" advanced jazz dance.)  My trio partner was in it with me, I think it's going to be awesome...but Ashley for some reason was having issues with her long legs. lol.  Today I'm going to see how the beg/int jazz dance goes, it's supposed to be taught informally, the song is Alicia Keyes's "Heartburn". (Keyes's is right, I just learned it in my grammar class.)  But I'm really excited about thursday, there are a few dances I want to go to. There's one more on wednesday, but I don't really know about that one yet. After all, joing dance troupe is just for fun for me, a way to get out and get away from the piles of homework that I have.

      Okay, so after booking it across campus,I I proceed to sit down at the  computer lab in Manitou . I had to print off all of the chapter questions for our the weekly quizzes in my  Physical Geography  class. I printed those off, and had to  print off the   powerpoint lectures . I try to conserve paper but there are alot of  maps and illustrations  that have to be printed off on a single page in order to read what is on them.   Mid-way through de-backgrounding the lecture #2's powerpoint, a dude comes by and said "Does this belong to you?" I thought he was just being nice and handing me my printouts. No! Boy was I wrong! He  proceeded to accost me for printing out powerpoints on single pages of paper. "You need to try to print out powerpoints on handouts with two or three handouts on them. Otherwise you will lose your printing privileges."    :0 !!! What is this?!  and on top of that,  he threw all of my chapter question printouts into the trash!    What a complete jerk!   ARRRRRGGGHHH!!! Really, I'm not in the mood to stay at Manitou to print off all the powerpoints that I can on single pages. I really do have a life!   Geez! em>

      Okay, now I know that I've come to a point in my life where I can separate dating from a steady relationship. But what do you do when the guy that you're dating  start throwing curve-balls  at you? I have no idea, and that  was truly the whole point of today's blog.  Not very commanding is it?

      The most miraculous thing happened to me this week. A week-long practice for the dance troupe recital had begun monday, after the first day of practice had been cancelled the day before.   We practiced our openers, the different dances went up in front of everyone to show what they had worked on during the whole semester. Our dance came up in the show order...my group went up to meet in the middle of the floor, only to be greeted by two members of the e-board who felt that we needed to cancell our dance's show. I was bummed, we all were, but then I became outraged. Four out of the seven in our dance wanted to cancel our show...I and two others  wanted the show to go on.    I convinced the others two girls that we should be bold and continue on with the show...if the others didn't want to...that was fine, but I was going on with the show. That was monday night, by tuesday we had chosen our song. We had atleast two-thirds of the steps written down...and we were still pretty confident. Wednesday we were told we had to perform in front of the others...eek. It went well...we had changed up some of our moves. The outcome was that atleast we were still being ballsy, still going on with it. Thursday was our dress rehearsal, and our first practice at the auditorium, on the stage...and without music for a whole day...we had worked out all of our dance steps. And we were nervous as hell.   Friday, (yesterday), was the first night of the show...boy were we nervous. Atleast it all went well...there weren't really any flub-ups. Tonight, the best and final night of the show, we went out there and kicked ass. Everyone loved it, they all thought it was cute, and most importantly as Ashley's mother had noted "we did a a great job, not to mention having to get it done in three days." Way to go Ashley's mom. lol. I guess everyone loved us tap-dancing to The Beatles'  Help!  wearing some really loud, crazy shirts and long swinging scarves. Ha! How great was that! Totally awesomely great! That's what!  So now we're pooped, tired, and ready to learn more dances. But hey, when's the next time that dance troupe is going to have two rookie tap dancers (that didn't really know much about the dancing at all) and one several semester girl, up there on stage dancing as a trio and putting it all together in only 3 days before the show. You gotta give props for that.   Whew...well, going on with the show totally fulfilled my new year's resolution to  "be more brave, be more bold".  I totally beat that resolution down in less than two weeks into the new year. Rock on!

      I would like to confess that I still have a raging crush on the singer Robbie Williams. I don't know why or how this even started, all I know is that this crush developed soon after my seeing my first Bond movie... and since then I've been hooked on Sean Connery c. 1960's, guys with really atrocious sean connery accents, and short, slightly hairy guys who seem angry that they are short in the first place . I don't quite know how this will begin to help my single situation although to be quite honest...I don't think it could hurt. :)

      I don't think that I should talk to people anymore. Even the most innocent and ordinary of situations get slow mo-ed and critically analyzed by my ever exhausted brain.  Anyways, on the up-side, I did get my History test and paper back and got 86% on them both, which is so completely awesome.  But regardless of this wonderful academic quality that I have, I still don't think that I should talk to any more people.   I've found that  I get loud and obnoxious when I'm flirting, and this happens unconsciously, as though the person the flirtation is directed act is going to understand this verbal act at all . Ugh!  And it's too bad that I've got this funny thing going on too... here let me impress you with my funny joke making skills . Ok, so I'm wondering, where are the awesome single guys at?  I soo hope I get kissed on the day that I turn 23. That would be soo very awesome. ...Ok I'm done ranting for now.

      *Here's my discussion board posting on global warming for my GPY 100 Physical Geography class:  After reading the article about how increases in CO2 levels actually broaden the range of forest species limits on land-area livelihood, I have to explore one question. If tree species can survive and thrive in southern latitudes do to this global warming, can agricultural crops survive in these lower latitudes as well? The reduced risk of frost and enhanced climate conditions may well provide a greater diversity of crops in cultivated areas, allowing for even higher production of agriculture. Unlike the genetically refined vegetables and fruits that we find in the supermarket today, these newly developing species may have even higher benefits.  These new crops may help fight diseased crops or increase the growing season. The potential for greater medical exploration would be increased greatly as well.    If CO2 gives rise to an enhanced riched of earth's forests, couldn't CO2 be considered a good pollutant?

      So  I must say, that rocking it single on Valentine's day was soo worth the anticipation!!!!   My Mom came for a visit. We went to eat and I had an amazing steak and grilled chicken breast dinner. Mmmm. plus a salad. plus a cup of chili..and plus a giant friend taco shell apple dessert mmmm!. I ate for two hours straight! It was soo awesome! I love to eat food! *I don't really know how I ate for two hours though.  Let's see what else did we do...went to hobby lobby so I can get to work on some awesome graduation and mother's day presents and bought a few feeder goldfish..only wanted two but the clerk made me buy ten. I figured that paying a dollarto buy a few fish to watch to help reduce stress was well worth it.  I've decided to call them   The Ten Elvises  . Have A Great Day After Valentine's Day Too! And I'll keep rocking it single. Whuhoo.

      Feminine Autobiography Amy Westrick  There was this French-Victorian, nymph  standing without power. She was shaken,  Shivering and scared. Her heart lines  had been torn wide-open winding in pools  and cascading down toward the drain  Her eyes turn to face the mirror Watching herself look out  the window towards downtown.   Sprite, belong to the truth  And you will no longer  Hear the deafening sounds of  Hot lusty silence and a mind  Lost in the spinning of its gears.  Hail the mighty rabbit,   Who consecrates herself to  Her most recent devotion. The sweet cold mystery,  Piercing and yet calming like rain. Seduces the harsh and irresistible As she goes about setting up Her fortress in the plain.  Her mother condemns this Vindictive acid-washed tearful pain.  Charming the snake mascara To slide beautifully down her face To reside for a moment on her chin And drip, down to the drain.   Now, Heart lines sew yourselves back up. Stop you’re blubbering. Stop this constant drain of these Half-hearted emotions, Because the fantasy wasn’t real. And the nightmare was only a dream.  That lost lonely girl inside her  has suddenly grown stronger. She can force those fake tears no longer. And she stands looking in that mirror Seeing her youth looking  As vibrant and lively as ever. With two glossy pouted lips  And a brush-full of blusher.   This is what I sent in for the women's center journal. Hopefully they will like it and put it in. :) Keep your fingers crossed.  Now that I've been volunteering there, I really like it. The women are very supportive and you feel yourself trying to support others too. Check out their website.

      I think that I am going through my quarter-life crisis. I thought it was supposed to happen around 25, when you are changing careers from being a professional student to a successful professional, or hopefully in my case changing to a successful high school teacher.  Instead I am 23, newly 23, with more on my plate than I'd like to imagine.  Why is it that when you are five, no one cares if you would like to color, but when you are 23 suddenly wanting to color isn't considered to be such a good career choice and more than likely it will soon be considered a character flaw.  I don't think that I can grow up. Honestly I want to dance around the room and play dorky music all day. But there's no one around to play. Everyone is too busy with assignments, papers, children, and real-life.  Maybe I'm just tired of staying here at the same school for soooo long. Maybe I feel like I am stagnating. Maybe if I wasn't an only child I wouldn't have such an imagination that I would have gotten past this growing up thing a long time ago.  More than likely I'm just sitting here thinking "C'mon let's go, let something happen." I am tired of the same-old same-old, but everytime that happens life comes up, smacks me upside the head, and I realize the silly nature of what I had just said. If I wasn't so mature, maybe I'd let myself color everyday. *  *Is it a bad thing that I own a nearly brand-spanking-new carton of crayons with an additional pack of 8 space crayons? lol.

        PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate  and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.      urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS!

        	Hey so I would like to let you know how totally sixth-grade-science nerdy I am.  I wore my frog shirt for good luck today and like billions of people saw me wearing my stellar frog tshirt. I mean, after all, who could pull of wearing such an exotic number besides me? No one, I tell you. And I've just realized how ultra-cool I really am. I've got multi-colored frogs all over my boobies.   It's official, the rainforest frogs are now the amphibian protectors of my boobies.  Ha! lol.  Oh yeah! And I almost forgot to mention that I aced my physical geography exam! Whuhoo! Go lucky frog shirt. I'm really gonna be reeling in the cute smart boys now.  And Eric,  I saw an Alaskan, an Eskimoan, or possibly a Pacific Islander today who, dare I say it, rivals your cuteness.  He had an accent too. Oooh.  Now only if Sean Connery/James Bond would be a Pacific Islander.... Ooh then my fantasies really would come true. I'm coming Mr. Bond. Ha! I'm such a major dork. :)

        	Isn't it weird how one year of college ranks differently compared to another year of college? Especially when you're at the center of your own college experienced year? For some reason I think I was more fun two years ago. Back then my roommates were protecting me from "the celery stalker". lol.  	 	I think I was a lot more entertaining when I was dating different people. There was one semester where I rebelled from a relationship by dating and "hanging out" with like 5 different people..not counting ones at home. I was so thrilling then. I was soo entertaining. Now I hang out with my textbooks and my computer.  Neither gives me the satisfaction I so deserve.

         I apologize to mattproject and to everyone else who may read my blog because I have not written a decent post	since this past monday. I should point out however that my last post was made only five days ago and this has been a very very busy and hectic week. All of my papers were due, rewrites spontaneously due and two finals had to be studied for and taken.  I think that people forget what it was like to be in college during the week before exams. It's easy to forget the spazzing that goes on during the struggle to refresh and relearn everything that was covered in each of your classes, especially when you want to get an A.  So I'm sorry, but for right now I have to get back to finishing a grammar analysis essay and a 5 page reflection paper that were both due on thursday and the first paper was due a week ago this last tuesday.

          BEAUTIFUL ICE PRINCESS/PRINCE .You need distance between you and your partner in your relationship. You are very difficult to get. You have big requirements and this one you love must try hard to get you. But after she/he melt your heart she/he will be the most happy person in the world. You need someone who shoes you that you are special  and it makes you feel good to see that you are loved. She/He shall know that you could easily get another girl/boyfriend but you wont  as long as you love him.  when she/he hurts you you will hurt him too, but in general you dont get hurt. If your partner cheated you ,you would react cold and immediately (try to) forget him    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS!

             Something odd has happened.  I used to know how to talk with guys outside of class. Now it seems that I have lost all conversation ability.   For example:  I went to history class, went to geography class, and then was walking home.  I made it all the way across campus and was on the home stretch across the parking lot towards home. I hear my name; it was the freshman dude from history.  (The one I walk with every Tuesday and Thursday to my next class). He says that he had been trying to catch up with me for a bit. (I tend to walk fast everywhere I go.)  So we walk across the parking lot...to my apt. He had said that he had wanted to see my bead thing that I had been telling him about.   ?   So I go upstairs and can't find it. I go back downstairs and say "I can't find it, it's piled somewhere in my totes that I have for moving".  He's like "oh, you're moving? I can help."     Um....? I say, "No I move in a couple weeks, but thank you. :)"  So then he said that he has nothing to do all night, no work, no school stuff. He asked what I wanted to do. Well, he already knew that I'm way busy all week with school projects and papers...but I say hey lets go play video games or pool. So we walk back to campus and play videogames and pool for like 2 1/2 hrs.  I couldn't pick up on any signals...one would be like a friend and the next would be in each others spaces. If you have been single you'll know what that means.  He kept asking about what I wanted for dinner. I was all like...is this hanging out or not? I don't have any money, so I'm not going to say hey yeah good idea and then not eat..or something.   So we walk back to his car...and i have him drive me home...I don't know...some way to waste time and prolong the decision making process. I said that I have grammar to work on tonight...he already knew about the 6 big papers/projects that I have to do.   I don't know. It's been along time since I've been part of a couple. So even mini conversations that could be geared toward liking someone are really really difficult for me. I hate how non-light-hearted I've become. But seriously, how many guys do you know want to hang out? Not too many. I mean everyone's busy with their own time..work..school..that I just don't get the friend thing. In my mind, if there's absolutely zero chance of liking a guy...he's not even on my friend radar...but if he's likable in that way...then it's a possibility to go directly toward liking.  Ugh, I need to revamp my little chit-chat skills. Ugh. If you understand what this post means please write a comment. The last two hours were confusing enough; I have no idea what the answers are to my questions.

        	The presentation was lovely. Additionally, I was able to walk a 35 minute distance in only 13 minutes hands down! I arrived 13 minutes late but was still allowed into the dinner. I sat at a table with two other girls and one hunky guy. :) I sat across from the hunky guy, but of course. lol.  We were taught how to eat Continental Style. Fork in left hand, upside-down and using the knife to push rice onto the upside-down tines of the fork. It was interesting to say the least.  The first course was a nice salad. The second course was a hearty vegetable soup, Main course was Chicken Cordon Bleu, and finally a lovely light mousse for dessert. Since there were many extra desserts, my tablemates and I opted for a second round. :)  What a lovely event that was! And it was only put on for senior humanities students. I'm glad that I decided to go single. Most everyone at the dinner was single as well.  Hence, my seating arrangement. My back was to the rest of the room and so everytime the speaker spoke I had to twist gracefully around.  And naturally the hunky guy had to look past me while she spoke as well. :) Sneaky and  I did some light flirting since that's what one must do when the guy at the table is a hunky italian and the other girls are way way less cuter than you. :)

        	Well, boy do I feel stupid. I woke up this morning at 6:13am and fought with myself to get out of bed around 6:35, stumbled downstairs and made myself a  bowl of corn flakes and soy milk .  I hopped into the shower,  scrub scrub scrub wash wash wash  got out and had only 15 minutes to do my hair, put on my makeup, and get dressed. I thought that I was looking pretty snappy. I walked my little butt across campus to Padnos to sign in at 7:50 somewhere on the second floor. I walk around clop clop clopping in my cute changing color mood tongued brown shoes. I decided to walk into the classroom that I had been assigned to through an email message.  Talk to the older gentleman in the front only to find that he was indeed a professor and I had just walked into his discussion lecture. So after walking around the rest of the second floor, I went up to the third floor. No one was there, but I did see a sign posted that caught my eye.  SSD (Student Scholarship Day) is on April 7th. I looked at my watch only to find that today is indeed April 6th. One month after I turned 23 I go and do something stupid. I knew that I had something to do on wednesday but for the past week I couldn't remember what it was.  So now I am home in snazzy clothes. I called my Grandma so she could laugh at me. :) And I left a message for my Aunt at work so that she could laugh as well.  I can't believe that I totally screwed over any chance I had at sleeping in this week. Oh man do I suck.  At least I have two things to write up for gpy 100. One's an extra credit lab and the other is a movie write up to prove that we were in class when the professor was not.  Then I have a grammar presentation today...good thing I asked for an extension on grammar analysis #4 or I'd be way on my way to stay in bed for the whole day, hoping that I wouldn't have to grow up.  At 6 I'm going to a free four course dinner, which is put on by the school. It's purpose is to simulate a lunch interview and I'm assuming that I will learn about etiquette and which fork is for use with what dining item. :)  Still trying to find someone to go with though, preferably someone with a car, since it is supposed to rain today and walking up to the alumni center is a 35-40 minute walk at least.

        	Today was interesting enough. After all it's not everyday that you see someone carrying around a stock-pot sized glass jar with condensation inside of it.  To my chagrin each and every person that I passed yesterday had to look at what exactly it was that I was carrying. Even by the clock tower one guy trying to collect donations goes  "Hey. Cool. A terrarium!"  Boy I felt like a huge dork/nerd/nerd. lol. And then he says do you have any money to make a donation. Um no? I'm carrying a 15 lb. glass jar/terrarium, my arms  can't hold it anymore, and no one asks if I need help.   So I continued to walk my way across campus, it only took 20 minutes. Which is great timing when carrying such a bulky item.  I sat it on the desk, took tons of notes on roman civilization and made the guy in my class walk with me to our next class. So that I wouldn't look dumb carrying the damn thing around any more. We walked over the bridge and made it to class. Not once did I drop the glass lid, it did not break into shards.  Nor did one guy ever ask if I needed help or asked if he could carry it. I need to ask  where is the chivalry? Where is the common courtesy? People nowadays are soo ignorant.  Weren't they taught any manners?  Apparently that answer is no.  So I gave my presentation in my gpy 353 class. Got interupted by random incoming students, couldn't show the web page that I had created (because the prof decided that we were going to sit in a circle), and she interrupted me and cut me off. She used up the last two minutes of my presentaion time and then her timer goes off and she goes "thank you Amy that was very good. Now everyone clap for Amy." Ugh. Atleast she wanted to look at my terrarium. I had like tons of awesome creative ideas for a high school geography lesson unit.    And then I got to walk home by myself carrying the extremely heavy glass terrarium. I really do hate ignorant West Michigan people, with a passion.

      Well, I think that the interview went well.  However there was only one guy there and all the interviewees were female. Soo I figured I'm charming anyhow. lol. eh? :)  We wont hear anything until the beginning of may. Either way we get a letter in the mail, although the good letter will have a packet with it and will obviously be much less thinner. And I can resist posting here: Don't want no thin packages here! ahahahahahhaahaha I'm so funny!   Back to work, back to work. My GPY 353 presentation is at 430. I have class at 3...so I have 2 hrs and 40 mins to finish my presentation or at least get it together. So T minus 2hrs and 40 mins, take away an hour between 1 and 2 for soaps...and I think I'll get it together. I just have too!  *and thank you for your good wishes! :)  mwah .

The school is hiring for placement in the fall for the writing center. I want this soo bad. It would be an awesome thing for my resume and awesome experience for teaching editing.  I made the appointment at the same time as two guys, so hopefully they'll be wooed by my  charming feminine wiles.  eh? lol.   So send me all of your positive thoughts at eleven...I really want them to say they love me and that I'm a great writer. lol. I mean, c'mon being compared to some guys...I should win hands down! :)

      What a beautiful day for doing laundry! There's no snow on the ground to impede the two minute trip to the coin-op and alternatively there's no chance I can simply slide my heavy laundry basket over the ice and snow. However, I can use my new bag for laundry and let me tell you, I'm styling.   Nobody does there laundry at 8 am on a sunday. It's peaceful, meloncholy, to have my choice of twelve washers and dryers. Happy laundrying!

      I am three days wiser than when I was posting about my quater-life crisis. I've decided two things:   1. I don't understand the weather. (It's hailing teeny tiny pieces of ice outside and it's sunshiny as all get out.)   2.  True  sexuality lies at the hands of   urlLink Victoria's Secret . They have these low-rise briefs and thongs that I love. Don't know whether I'm brave enough to try the low-rise extreme t-string yet.)  I'll have to put that on my summer to-do list.   and opting for an  honorable mention : 3. I will never understand men. (I always knew this, but just recently I realized that I don't   get   twenty-something guys. they are just beyond me.  What's my favorite part of a guy?   Any of them, I love looking at them and they way they move.   But I figure that's ok since half the men I know can't understand woman, namely, me. Ha, I'm sooo mysterious. I wish, too bad I wear my heart on my sleeve. Oh gosh! Did I give away too much? I don't know. I don't think anyone really reads my blog besides me.

      Alright. I'm going to work on my 5 day lesson plan for geography useing the  urlLink national geography standards , so I won't look like a goon when I have to present it on monday.  What else is left for the weekend?...  10 pt. extra credit  urlLink Frederick Meijer Garden's Arid Garden  Lab. I only have to make a set of tables and write a one-page report.  A five-point paper telling what our movie was about in GPY 100.   A fourth grammar analysis that is kicking my butt. It's going to take up a  homongous chunk of my time .  Putting together a study plan for my 5 exams.  And finally, working on my psy take home test applying educational psy principles to the movie "Stand And Deliver" which I've seen over 800 times. Somehow each viewing seems new. I hate that. So in two weeks a 7 page paper is due. Great! I'll have to work on it when I go home for Easter.  *I'm eating the last of the rice pudding for breakfast this morning. :) I feel good about it. lol.

Didn't  know that I was or have been at any time a Women's Center Ambassador. 2. Decided that I liked it. 3. Hoped I get to be an "Ambassador" again. hahaha. I'm ever so charming.  Now I'm just sitting back.  Two of my classes got cancelled today! Whuhooo! And now I have nothing to do until my psy class at 6. I could however get to work on these two massive projects that are due next monday, tuesday, and thursday. But I say I'll just wait and find out where the day takes me.

           Let's weigh my summer highs and lows thus far: Pro- I got to plant 8 flats of flowers in the flower beds at McDonald's. Pro- I was told by my male co-worker that he's open to dating older women. Pro- I told him "okay, you missed a spot over there by that other flower". Pro- I wore a ultra-cool electric orange kid's mcdonald's tshirt today. Pro- I got my second two-week paycheck.   Con- I had to sweep dried dirt/cow manure off the sidewalks with a broom.      (Cow Manure, though dried, sticks.)  Con- Both decently cute male co-workers are only 19.      (One of them turns 20 this weekend. Um, ahem, whuhoo.)		 Double Con- This silent but sweet 19 year-old has a fiance.  Neutral- I have developed somewhat amazing bicep muscles, quite possibly the largest of my life.  Neutral Con- I gained some tricep muscle today doing the crazy hectic sidewalk sweep for over a half an hour.  Funny Con- My day-glo ultra-bright orange shirt made numerous men look at my boobs. Um, somehow this is being downgraded to a Neutral, if not Neutral Con.  Pondering...

      So after I had posted yesterday, I went over to my mom's old apartment to dig up all of our old flowers. And while I went about digging out Lily of the Valleys I managed to develop a giant blister in the middle of my right hand which popped soon after I had dug out a few forget-me-nots. I was like &*^%. So I finished up by digging out two giant hostas and set back to sit them over on my Grandma's porch. I go inside, covered in dirt, arm and hand shaking with pain, and say "Hey Auntie, I need a band-aid." So I go wash out this giant open wound in my hand. Gram gets me the peroxide and I'll be damned if my hand didn't foam for more than five minutes. That was the worst searing pain I've ever felt in my life. And now I have to wait for the damn thing to dry up and stop oozing so I can put on one of those plasticky healing band-aids that come off when you're healed in a week. My hand hurts like *&^^&$%^$%$#)(*!		 Feel sorry for me. :(

I'll try to update and keep your lives filled with the extra spicy goodness that only I can add to your lives. Hi whiskey! Hi Cooper! Oh yeah, and Hi Matt Project! lol.  I miss chatting with you all.

I came upon this realization while the little paper sleeves on the hashbrowns at McDonald's. It was quite an epiphany now that I think about it. How bizarre...doo doo do...doo doo do..doo doo do..oh baby...how bizarre. And now for totally random pop theme songs from the late 1990's.   And what's up with Victoria Secret's not having any spunky-fun underwear patterns in my size in the clearance catalog. Now tell me, can all of the low-rise bikini panties really be sold out?

      Amy's Fortune of the Day: Stress is the perfect study aid.  I could barely stand myself today. I woke up this morning in quite a mood, got in two fights with my grandma over language and my mcd hat. I came home at lunch only to call the michigan testing center to try to find out my test scores. The scores weren't going to be reported online until five o'clock today. I had to go back to work and be anxious the whole day. I got off work at four, drove around the block listening to Ricky Martin's Living La Vida Loca. I finally drove home, parked the car, and took a shower. I couldn't stand it. I had to know. And then, when I thought that I could finally go online at home (and not at the library because I misplaced my library card and didn't want to look for it) my gram said I should wait until after dinner to ask auntie if I could go back online tonight to check on my test scores (I got in trouble for using her aol minutes extraneously). So, finally tonight at 7:15 p.m. I went online and checked my aol email.  I passed my Geography subject area test. I passed my English major subject area test. I passed all three sections of the MI Basic Skills Test, (reading, mathematics, and writing). I even aced the writing portion.  How awesome is that!!! I am positively elated. I called my aunts, my bosses at work, and my supporting work-friends.  So what does this all mean?  All I have to do is my student teaching and I could get a job. How awesome is that!!!!!! I am soooo happy! I should have absolutely no problem getting into the school of ed, (I apply in Sept). And that means that I could apply to teach summer school for the school district!!! Oh, I am soo happy! :)  Thanks to all of my friends  and family who were so positive and supportive during all of this. You guys mean so much to me. I am going to sleep so well tonight! :)

      Amy's Fortune of the Day: Hindsight is a killer, good thing you can't have absolute hindsight in the present.  Oooh, that one is ominous. I went to work at 5 a.m. Yippee! Yup, I was up at 4, eating cheerios with massive amounts of sugar and having a Diet Coke, getting dressed and out the door promptly at 4:45, which sucks because the rest of the fam was snoozing pretty deep.  I changed my classes around for the Fall, yet again. And am currently happily searching and finding cheap books online. Here are my favorite places to go:  urlLink half.com ,  urlLink aaatextbooksearch.com , and  urlLink barnes & noble . I like aaa because it compares all of the top used and new textbook sites, but it doesn't include half.com. I decided against taking PHI 102 Ethics for the time and ENG 323 18th Century British-Romantic Literature London for the second. Knowing my luck and basing the possible outcomes on my BIO 103 class, which I took 3 times and still fought for a D+, I decided to drop those and take new classes from those sections. Which leaves me free to plunk in a writing class (ENG 382 Nature Writing) and (WGS 200 Intro to Gender Study or something). So after these two semesters (Fall &amp; Winter), I'll be finished with my Gen Eds, my English Major, my Geography Minor, my Writing Minor, my School of Ed pre-reqs, and I'm applying to the school of ed this semester so that if I get in I can post-pone my student assisting for one semester until the Fall.  On another note, I've been trying and trying (for absolutely no reason at all) to remember what Sally would say to Linus in the Peanuts cartoon. I finally asked my boss what she said. Was it   The Great Baboo ? No! Sally always said that Linus was      H er Sweet Baboo  !               And so I've decided that I too am on my search for my own  SWEET BABOO ! So the position of companion is now only open to men who would consider being called " My Sweet Baboo " as a direct compliment, worthy of praise.  :)       Let me tell you something though, James Bond would never consider being called "My Sweet Baboo" as anything but a means towards foreplay. I'm such a Bond-girl! : )

        And a wave of silence swept over the huddled masses...     As they cowered before him in fear....   He was to be the beginning of a new age, for his majesty knew of weakness to no other....   and he was known unto them as......    Fluffy!         Bow before me bitches

      Amy's Fortune of the Day: You know what's crap? Getting ready and pulling out of the driveway on your way to work at McD's and realizing that instead of only having one last week and a few day last days to work; you realize that you miscounted and were a whole week off.  So here's to   three weeks and counting...

      Amy's Fortune of the Day:   Friends should always let their friends buy them drinks. : )      This weekend was a  rocking mix  of hanging out with a coworker friend, our night going out to    Chi-Chi's,     tossing back a couple of Bahama Mama's,  and   checking out the naked, yet sexy Will Smith in the touching movie i,Robot. (Yum) I especially liked it when the movie pops into a scene with Will in the shower  with water drizzling over his steaming hot body  . I almost shouted to Will on screen... "Me want to touchie!"  Good thing I was slightly sobering up, slightly lol.            So the tally goes: Will Smith is hot, makes robots hot, I want to be a robot for halloween, hot, lol :) Bahama Mama's,hot, The waiter Big Boy's who (looks like a greek god) my friend & I decided to have as my pool boy, hot. Getting a cell phone &amp; downloading  The Munster's  ringtone, hot :) Downloading a cell phone wallpaper with a grouchy, plump tiger, hot. Finding excellent deals at Penney's and then getting 15% more off, hot, buying more teacher clothes, hot. Buying bras and ending up getting two for free, hot. Posting your bra size online, hot. Ha! Gotcha going! hot. ;) Oh yes, and let's not forget, working saturday at McD's til closing and getting asked out by another 19 year-old, hot. Ha, yes and corny. No more under 23 year olds for me thank you!  And you want to know what the greatest part of my night was?!!! Seeing tall, thin, country-boys wearing plaid shirts tucked into belted tight-fitting blue jeans and wearing a cell phone, hot. No, no, not hot....very very weird. Thank god I could come home for the summer to see this. Now all I have to look forward to seeing in high school when I'm teaching is bean-pole country boys with cell phones and pre-teens with those horrible not growing in mustaches. Ack! Gag! OMG gag. Bleck. I'll take tight-jean wearing country boys any day over that. Wait, I just ruled out the younger crowd. Oh well, boys have to have their little fantasies right?
