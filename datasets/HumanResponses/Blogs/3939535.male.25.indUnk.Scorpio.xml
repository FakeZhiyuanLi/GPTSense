      As I foray into this new universe of the blog, I struggled for a title.  My reasons for starting in the first place reside in a change that's been occurring over the past year or so.  This change isn't visible necessarily, although I believe it might be to certain people in this world.  I've had similar changes happen along at very decisive points in my life, so I've found that refering to them as "revelations" seemed to fit the best, despite the fact that some might see "revelation" as a bit obvious, even trite.  Screw that.  I like it...more details on this life change later on, as time and neccessity demand.  Coming back to the initial statement about finding a title that fit...well I did.  When I was ass deep in the middle of the revelation, I made a mixed CD for myself, and one other.  It was something special, an arrangement of all of the really important, influential, and memorable classic rock songs, for me.  I spent many hours thinking, listening, smoking, arranging, and finally enjoying this particular set of music, and I continue to enjoy it.  For me the songs described a certain perspective and mindset.  More so than that they are just a collection of sounds that when heard evoke beautiful things in the mind, and conjure memories that should never be forgotten.  So here we go again, another forum for the exchange of thoughts and expression of all things us: Love, Hate, Fear, Laughter, Smiles, Cries, Confusion, Loss...and on...and on...and on.    Here is the Blog Foundation:  "And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last When all are one and one is all To be a rock and not to roll"  Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven  The last line of the finale spells out the mastery, to be a rock and not to roll, referring to the alchemical philosopher stone.  Here the rock is not an external object, it is the adept which creates the rock within.  The turning of lead to gold is a metaphor of inner transformation through running the intense experience of the 3rd density of choice, the Earth experience, through the refiner's fire.  Gurdjeff speaks of crystallization as the result of work on the self, and the rock which the hermeticist becomes is the result of this.  Mouravieff similarly speaks of fusing the iron filings of the personality into a solid single block via "fusion of the magnetic center."  Not rolling means that the adept is no longer subject to the shifting winds of the world and is firmly set on the chosen path.  There is no end to the journey, but progress past the confusing dualities in the hall of mirrors requires crystallizing the choice.

      I've realized over a long span of time that our country's current leaders are not in our best interest. I don't pretend that I'm a politically savvy person, but I do possess a greater than average perspective. It seems completely obvious that in the past four years our government, and more specifically our president (G-dub to the layperson) is driving our nation into a quagmire. For personal gain of both money and power, our founding priciples are tossed aside like so many red-headed stepchildren.  Note to reader: Form opinion on current president, don't vote blind. Step back and really take an honest look at what has happened to our great country.  I could sit here and write volumes about the wrongs and rights of the administration. All of the political ass-rapings and blatant stupidities, but that's not what I'm getting at here. We elected him (at least I sort of think we might have...) to run this country. He's fucked it up beyond all recognition, and his term seems akin to something along the lines of letting Hellen Keller behind the wheel of a semi-truck driving through a glass factory. Oops, our bad. Let's right the wrong next election then.  If that was the case, how in the world can he be behind by only a few measly percentage points in the polls!?!?  I'll tell you how. Coastal Proximity. That land between LA and New York called America is to blame. The land of brutal republican devotion beyond any other thing. My brethren, the downtrodden. Lower-to-middle class white families, also know as middle america or white trash. Ignorance is the Mississippi river on which the ship of fools sets sail. Us coastal folk, East or West, have a leg up. I think living near the ocean gives one a sense of enlightenment, the forces of nature and mother earth drowning out the seemingly inherited idiocy present in the minds of those who cannot hear the neverending roar of the sea. It doesn't help that they're also shuttered away from the progressive, advancing pools of our society who can see right through the bullshit.  We need to provide everyone with an ocean, so here I say this.....we're screwed. The percentage of people who have the blessing of the ocean are a minority. I think Kerry should be sending everyone from Nevada to the Carolina's a copy of that "sea sounds of serenity" CD you see on late night infomercials. Something gotta change here people, another 4 yrs of G-dipshit and we're not going to be able to right our wrongs for many, many generations.  I've never voted in my life, but I will this year. My vote will be counted this year, not to elect anyone, but to go my part to ensure that someone will not be re-elected. I urge everyone to form your educated opinions about where you want your 1 vote to go, and then to carry that out. It matters not who you vote for, as long as it's for the right reasons......yours. If everyone does that, our nation's path will become. If not, I fear for the future, and for my children's future...
