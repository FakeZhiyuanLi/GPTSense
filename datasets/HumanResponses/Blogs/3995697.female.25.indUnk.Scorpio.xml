      Hi everyone!! My name is Karlana, affectionately known as KJ also. I often find myself wanting to keep a journal, and I do, but I find it easier to type because I type fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. Anyways, I am a happily married gal with one daughter right now, and one on the way. We live in Las Vegas, NV, but we hope to change that in the near future (like in a year or so).  I am currently going to school to become a high school teacher. I would love to teach Creative Writing and Multicultural Literature. I think children need some kind of structure that is geared around things they would love to write and read. Reading and writing is a great starting point for a mind's creativity.  In my spare time, I enjoy reading a variety of books, writing short stories and poetry, drawing and sketching, spending time with family and friends, and chatting and playing games online.  Other than that, I am well known for my sense of humor, compassion for friends (which includes listening to them and giving GREAT advice, not to be conceited!!), and being a school nerd. I have always had my nose stuck in a book whenever I can. But most importantly, I am always there for family and friends.  Even though my journal is in the early stages, it will be full of amusement. I rant and rave about life. And now I will be talking about my pregnancy. Of course, there will be gossip on here about people you don't know, but hey... Who doesn't like hearing about other people's problems??  So, please feel free to post any comments on any entries.  And I will see you next post!!

      It has been windy on and off today.  We had some thunderstorms last night, which was very welcomed.  They put me to sleep.  We are suppose to have more to come between today and next Tuesday!!  I love thunderstorms, they remind me of my mother.  My mother passed away in Dec. 2001.  We weren't very close when I was growing up, and didn't really build a mother-daughter bond until I had my daughter.  The one thing my mother never really taught us while growing up was about death, she pretty much shielded us from it.  My brother and I take it day by day.  My mother was one of those women who carried the weight of the world on her shoulders.  She took 9/11 pretty hard, even though we didn't lose anyone in those attacks.  She felt my brother's enlistement in the Army would bring us harm.  In the end, I think the worries of the world had killed her.  When it rains, I listen b/c it is as soothing as my mother talking to me.   No real morning sickness yet.  I suppose I should be pretty psyched about it, but hey... It isn't that big a deal.  I have been feeling a tightness in my lower abdomenal area.  Other than that, I have been taking it pretty easy.  Until next post.....

      Hello everyone!  It was very hot out today!!  it got up to like 112*F out here on my side of LV!!  I made my first OB/GYN appointment this morning.  I go in to get everything checked out on August 24th at 930am.  They will probably have me take some blood tests and everything.  But I am cool with that, as long as I can get things on the ball with the whole early prenatal care.   When I found out I was pregnant with my daughter in 1999, I found out when I was 3 months into the pregnancy, not getting enough early prenatal care led to my complications.  In the end, I had my daughter 6 weeks early, and 2 weeks after having her I had to go back and get my gall bladder taken out.  It was quite a horrible experience.  This time around, I want to do it right.  Eat healthy!  Take extra vitamins!  Just take care of myself so I can take care of the baby.   Thank goodness I have a huge support system of family and friends.  Many of them are already offering their babysitting times.  A couple are already planning baby showers.  With school about to start,  I am feeling great.  This baby has been long in the waiting.  Often I wish I could have had it two years ago, but may be it just wasn't time.  But now, I am glad I waited so long b/c I am so ready to have another one.  My daughter is ready to be a big sister and DH and I are ready for a new edition.  Watch out world, here we come!!  Until next post.....

      Well, we got the results back from the blood test taken yesterday.  They called back and said the test came back positive, so we are definitely pregnant!!  Now, we have to start really eating good and healthy and set up our first appointment with the OB/GYN.  I am so excited b/c this made the pregnancy official.  We are so happy, we have been trying for awhile now.  Today has been a lazy and relaxing day.  DH's birthday is today, so I have been pampering him as he has been pampering me.  Tonight I am making him chicken fajitas, one of our favorites, and we are goign to sit down and start planning out my "pregnancy diet", as he calls it.  Our daughter is playing a big role in this pregnancy, too.  She is quite excited that she is getting a baby brother/sister and is starting to talk to it.  I believe that this sibling loving will last for only so long.  With the big age difference of 5 years, I believe that after awhile, the younger one will be seen as a nuisance by the big sister.  Well, off to make dinner.  See you next post!!
