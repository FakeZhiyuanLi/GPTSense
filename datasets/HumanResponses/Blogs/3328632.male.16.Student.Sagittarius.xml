      After massing around 60 hours of gameplay i finally shoved some ultima's up jecht's ass today.  FFX was, great, my fave so far except for possibly IIX.  IIX (or VIII as it seems to be referred to alot, dont ask me why) was the most emo one I've played, but i kinda like that stuff ya know?  But anyway, FFX had one of those beautiful bittersweet endings, complete with matching  urlLink music .  But the best thing about X was the http://squaresoft.com/uematsu/, it's way more direct, and way cool.  It's on to X-2 for me now, yuna has a  urlLink gun , something to look forward too.  However, my favorite character was Rikku, she had a happy-go-lucky spirit, and she was the theif of the group.  She was just all around loveable.

      I bought a Nintendo 64 this weekend, mainly to play  urlLink mario 64 , which really does stack up well against the more recent platformers, despite rather annoying camera work.  It's deffinitley no  urlLink PoP , but it still stacks up well.  I would like to know what mario would do if he came into battle against the prince, mario wouldn't have much of a chance, not being able to control time and whatnot, but if our favorite plumber were to pull out a star, that would be a whole nother story.  however, annoying little fara wouldn't stand much of a chance against  urlLink peach  (umbrella slap).

      apparently my journalism teacher is planning on moving in with the resident cheerleading instructor at this school, or rather having the cheerleader move in with her.  They seem to be excited in an odd-highschool-girls-preparing-for-sleepover type way.

      I'm supposed To have all of Jane Eyre read by friday.  So in short... fuck.  I'm really not liking it at this point, it was really fine until all the chracters became whiny bitches.  I don't want to have to analyze what makes their lives so sorrowful, i just want them to get over their bitch-ass-ness.  Also I'm tired of this book, and in general I am tired of assigned reading, as i feel it interrupts my more focused literal pursuits.  In any case, please excuse the hypocritical bitch-ass-ness of this post. Rip out (pout).

      Well, i suppose i've failed the math and chemistry sections of the state testing today.  Im not sure what it was that made these tests so difficult, maybe it was my general apathy towards the test, maybe it was mjjisdirected instructin, maybe it was a siren gamecube begging me to finish quickly.  In any case, this may very well screw over any attempt for me to further my education after highscool, but for now, i'm not worried about it.  The Guild Wars demo is out, and fair game for any of you that want to try it.  I wasnt a big fan, there is a team quest function that was oddly un-team like.  I went on a few quests and on each one there was no real sense of "teamwork," just individual players hacking and slashing.  I still have the chem test to finish up, and Mrs. Vaughn can't wait till summer, things are pulling my attention away, adieu.

      You cannot do anything to justify your life. What are you living for? That depends on a few key factors, but basically you are living to stop someone else from living (because he raped your wife or something) or you are living to procreate; which means, if necessary, you should go rape someone's wife otherwise your life would be worthless. We are all rape babies of one form or another anyway. Rape-arpe-prae-pare-paer-pear. Forbidden fruit indeed. Civilized life is so full of paradoxes and subsequent double-standards.  Femminism is a funny thing, women scream their heads off saying we are suited to do what men do, we are no different then them.  It's so ridiculous, they are anatomically different, they are genetically different, not to mention the psychological imprints of playing "a womans role" for generations.  I'm not a sexist, i just dont get it i suppose.  maybe i am a sexist, maybe thats the defining characterestic of a sexist.  I know that my father would make a horrible mother, and my mother would make a horrible father,  I mean, they aren't even too good at their gender specific roles.  Anyway im getting out of here soon.  If bush is elected to another term ill be out of the country before he is out of office.  im afraid of being forced into hard labour.  if he doesn't get elected i'll probobly leave anyway, but not out of fear, just out of discontent.  - Rip  out   "Did it happen so fast, what you thought would always last has passed you by."

      There is nothing more vitalizing then a breath of cold city air as you walk down the dead center of a street, lit only by those never dimming lights of any american cityscape.  It is for those moments that we are alive, and it wouldn't be living without those moments.  Soymilk is good, it tastes better than regular milk, has a longer shelf-life, and doesn't have that disgusting fatty viscosity.  - Rip  out   "My words won't come out right. (What are you thinking?) I feel like im drowning."

      hey kids, band practice in a couple days, i haven't been practicing. I feel like an ass because i keep telling everyone to practice. I dislike people who are deeply, stubbornly religous, and I dislike people who are deeply, stubbornly, unreligous. i would enjoy spending time with neutral people in general. Maybe not neutral, maybe willing and open-minded. If you are deeply passionite about religion, or you're lack there of, don't worry I dont dislike you, i just like the concept of you. I'm sure you are actualy a beautiful, wonderful person. But in all seriousness, watch nightline, it's good for you. Kopel is a conceptually cool guy. / Rip /out/   "Close my eyes just to look at you, taken by the seamless vision, and i close my eyes,  ignore the smoke ,  ignore the smoke ,  ignore the smoke ."
