      Finally I shifted my blog to blogger.com, although I still host it on my own space on the CU server. I just thought that the movable type (MT) system was too much of a hassle.

      It feels good to be back !!  Everything kinda happened in a hurry. One fine day I woke up and decided that, no matter what, I was going to India this summer. Searching for tickets in June, I actually found that the May ones were much cheaper and here I am ...back home in May...for a month.  In the 2 years that I have been away, so much seems to have changed around here and yet so much still seems the same. An irony of sorts. While, almost every other person on the road seems to be carrying a cellphone, it still takes a good 45 mins to reach Ghatkopar from VJTI by road.  People talk of a "culture-shock" when they go to the US from India....I guess after living there for 2 years, what I am experiencing right now in Mumbai could be aptly termed as "reverse-culture-shock". Boulder is a very small, cosy town - a total contrast to the fast paced life in Mumbai. Even though its almost been a week since I came here, I am still, only just, getting used to it.  So many new joints have sprung up everywhere in Mumbai -  from the Baristas and the Cafe Coffee Days to the Big Bazaars. Heck, I think I even saw a SUBWAY someplace.  Another funny thing that I have noticed is how "less expensive" everything seems around here. When you  go to the US you always tend to think in rupees and how atrocious that price tag of $3.99 seems on your first latte. And now, even the most priciest of coffees in Barista is under 100 bucks...SWEET!!!  Well, this is just my first week here..with 3 more to go..so hopefully I'll have lots more things to talk about.

      Just finished reading two of his books " Stupid white men " and " Dude, Where's my country?  ". His movies seem to be an extension of his books.  Bowling for Columbine  showed a lot of stuff what he'd written in  Stupid white men  while  Fahrenheit 9/11  discussed a lot of what he's written in  Dude, Where's my country?  He seems to be very opinionated about everything that's even remotely connected to the Bush family and Corporate America. His views ironically seem to be too extremist for a liberal that he considers himself to be. Though I am not fond of either him or Bush, he offers a second point of view&nbsp;to the same story.  History as they say is always in the favor of those who write it and I think Michael Moore may have just re-written it for  Dubya . Come November and we shall all know.

      Have become toooo lazy of late...  Finally shifted to blogspot's hosting service from my own space on CU server.  Will update soon.  &nbsp;  The thing is, there are too many things to write about since I last blogged. Sometimes I am so jealous of Dumbledore...wish I had a pensieve like his...where I could just deposit my thoughts and restore them back verbatim when I blog them...  &nbsp;  Well if wishes were horses, I wouldnt be a beggar !!!  &nbsp;
