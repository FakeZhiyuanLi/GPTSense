      Yes,Drei and i have our own share of problems,but that does'nt stop me from loving her any less.I love her more than anything and anyone.Why?She has given me more than what i wanted and expected from her.She is the source of my happiness.She is my life.If i lose her,no more happiness,no more LIFE.I need my baby Drei.I love her more than any other ive had.I have never loved anyone this much.She's the only girl i cry'd for when i missed her so bad.I really have the desire to be with her.I need her presence.I need her love.She gives me strength to do whatever i want.She takes away my fears.Except the fear of losing her.I never want to lose her.I ant to keep her forever.Shes the most precious and valuable thing in my life.She is my treasure.And i would go through any hardship as long as i can keep my baby.I am ready for anything.I am ready to defend my love for Drei.I am ready to fight for our relationship.I am ready to fight for her.I will love her always.

      Today is the best day of my life with Drei..We went out together and i surely enjoyed it..We went to GreenBelt 3 and hang out there..While we were at starbucks,she used my hanky,im never gona get that hanky washed again and il keep it for the rest of my life..Like a 2nd class relic of Drei..After that,we watched a movie together..Meangirls was the movie..I wasnt able to focus on the movie,instead,i was focusing on Drei..She always catches my attention...No wonder i think of her 24/7...After the movie,we had dinner in Pasha restaurant and had some shawarma..It was all good. She didnt finish her food though..Its alright though..We were also arguing (in a good way) on who will pay the bill..Well,we both did..Then i offered her the change,but she told me to keep it..When we were outside,i slipped all my money in her bag..Told her to buy sumthin,from me..Then,the most painful or tragic part of the day,was the time to say goodbye..When my car came,we kissed each other..My lips on her soft lips,and said goodbye..Told her to always take care of herself for me...When i stepped in the car,i already missed her,and sent her a txt message already..Thats how fast i miss her..Till now,me typing this,i miss her even if we have been talking just minutes ago..I guess i love her too much..
