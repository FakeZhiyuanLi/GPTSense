       I haven't done nothing much for my interactive project in the office, but i got to time to sneak to "Kinokuniya" to browse some of the Flash, Director and other design books. Somehow i feel that i got a lot of motivation and eager to let my creative juice flow once you browse the books, a lots of idea, tips, and knowledge you absorb. Jaye my classmate from my degree course called to discuss about her project, she got problem for the storyline and direction of the game. So i advise her on a few direction she can try for her game.   Basically her game is about three mischevious kids palying around with dirt  in their backyard, their mother was shocked what they have done to their backyard, the kids were so scared that they hid themselves... find out more later from Jaye! In the end of our discussion, i think she have a better picture in which direction she going to execute.

       I got half day today at office, so i hev done nothing much at my office, just attend a few meetings, onced i got back from office i packed myself with my fishing kit and set to Pasir Ris Park, meeting my friend day for fishing, Fishing at the beach give me calmness in my mind, at the same time enjoy the thrill if you got a bite, thrillin part of fishing is how you fight with the fish and drag it to the shore, it will be more exciting and fun if the caught is a big one! : )  While waiting for the bite, John my classmate for Interactive Media at Coleman Creative School call to discuss about the game project given, coz he have trouble to find sound Fx and loops for his game. Somehow you stress will be at ease by the beach, viewing the panaromic view of the seascape, people jogged, pretty mermaid "babes" and birds flying bla bla bla... by the time i got back around 11pm, quit tired though i spent a few minutes posting this blog!
