      I'm so stinking tired. I don't evn know why. Uhh...The concert went well untill our last peice, Riversongs. I have head what a fiasco it was but even though I was there, I didn't notice anything. Yeah anyway people are still convinced that I'm going out with Tony...hum I wonder why...There really isn't all that much to say...oh yeah Sarah got back from Arkansas today. I think I'm getting strep throught. Oh I'm in Nick's class for drivers ed! I have a friend! I won't be alone as I go throught that insane class. I get to drive...It's so gonna rock. I don't care what people say this is my chance for freedom from my family!! Will I have to go practice...I've kinda been slacking. Gotta make up for that...

      Today was good...I ate massive amounts of sugar in French this morning!!!!! It was so fun. Then I ate the remnants of Sarah's souflee at lunch along with more sugar!!! So my excitement was paeked though I think I have some off the sugar high. I'm still hungry though. Food...food is good but sugar...sugar is better. Uhhh...there should be more to say....Oh yeah1 Got my schedual today. It was freaky I have the exact same schedual as Sarah Estes except that I am in Honors english and she is just in regular english. I found lots of people in my classes which amused me. Uhhh...I get out of fourth period tomorrow! For band. i get to play then i get to eat and then I get to play some more. Yeah and I get a solo...all my own...I don't have to share it with cassidy!!! I am so excited but hey it could be the sugar. I have been playing my solo perfect lately...Wo ho...sugar enduced happyness...such a wonderful thing...darn could have used that as my title...oh well...have to go do my math homework...if I can concentrate that is...

      I had a better practice yesterday after I rambled a bit on my blog. Don't think about it too hard, that's the key to keeping my tounge going. Today is that last monday of the school year!! And I get to eat food in French class which is very good. Wow...the concert is tomorrow. I really hope it isn't a fiasco. Hummmm....anything else to say? For one I sound like I'm talking to myself. I probably am. I don't even know why I wrote this...I have nothing to say but that the snow has melted but it's still cloudy and could rain/snow at any minute. But I am stupid and am wearing sandals. But hey I wore them when there was much more snow on the ground. Well I have to do stuff before i leave this morning so I will be back when I have something to talk about...

      IT"S SNOWING!!!! Again!! I left Friday on a perfectly sunny nice day and I came back to snow! Grrr...Montana weather...grrr....Uh yeah...anyways...I just got back from a graduation party and there were alot of people there. So many people in fact that I began to have a panic attack and hid in the kitchen the whole time. I have a phobia of strangers. I realised the true extent of this phobia today. Yeah just got back from Bozeman. Poor Brit...lost both his games. I saw Paul's team play for about 15 minutes too. Yep good stuff. Uhhh anyway....really isn't much else to say...My flute playing has been very bad as of late. I can't even begin to double tounge my 16th note run on my all state audition peice. It really is begining to frustrate me. I can't even move my fingers well enough to type this right now! I think I'm gonna take a break before I practice any more...

      I was looking at the paper and I came across a poll regarding gay marrage. the questions state "Should Montana recognise gay marrage from other states. An overwhelming amount of people said no. But the thing that really struck my nerve was a quote at the bottom of the article; "It's too immoral for most Montanans to even consider." What is so diffrent about a marrage of a homosexual couple from the marrage of a heterosexual couple? Other than the differing of sexs, of course. If two people are so in love that they fell they are ready to take the plunge and get married then what should hold them back? Certanly not the law. How about we just ban all marrage, that would be fair. fairer than what is going on. Consider that.

      It is raining alot. All day. I do like the rain but the mud is not fun to traverse. Yeah...my piano recital went well...so everyone says...all I can concentrate on is my mistakes. Anyway...today was good. French class was even good. My stalker was hitting on me mercifuly durring gym class (I need to reveal his name sometime...) But one of my friends was acting depresssed today because Sarah Degoyer wasn't there today and obviously yesterday she said that she didn't like him. I fell bad for him because I had to do the same thing a few weeks ago. Anyway I took it upon myself to make him not depressed and I have to admit that I did a really crappy job of it. What else...Lunch was very good and fun. Ashley kept throwing licorish down my shirt but it was good because I got a lot of licorish out of the deal. Nick wass amusing as always and Paul was being a fungus...(Ha ha Paul)...The stupid people in my band STILL don't know their parts but I was happy because I didn't mess up on my solo. We have a concert coming up on tuesday so that means I get out of class to rehearse which is ALWAYS fun. Uhhh...science didn't suck and I read durring the movie in history because we had a sub. I enjoyed it emensely. Then I got to see all of my odd friends after school...in the rain... and (It is time to reveal my stalker's name...) Tony kept hugging me. Then he was said "Hey you should call me some time" and I had to go into my fear of the phone. Yes so today was good. I have to go to Billings tonight. Stay the weekend but I have all of my major projects out of the way and all I have to look forward to is finals...wo ho. You gotta love um. Well I shall be back soon enough. Au Revoir mes amies!

      I have to go to my piano recital in about 2 hours.  Still hasn't hit me that I am preforming but that's the best way to go. Today was good. My stalker was being so odd. He kept stealing my purse. Then i got insanely bored in French class. We seem to be doing the same thing over and over and over...again and again and again...well you get my point. It's driving me insane!!! Then I insanely amused at lunch because of Nick again. Ummm...oh in english today this guy came to the door and her told Miss Notti to make Ashley Barton colse her eyes and when she did he gave her pink roses! How sweet! I don't even think they were going out. Wow...good thoughs... Ah getting too sappy! Anyway, band was alright. We have a concert coming up and the stu[id people STILL don't know their parts! Science was better then usual. wasn't watching the clock as much. And I have my rock collection done and I probably should finish my book for English. Still not nervious. As soon as I put on the dress I will...

      Rain. It's raining here. It just keeps coming down...the same dreadfull stuff that I walked around in on Sunday in Helena. Makes me cold. I got my I pod to work, finnaly! Now I won't be stuck listening to Good Charlotte. Makes me happy. (Wide range of emotions today) I should probably go practice. I have a piano recital tomorrow night. I am preaty much ready but there a few flaws in my music that I need to smooth out. All State tapes are due June 9th(reminder to myself and just to let you know how lopng I have untill I start flipping out over a preformance again.)

      Regarding comments on my blog. I go to CMR. Uh and I have no problems what so ever in taking the name of cinnamon milk in vain. (Not vein...like blood...) Anyway...today...today was good because of lunch and Nick having a tad too much fun with the oyster crackers. (If anyone can sheed light on why they are called oyster crackers that would be great.) I was so greatly amused by him today. Uh really nothing better realy happened. I was in a bad mood today I guess. For no reason. Uh...now I am jsyt felling guilty because I didn't do my math homework because I couldn't concentrate. And I have this rock collection due Friday which I haven't started. AHHHHHH!!!!!! Sure..they let us off the Whole year and then they throw it at us...Eguh...Yeah. Going to see if i can do something on my rock collection...

      I realise that I got very bogged down in my last post that I am just going to write a separate one. Regarding the comment made by Paul...cinnamon milk sucks...I like the pictures in People the best and Brit took third. Anyway...moving on...I was happy today. Just because. Its always first period and my stalker that seem to make me happy. I do really like him. He was just being funny. Then the alarm went off durring 2nd period and no one told us why. we got about half way outside and they started calling us back in. And I'm so confused in my math class right now. For some reason radicals confuse me so much. Yeah...lunch was good...I was somehow wraped up in the most interesting/disturbing conversation I have even been in. Then we are reading this great book in English which I really like. Uhhh...band wasn't bad. I always like band. Uhh..science sucked..but it always does...I hate that class so much. Then in history we are watching Swing Kids which is a great movie. This will actually be the third time I've seen it. And it means that I don't have to work so...It's all good. The stuff for my all state audition is going well! Makes me happy. And now I get t go eat the watermellon that my mom got me. Good day. Very good day.

      Today i was just alittle too hyped up in gym and I realised that I was fighting the public shool district, in great falls at least. School is basically a dictatorship in a democratic country. Our lives are ruled by teachers and if we try to change it we are only punished. I like to think that the greatest example of this is gym class. For those of us who are not athletic, we are forced to preform at the leavel of the athletic kids in class. When we don't live up to their standards we are looked down upon or even punished. The games, oh the games. They are public humiliation. If you're playing baseball and you can't hit the ball everyone is looking at you and laughing at you. So people will even get mad at you if you strike out and don't hit the ball. We are a country that was founded on human rights. As a child or and adolesent we have no little or no rights. This is exploited by our teachers.  Also, I have been thinking lately about the Pledge of Allegence. Are we the only country that does this? It says "One nation under God" but doesn't the whole idea of the pledge break the second comandment? Thous halt not worship false idols? Americans have been bainwashed as children to stand and say the Pledge when instructed. What about those among us who do not belive in the ideals of the United states?  Well before getting too deep/ angry/make others angry, I'm going to stop.

      So I haven't talked to my best friend in California for maybe a month and now I geet on the computer only to find her as being away on her IM!! Makes me mad. Fate seems to hate me.  I just got back from Helena. Yesterday was insanely nice and sunny and I even got sunburned. But today it rained and was bone chillingly cold. Now my shoulder hurts like heck and I am sick again! This weekend just was not one of the best. Yeah anyway...there has to be something else to talk about. What to say what to say...did I mention that my shoulder hurts like heck?  She isn't even away now! She signed off! EHHHH!!!!! Long distance relationships, even if they are between friends, suck! Yeah..kinda depressed... I think I need to go do something to get out of this mood...eat chocolate...that sounds good.

      Well today my stalker (his name will one day be revealed!) and I were having a conversation on paper, as I like to call passing notes, durring health class. And Sarah said that she thought there was something between us...which I can't all together deny...and that we flirted with each other alot. Then she decided we were going out. (For the record we aren't). Then he misunderstood something I said and wrote "I like our relationship" and then that just set everyone off. So they are all convinced that I'm going out with him but I'm not because it is a long complicated story. (Which will also be revealed one day!)  Moving on...I only messed up once n my solo today and Jen wasn't in band so I was really happy! Then I got a 94 on my history test. So today was insanely good. Now I have to go to Helena for the weekend because my brother has a soccer tournament. Humm...more soccer moms and 12 year old boys...how fun. Au revoir! Deux merci c'est vendredi!!!!

      I find myself morning a lack of people to have on my MSN IM. I am haveing a hard time thinking of words. I HAVE TO RUN THE PACER TOMMOROW! Oh that sucks! I hate running. But looking on the slightly duller brightside...it will be over before I know it and it's the last one of the year. Grrr...makes me mad...I am still tribly sore from the mile that I ran YESTERDAY! Holy crap! I think they're trying to kill us! Obviously I haven't had that much time to think about this. I've been too concerened with sticcato notes! why I don't know. I really hope tomorrow is a good day or I will be in such a bad mood. But it probably will be. Because that's just the way it goes.  I got to skip 7th period today to go to the orthodontist. I still don't know when i get these stupid braces off! They are throwing off my flute playing! Yeah...I should really get out of this spitteful mood...I conld talk about my stalker! He didn't stalk me as much today. Hmmm....he followed me to the feild house and I didn't really know he was there so that was one of the scareyest sensations of my life...felling like someone is behind you. Oh yeah then Mark was "stoned" in health class. It scared me so much. I mean on a deeper level. Hummm...I know something more interesting must have happened today but it doesn't seem to be surfacing...It was snowing again today. I miss wearing skirts...they amuse me so much. I need to practice scales...just in general. Good for technique...and I could also practice my sticcato notes. I con't play them very well. Good for speed. Yeah don't make me put so much effort into tounging. Humm...well be for I get too much into theiory...I'm gonna stop now. Cherio people!

      I am so obnoxiously happy today. I had to run the mile (which sucked) but I beat my best time so I don't fail! Wo ho! An my stalker stalked me murselusly today. I did quite enjoy it though. I think he found out where my locker is...creepy...Yeah...We got our 40 minute lunches back yesterday! I have been in a better mood because I've actually had a time to do nothing and talk to my friends. It's snowing again. I'de really hoped that it was spring but obviously it isn't. Montana weather is so grand. I have a solo in our peice in band and it so amuses me because it pisses off the third chair flute (who seems to think that she is still better than me even though I am first chair) that she isn't the one with the solo. Finally this blog is felling somewhat like home...mow that I have put in my good paragraph. I ramble too much when there is no one to stop me. Bwa ha ha! Lucky you random people!

      Well the happyness definately abounds today...I am done with the stupid classroom part of drivers ed! No more stupid tests or Mr. O'Hara's babling...this is just great...now I'm gonna have a summer! I'm happy. The final test turned out to be not that hard because he let us use our books and I'm sure he'll be lenient on the final driving test...I get my lisence when I get back from seely! yay. Other then that I have nothing interesting to say so I'm just gonna stair at the computer screen and wait for Paul to start talking to me...

      Well what have I been doing this weekend? Cleaning...obsessively. I gutted my desk, my closet, my bathroom and my shelves...filled up like five trash bags with junk and 4 boxes with garage sale stuff...moving is gonna kill me. I wore myself out working for like 4 hours yesterday...which could explain the tight muscles in my back, now that I think about it...I've had too much time to kill with Paul in Helena and no social life beyond that (how pathetic) but i fell like I got alot accomplished so I am insanly happy. I gave myself a break today after about two hours of cleaning and watched the Life of Brian which was insanely funny and read my book for English and listened to Coldplay...which almost put me to sleep. I should invest in that CD so I can sleep at night...wow that's a really good idea..I'll look into that but right now I am tring to get myself to foucus on one thing instead of insanely multitasking. I need to get out of the mentality that if I am not doing five things at once that I am not getting anything done...yeah like I can beat my mentalities. funny. Well this appears to be going nowhere. Hum...do I have something more interesting to talk about? Yes as a matter of fact I do! I have my final written test for drivers ed tomorrow and it's THE LAST DAY! no more getting up early for me or going to school durring the summer! Wo Ho! I only have to take my driving final test on tuesday and I am completely and tottaly finished! It makes me so happy...so insanely insanely happy...now all I need is a car...

Oh gezze never thought I'd say that. Well ehough with that, I'm gonna talk about driving! My first time out legaly. I almost rear ended a guy coming off of exit zero. It was great. My dad totally fliped out. Yeah then I was in the other people's lanes on thenth Ave. S. and I was going way under the speed limit. People hated me and I was yelling at the ideas of them. Since I am too nice to actually yell at them. What else should I talk about...nothing? Sure that works. I'm just fonna go. Yeah, bye.

      I'm am so happy! I just oassed my test for the learners permit!!! Oh God it was so stressful!!! There were only 33 questions so we couldn't miss more than 6 questions to pass with an 80%. And then we had a guest speaker for like two hours and then Mr. O'Hara went on and on about what to do if you didn't pass aand so I was litterly ready to kill him by the time he finnaly passed them out to us. It was crazy!! But  now I am happy that I passed that because it was so majorly stressing me out. Now I should eat because I am starving and I will probably faint if I don't!!

      It's been a while (for me at least) since I last posted. Anyway...I get my learner's permit tomorrow if I pass the TELL test!!! And I get my licence...my real lisence...next week!!! Oh my God I am so excited! I only have to sit through a week more of class with O'Hara and I am free and I'll be able to drive and have my independence. I have never had independence! I have always had to rely on some one else but I won't in what? Two weeks? Now all I need is a car...ha, laughable. But my mom is so crazy doing 9 things at once that she needs me to have my own car. Oh God I really haven't had much time to put it all into perspective. This is so great. Ahhhh...happy thoughts....Anyway, speaking of my insane mother, she is in Chicago right now. It is so nice to be completely and totally away from her! I haven't realised how stressful she makes everything. She really drives me crazy. I knew that, but I haven't realised the extent of it untill now. Gezze I am in a good mood now...Oh wow...I just rembered that I have a cousin that's supposed to be born today. My aunt is have=ing a C-section so it is coming today. Wow I totally forgot. I hope my grand ma calls so that I know what is going on. It's gonna be a girl I can fell it...I'll keep you up dated I guess!

      ONE MORE DAY TILL I AM FIFTEEN!!! It's all very good and exciting but about this point in the year I start to realise how anti social I really am or how many people I really do hate. So I am ending up just going to Harry Potter 3 with my grandparents for my real birthday. But it'll be fun because I don't spend as much time as I would like with them. Them being really my only relitively sane relations. Oh but my grandma has me go to Herburgers where she works to pick out my birthday present and I went yesterday and I found this braclet and this lime green wallet which rocks so much! And I get to go celebrate my birthday/ fathers day tonight with my mom's side of the family. I got to have the party for April/May/June, which includes my birthday, with my dad's side of the family on Sunday night. I guess I like my birthdays to be like this so that I am not the center of attention where I get fliped out. Yeah so more presents for me! Ha ha I am so (word that starts with a c which I forgot but would be perfect in this situation). And I don't have to go to drivers ed tomorrow but I have to get up even earlyer then I usually do to go to an orthadontist appointment, now won't that be fun! In a perfect world I could then come home and go back to  sleep but I have never been able to do that. Hummm...it's gonna suck! But really what can you do. Something else I was going to tak about...hummm...can't remember...OH well I'll rember later when I rember that c word. Hummm...a three second memory span really isn't good. Yeah well I have stuff to do for drivers ed and have to practice. Bye!

      In regards to one of my earlier quotes..you are right Paul, I did forget to metion that we kidnaped you...My brother adopted him as the new membor of the family for a day...Anyway back to what I was really talking about...Drivers ed has continued to suck but it is easy and I am passing all my tests so this could be a breeze other then my extreme bordom...I have to drive again tonight..lane changes and driveways, how extremly fun! Yeah onward to my "social life"! Tony has called me everyday since wednesday. Yeah we've talked for like 3 and a half hours everytimes. But now my mom is tring to kill me because I am on the phone so much!! Yeah the conversations have gotten really deep. But I like it and it's something to do to kill three and a half hours other then study for drivers ed! I am just killing time till he is supposed to call me again...about 15 minutes but I have gotten in some good practice while killing time! My lessons are on Monday so I happy to have more organization to my practicing again. About a year ago I wouldn't even think about practing as much as i do now and it makes me happy because I have gotten insanely better and since I am not in Symphonic band next year it will help me acheve my goal of first chair in Rustler band!! Which I know I could do...oh so easily...oh fun...I knew all this practing would get me somewhere! Yeah well I should go knock a few more pages off of my summer reading book for honors next year and find a heating pad to help ease my back which hurts like heck! Good bye!

       second day of driver ed. It was insanely torcherous. We were couped up in the classroom for 4 stinking hours without a break because he forgot to give us one..or two..I was seriously about to kill someone. we didn't even talk about driving most of the time!!! On the bright side...this whole thing will be done in a month and I can have a summer!! It has been raining here. And cold...like winter...without snow. I want it to be summer!!! I am sick of rain. I want it to be warm. Maybe next week...

      I am writing this on the computer in the business center of the hotel...I have never actually used any of these things and this is the least stupid Dell computer I have ever worked on!! Anyway...yesterday was the last doy of my freshman year (Reminds me that I should probably change my profile)...oh how sad...Anyway, it was very eventful...we basically did nothing in all of my classes which was so amusing, I actually enjoyed my science class because there was food and I knew I would never have to go back there again!!! Then Tony, my stalker, called me from a pay phone...it would be really stalkerish but I gave him my number...it's all my fault...oh well, he actually was remotely sane most of the time...Now I am in Kalispel and my brother's team lost his games in the tournament...so sad and then there was a thunderstorm. Yeah...I am amused...I am not actually trying out for all state band after all...it is stressing me out way too much...And drivers ed starts on Monday!!! Yeah well I have yet again run out of things to say so...good bye people!!!

      well that's how good my mind is...I thought that I hadn't updated this thing for at least a week but it's only been two days! Crazy. Anyway...finals are over with little or no effort! And I am sure that my scores are gonna reflect it. But tomorrow is the last day of school! I am kind of depressed because i actually really like school and I like seeing my friends everyday and stuff like that. But I get to go on Monday at 8 in the morning for drivers ed so it will be like I never left. I got to go driving today with my dad. It was so amasingly fun. I learned; don't take corners at full speed,  watch for curvy roads, I CAN go 50 mph without hyperventelating, and to always use your turn segnal, especially when changing lanes. i was so amused. I love driving. And soon I will have my lisence and will be able to do it legaly!! I'm gonna buy alot of ice cream then and chaufer alot of kids.

      Today I was insanely happy. It was great. last week of school. wo ho. But my main amusement was that I talked to Rachel last night. She was acting like her old self and she was not being depressed and ranting over people in a California! And she's coming in August and I can drive then...ahhh...nirvana...not the band of course...good band...maybe I should say euphoria...big words...I love them....anyway...took my first schedualed final today. I already took one of two in my science class...because my teacher is evil...and that wonderful pacer test and mile that I was complaing about a few weeks ago is my final in gym...yeah so seven more to go... Uh huh...you gotta love finals :( . Isn't sock a funny word? Just thinking about that. Yeah well I've aparently run out of things to say so...au revoir...

      After saying a final goodbye to Paul before he goes to Gonzaga a tear actually runs down my cheek. It is in this moment how much a part of me he has become and how truely alone I feel right now knowing that I won''t be able  to talk to him all the time. I am going to miss him unimaginably much. I love him. Now is when my feelings really begin to materialize. Love, lonelyness and sadness. I really have a deep bond with Paul, my boyfriend and the person I love. A good thing that I only miss, sadly, when it is gone.

      I am in love. There is nothing more to it. I am in love with a wonderful guy who is the best thing that has ever happened in my life. I feel so taken over with emotions right now that I can't even begin to sort them out and write them down. Love can only be understood if you experence it.  It is not like anything else, no other emotion and no other experence. I really love Paul with all my heart and my spirit. he is the best thing in my life. the person I get up for ever moring. The reason for me to live. I don't know how I am going to exist without him when he goes away to Gonzaga, even if it is for a few days. I will survive on the sould thought that he is coming back to me and that he loves me as much as I love him.

      I seriously have the best boyfriend in the world. We talked till 2 in the morning last night and some of those things he said to me just made me melt. It was so wonderful. I just can't this gawkey smile to leave my face I am so happy! And I got to talkto Rachel last night and she was happy to hear about my first date which made me really happy because no one seems to be showing any emotion for me. And it is really starting to get to me. But I really don't care about those people because right now I am insanely happy.

      Today may be one of the best days of my life, and that's something I don't say lightly...First off today was Paul and I's 2 week anniversary and we went on our first date! We went to see Anchorman, which was preety funny, and we were the only ones in the theatre but for these two guys that were there all alone. And they looked at us all the time. It really flipped me out. But back to the actual date. I was sitting thorugh the first half of the movie hoping that he would do something...like put his arm around me or hold my hand or something! And then! then half way through the move he put his hand out and I laced my fingers in his and I was so happy at that moment. If only a bit nervious. I kept tring hard not to start shaking. It may seem so cliche that I was so happy about him holding my hand but it really was what I had been wanting to happen since he had told me he loved me. So I am just basking in the perfection that is my life at the moment. Oh perfection...so good....

      Hum...what can I say...I fell very proud that I rembered all my log in info today. It is very intersting to switch computers. Well anyway...still happy even though i had to work today. We made *RED* kool aid! Yeah samart idea and we walked down to Barnes and Noble which killed alot of time for which I was happy. It is always good to do stuff like that. And I made 15$! So I am that much closer to my trip to France! Fun stuff...I get to go for 3 weeks 1 week in the counrty, one week in home stays and one  wekk in Paris. And it is the chance of a life time and i would get to spend my sweet 16 there! So the whole thing is gonna rock, Well this is distracting em from talking on the phone, ha, so deepness later...

      Need to actually do more spilling than I can allow myself with the deepness. If no one guess Paul told me he loved me last night which was the best thing that could have possibly happened to me at this point. And being called perfect by your boyfriend doesn't hurt much either. I am just overflowing with happyness right now. Nothing can hurt me...nothing...god I didn't know I needed this so much. So much I couldn't say until this was out in the open. So many unnamed feelings that I have found to be love. It's can be discribed by nothing but being perfect. We've been talking alot about the future. This relationship is gonna last for a long time. We've decided 3 years at the least. Till the end of high school. And I love that prospect! I mean how many high school guys are ou there who would seriously stay with a girl for 3 years! The rest are too concered with how many of them they can possibly date in a year! So I consider myself very very lucky to be going out with Paul. I realised last night, while sitting through the most boring barbeque, that I could see not see myself with anyone but him...and i love it! I get to spend three years of the most stressful dating with the greatest guy I could even hope for! I am excited for the future and whatever it may bring me!

      Love does strange things to our mentalities. It makes us happy in the most impossible situations. It melts even the hardest, coldest of hearts. Just saying those words, "I love you" makes you light. It dulls the pain of life and we are surrounded with the comfort of pure, intence happyness. It is an intense emotion unlike any other. But the intenseness of it is dulled by the sheer amount of good emotion it brings. Who knew that one person saying three little words to another could set a wave of this extrme emotion on the other, and themselves. It's all consuming. But it brings on the haze of happyness. reality ceses to exist for a moment and we are at peace. To be in love is perfect and it is the only thing that is needed in life, before it's abrupt end.

      Today..I feel like being very emotional and sentimental so I chose my quote accordinly. It means "Now I know what love is." And I seem to feel that way. Obnoxiously happy and the whole thing. This really has been so good for me, having a boyfriend. I've needed to be softened for so long and I haven't really even realised it. I still am having trouble expressing myself emotionaly but I slowly work on that as Paul begins to put down his beariers also. we spend alot of time talking about the future. This is gonna last us a long time. At least untill the end of high school, we are sure of it. I know it sounds very optomistic but we seem to be so well suited for each other that there is no possible thing to get in the way. And I know I want it to last a long time because I am just loving this. Who knows where it will take us. The relationship definately has the potential. Now the final obsticle, telling ou parents. We have been waiting for his dad to come home from Iraq to tell them. So we have concoted a plan where i tell them all at dinner. I know I should be nervious about it but I don't seem to be. I know that they could turn on us and ruin this perfect thing that we have going but it doesn't concern me. right now I am just lost in the moment and really don't want to come back to reality.

The best anyone could ever get...yeah and that's why I've been insanely happy. Yesterday was our one week aniversary and he came over to my house and we hung out while tring to ditch my brother then I went to his soccer game. It was really great cause he got down on one knee and asked me out again cuse the first time was kind of an imcomplete rush. So yeah it was great. I find it a real relef not to be single any more. Don't have to impress anybody and don't have to worry about all those other scarey guys...yay! He's my first boyfriend and I'm loving it...

      Yet again...I am back to rant! And rant and rant some more about my boring meaningless life! Ha what fun for me...Yes well I was finnaly enjoying the slience after posting when the children burst in the door in a grove bearing a rented x-box...which is noisey and I hate already...I was very comfortable sewing in my chair in the family room where the big screen is, which they insisted on using, and so i just drownd them out with my I pod which worked other then the fact that I was forced to listen to my Good Charotte cd because I needed something guitarish to drown them out sucessfuly. and along with drownding out the children i drowned out my mother! Which really made me happy because she is getting on my nerves...massively...and I realised that she never leaves...and it makes me mad...At least my dad has been home and has been occupying her with house stuff...but the boredom has set in since Paul has been grounded for the weekend and i am left with no other people who are as pathetic as myself to talk to...they all have lives...grrrrrr on them...I'm gonna call him tomorrow and hopefully break the monotony of our insanley boring lives...And gotta see if we can do something on a random day... I start working on monday...steady babysitting job that is...5$ an hour for one of Brit's friends and his two siblings...the other details of this job are unknown because my mom was the one who talked to this lady who will be my employer...But hey it's money which i need...I am still conning myself into thinking that I'm gonna have a car soon. My mom has been making an endless loop of excuses from keeping for even going so far as to actually go to the dealership if only to look. Ha what a proposterous idea! But there has to be some magical way to find a good used car! Maybe it will just drive up someday! How could looking even make sence? Bah...evil her...i want her to go away but she won't...damn...yet agian the hope of the car sustains me...Hum....more paragraph writing! i love it...it makes me feel complete...and slightly less pissed, depressed and bored! Ha it's a wonderful life...ha ha ha ha ha ha ha....

      Just got back from the most horendeous place on earth, the grocery store...I spend an hour wandering around after my mother, who obsessively askes me what I want and what we need. Then finnaly when I decide I need to go get something so disapears and reappears in the most obscure place in the store...usually somewhere she has already been after I spend 5 minutes seacrching up and down every isle, which I have become too good at...By that time shear and complete bordom sets in and i wander mindlessly, after getting thouroughly pissed about why she just ditches me. finnaly after going up and down every isle 5 times and hearing, endlessly " What do you want? What do we need? Is this  okay?" we finnaly get to the salvation of the cash regester where scarey old men bear perolusly down on me as I unload the cart and read the tabloids. But the upside is that I did lear that they can make everthing possible low carb and that I would by bad food just because there is a bunny on the package...So I finnaly out of the vile grocery store and now must rant about something that isn't so mindless.  Today would be the birthday of my little brother. fun. He has his friends here who stair at me when I am on the phone, eating or on the computer. But I have a bit of salvation from them as they are currently mini golfing. I do realise though that they all seem so much more normal and slightly less annnoying then my own brother. And after realising that the really quiet one that was sitting across from me was the kid that I start babysitting on Monday made me fell really good. The little children seem to like me so no revolutions or anything. But Paul got grounded and couldn't come save me...so i really have been bored out of my mind. No one on the computer, no one here to tak to, no one to call...That's just great... But...rachel did meet Paul over the phone today. It was very interesting...at least for me...and all seemed to go well. yeah...for it being so boring i seem to have a lot to talk about. That's good. Umm...yeah gonna go watch VH1 and finish my quilt while pondering how to get my self to stop being so fricking bored. ...

      Well my mother is driving me nuts. we went tot the MLCC for lunch today and we had to wait around for Brit to come off of the golf course for a half an hour. I would like to mention that this was at noon when I hadn't eatten anything all day and it was 95 degrees. Finnaly I got her to give up on the idea of waiting for the evil little duck and got her to tell them in the pro shop that we were eatting. So finnaly I got to eat something and i see my father...the tolerable one...and so he comes into eat with us and is ordering as we get our food. I actually ate all of my chicken for once and he is just starting on the main corse as I am done. So I have to wait...doing nothing...while he finishes eating...hoping that then we can go home since i am bored out of my mind. Then my dad leaves with my brother as one of his friends and his mom sit down at the table next to us to eat. Then my mom fells the urge to talk ot them till they fnish eatting their lunch...so by this time I have been there for two frinkingly boring hours...and then my mom got mad at me for being rude...yeah...so that's my ranting story of the day...Not like anyone really cared but it was something to do and a good way to keep getting my paragrah blog entries...

Which I am actually getting! Tan! For once in my life! It's so insanely crazy...Yeah sure as I say that the clouds roll over...hum...can'type...maybe it's because I just got up and haven't been doing anything more stimulating than read articles about polititions arguing over gay marrage...Still stand the way I always have...you all know that...if not go into the archives you smart ones...I really should be enjoying this time of silence cause God knows I'm not gonna hear much of it today...Yay my sanity is really gonna be gone!

      Geeze I confuse myself. I had to get into this by another computer and I forgot all my log in information. But I eventually rembered thus I am here! Yeah well anyway...just watched Cold Mountain. It was such a great movie. Though very sad and very bloody but it really puts one into perspective. I love it when movies ment to entertain do that. Seems like all of our society has gone to trash thus far...

      Over the week I had this war in Iraq touch me and hit close to home. One of the ladies at the quilt store got her first letter from her son saying that he was going to war. I stood by and watched as she broke down to tears. I saw as each of the ladies in turn cheered her up, but yet she cried as she laughed. I saw her daughter rush out of the room when she heard news of the letter. I heard her story of how she wrote him twice a week or more and how much they both missed him. This war has hit close to home and put people I love into pain that they don't deserve.

Finnaly back to the computer again! Geeze I was going totally insane. I have really become dependent on this thing...oh well...might as well feed it! right? Yes well I made my typical quilt in a week. My obsessive compulsive side came out full force. It didn't do to much for sleeping. I went and hung out at the lake on Friday which was fun. I think I may have gotten what may be suficable as a tan! And i went shoping in Missoula...got really coolio stuff. I was so insanely happy. Poor me the shopaholic....Yeah well other than that...I fell there is nothing else more excting to say about my week other than it was boring and I finished the once and Future King for English...which actually was quite good...so yeah bye people!

So I think I might just randomly write whatever comes to mind...first of something I wrote while bored...I think it's amusing" In a world where strange produce can be made into bread..." Don't know where it's going but I was thinking about the zuccinin bread that was on the counter. And crap I think I'm getting sick again! My throught is sore and all of my muscles have been acing and I've just felt awful...so I'm either getting sick of I'm just tired and I burned my mouth on soup. Coause I know I've burned my tounge but didn't think I burned the rest of my mouth. Oh yes getting my hair cut soon...I am actually thinking of bangs...which I haven't had for 3 years...So i don't know but I think I'd look better with them so I might shoot myself later but oh well...yeah well that's all the stuff that i had thought of before I started writing! Yeah I actually plot all this stuff all out...who knew...and going back to the search for conversation topics...

      It is so good to have Paul back. I have been soothed back to normality since I had been getting really excited and really emotional for the past two days. I don't feel so alone anymore. It's really a good feeling to be loved and to know that you can talk to the peopson you love. I began feeling really hopeless when he was gone, but I really should stop dwelling on that...I'm just happy again. Which rocks but we have to tell our parents soon, no wait! I have to tell our parents soon, oh yeah, can't forget about that, and I am kinda stressing out so that sucks! ha ha...it all just goes in one big circle...

      Can't sleep...again. I keep turning over thoughts restlessly in my head. Thoughts of Paul mostly. Now is one of those points when my mind slows down enough for me to really miss him. It's been just keeping thoughts of him going lately, not thoughts of him being gone, that has kept me from missing him as much as I thought I would. But when I do start missing him it gets preaty intense. My only sconsolence tonight is that he's coming back tomorrow. I think I forgot to mention that I talked to Rachel today and her boyfriend was at here house I so I kinda got to meet him over the phone. I liked him, he had a nice voice. And I admire him for putting up with Rachel! They kept kissing each other while talking to me which was acward but I laughed at them, thought about Paul and spun in circles which made it all good. Now let's see if I can go back to sleep since my eyes won't focus anymore, but maybe it's because i don't have my glasses on...hum...I don't know...feel preatty tired though....

      Ha I got to use the weed eater this morning! I was way too amused. I killed absoulutely everything in sight and sometimes that might not have been such a good thing...Poor orlo, he was outside and I was weed eating near him and he got grass in his face! He now thinks i'm crazer than ever...Thank God for orlo though! He has been the only thing that has kept me sane/occupied while paul has been gone. Oh hey today is my 3 week anniversary! I spent it weed-eating and watching tv! Fun! But Paul comes back tomorrow! So that makes me REALLY excited! Ha ha...Radiohead rocks, it can drown out a weed eater and I have been listening to Pablo Honey all morning so I think my brain is a bit fried...the bordom is about l.......l this close....

      50th post! not bad huh? Anyway I just got back from the keith urban concert. Very good but it made me miss Paul more than i already do! some of those lyrics were so intense that I just couldn't stop thinking boaut him! I know it sounds funny but it's true. I realise I am so lucky to have him. I know we've got something special. I amuse myself by picturing the couples walking stiffly down the hall holding hands and the girls who use guys and vise versa and I am just so glad that Paul and I have something so much better than that! sure it's only been about 3 weeks and we've only gone on one date but I already know that this is gonna be the real deal. and for that i thank God every day.

      I miss Paul so much! I thought about him all today while I babysat. But I get tomorrow off and my mom won't be home so that rocks! But back to the topic. I really do miss Paul. I hate not having him here to talk to when ever I want. Especially since now he is my boyfriend, though I still can't really think of him as my boyfriend because I seem to be registering that as something more impresonal that what I have with him. Though tomorrow is our 3 week anniversary already! I can't belive it's already been that long. Though I realise as I keep this count I am wishing away my summer. Nut oh well. Next year isn't stressing me out right now.  My topic of thought last night was on Paul actually being my boyfriend and how I won't have to be alone any more. *hopefully* I'll always have someone to eat lunch with and go to pep rallies with and all that other good stuff where i am terrified to be alone. So this is exactly what I need considering my fear of people! Ha well this stuff kinda only makes sence in my mind so I'm gonna stop. Tonight I may be able to come up with something deep...

      It seems all I talk about anymore is love, lonelyness, My boyfriend, Paul, Missing Paul, Love, Paul, Paul, Paul...and so on an so forth. I try not to be one of thoses people that just drowns on and on about my boyfriend but this is my chance to spill. So if you don't like it! Don't read it! Isn't that why we live in America? Freedom of speach? Well that and the food that will eventually kill us in ten years. And on that note!... Last night I went back and read the blog entries that Pual wrote about me and it kinda gave him more of a persona in my mind since I haven't talked to him in two days! I kinda forgot his personality and just dwelled on him as my boyfriend. So the emotions hit me then. I really do miss him alot. I miss having him right there to talk to when I come home and I miss having someone to rant about my day to. I realise now how much a part of my life that he has become. I now know how truely good it is that this relationship is gonna go on for a long time because i don't think I would be able to go back to normality with out him.

      First off, something I wrote last night at around midnight: Paul, How can I thank you for the sleepless nights. I toss and turn tring to rid my head of thoughts of you if only so I can sleep for a few hours. It's funny, you haven't even left town and I already desperately miss you. I love you. In such a short period of time you have penetrated my mind and my heart Even with you gone it is almost like you are here because i think of you every moment. YOu have become part of me and you have become my life. One of the few along the way that i have truely had a connection with. I readress your question; How much do I love you? I love you more than anything. With all my heart and all my spirit. I lve no one as much as I do you. The light sears my tired eyes and I go back to bed to be racked with more thoughts of you. But it is truely worth it. I love you.                           Halsey  I have so many fellings right now that they can't even be put into words. my head is realing tring to even find a solotary thought to write about. But one stands above the others and that is love. I can't belive I found it at fifteen or that it would have effected me as deeply as it has. But it is true. And it is killing me that I can't talk to Paul, the one that I love. I am alone now but I have regained my life before I found love. It really is nothing good. I have been forced back into reality and I must say that I have become quite fond of my dream world. I don't need reality. But i seem to be back here.   It is easyer not to miss when you occupy yourself and pretend like nothing is amiss at all. that seems to be what i am doing today. I watched soccer relentlessly and then occupied myself on keeping busy. It helps but I know soon Paul's absence will sink in. The feelings of sadness and lonelyness in the world have been pushed temporaily out of my mind. But just seeing the couples at the park today made me jelous because my boyfriend is away. The only thing that keeps me sane are the mere thought of his return and the whole future that we have layed out in frount of us.   I am running myslef in circles and therefor need to stop.
