            Well, i'm very sick of hearing those terrorist kidnapping people and       threatening countries to pull out of         Iraq.       Well, can't they just stop all their       doing and give the world some peace.

         Just don't understand why i can't keep myself settled down on a name. So guys, which one is better;              Styke           Stike           Staik          Hmmm, guess i seriously need some advises from people. Please rate them with factors like: look of it, the ease of pronouncing it. Rate them on against 10 points. I personally prefer Styke.     *LOL* Come to think about it, feel that it's kind of lame, isn't it? Well, thanks anyway.

Anyway, with every sucessfull completion of my java practicals, i think i'm startin to love it. Hope i can keep that passion up for a long time...    &nbsp;  anyway, i'm havin muscle aches all over my body now... gosh i'm so tired man. i spent my whole yester-evening workin out in the gym. I've ever never felt my arms so stiff before man... serious lor. We ran for 2.4km... and did weights and the regular push-ups and crunches. I was actually rather disappointed with my sef for my performance. damn, i feel weak!

       gosh... i'm so bored attending this web publishing lesson. Hmmm, i can't even hear what my lecturer is talking about, he seems to be talking to himself... kekeke. I kind of pity him sometimes, its like no one's listening to him, which makes him look like an old fool  anyway, i'm planning to do a better site than my current one after a complete this module. Hopefully, i can come out with some thing nice. : )  Well, i guess that's all i got to say, better get back to my lesson.

          i was installing my CS software, i finally got my serial number... but, due to the illness call 'itchy hand', i blow everything off... i realise that the problem lies in the installer itself. The thing is... now i can't do any graphic editing, T.T... which means development for my website gotta be delayed once again...       Check out my site,  urlLink www.geocities.com/wao_lao  hope you guys can enjoy it... though, there's nothing much there... kekeke... i'm just staring out to revamped it, just a noivce, still learning    Cheers, enjoy

         Yoz... today is a fun, stinky and tiring day.  Firstly, we got a game of soccer RIGHT AFTER our lunch, well, that isn't something real healthy to do isn't it? Anyway, i guess the guys can't be bothered by that too. We went to ICT Club to borrow a ball, but rather dissappointed by the lock-up of the room. I mean, hmmm, shouldn't it be open for school hours? We got a ball from... someone else, and we got engage in a match after that. I played bad, lost some skills... though i don't really have any. *lol* -.0"  We ended up in another match after our lessons, this time the 'big' guys. It was a fast match, quick and rather decisive. I was exhausted then, after being fooled (according to darran) by them. So, i did some jogging with Darran too, and some exercises and ended my time in school with a dinner @ KFC.  oh, by the way, any of u got general Zero Hour to lend me?

         Agenda of the day: - Non-stop chatting for Mathematics lesson                               - About the Math quiz  Hello, people, well firstly, i'm rather irritated just like our Math lecturer. I couldn't understand why my classmates can't give him some silence. I mean, why can't they just talk softly. I thought he was gonna blow up again like what he did few weeks back, lucky i was wrong.  Onto the quiz, i got myself of a computer with an optical mouse, yeah! *lol* no big deal but just like it when i don't have to fuss over those 'balless-feel-alike' mouse. Anyway, i got real nervous over the quiz, when i got stuck over at a question. Hmmm, i received some help from a friend of mine. I helped in one question in return... well, to my surprise, the first thing he got out, was an announcement on his aid. Interesting, i thought. Anyway, i was dissapointed but coundln't really bothered by that thing. He's just like that, i should've know.  I guess i describe him till like his a bad guy huh? Nope, he ain't a bad guy. He's one with good sense of human, a guy who talks 'yi qi', brotherhood if i'm not wrong.  K, that's all, hope tommorrow i can do some jogging with Darran ya...

         Well, today ain't really a good day man. first thing in the morning i've spent more than 15 mins waiting for my bus. Hmmm, feeling rather tired after my yesternight's work out... and i had a gd slp in the bus, so it's like 1.5 hrs of slp in the bus.Ended up late in class....  I seems to lost my touch in my Java programming, envy Kang Heong's skills in it. Becasue i was still stuck @ my practical 4... when i'm suppose to be doin the next practical. But i gotta hand it to Vanchin, he was great, thanks to him... i seems to catch some 'balls' back... *lol*  then it was Goy, he seems pissed off bout our classes, as the same old reason, we keep talking. But yet again... this module's topic ain't interesting at all man + Goy's voice it's worst. sickening... he scolded one of us.. i ain't sure if it was me or wat... but he was lookin @ my direction... Well, i was rather shock that some of the people, skipped the class... something really not appropriate.... feel that that ain't giving the lecturer any respect...  anyway, then it was a rather fun after school... was thinking of jogging with darran... but didn't expect the sun to scorch the track... it was too hot.. hence i decided not to jog... was rather disappointed... guess darran too... wasted his time... sorry darran... anyway then we were called for a game of badminton... it was a very bad one.... no court... and i ain't sure wat everybody is doing... even me... we play no badminton, it was like a kid game. I'm not too sure what's up with everybody. Can't even play a proper game  All i can hope is to hope that tml will be a better day... : )
