      Remember when you were a kid and you had to ask to get to eat anything out of the kitchen? I can remember eating cheese slices that I stole and frantically hiding them so my mom would not find them. Wow how things have changed cause here is it four in the am and I am eating leftover spaghetti. Freedom is liberating I must say.   Work was uneventful but last night was great. I got to see my first stomach pumping. We had a 21 yr old female come in who said she had taken four loritabs, two vicoden, and a whole bottle of tylenol. Then she added that she had washed them down with a couple of Hardee's cup sized glasses of hunch punch. WOW! So we proceeded to pump her out, wow what a site. We had to wear these biohazard suit looking things, visors, and gloves. I even said at one point good LORD it looks like we are on the movie Outbreak and Jamie the nurse going in with me followed with boy you don't even understand how grateful you'll be that we have these on. Well it didn't take me long to realize the full truthfulness in her statement. PUKE covered that room before it was over. Well, it was until after we had emptied her out that she decided to confess that she was only trying to get attention from her girlfriend that had broken up with her and yes I said girlfriend, not trying to kill herself. What an idiot, I swear. That's a heck of a lot to go through to get some attention right there. Can we say Decatur General West? Come on people.   Jeff came over before work yesterday. Actually I think it was the first time I have ever cooked for him. It was pretty good. He really like it but I screwed up cause when he went to go get a second helping I mention that it tasted funny when in actuality I mean it tasted different that it has in the past, and then he didn't want to go back. Oh well more for me, ha ha ha j/k. He came up to work later on last night looking like Willie Nelson with a hankerchief on his head, it was so cute. He had gone running and I guess he wears those to catch the sweat.   Well, this definitely goes down in the books as longest blog for JBizzle. I am tired so I am going to go watch Full House and go to bed. Till next time..

      I finally made it home from work and went straight to bed so when I woke up today I felt somewhat refreshed. Last night was crazy at work. If you watch the news I am sure you saw about the murder/suicide that occured in the parking lot of our hospital. The whole hospital was in a tease yesterday.   Jeff came over when he got off work and we just hung out for a while till it was time to go to momma and daddy's house to eat. Got over there around 6:30. We went out and played with their neighbors dog for a bit. He is so cute but they don't take very good care of him though, I feel sorry for him. Left there around 10 we were both pretty tired. Jeff does really well with the parents, they like him a lot. That is something that is very important to me.  Well anyway, that's all I got, till next time...

      Man, I don't think I am going to make it one more day. I am so tired. Last night was exciting, we had a lady who came in having a heart attack and we ended up having to medflight her to Huntsville. So that took up some time last night at work. She was only 46 and she had the cutest little eight year old boy. He watched the helicopter fly away, and I about teared up when they took off he stood there and waved at it. It was so sweet and sad at the same time. I guess sometimes I get in a routine of things that I don't stop to realize that the people we are working on have families just like mine and it affects me when I see things like that.  I was so tired all night and now that I am home, I can't seem to fall asleep. I need to though cause it's not long before I have to go back.  Jeff is wanting to go clothes shopping tomorrow, I hope I will be able to function or he will be looking funny in the stuff my delerious mind may pick out. HA HA. Then my mom wants us to come eat over there, I don't know if he'll go for that but I sure am up for it. We'll see I guess.  Well, I am going to try and sleep for a few, till next time...

      Usually after a five day streatch of weird hour shifts I start to get eternally sleepy. I mean I never got a chance to go to bed before work yesterday except for like an hourm so that doesn't count. I was draggin' last night. I left at three and went straight to my bed, now it's 5:45pm and I still feel like I could sleep another 12 hours. Speaking of twelve, I have to work two more twelves, tonight and tomorrow and then I only get one measly day off till I have to start allll over again. WOW, I am going to die young I can feel it.  Jeff brought me some chicken fingers from logans last night. They were pretty good. I have some left so I guess I will make me a chicken salad tonight.   Can I just say that Sundrop has to be the best drink ever invented. Man I am to sundrop, like an alcoholic is to liqour or beer.   I CAN'T WAIT TILL I AM OFF, it feels so liberating even though it only lasts for one day.Well that's all I gotta say for now, till next time...

      Wow, I never really sat down and realized how many crazy people I am around everyday. I mean I work with a lot of drug dependent nurses and then crazy patients, the list goes on and on.   I am sitting here watching good morning america and they just said "for those of you who take daily vitamins, make sure you tune in tomorrow and find out what we have discovered is actually in those vitamins, could they be harmful" Well that's just great, I take vitamins. Maybe I should reconsider popping that pill today, it could just kill me but I won't know TILL TOMORROW, good lord.  The agenda today is a little more eventful than it was yesterday. I am going to do wedding stuff this morning with a november wedding bride whose wedding I am planning. I am so sleepy I must add. I hope to make it back soon so I can sleep some.  Jeff did the sweetest thing for me yesterday.  First he brought me some dinner before I went to work, then as I was leaving I saw this yellow card poking out of my purse, it said the sweetest stuff...AWE! I am so lucky.  Well I guess that's about it, till next time...

      Well I just completed my first day back at the old job a rooney. Nothing exciting happened last night just the usual EKG's and breathing treatments. No fun stuff like stabbings, drug users, car wrecks, you know stuff like that. Now don't get my wrong, I don't wish any bad things to happen to people but it does bring excitement into the job. Sure does make those 4 years of college worth it.   Anyway, not much on the agenda for today other than sleep, get up, and do it all over again. I have four more days of this till I get an off day. Man this can get rough at times, oh well the money is nice.   I have to admit that things in my life have been a little strained lately but things are starting to get back on track. I just hope they continue to get better, I am going to keep working hard so they do so.  Well I know I am getting off to a boring start but I am sure things will get more interesting.  Till next time...

      This is my last day off for a while so I took major advantage of it. I slept allll day. Now here I sit eating leftover chocolate pie and my hair is all on one side of my head. Perfect time for the sweepstakes to knock on my door.   Well I haven't gotten to watch my shows in a long time but tonight is my tuesday night line-up. It starts with My Life According to Jim, and ends with the Real World. WOO HOO!! TV is the best. I guess that is all on my agenda for tonight.   Till next time..

      To be a blogger that is. Well here it is, after all the months of begging Jeff can finally be satisfied that I am blogging. I don't really have an exciting lifestyle but I will try to keeps these interesting. Seeing as how my day has just gotten started I don't have anything to tell you as of right now so check in later this afternoon and I will fill you in on my daily activities. Oh yeah and try not to explode with anticipation.

      I am a little concerned with Jeff and his sleeping. It seems to me that one minute he will be like WOO HOO, let's be awake and stuff and then in a split second there he goes as if it were a comatose state. He feels nothing, hears nothing, and if by some miracle from God he wakes up he is so drugged sounding you can't understand him. I mean it just isn't normal. Even the cops that came to house (ha ha ha) couldn't wake him with 45 minutes of beating with police sticks, GOOOOODDD LORD. Oh well maybe one day I will convince him to have a sleep study done. He always is so tired and stuff so maybe that is what's wrong he must have a disorder.   Anyhoo, I have been off for the last two days and although it was nice being away from the drama, I didn't feel like doing anything so I sort of wasted my whole time off, expcept for the fact I got to spend time with Jeff of course.    Don't you just hate it when you talk to someone and they have a boyfriend and they are like "me and my boyfriend this and me and my boyfriend did that, Oh i just love my boyfriend" and then the next minute they are like "let me rant about what my boyfriend did last night or BLAH BLAH BLAH COMPLAIN COMPLAIN COMPLAIN" TO me that just makes girls look stupid and crazy. Seems like everywhere I go and people I talk to are ranting about their boyfriends. Ya know that is why we girls have such a bad rep. with boys in the first place. We gripe over stupid crap and then our boyfriends blow it up even more cause they dated someone in the past like the type of girl that i am refering to and then you look crazy for no reason. So i guess what I am trying to say is SHUT UP, no one cares about what's going on with you and your man. NO one could care less what he said to make you mad or what he did to piss you off. Of course you will get some fake sympathy from the person you are telling during your story but as soon as you get up and leave they will talk about how stupid and psycho you are, I MEAN COME ON!!   Ok, so much for that I guess i ended up ranting a little myself oh well just a little situation I wanted to address. Well, I am off, till next time...

      So yeah it was a crazy weekend. Let me tell my side of the story since Jeff left out some key information. So there I was talking to him around 11 or so and I said, "Hey my food is here, let me call you back" he says "ok". Well, I ate and then had to run to the ER to save a couple of lives, you know how it is and then I proceeded to call him back around 12. I dial the number, ring ring and then I get, this:  Strange Man: Hello Me: Hey Him: Hey Me: Whatcha' Doing Him:  Nothing much, what are you doing (at this point I realize, it is not Jeff) Me: Who is this Him: Who is this (man don't you just hate that) Me: This is Jessica, who are you Him: Well, who are you wanting to talk to Me: Jeff (and without missing a beat he says) Him: Jeff isn't available!!! ME: slams the phone down thinking "what the crap, did I dial the wrong number"  So, I picked the phone up and hit redial and I checked four hundred times to make SURE that I dialed the right number, and I had. So at this point I was really confused. So naturally I called it back this time, with the hopes of that man answering again but now it would only ring once and then stop. Well I told my fellow nurses about it and they convinced me something was up. I called his cell phone numerous of times, so many that any normal person in the deepest of sleep would have woken up... and got no answer. Yes, I took it into account that it was late and he was probably in his daily coma but the fact that that man answered like that just really ran all over me. I knew that if I called anyone to go check, Jeff would die but my friend Mary just insisted that she knew a cop in Moulton and he wouldn't mind riding over there and getting the 411. So she called. Well he went out there and knocked and knocked and knocked but there was no answer and he even drew a concern because No normal person would sleep through that and since everyone else in the complex had woken up and come out he should have to. They fianlly called me back and said that I should come to Moulton and meet the cop to make sure he had the right place. So when I got off work at 3am, I headed that way. Well, he met me there and we both knocked and yelled and everything, still, no answer. He even called another cop out there to come check it out to decide what to do. In the mean time his neighbors came out and were all "he's a good boy I think, I mean he's real quiet and stuff but I don't think he causes no trouble" and I am like GOOD LORD he is going to kill me but I was too far in it to do anything else. So the head cop is like Ok, so I am going to go in now cause this is weird and I said "wait let me just try ONE MORE TIME" knowing that if he busted in and jeff was asleep, the concern would then be switched to me cause he WOULD KILL ME. Well, sure enough the Lord had laid hands upon him and he arose from his comatose state to come to the door. GOOOOOOOD LORD!!! As expected he was highly ticked but the more I explained my side the more he saw the love in it and forgave me.  We met my parents sat. night and they had a good time teasing him about it. I think that eased some of his angerness towards me. That was a strange night too, my dad of all people was all wanting to go play putt putt. Jeff was the winner and is set to play my dad when we go to florida in a few weeks for the title. But what he doesn't realize is that I hold the title in the go kart division and he will never live to take that away =) Ok so we are a gay family but we like to take advantage of all the things the beach offers for entertainment.   So, I finally made it home from work, managed to clean this nasty house to a sparkling shine and I am about to go make my watermelon fruit basket to take tonight. We have a girl who is leaving and she is very cool, we hate to loose her. If I think about it I will take a picture and post it on my next entry for all to see. Well, I guess that is it, till next time...
