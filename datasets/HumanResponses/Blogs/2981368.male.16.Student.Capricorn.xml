       Woohooo! After lots of annoying and endless work, I've finally managed to get it all up to date. Citizenship coursework...IT coursework...ahhhh. All done. What a loverly feeling.  TUESDAY: So easy...did nothing but discuss ebay, blackadder and cliff jumping all morning. Then double PE...always fun. Suprisingly, Holly  didn't  mention asking Nat out once on the way home. Not once! Though she did tell me REPEATED TIMES exactly where she and Nat would be on Friday, and how I should join them. Pffffft. Stayed up past midnight doing cwk *shudder* kinda fell asleep working, so half my citizenship will probably be stuff like "76yhbygh vtxfcred4f" - Yes, that was the result of hitting my head against the keyboard. Seriously! And oh well.  WEDNESDAY: Wooo, field re-opened. Whoopee-yayness. Handed in IT and citizenship cwk, as well as the french convo book which was due in....about a month ago? So me sorta happy 'cos thats 95ish% of all my work done. And the rest is so easy I could do it in my schleeeeeep. Walking to IT was....interesting. Several plots involving setting hundreds of water snakes into the sewage system were revealed, ending in a great mental image of someone running into a hospital: *Nurse* "How may I help you sir?" *Random person, butting in* "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, A SNAKE BIT MY ASS!!!"  IT itself was fun, as usual. Those random conversations with Nat get kah-ray-zee-er every time. And pretty much everyone said how we're exactly like each other. Hmmm. Bah. Then Katie did her subtle thingo...lol. *Row in IT goes Katie - Me - Nat* *Katie* "Pssst...hey Nat...you going to the prom with Ben?" *Nat* "Yeah" *Katie* "Really? Do you think he can hear us?"  Katie really needs her head examined. She also told us that she'd had to block ebay from her home comp so she didn't get tempted to buy more Busted concert tickets. THEY SUCK DAMNIT!  Heh. Tomorrow is the last day of term...and I won't be there for half of it. Yayness. Then on Saturday...the Bristol City VS QPR match. Another golden oppertunity for my dad to make himself look like a complete idiot. Oh well. Should be fun.  In the words of collective soul: "oooooooo-oooooooooohhhhhhh...I'm not the one.....oooooooo-oooooooooohhhhhhh...I'm not the one....."

       Bah. Too much work, not enough incentive.  Good stuff: Bishop got kept behind picking up paper he'd flicked in science. (ha-ha) Blackadder came 2nd in the top British sitcoms thingo, Vicar of Dibley came 3rd. (woooo!) Double PE tomorrow, always fun. (yaaaay) I have tickets to go see Bristol City play on Saturday (woo and yay)  Bad stuff: Citizenship cwk is in tomorrow. And I haven't even started it yet. (SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT) We have yet more bloody exam papers in maffs. (booooooo) I ate too much food inbetween games at badminton. (bleugh)   Holly seems to still be insane. But good at badminton. So she better be doing badminton tomorrow in PE. Or I'll have to beat the holy crap out of Olly and Phil again. (No offense guys) Either way, double PE and the walk home will be kinda crazy and fun, probably with lots of "Hey, thats not fair!"s, "stop smashing it!"s and "pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaassssssssseeeeeeeeee"s. Eehee.  And one great quote from Blackadder 4: Blackadder - "The only attractive woman around here is carved out of stone, called Venus, and is standing in a fountain in the middle of the town square with water coming out of her armpits." George - "So, we're a bit stuck, eh." Blackadder - "You can say that again George. We're in the stickiest situation since Sticky the stick insect got stuck on a sticky bun."

       Coursework, coursework and...what? More coursework? Bleugh. Coursework is due in on Thurs...so I spent pretty much the whole weekend doing it. No foolin'. And somehow, I managed to only get Tasks A, C and F done. Some is done already...but argh. Very tiring, boring and generally crap. Though I have got double PE to look forward to (Tuesday). That should be fun. Apart from that the extra half hour I gain from it will be spent listening to Holly go completely crazy, then spend ages doing...*gasp* more coursework. Whoopee doo. What incredible fun.   Oh, one good thing from todays coursework blast: I had to make a flyer/poster of some kind, and what I made I'm kinda proud of...and might have to sell it or something. Eehee. http://botprojectx.topcities.com/taskc4.gif

       Lots of pain today *Yaaaaay*. Jack was (for no apparent reason) doing TKD moves in Science, and managed to knife hand strike me in the neck *geughk*. At lunch, Tim punched me in the nose trying to get that damned balloon *arrrgh*. And asshole of the century Bishop not only stabbed me repeatedly with a compass in History, but elbowed me in the face in hockey.  But somehow...it was a good day! I got loads of chocolate off some person who I don't really know, had lots of supply teachers, and managed to recruit a grand total of 0 people for badminton. Lazy old... *grumble grumble*  More when I can be bothered to type it.

       Hm. Probably another short post...today was boring apart from History (lots of cake) and IT (lots of funny conversations). Science...Bishop needs to learn something: there is no way I'm asking in a lesson. Not even if he set himself on fire and jumped out the window as part of a deal. And Jack should shut up 'cos he really isn't helping.   Oh, another good thing was that I managed to find Andy Craig at lunch. That kid rules. He plays badminton at a county level in an under-17 (ish) team (despite only being in yr 7). And his form tutor is cool.  Woot.

       Dont really know what to say about today...it was ok in parts, crap in others. Jack really needs to listen to what Nat is saying. Before he can persuade me to make a complete idiot of myself.   "Up yours Springfield!"

       Today didn't go so bad. PSE, Geog and Sci, didn't really do any work. As expected. Hadn't laughed that much in ages. Heehee. But then double IT was even funnier. Two hours of random "FQLEH!" "SPCUEEEUGH!" "FWLPWIBBIB!" shouting, along with laughing at Belgian spelling (the new name for typos. Also, Jehan "Big boss Veynom" Snyers d'Attenhoven has been declared the God of typos/Belgian spelling). And managed to get a fair bit of work done, too. And I'm still in a good mood from last night...ahhhhh.  One thing that did go wrong was that Harnet managed to completely feck up what I had planned for after school. Bah. Not exactly his fault, but he still managed to do the most annoying thing to me since the Barber/Bishop paper flicking campaign ended. Bahbahbah. And I still need to find the rest of the words to the Noddy theme tune...so cool...

       Wow....what a great day.  Started OK, for once it wasnt raining on the walk up to the 6th form for IT. Which wasn't so bad. Spent the whole hour trying to not do too much work, and hit my head against the keyboard/screen several times too. Let out late (again) so missed a fair chunk of English. Which didn't matter 'cos we didn't really do anything anyways. French...interesting. We had Ms Hovland as a supply, so naturally no real work was done, apart from finding random French words then insulting Sam with them. Science...again, interesting. Uncie Phil's WILF and WALT lists are getting v. annoying, but his willingless to let us play with those mini-whiteboards needs good comment. Of course, Jack and Bish kinda went crazy with classic messages like "Jack blows rabbits" "I'm with stupid" "Bish for men" "Nat say yes" among other things. And no good day would be complete without History, where we found out we're gonna be getting cake next lesson. Woo-hooooooo!  Then comes the fun part. The last few group games and finals of the SVJBC doubles tournament! Me and partner James Jones (one of a few friendly yr 10s) went and beat the bejeez out of Andy Craig and James McWilliam (the #1 seeds) 15-6, then beat some other people by 15-7 to get through into the semis. Semis, we beat Pete *the hair #2* Heath and Jamie Thomas 15-11 to get into the final against Andy and James. At one point, we were 10-3 down, but we pulled back and won 15-11.  Very  fast and tiring. Better roller coaster than the ones at Disney World if you ask me. =D  So yeah, I got this: http://botprojectx.topcities.com/woohoo.jpg and its still kinda kahrayzee that I won. And I'm in such a good mood I  might  go ask Nat tomorrow. That'd be the icing on the cake...mmmmm....cake....

       I just read this, and its kinda funny, methinks.   [01:44:05] Syn: Dear journal [01:44:12] Syn: Today was a boring day [01:44:20] Syn: I got three emails that I gave a damn about and a bunch of spam [01:44:43] Syn: I was lonely so I called the phone sex hotline six times. [01:44:51] Syn: Now I'm several hundred dollars in debt. [01:45:03] TembreFe`ll: Dear Syn. [01:45:07] TembreFe`ll: Do you think I can resond? I'm a book. [01:45:12] TembreFe`ll: Get a life. [01:45:14] TembreFe`ll: -Your journal. [01:45:48] Keir_Santage: Dear Journal, some sex-crazed woman kept phoning my cellphone this morning...   Heeheehee.  This time tomorrow, I will probably have the following: a) A medal of some kind (woohoo) b) A very painful leg (oweeeee) c) Several detentions (the fun never ends) d) A fresh pile of homework (Mr Essay Question, meet Mrs Lit Match!)  So I'm guessing it'll be another craptastic 5 hours of school. Whoopee-doo-ooo.

       Awww man, such a cool word. Must remember to use it frequently in normal conversation.   V. boring and craptastic day ( Wow, a blue car! ) as in, daytime TV, dog walks and watching last weeks hockey again. And the rugby (ha-ha Wales, England rules).  Found a song that pretty much sums up Nat, lol. (No, not in  that  way). And half the lyrics sound EXACTLY like things she's said...scary. Song is "Needs" by Collective Soul. You'll see what I mean by the end of the first verse. Meh.  Hopefully there'll be more woot-tastic stuff happenin tomorrow. But probably not *bah homework*

       ^^^ just about describes today. Right from the start, it was bound to be bad. Woke up waaay too late, walked to school in a damn monsoon. RE, had a really annoying test on 'Religion and the Media'. Which I failed badly. Threats of detention start to fly around. French, well, it was plain bad. So nearly got kept in for whole of break by laughing at how people were made to pronouce "Euro". Oh, I mean, "Uuuuuuurough". History, we got to (as the student teacher said) meet a REAL LIVE IRISH PERSON! Spent whole lesson with my class and Joe's class asking stupid questions like "Are you a part of the IRA?" "Have you ever bombed someone?" "Have you ever been arrested under suspicion of being a terrorist?" etc.  Lunch, had to wait around for ages for RE teacher to turn up so I could get a re-test for the mini-test I'd messed up earlier. Stupid teacher let me do the re-test without watching that I wasn't just taking the answers straight from my book. Her stupid loss, I guess. Still a complete waste of my time though. Science, Jack started only talking in either film quotes or 3rd person. Kinda scary. Though I did get an A- for my funny drawing of a big dragon and a hunk of meat that said "EAT ME" on the side, on the perfect predator/prey homework. Sir didn't even mind that one of the labels for the predator was "Feckin' Massive". Woot. Maths, got kept behind after school for 10 mins or so for not getting my homework in on time. Bah. This weekend better last longer than usual...or I'll have to shake my fist at the calender. Grrrrrr.  Oh well, badminton tonight. If my leg holds up I should be A-OK for the Finals of the doubles tourney on Monday...*erk* Which reminds me, anyone who is either any good at badminton, or who wants free coaching, should get down to the Marlwood sports hall Fridays from 7:30-9:30pm.  Meh. Back to the world of telling Jack to shut up, and that all his plans are the worst since Mr Hitler Senior said to his wife "How about it tonight?". Though Jacks plans generally don't have as much rascist persecution of Jews in them.

       OK. First things first. Jack, Holly, SHUT THE HELL UP AND ONLY START TALKING AGAIN WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!!!  Heres some quotes from todays conversation to help you understand the damned point  "Nat: I like you, but (as has DEFINITELY already been explained to her) I LIKE BEING BY MYSELF."  "Ben: and they all seem convinced that if they bug you enough you'll give up Nat: I'm like this 'cause I am. And they're wrong; they're just convincing me more that I'm right."  Does that get the message across, or am I gonna have to literally beat it into your head with some kind of garden tool?!  Ahem. Today was...to put it nicely...crap. Watched a video for about the 5th time this year in Geog about some Japanese farmer who laughs at the notion of himself dying. Onto History...the student teacher was being inspected by some random guy from some random Uni, so we all had to act like well-behaved little people who don't do anything wrong. Virtually impossible when Mark Bishop is sitting next to you being a complete idiot. As usual. English...sorta did a bit of work, mostly drawing funny little symbols on a big bit of paper. Maybe I should concentrate more and figure out wtf we're actually doing. Maths was boring, Science was even worse. Holly going on about Nat in every freakin way possible, and at every opertunity...Bishop flicking ink all over my face, etc.  Lunch was interesting though, some year 10s were doing 'chair bowling' where they were pushed along on the chair rack thingo into a load of chairs. Very interesting. See link to video below. And Nat, feel free to add anything to my rant =D  http://botprojectx.topcities.com/chairbowling.avi

       *walks in* Dude, this place is NUTS. Does Jack just randomly jump in with stuff all the time, or what? *scrolls down a bit*  Ah, shit. I thought Holly had given up. *does t3h bollocks dance*  And Buxton rocked. See LJ (www.livejournal.com/users/bulldogface) for random MemeGen ("The Downfall of Your Fandom") and loooooong Buxton report.   On a sidenote, I think I've probably shat all over any chances of getting good coursework by missing four days of school. Bah.    JACK YOU SUCK *runs away quick*

       Yes, Wednesday sucks. A lot. Lets see...RE...spent whole lesson discussing religion and the media with Lucy. *shudders* Science...sat next to Bishop. Sorta explains itself eh. IT...had to work like crazy to finish off this damned powerpoint thingo with absolutely no purpose. French...had a test (again) and lots of very annoying and repetetive work. Geography...more homework, had to watch a very crummy video about Osaka bay and all the strange little men who run around it making camera lenses. Woop-dee-doo. And then I had a 30-min detention after school because Mrs Ellis lost my homework. Bah.   Today seems to be the day all those lucky people in the Peru group get back from Buxton. So no doubt Jack will have plenty of stuff to say about *various things*. Things which will lead to me making myself look like an idiot tomorrow one way or another. What a great prospect eh?

       As predicted, good day. Only lesson where work was really being done was cut in half by me having to go and do nothing in particular. As in, the guy already knew everything he was meant to be talking to me about because we talked about it last lesson. Woohoo. PSE was nuts. Mat had brought in 3-4 cans of spray paint, which we kept 'borrowing' then 'testing out on the floor/chairs/desks'. Very fun. Oh, and then we found out that our Citizenship coursework is due in on the 30th (crazy 'cos we didnt even know we had any) and Mat proved that he needs help spelling. Classic examples like "shool" (school), "teatcher" (teacher) and "death treats" (death threats). So it sorta read like this: "In my coursework I will be comparing 2 articles about 2 shool boys who sent death treats to their PE teatcher." Quite funny really.  PE was also, as predicted, quite fun. Spent 45 minutes trying to teach Olly, Holly and Phil how to play squash properly, before going and beating them all at badminton. *mwahahahahahaha* After which I accidently ordered some kind of coffee from the bowls hall vending machine by randomly pressing buttons on it, then realising it still had money in *oops*, then ate as much vending machine chocolate as I could, nearly got myself stuck in that stupid little taxi thing in the Leisure Centre reception, then went down to Tescos with Holly & Sarah. At which I bought yet  more  food, this time a 5 pack of galaxy cake bars. And I also got one of them M&M chocice thingos from Holly. So right now I'm feeling like I've eaten waaaay too much, I'm tired and for no apparent reason my leg hurts.  On another front...Holly had some random/funny news about Nat. Between bouts of uncontrolable giggling I picked up that "shes taking the prom thing very seriously" "shes actually buying a dress" "the best way to make her dance would be to literally pick her up and carry her onto the dancefloor, then not let her go". By this point I'm starting to seriously doubt Holly's sanity. Then the  really  crazy stuff was said. The usual "awww, I'm sure she'll change her mind if I pester her some more..." "she likes you reeeeeeally...." "she'd say yes if you aaaaasked....." "goooooo oooooooon, ask heeeeeeeer....pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssseee........". By which point I am wondering if I should hit her with my squash raquet...or my badminton raquet. Hmmmm. Very difficult descision there. In the end I just laughed at everything she said. Seemed to work, as she shut up about it. But yeah. For once I was actually suprised by the amount of persuasive talk she managed in that time. And I'm not easily suprised...WOW, A BLUE CAR!  Ahhhhhh.  Why can't every day be a PE double day?

       Monday...urgh. Just as I predicted, there are going to be a fair number of essay practices etc in the short time the Peru group are away having fun in Buxton (argh its not fair damnit). Plots have begun already, as in, first lesson, and mostly involved Bishop making himself look stupid by suggesting nothing that is physically possible.  On the good side, I did reasonably well at badminton, and beat my way through the group stages of the doubles tourney, despite splintering one of ma toenails, and its double PE at the leisure centre tomorrow! What a skive...mwahahaha. I...mean...won't that be 2 hours of reasonably hard work which will be challenging and intelectually stimulating. Or maybe not. Oh, and I have my 'Post 16 options interview' tomorrow. I mean 'Miss 10 mins of English discussing some random load of nothing in particular with my History teacher'. So...a nice relaxing day of nothingness. What a nice change. Ahhhhhhhhhh.

       Not so bad a weekend. Spent it watching a load of DVDs (Blackadder, One foot in the grave, LotR etc), listening to a load of random music I found (Spanish Flea, Coldplay, Collective Soul, the Return of the King soundtrack) and generally not doing anything that takes  any  effort. So now I'm feeling kinda stuffed with junk food, and I just remembered the badminton doubles tourney starts tomorrow (holy craaap). How the hell am I meant to do well if I cant even be bothered to do anything? Argh.   Also, half ma friends get 3 days off school (Mon-Wed) messing around in Buxton. Bahbahbah. I can bet any amount of cash that during those 3 days so much homework is gonna be given out, and every other lesson will involve writing an essay. Just for the sake of it.   In the other news, Bishop needs to be hit round the head with a squash raquet, they really need to change the Leisure Centre touch-tone message before it destroys whatever sanity is left in ma head, and the cold wave in hell has come to an end. Weather forecasters predict that temperatures will not drop below 50 degrees centigrade for at least another decade, and that they will most likely rise to well over 100 degrees over the next couple of days.   Buxton people: Have fun, good luck, and I'll see you all on Thursday. Everyone else: Get plotting for when they get back! >=D

       Erm...woops. Before Jack says anything...I DIDNT GET A CHANCE DAMNIT! And you kinda messed up your bit too. Bah.  As for the rest of the day...it was so crap I'm not even gonna bother moaning about it. Much.  Apart from one thing...certain things were said by certain people at break...and I'm getting the feeling this has all gone way too far. And even I can take a hint like this. Lets just say...if what Jack says about how Nat feels is remotely true, she better do something quick. And I mean, quick.  Thanks for trying J, much appreciated.

At least I think I did the right thing leaving IT...no doubt if I don't ask tomorrow Jack will try to murder me. Bah.  On the upside, I managed to do better than expected in the geog exam *woohoo*, we have hockey tomorrow  *WOOHOO*  and it looks like its just started snowing. However lightly, that has to be good.

Last night he somehow managed to mess it up. Bah.  Oh, and since reading the latest installment of "The Nat and Ben Saga" Jack has once again risen as the most annoying person I know. Congratulations. =P (And yes, that means you are more annoying than people like Bish, Ms Phillips, and whoever came up with the latest MacDonalds advertising campaign.)

       Bah, stupid Devils. They just  had  to have 3/5 of their top line out when the Flyers match came round...bah.  Until now I started to figure that Jack might actually be getting less annoying. No constant and random paper flicking, no constant and random persuasion bursts (well, less than usual at least). Lets just say...maybe tomorrow. Maybe not.   Highlights of the day...probably taking the piss out of the English Ice Hockey League and all their rip-of-of-NHL-logos in sci, laughing at Sam filing his nails in french, and jumping Mat's petrol car over a stream into a big patch of brambles. Woot. Oh, and I just  can't wait  to read J's latest thrilling installment of the Nat and Ben saga. See what random crap will be spewed out today.

       Flyers v Devils eh...wont that be fun >=D  Pity 1/3 of the egg line is out (facial laceration) should be a pretty good game anyways.  In the other news, I just found the homepage for the English ice hockey people...holy macrap. I'm pretty sure I could do better than that in my sleep. And I'm not just saying that. They really need some financial help. And probably mental help. Basingstoke near the top of  any  league is unholy.   GO DEVILS!

       Woohooooo!!!!  French oral exam is done! And it was laughably easy. So now I'm probably going to destroy my coversation booklet in the most imaginative and original way I can think of, then do bugger all for the rest of 'study leave'. Well, not quite.  Tomorrow I'm going to kill myself playing tennis and badminton, and riding there and back on *ohmygodno*  the stream bike  which I rode back from Mats today. It is a seriously dangerous thing to ride. Its so small my knees are almost hitting my chin when I sit down on it. If I try to stand up on it I can't because the handlebars are too low. The back brakes don't work at all. The front brakes barely work at all. If you don't want to crash you just throw yourself off the side. The tyres have been filled with compressed air (sarcastic thanks to Mat) to the extent that its impossible to go up or down kerbs without causing yourself grevious bodily harm. What else...oh, right. Its a pile of rusty and useless metal crap. Yaaaaaaay.  Only...8 more days of school left? Erk its gone quickly.

       Yeah...I'm on study leave. Just about managed to get myself up to laugh at everyone else leaving for work/school. Then went back to sleep till about 12:30  Then I went on a dog walk in the baking sun, nearly getting run over by a manure spreader in the process, then sort of nearly went back to sleep again.  Walked to badminton, managing to loose all feeling in my ass and legs crawling under some barbed wire and through a patch of thistles. Then nearly killed myself playing badminton in the bloody heat.  So I have the rest of tonight and tomorrow morning to completely learn my French presentation, and as many questions from the convo booklet as is humanly possible. Ahhh crap. I might as well just do the 'yoghurt in my eyes' thing and live with a crap speaking grade.  Woohoo.

       Hmmmm. It would appear that I have managed to aquire some new DVDs thanks to those counsins visiting. I now have:  - Master and Commander (guy from Gladiator on a ship) - Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson as crazed spy. Has a funny scene with a shit tube. need I say more?) - The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (only first half, unless I can figure out why the 2nd half isnt working. still very good film etc) - Some more stuff I can't think of right now  So yeah, me happy. And the house seems a whole lot quieter now. I can actually hear myself think. And make it down the hallway without being run into by a hyperactive 6-year old with a deadly habit of trying to punch me 'below the belt'.  Oh, and study leave starts properly tomorrow. I'm going to get up early just so I can laugh at my sister having to go to school. Bwahahahahahaha.

If I make it through work without half-dying then I'll have another night of 'polite socialising' with adults then *trying* to sleep in most of Sunday.  Oh, and ITS STUDY LEAVE  Thats right, a whole week and a half of study leave for one 20-min exam. Which is right at the start of study leave. Wow, this should be fun. All that revising. Yes. Woohoo. Ahem. Revising.

       One of the funniest news stories I've ever seen:  -------------------------  LONDON (Reuters) - A rampant rhinoceros gave a group of visitors a glimpse of nature in the raw at a British safari park when he tried to have sex with their car.   Sharka, a two-ton white rhino, got amorous with Dave Alsop's car when he stopped with three friends to take pictures of the animal mating with his partner Trixie at the West Midland Safari Park.   The 12-year-old rhino tried to mount the Renault Laguna from the side, denting the doors and ripping off the wing mirrors before Dave drove away with a puffing Sharka in pursuit.   "He was a big boy and obviously aroused," Alsop told the Sun newspaper on Thursday. "He sidled up against us. The next thing I know he's banging away at the car and it's rocking like hell."   A spokeswoman for the park, which says "rhinos are not particularly intelligent animals" on its Web site, said Sharka was a hit with the female rhinos and had fathered two calves in the last five years.   "He's got a bit of a reputation this lad and he was obviously at it again," she added.   -------------------------

       Ahhh, classic. The past 3 days have been...varied.  TUESDAY Didn't really do anything...all day...erm...yeah. Nice break from all the work we've been getting.  WEDNESDAY Again, didn't really do much. Apart from spent the whole of science mumbling "holy shit....argh craaaap...." repeatedly, while trying to find something ever so slightly scientific to put in a presentation (for science, duh) which had so far been pictures of Mr T and his van, Doc Brown and his flying Delorian, and Joe eating a banana.  THURSDAY Did the presentation. Decided at last minute to cut out the slide with the flying cars. Added the use of a ruler to point at stuff on the board with. Turned out really well in the end, most people found it at least kinda funny. Highlights: "And here we have Mr T saying "Its a helluva fast van, fool!" But really, he is the fool for wasting energy!" "As can be seen on this slide, only stupid people waste energy. Here we have such classics as Mr Bean, George Bush, Tony Blair, Baldrick, Homer Simpson, and Joe Firth." "...What the hell?!" Yeah. so in the end I just sat there pressing the 'next frame' button while Jack came up with lorryloads of made-up crap that went with what it said on the projector. Woohoo. And yeah, we kicked the stuffing out of Mat and Joe's one. SO EAT THAT Also finished IT c/wk, studied past exam papers, and hurt ma knee trying to bodycheck Ross in a game of football. Heh. Woops.

       Back at school...*urgh* but was a suprisingly good day. Ignoring the fact that ma back hurt every time I sat down (I blame AGC and propane cans) nothing really went wrong. Lessons were slow apart from IT, which, again, mostly consisted of me and Nat going completely crazy, and me trying to get everyone to try talking through their noses. *FNEEEEEEUUHHH*  Lunch was completely insane as usual, everyone either doing nothing, or running round the field inanely, or doing frontflips onto piles of bags. Whoopeedoo. And the science presentation me and Jack did rules. Though its almost completely off subject and spends most the time taking the piss out of: a) Americans b) Joe c) The pollution caused by Mr T's HELLUVA FAST VAN (The A-Team)  Yes. So we're either gonna stick in a load of unreadable on-subject text at the end, or get 'Unsatisfactory' and one of Mr Goodwin's 'punishments'. And tomorrow will be good. Only one lesson where I expect to have to do any work. And thats geography. Booo sucks to Harry Hun.  Victor - "UNBEELIEVABLE! Do you see what I just found in one of those crackers you got? Question: Whats the difference between Victor Meldrew and a chef who keeps dropping his pancakes? Answer: They're both useless tossers!"  Margret - "Shes dead!" Crowd - *worried mumblings* Victor - "She can't be dead, shes a bloody health and fitness instructor!"

       About today...  Work was fun. And funny. New person on the till behind mine (weird double-till thingos) so I naturally helped out quite a bit. Teaching 'em how to operate the cash draw without seriously injuring themselves, how to take those stupid tags off clothes, etc. Other highlights include: - Someone spilling a load of water from some stupid thing from auqatics all over me, the desk, and a load of compost bags. - Stacking shelf-fuls of ant killer. - Some random old guy and me having the following conversation: Me "...haven't you already been through and paid?" Old guy "Yes, we've already been through here, but we went to the coffee bar and my wife decided to buy some more. Thats what you get for being married...heh." Me "Heh" *lil laugh* Old guy "Are you married?" At this point I had to restrain myself from staring at him and saying something like "what the fuck? I'm 16 damnit!"  Stupid Devils are about to be knocked out of the Stanley Cup...bah. The season Jack starts supporting the Flyers, the Devils start playing crap. Just my luck eh.  I found that v. funny log from Feb 15th....bwahahahaha. What a great day. And I got the best response ever from Mr. Syners d'Attenhoven with my latest artmonkeywork: "  AAWESOME!" Woohoo. And I found that classic old song "Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows". Very cheesy. Great lyrics.

       4 the last few days i've been staying with friends in Stevenage and going into London in the daytime  I bin 2 a helluva loada art galleries (man there some crazy stuff in dere)  then i saw chitty chitty bang bang the play - really good but i would have made it much better by adding in some back to the future music / quotes at the flying car scenes  I started the next day by finding out the hockey scores  looking good so far  SHUTOUT posted some abusive messages to the new jerseyan guy on the PA forums   Then went to see some more art galleries and the globe theatre  In the evening i went to Covant Garden and oddly saw a man, wearing only a  G - string (dont ask, its too disturbing) on a unicyle, juggling 3 chainsaws, and shouting in portugese.   which was a tad odd  we went to look in the Covant Garden store (which had a toronto maple leafs jersey hanging outside 4 sum reason) then went home  Today i came bk to thornbury and had a Rabies Jab (im having so many im actually starting to enjoy them)

       ^^^ Sums up today pretty well. Didn't get up till had to go to work, where it was pretty much deserted most the day. So we went round helping out in other random places. Like, I had to move a shipment of 13kg propane canisters around the place. Gets pretty tiring, lugging those buggers up and down hills.  When there were customers, pretty much anything went wrong. Barcodes wouldn't read. Barcodes weren't even on the bloody items. Barcodes brought up the wrong items. Argh. And people seem to have an annoying habit of signing for cheques on the wrong damn line. Even though it says on the damn thing where to sign, and I've just shown them. Idiots. Oh, and Sophie R managed to trip over her own barcode scanner cable. *clapclapclap*  Not long left in the holiday...and there was more I wanted to say but theres stuff on TV I wanna watch now. So I'll leave ya with some great One Foot In The Grave quotes:   Victor - *sighing* "Oh well, I've had a good life." *sits back. looks around. gets up* "I'VE HAD A BLOODY AWFUL LIFE!"  and  (Victor has headphones on listening to radio) Mrs Warboys - "I - I- -I just think I might have to kill myself..." *breaks down into tears* Victor - "HAHAHAHAHA, spam, spam, baked beans and spam, ahhhh, thats funny."  oh, and  GO DEVILS, BOO SUCKS TO TEH FLYERS

       Wow. For most of today it was actually not raining, and the weather was very nice. Warm 'n' sunny. But I was stuck inside the GC working the tills...so naturally I was being boiled half to death. *Urk* Of course it started raining later but thats not really the point. As its always raining here.  I seem to be suffering from something I like to call "Who the hell are you? Syndrome". Basically, its when you meet people who know you, but you can't figure out who the hell they are. Very annoying. Happened twice today, once with a customer and once with a co-worker. Neither of which I've been able to put a name to yet. Bah. It would be like  "Hey Ben, can I borrow that pricebook?" "Yeah ok...hey waitaminute..."  And suddenly I don't have a clue wtf I'm doing. Arrrgghh.  Two great quotes I picked up from work today: 1. Some random customer said: "Mint flavoured tennis balls!" 2. Something random on a bit of packaging: "Varieties may vary"  I mean, in both cases, WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING???!!!  Oh well.

       Mmmmm. 2-0 down. But then again, both times Devils managed to get 2 goals...fairly close (3-2, 3-2). If they play that well in NJ then the series'll be tied 2-2...but yeah.  Guess who I talked to today...only the legendary Mr Webdood. Sodding asshole extraordinaire. I doubt I've ever had to type the words "shut the fuck up" so many times in my life. Bahjeeeeeeesus. But anyways, that kid is funny. Went totally ape-shit when I reminded him about the yr 3 SATs joke...bwahahaha.   I now wish to put a pub sign up on our street, with Ron's face and "The Pain in the Arse" on it. And I also gotta remember that phrase. Ape-shit. I like it and want to use it more in civil conversation.  In the other news:  -I get doubletime tomorrow *woohoo* -My sister is a good chef. Her chocolate cake is about 90% chocolate. Its so tasty its almost painful. And there wasn't any jam for filling, so she used...yes, melted chocolate. -Jan Hrdina is cool -History coursework sucks -Yorkshire Bank Plc are facist bastards -Theres a place called "Butthole Road" in England -"Wherever you will go" is cool -Some Finnish science people say eating chocolate helps the health of unborn babies -Easter is the tastiest day of the year -Only 1 more week of hols. Then back to school...then exams!!! Holy shit!!! -I should be doing coursework instead of this -Hell still hasn't frozen over. BUGGER.

Thats 2 - 0 in the playoff series   We'll see wot happens in New jersey   But if boths sides win their home games then Philly will win in the 7th game   game 1  -  Philly   game 2  - Philly   game 3  - New jersey   game 4  - New jersey   game 5  - Philly  game 6  - New Jersey  game 7  - Philly   Thus making a score of 4 - 3 philly   But thats unlikely to happen

       That was a sick idea. But it was a joint idea. People in general: if you just happen to see a cheap submarine up for sale (has to be fairly big, with space for 'modifications') be sure to notify me or Jack ASAP.   Yeah, yeah. Flyers just about won the first game. But I'm sure the Devils'll be able to win their home games. Or even tonights game in Philly. You never know...anyways. Back to our usual schedule of me quoting Blackadder and Coldplay.  "Am I part of the cure, or am I part of the disease?" "No, I'm going to conduct myself with no decorum. Shove off!"

       ^^^ Pretty much what I was thinking at 6pm yesterday. At work we had to put a crapload of them together. Basically they're big random Chinese cast-iron outdoor fireplacey thingos. Argh. What a vague sentence. Meh well. We managed to get 2 done each in 3 hours work, including cleaning up the shop and having a v. long break. Which involved everyone messing around with one of those big gas canisters of helium. I swear, it was like having the Smiths around the place.   Of course, after all that work putting these damned things together, they all fell apart when we had to move them into better positions around the outside area. Like, half the bits were actually attached. So anyone who buys one (they're £129.99 *bwahahaha*) really needs their head examined. And should probably be locked away in a home for the criminally insane.  Today was pretty fun. Long lie in, until woken up by dog barking at bloody birds. Afternoon, walked up to the Lesiure Centre with Joe and played badminton. Hot day for once, and they had all those fat industrial heaters on full blast, so nearly died *urgk*. Then sorta walked round those fields where the circus goes trying to find a way into Mundy Playing Fields. Failed, and managed to scare some kids walking along that random road by appearing from over a wall carrying raquets 'n' all. Amazingly, in about 1h 30mins of tennis, we both managed to play fairly well, despite not having played for about a year. Woooohoooo-ness. Left early to get home in time for dinner, but ended up being late by talking to Jack for aaaaages. Then played ping pong till about 9, while discussing a great marketing idea, which i'm gonna post seperately. For the sake of it.  EDIT: OK, its too sick an idea. So I'm not gonna post it. But if you reeeeally wanna know all about it, let me know and I'll tell ya. I just think its a bit...erm...grim to post here. And would probably just offend someone.

       HEHEHEHE Thats actually pretty funny what they dont tell u is that his "son" was kidnapped and cleverly replaced by a cunningly disguised Scott Stevens who made sure that the little accident took place.  oh well the flyers will manage without him   Experts say the devils wont REPEAT   i.e. wont win the Stanley Cup even by some small chance they do beat the flyers  cos its gunna be hard enough without having to face sum 1 like Tampa Bay.

       Experts say that eh? Well they obviously haven't seen the news this morning *evil laugh* and yes I did find this pretty funny.  "The Flyers are quite sure about the status of their own injured star defenseman, Eric Desjardins. After returning from a broken right arm to play the final three games of the regular season, Desjardins is out for the entire playoffs after the metal plate protecting his injured limb broke on Tuesday while he was playing catch with his son."  Hes an ice hockey defenseman. Every few days, he goes out there and bodychecks people. Thats his job. Then he injures himself  playing catch .   And for those of you who haven't seen a playoffs series before, this is how it works: The first 4 games are set. 2 at one teams rink, 2 at the others. If one team wins these 4 games, the other possible 3 games aren't needed, as it would end up 4-3 if the other team won them all. So they're pointless. But most the time these go to the 6th or 7th (final) game before they're decided. Whoever wins goes through to the next round, and you end up with an Eastern and a Western division champion. These 2 then play in a series as the big final. Which could mean a maximum of 32 more games for the division champs.  Anyways, Devils/Flyers will probably go right to the 7th. Its gonna be a close 'un.

Ohhhh no   I will leave the grudge bearing to my loyal armys of highly trained mindless drones who will gladly spend the rest of their otherwise pointless lives hunting down and (as they say in scientologist circles) Exteriorising those who have displeased me   Anyhooooo now i've gotten that out of the way   I have been asked to recommend the admission to this Blog of Mr Ben MacDonald  and even if not him then maybe some other new people would be a gud idea   all that remains for me to say is quite simply...

       Whoever wrote that weird poem (I'm guessing Ben M and Jack) really needs to get their facts right.  1. Yes I do leave the house, I play a lot of badminton (3-4 times a week), I go on dog walks every day, and I work.   2. Much to your obvious disappointment, no, I'm not gay. And I'd have thought that was pretty obvious from the whole fancyin' Nat thing? Or have you been living in a cave?  3. Yes, I do actually eat stuff other than ketchup. Incredible isn't it.   4. The only ppl who screamed were a load of the girls on the other side o' of the room. I just stood there saying "ooooh shit".  5. Yes, I do actually do things. I do have a life. Maybe if you tried being just a little more open-minded you'd notice that. But no, you'd be too busy writing pageloads of complete bullshit to try to annoy me with. Oooh, how impressive. Now why don't you just go do something more productive...like maybe throw yourself off a bridge?  Wooo. Work at Almondsbury GC is easy. Scan barcodes, swipe cards/take cash, wait ages for next customer. From 9-6. Every now 'n' then go stack some shelves or move craploads of compost around. Breaktimes, laugh at Bishop when he puts stuff in the microwave with ALL of the packaging still on it. As in, one of those small lasagne tray thingos, he put it in there while it still had the cardboard sleeve on. He's crazy. And whoopee-yayness, I get £8/hour when I work on bank holidays. ie Monday. Not bad, eh?

       Go mee, go mee, go mee...  Today = a very good day. Yeah, it rained worse than previously this week. Yeah I had a v. painful dentist trip. But what the hell, it was a good day.  1. They're re-arranging the monkey team, leaving just me, de Dijker (cool Dutch guy) and Roy "Starkiller" Pitchford. So me happy that I'm in the top 3. Woooooo-ooo-oooo. I am teh l33715H bannerman.  2. Gave in that application form thingo at Almondsbury GC, and guess what? About 20 minutes later, they phoned. talk about fast response...any quicker and I would have still been getting home. So I now have a job. Which I'm rather chuffed about. (whooopee-yayness).  More reasons why today ruled later. Now football.

       What is it with this damn country. Its raining. Again. On the upside, I've just found out that some of the art monkey team play TA. So now I need a cool new name prefix to go with 'monkey'. Like 'ninjamonkey'. Or 'kahrayzeemonkey'. Suggestions more than welcome.  Great Belgian English:  "Veynom: The suggestion of Tembre is good. I will now make sure that it works."  Mr Snyers d'Attenhoven will never let you down when you're on the hunt for bad grammer and sentences that don't make sense.  Anyways, I'm now off to beat the crap out of people with quality names like "Andre Siminski" and "Peter de Dijker". Awww man, these Europeans are funny.

       Mmmmm....Devils V Flyers first round...talk about a big game...erk. Stats show that the Devils play better away than the Flyers do anyways, so this is the most balanced match-up you're gonna get. I'm just hoping its gonna be another matinee start (1pm EST) so we can actually listen to it without having to stay up till godknowswhen.   Bah.  Yesterday was about as much fun as getting an arrow through the neck, then discovering theres a gas bill attached to it. It rained. All. Fucking. Day. Me being me, decided to put off the dog walk until 'it stopped raining, or at least lightened a bit'. Of course, it just got heavier and heavier. In the end I just had to go for it, and got rewarded by getting absolutely drenched. As in, it would have been easier to jump into a swimming pool, then throw my shoes into a giant pile of mud/shit.  And today doesn't look great either. Its not actually raining right now, but it looks like it will, and I have to go clothes shopping. With my sister and her friends. *FATEWORSETHANDEATH* Again, It'd be more fun to get a second arrow through the neck, with an electricity bill attached. Or possibly to have to teach home economics at a german convent school outside hiedelburg. And yes, all of this is blatantly stolen from Blackadder.   *More bahs*  Nice to see Nat back, and I gotta run now, sounds like my sister + evil friends are trying to dismantle the ping pong table. arrrggghhhh  *blackadder quote of the day* Blackadder - "Ok, if you crawl over any barbed wire, you must on no account go AAAAAARRRGGHHHH!" Baldrick - "Did you just crawl over some barbed wire sir?" Blackadder - "No, Baldrick. I just dipped my elbow in a blob of ice cream."

       1. City game was great. Beat QPR 1-0, Dad didn't do anything embaressingly stupid.   2. Devils beat the Bruins (in Boston) 5-2 (Goals for Rasmussen, Niedermayer, Stevenson, Albelin, Elias).  That takes Elias' season goal count to 38, taking him to 4th in the lead with goals. He also got 2 assists. Albelin got his first goal of the season, which isn't so bad considering hes really old. Like, 40 or something. Brodeur made 38 saves as well, which rules.  This game takes the Devils to 100 points, and the 7th season running that they've hit the century. It also edges them above the Flyers, who lost to Ottawa yesterday. If the Devils win tomorrow's game at home to the Bruins, they'll go through as division champs, no matter what happens with the Philly game. Woohoo. Also, the Devils might end up facing Philly in the Eastern conference 1st round in the playoffs. That'd be interesting, non?

       In my defence there were certain other reasons that i went in to school apart from having obsenely large amounts of work to do. Any ideas cos i really dunno, but i doubt it was anthing to do with my girlfriend being there and me wanting to spend a bit of time with her before the easter holidays cos i sure as hell wudnt hav wanted to do that.  my my im being a subtle as a Las Vegas casino on steroids   or should i just say "as ben"  Buenos noches y adios amigos

       Blackadder: "This is only the beginning of training, George. The beginning of 5 months of very dull, very clever men looking at machinery." (from outside) Flash: "HEY GIRLS, LOOK AT MY MACHINERY!" (lots of screams) (Flash runs into room) Flash: "Enter the man who has no underwear! Ask me why!" Group: "Why do you have no underwear, Lord Flash?" Flash: "Cos the pants haven't been built that'll take the job on!"  Yes, more classic comedy. Almost as funny as Jack going into school on an INSET day. And having fun. I DONT CARE IF IT WAS ART OR NOT!  Oh, and does anyone know what that song they sung just before the RWC final was?

       Hpmhmeh. Strangely frustrating day.  Hols have started, so didn't have to get up. Instead was woken at about usual time by dad on his way to work, being as annoying as is physically possible. IE assuming it was a school day, and turning lights, alarms etc on. GAH!  Sort of got up, forgot about breakfast till after I'd had lunch (doh) then went on a nice long dog walk. As in, run to the Leisure Centre the field way, then run back. Saw Nat & Holly as I came back into the big field, but stupid dog decided to just sit down and rest. So I couldn't go and see them. And now I have a pissed-off feeling that I'm not gonna see her again over the hols.  Title pretty much sums it all up. From Blackadder (of course =D) "I made a diary entry on the way here......it just says "bugger"." - Capt. Darling  Current mood: "Collective Soul - Not the One" / a cross between tired, annoyed and looking forward to tomorrowness.

       New Jersey look like they might beat Philly...if the Flyers loose when they play the Montreal Canadiens (A) tonight...well.  After that game, Philly and the Devils only have 2 games left each...Philly's against Ottawa (H) and the NY Islanders (A), and the Devils have to play Boston home and away. Both teams on 98 points...its the difference between 3rd and 6th...COME ON MONTREAL!!!  Okies, me sound like a sports analyst now. (OH DEAR GOD NO!)  I suggest everyone go d/load "Collective Soul - Not the one". Yup...thats a damn good song there...and its probably the best way to express myself atm. And now...back to UK Gold.

       At bloody last...A HOLIDAY!!!  *does the 'wooo, holiday time' dance*  2 weeks of stuffing my face with chocolate, not having to worry about coursework, deadlines, having to get up in the morning, etc. Ahhh, pure bliss. Also...Saturday theres the Bristol City game...and then Sunday (or maybe Friday. Or maybe both) a load of badminton. FunfunfunFUNFUN!!!  Today was mostly good. Geog, didn't do ANYTHING of any value. Apart from laugh at Greg eating what looked like crunchy dog food. Hmmmm. History, again, didn't do much. Mostly just sitting back, laughing at feeble attempts at last year 11's N. Ireland cwk. English, wrote a really funny speech about nothing in particular. And despite sitting next to Lucy B, it wasn't too bad a lesson to end the term on. Mostly random jokes, Blackadder impressions, that sorta thing.  Then *dun-dun-duun* orthodonist time! Got to miss Maffs and Science (ha-ha everyone else) just to drive all the way into Bristol, have someone poke round my mouth a bit, then go on a quick job hunting spree. So far I'm stuck between Wyvale GC or Almondsbury GC...any input from anyone would be useful.  And now, I'm gonna go watch s'more quality British comedy. Goodbyeee!

       Once again, Jarome Iginla has scored for the Flames.  3-0 was the final score in the Saddledome last night, the Flames are now leading in the Stanley Cup Final 2 games to 1. Jarome got 1 goal, 1 assist, and got in 1 fight. Which isn't too bad for a days work.  And on two of the goals the scorers did that funny thing where they basically jump full-on into the boards in celebration. And almost knock themselves out in the process.  Nothing else interesting happened today, apart from me managing to make my shoulder hurt more. Erm, yay?

More than once. -Cut my finger badly on a rose. And then got soil in it. And blood on some cash.  Good points being: -Long and v. funny chats with people in breaks. -Not too busy. So plenty of rest. -Got a pay rise!  So yay. Good day overall. Though now my shoulder, finger and back hurt. Bah.

Not in a 'hit-by-a-car' sense, but in a 'urgh-stuff-this-I'm-too-tired' sense.  I'm bored and so am gonna watch more 'adder. And listen to that great song "End of the line". Such amazing quality...ahhhh.  Oh, and can Nat get in contact with me before I forget wtf I wanted to talk about?

       OK. I'll start with some words of wisdom from you-know-who.  "arghs i can't stop eating these plain potato chips and i hate plain potato chips but for some reason i really like them right now"  "Eli (9:41AM): LIKE A STONE Ben (9:46AM): eh? Eli (9:46AM): nothin' man. nothin'"  One day until English exam....ARRRGGGHHHH!!!! SHIIIT SHIIIT SHIIIT  I have a bad feeling its the poetry one as well. And aparently that includes the first 6 of 12 short stories. Which SUCK SOOO BADLY.  OK back to revision.

          Hi folks, and welcome to Florida, for game 1 of the Stanley Cup final!  OK maybe not. But still, game 1 was played last night, between the Calgary Flames and Tampa Bay Lighning.   As in most playoff fixtures, there wasn't much to choose between. Both sides haven't really got this far before. Tampa Bay had a far better season, winning the Eastern conference. Calgary qualified in 6th Western place, but pulled together and smashed through opponents like the Detroit Red Wings and the San Jose Sharks. So stat wise they're about dead even. Onto the game...  The game started well for the Flames. With just 3:02 gone in the 1st period, Craig Conroy's shot from the blueline deflected off Tampa defender Dave Andreychuk, then off Flames' forward Martin Gelinas, to trickle past Khabibulin.  In the 2nd period, things got even better for Calgary. Jarome Iginla, favourite to get half the playoff awards this year, scored shorthanded. Stephane Yelle made it 3 on 18 minutes.   Tampa Bay managed to pull a powerplay goal back in the 3rd, and it was hardly likely to be from anyone else...yeap. Martin St. Louis struck again.   Then, with 20 seconds to go, the Flames really took the piss by scoring a really weak goal. 2 Flames managed to break away, they passed the puck between each other, then Chris Simon tapped it past "The Bulin Wall" to make it 4-1, and 1-0 overall for the Flames.

Haven't talked to him for a while, which may or may not have been a good thing. He is completely insane, lives somewhere in the US and is training to become a lawyer. God help his clients. Heres some of the things he had to say, on various pressing issues.  -------------------------------   NOTHING IN PARTICULAR   Eli (11:46): it's like the batpoles! Eli (11:46): TO THE DOCKING BAY!

       Helluva game last night...Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1, to win the series.  3 great goals, craploads of great hits, some generally good plays, everything you want for a good hockey game.  This leaves only the Lightning, and the Calgary Flames left for the final, which starts on Tuesday (I think). Should be a good series.

       I swear. There were waaay too many fat people around work today at one point. It reminded me of that  "Houston, Texas. Fat capital of the world"  program that was on a while back. Because, literally. The best description for some of these people (without trying to be racist) was "Texan". Aaaaaanyways.  Today was tiring. Get up. Work. Get back. Go play tennis. Get back. Do bugger all recovering. *yaaay*  And the next time Mr d'Attenhoven calls for more art, I may have to restrain myself from branding the words "I'm busy, you ass" onto his forehead. Or maybe the Belglish version: "I,m biesee, yu asch///"  Oh well. Got till friday till next exam. So plenty of  "study" .  NOW WITH ADDED SARCASM!!!

Nick managed to injure himself by falling off his bike on the way there. And we got a new football. Which Ben had to climb onto a roof to get. One of them world cup ones. V nice.   Now we get a week of "study" before our next exam. Woohoo!!!

       2 days into study leave now. Much better than being in school. And guess what...first exam tomorrow. Citizenship. Won't that be a barrel of laughs!  I watched a really weird movie today. Galaxy Quest. God knows why...basically a bunch of actors from a crappy 80's sci-fi show meet a bunch of aliens who had watched these 80's shows and thought they were 'historical documents' and so based their whole civilisation on it.   At this point I'm thinking "...what...the...fuck..."  Somehow the movie turned out worse than I expected. The main 'bad guys' all looked like the Grinch wearing spikey metal plating. And there was a cliche-ridden thing with a short-term time travel device.   *urrghh...unclean!*  In the good news...  - Bristol City beat Hartlepool last night in the div 2 playoff 2nd leg...was 1-0 Hartlepool until the 88th minute, when Marc Goodfellow headed home an equaliser. Then Christian Roberts scored a blinder in the 3rd minute of added time to win the game. WOOHOO! GO CITY!  - Calgary beat San Jose 3-1 in the Saddledome last night to secure their place in the Stanley cup final. Jarome "Legend with a cool name" Iginla scored his 10th goal these playoffs on a powerplay at the end of the 1st period. Martin Gelinas followed up with a goal midway through the 2nd, before McCauley pulled one back for the Sharks. With less than half a minute to play, San Jose pulled their goalie, only for Regehr of the Flames to whack the puck right from one end of the rink to the other for an empty-net goal. With  1 second  left on the clock. GO FLAMES!!!  - Looks like Tampa Bay are going to beat off the Flyers. Woohoo again.  - I managed to find my citizenship source booklet. Pity half the stuff in it is scribbled on. Bah. Good thing you get a new one in the exam. And it should be an easy subject to pass anyways.  Ahh, that'll do for now. Wish me luuuuuuck! ('cos I'll probably need iiiiiit...)

       YAY! What a great day. IT...did nothing. At all. Apart from comment on my last post.  English...did nothing. Apart from laugh at various people.  Break...the big smokebomb thing was a complete cock-up. Didn't work. All it did was made us look stupid. Ohwell, better luck tomorrow?  French...did nothing. Literally this time.  Lunch...got a large number of funny pics/videos. Including: - People breaking the fence - People throwing sticks at each other - People throwing banana skins at each other - Lucy getting in a piss with Rob - More stuff like the above  Science...sort of made that crunchy stuff. Bishop COMPLETELY wrecked ours, which turned shite-brown and went all over the desk. He then ate some of it. *urrrrgh* Got even more funny pics/videos. Like stuff burning, Bishop going completely insane, and Jack/Nat wearing foil cup thingos on their faces. Man, they looked so funny.   History...we got exam tips from Mr Bean. And generally did nothing else.  So an all round amazingly funny day. Tomorrow will, of course, be even better. Yay! And then...wow. No more school for 11 weeks. Or something like that. WOOHOO!

       I honestly dont know how I'm managing to type this. Played hours of tennis, football, and tennis-baseball in the blazing heat. To the point when raquet covers started to melt. Took 45 mins to walk a 15 min route home. So I'm gonna go rest now. *uuurgh*

       Whoa. 100 posts on this thing. Since March 9th. A fair number, methinks.  Today was great. I had my last ever lessons of Religious Education and Maths. YAAAAAAHOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No more listening to someone drone on about Hindu veiws on abortion. Or trying to figure out curvy line algebra stuff. (apart from exams and whatever but oh well)  And most importantly, no more Mr Upward. Or Ms Harrison.  Monday will be interesting. Last lessons in IT, English, French, PoGo Science AND History. So, a whole day of not really doing anything. Yay!!!  Also, I have badminton again tonight after a few weeks off, next time anyone sees me I'm gonna have new glasses, and hopefully I'll have got a pay rise.   "Into the West" is cool. LotR music with some random person singing over them (from the RotK soundtrack) and it goes really well. Has lots of quotes built into lyrics as well. Like "all will turn to silver glass" talking about hope fading, white shores and all that. Ahhhhhh.   Over in the US last night, some mixed stuff. Philly lost 4-1 to Tampa Bay at home (yay!) But Calgary lost 3-0 at home to the Sharks. (bah!) Tampa Bay - Philly game 4 is at 3pm EDT on Saturday, so for once us English NHL fans'll be able to listen live.  ONLY 2 DAYS OF SCHOOL LEFT!

       Damn...its so temping to edit "retardant". Ahh, who cares about how many years it was. I participated in a large part of said bullshit? If I remember rightly it was you writing "Bish 4 Men" in his book. Yes, I found it funny. It is very funny IMO.   Yes, I know you and Bish seem to like annoying each other. Or working together to annoy Mat even more. I respect that. Its been very funny over the past few years in science.  Speaking of Mat, he'll be setting up for tomorrow by now. Will the 'big plan' work? I personally don't think it will. But you gotta acknoledge the amount of work Mat's put into this project. Good luck...  Oh, and when did I say I'd be doing the pitchforking? =P

       mindless flaming eh? in that case i would like 2 remind you that i am completely fire retardant   anyway   5 YEARS OF BULLSHIT!!!!! 4 THE RECORD IT WAS A MERE 4 YEARS.... TOPS!!!  secondly Bish is not seriously going to tell me that he actually gives a flying fish about it   thirdly you are not seriously going to tell me that you give a flying fish about it - need I remind you that u actually participated in a large part of said "bullshit" and found a larger part funny dont even try 2 deny it   I accept that bish is actually quite a nice person but its not like he hasnt done anything 2 me 4 those 4 years   of course I have checked my bag and didnt find anything missing hence point 3 of my previous post - but i dont care anyway   and by all means please attempt to pitchfork me to death

       A few points:  1. I don't have that detention anymore. So ha-ha. It is funny to me.  2. If Jack actually beleives Bishop on the stealing one then he deserves to be pitchforked to death. Have you even checked through your bag yet to see if anything is actually missing? Maybe that'd be a good idea.   3. Its not called having ones head up anothers ass, its called Bish getting you back for "5 years of bullshit". When Bishop isn't either hyper or generally being annoying he isn't so bad.   That phone thing was funny, and so is the thought of Phil Harnett going skydiving, then realising someone has conveniently removed the parachute cord. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAhem.

       Ahhhh Upward he can be a bit of a prick at times forgive me if i see the humour in him giving you an after school on the last day  spose its not funny 4 u   other humourous points of 2day:  1.Nathanael jumping into the pond  2. Bishop saying that he was gunna ask kim 2 the prom (my advise: I think his chances are good, thats having spoken 2 her after school, but just a hint)  3. Ben and Bish apparently stealing somethin outta my bag, evidently something small, unnoticable, and seemingly non existant, oh well i should have expected as much but the words ben's, head, stuck, up, Bish's and ass spring violently 2 mind   4. Emma giving me a phone  Well im dun   GO Flames, GO Flyers!!!!!

       Or in this case, some weird genetic mix between (geog) Mrs Ellis, Mr Upward and the advertising department at HSBC. Ellis and Upward both moaned at me in school for whatever stupid reasons they hold against me. Lunch was mostly boring, as were the lessons. And then Upward phones me the minute I get home to have yet another long yell at me. Bah.   Both Eastern and Western conference finals 3rd games are on tonight, go GO CALGARY and GO TAMPA BAY! I still really hope Roenick gets the good checking he deserves. As in, gets concussion from a cross-check or something =P And yay, only 3 days of school left.  OK. Today suddenly seems a whole lot better. Yaaaaaaaaaaay

       Wow. Just watched a program on legend of the 60's and 70's...Mr Evel Knievel. Heres some stuff I picked up:  - He broke 35 different bones at some point or another - He once tried to jump a canyon in a firework - His last jump was in Wembley Stadium - His cool walking stick was worth as much as the BBC studio - He got in a big argument with the Blue Peter staff - He made BILLIONS from toys 'n' things  Today was boring. Until now. See if you can figure out wtf me and Nat are talking about here. Answer'll be posted tomorrow if I remember.  Nat: Tractor? Ben: a little too insane. Ben: hovercraft? Nat: COOL. Ben: but are they road-liscened? Nat: I think so... Ben: that'd be pretty cool Nat: It would be way cool. Ben: not as cool as a chopper Nat: Nah. But we're too poor for a chopper -__- Ben: not suprising really. Nat: Mmm Ben: not gonna stop me from trying  Ben: lol. horseback Nat: Yeah! Nat: Double bike. Ben: now THAT would be funny Nat: Micro Scooters. Ben: go karts! Nat: WOOHOO Ben: lol Ben: milk floats? Nat: Even better. Ben: like one of those big converted ones they use in disney parades Nat: Damn it, that would almost beat the chopper. Ben: with a mini-laser show attached Ben: wow Ben: police car would be funny Nat: *slobbers*

       Check this out. The really kah-ray-zee bits are in bold. Woohoo!  ----------  BERLIN (Reuters) - Losing his license did not stop a drunk German driver from jumping back into his car a day later to buy more of his favorite tipple -- only to be nabbed a second time by police who this time seized the car as well.        Following a tip-off, police had stopped the 51-year-old on Monday, when a breath test showed a blood alcohol level  more than 10 times over the legal limit.     "The officers could not remember ever having recorded such a high level," said a police spokesman in Hagen, western Germany. The man's license was taken away.    The next morning, the man again bought sparkling wine and drove home. Police again stopped him and recorded an even higher alcohol level -- almost  double the amount considered life-threatening to most people.     "This time, the officers confiscated his car too," the spokesman said. The man will be charged.  ----------  Talk about a stuuuupid last sentence. "The man will be charged." Of course hes gonna be charged! Not like they're gonna send him gifts of thanks or anything...jeeeez.

       Ieeeee don't beeeelieeeeve iiiiiit.   Most of today was good. No teacher for PSCHE. Not really doing much in English. Discussing NHL teams for most of Science.  Then double PE. Most of which was fun. Playing squash and badminton and whatever. But oh crap. Nat managed to completely ruin my plan by not turning up afterwards. BAH!   And again I had a very interesting discussion with Holly, mostly about Nat.   Soon I'll post my Western conference lineup. Oh, and theres the small matter of there only being 5 days of school left. Woohoo.

       Not a bad team you put together there. Heres my *revised* Eastern lineup  LINE 1 - (Scoring 1) LW Patrik Elias (NJD) C Mats Sundin (TOR) RW Jaromir Jagr (NYR)  LINE 2 - (Scoring 2) LW Ilya Kovalchuk (ATL) C Scott Gomez (NJD) RW Martin St. Louis (TAM)  LINE 3 - (Checking 1) LW Simon Gagne (PHI) C Bobby Holik (NYR) RW Jeremy Roenick (PHI)  LINE 4 - (Checking 2) LW Mike Ribeiro (MON) C Vincent Lecavalier (TAM) RW Jamie Langenbrunner (NJD)  DEFENSIVE PAIRINGS Zdeno Chara (OTT) Scott Niedermayer (NJD)  Scott Stevens (NJD) Eric Desjardins (PHI)  Sergei Gonchar (BOS) Brian Rafalski (NJD)  GOALTENDERS Martin Brodeur (NJD) Robert Esche (PHI) Ed Belfour (TOR)  Any all-star team has to have Jagr on the #1 scoring line. He had a crap season and was still in the top 5% of offensive players in the whole NHL. He kicks ass.   Something quite disturbing I saw on Y! news when I got back...  "Man Fatally Bitten by Sexually Aroused Horse"  Oh, and any suggestions for improving this place in a comment please. Or over MSN. Whatever floats your boat.

       Whoa. Big blogger update. Looks cooler now. Yaaay.  Only...something under 10 more days of school left. WOOHOO! I managed to get yelled at by several different teachers today, for reasons I have yet to understand.  Now I got badminton. Another chance to smash the living crap out of a load of yr9's. Trogdor strikes again!  Oh, and ha ha Jack, Flyers 0, yes, thats right, 0, Tampa Bay 1. Not even Mr Roenick could stand up to those Lightning hits! Bwahahahahaha!  Oh, nearly forgot. Jack seems to have finally lost that last bit of sanity. He was trying to hold Nat's bag hostage "until she agreed to his terms and conditions". Of course she didn't. She probably didn't even notice he'd taken it. I think Jack needs to spend a liiiiittle more time in the 'planning' phase of his little ideas.

       Woohoo. Weekend. Today was...strange. Jack showed that his latest plan has pretty much no chance of success. Its not that its a bad plan...it just doesn't work.   Philly'll probably loose to Tampa Bay...and I'm saying that from a neutral point of veiw. The Lightning have had their best season pretty much ever, and they'll probably win the Stanley Cup outright.   Anyone who wants to play badminton on Sunday should call me sometime between now and then. Oh, and seems like another of Jack's plans has fallen through. Ben M isn't going for some reason or another. Aparently.

       ^^^today. Pretty much. Most lessons were easy-ish. We're down to the 'revision lessons' now, so...yay! Mat had a very interesting theory for me to completely destroy this morning: "Why do we need minus numbers? Couldn't we just shift the number line down a bit instead?" It took me from his house right over to that postbox on Midland Way to explain why it was such a crazily stupid idea. Which probably comes to between 5 and 10 mins. I'm not really sure.  And I can't think of much else to say now. Bah.

       ...with Rev. Ben Gross.  Throughout today, I've been thinking. About a number of things. Mostly more random than the usual crap making its way through my brain. Things like  "Cool things to change your name to...Ebrodak von Talisman! Nemo! Hercules! Xiahou Dun! Randy Valashek! Jamie Langenbrunner! Petr Sykora!"  and  "Strange things to change your name to...Zhuge Liang! (pronounced yoo-gay lee-ang) Jehan Snyers d'Attenhoven! Phil McCraken! and many more"  Yes, I had a boring French lesson =P School is once again here to haunt us all. But theres only 9 days of it left. During which time I gotta fit in truckloads of revision, hope Jack doesn't screw stuff up with Nat  even more  and hope to god Mr Upward's detention letter(s) don't get through. And all the prom stuff, too. That'll be fun...seems to be Nat's least favourite conversation topic. Whoopeedoo. Anyways, its back to the random thoughts for me.  "Why the hell am I still here? What is Adam Hart-Davis still doing on TV? Why can't Mat even spell the name of his college course? How did (other) Ben manage to loose his bag? Why does it have to keep raining? They really ought to hurry up and invent the time machine."

       Yay. London-ish was fun. So I spent the whole of today:  1) Crawling around the loft trying to find a damn scart cable. 2) Attempting to get TV, Video and DVD all working. Generally I'd plug one in and the others would mysteriously stop working. 3) Watching RotK again and again. Then watching the DVD of that football match waaaay back on September 1st 2001. Where England beat Germany 5-1 in Munich? Talk about obscure. Other titles on the list I could get via an uncle include:  - "Teach yourself TKD" - Wow, now I can be just like Sam *pffft* - "Explore Americas National Parks" - Completely pointless. "ONLY YOU CAN STOP FOREST FIRES!" - "England v Germany 1966" - One I'm actually considering getting. - "Windows tutorials - 6 disc set" - ....why?!?! - "Barbies Nutcracker" - According to uncie, that hyper cousin of mine who enjoys punching people in the groin likes watching this - "Balamory" - I had to sit through 4 whole mind-numbing episodes of this over the weekend. Talk about living hell.  Oh, and its the last day of study leave. Bah.

Everyone was in  really  posh clothes...like, all the boys were wearing jackets 'n' bow ties 'n' things, all the girls were wearing ball gowns. And everyone looked great! Spent most the evening chatting...bit of *attempted* dancing as well. The yellow mini was pretty damn cool as well, especially when it had its fairy lights in as well. Everything is generally too hard to explain or describe, so for the rest I'm gonnae wait for photos.  In the other news, I today completely re-made  urlLink my site . Yup. Its now actually up to date, and has nothing to do with anything in particular. And I reaaaaaally like that splash page. Worked better than expected.  So yeah.  urlLink Get yo asses down to ma site, 'n' have a look round. As usual, complaints, suggestions 'n' things are welcome. Oh, and theres a caption compo in the pics area. So...go go go.

       ^^^ That was the general view from everyone today. Yesterday, ref Ernst Meier single-handedly knocked England out of Euro 2004 when they played Portugal. England had chronically bad repeat descisions against them (to a sickening scale, like Vassel trying to head a long pass) and in particular, getting a perfectly good goal by Sol Cambell disallowed in the last minute of normal time. A goal that would have put us in the semi finals. The ref was miles away, and couldn't see. The linesman said the goal was ok, and the official UEFA regulations say in that situation its up to the linesman. Somehow we managed to drag it out to a penalty shootout, which we might have won if the penalty spot didn't crumble every time anyone tried to kick the damn ball.  If UEFA have any sense they'll put this right and ban that bastard from refereeing any big matches for a year or two. Or even put the rightful winners into the semis. I'm fairly sure they can overturn his descision and do that. Either way, Ernst is now on the list of the biggest assholes in the world. He makes Mara-fucking-donna look like a devout England fan.  Bah. Anyways. Today was book-takey-back day...in other words, an opportunity to spend the morning chatting with Holly, Nat and Jack, every now and then signing off from a few teachers. So...I'm signed off, and could (if I really wanted) go and get a full-time job. Erm, woohoo?   Only  really  interesting things that happened today were:  - Nat trying to sorta frontflip off the stage in the main hall - Mum cutting open her hand and needing a tetanus jab - Everyone discussing how much of a complete git Meier is. Yes, even the people who I would never have thought would care had an opinion on this (as they generally dont like football) -  urlLink A vending machine in a Texas Hospital exploded and started spewing out toxic gas  -  urlLink US Vice President Dick Chaney told a senator to "fuck off" and "go fuck himself"   Oh, and once again: "THE REFEREES A WANKER!"

       Woo. 6th form induction day todaaaay!  Points of interest being:  - The incredible amount of work thats gonna be in English & History - Nat's cool glove things - Trying to play american football with 6 people - Trying to understand Mrs Lowenburg - A pink mini that drove past us while on the High Street - How insane Mr Atterton is  Yup. A pretty good day. In the end my options were (in block order): English, History, Geography, Physchology.  (Wow. Its raining so hard it looks like the road is flooding.)  Tonight (well, 7:45) England play Portugal in the quarter finals of Euro 2004...I stand by my belief that if we can effeciently man-mark Christiano Ronaldo we'll have no problems in beating them 2 or 3 nil.  (Switching between subjects here...) Tomorrow is book-takey-back day. Basically a big pointless thing where we all dump our books in the school hall. Won't that be fun.  Last few points:  - Its stopped raining now - Clocks still rules - Bishop + Jack = Unfunny jokes involving me and Nat - My toe is bleeding! - Only...5 days till the Prom...*erk* - The drag made by those England car flags is costing the country £19 million from extra petrol consumption - COME ON ENGLAND!

       Yaaaay!!! If you are either a) Extremely slow or b) Extremely stupid then this will be news to you: England won last night, and in a fair bit of style too!  In the end, it was England 4, Croatia 2. Englands goals came from Paul Scholes ((who hadn't scored for England in 3 years, thats 30 matches) after a great bit of teamwork and a great header across from Rooney), Wayne Rooney himself got 2, then Frank Lampard finished things off with a great run past the Croatian defence and a decent shot into the corner.  So...BRING IT ON PORTUGAL!!!  Oh, and my last exam is tomorrow. Bleh.

       Wow. Yesterday was...interesting.  For no apparent reason, they filled the staff area at AGC with trees. When I walked in there in the morning to drop off my stuff, it reminded me so much of that scene in 'My familly' when Ben walks downstairs in the morning to find his house filled with Xmas trees...y'know the one. Heehee.  Bishop made himself look like an idiot (no suprises there) and I got to do door duty. Where I basically act as a bouncer. *rolls on the floor laughing*  Oh, and check this out:     I sooooo badly want to buy that...and do fun runs 'n' things in it. In fact...I wonder how much money I could raise by doing Bristol's Biggest Bike ride wearing that...(next year, obviously)  Oh, and England play Croatia today...we need either a draw or a win to get through. But because of last nights results (Russia 2 - Greece 1, Spain 0 - Portugal 1) Portugal and Greece go through...and we'd have to play Portugal unless Switzerland beat France, and we beat Croatia. Erk. COME ON SWITZERLAND...AND COME ON ENGLAND!

We didnt stop and we finished in 38mins 45 secs, which is pretty impressive.   Well to the rest of the Peru Crew - U SUCK!!! and we didnt even get sponsored so u dont get any money HAHAHAHA MOSSES

       Wow. Latvia played really well today. Not only did they draw with the Germans, but they deserved to win. They had 2 penalty calls turned down (retarded ref didn't see either of those blatant Kraut fouls).  Holland look like they're doing OK, last time I checked they were 2-1 up against the Czech Republic.  And that Swedish G-T-G was great! Everyone kept falling over trying to head it (in laughable ways) before Ibrihimovic flicked it behind him with such style. Go Sveeden!  No work today (working tomorrow instead) so I went shopping. Erm, yay. What...incredible...fun? Hell no. Argh. Though I did find out something really funny. That idiot who crashed into our car was...A CLOWN! Woohoo!

       LEAVE FOOTIX ALONE !!!!!!!!  He is a legendary little blue bird - have you ever played FIFA 98? where he randomly jumps out on the start intervals and either waves or demonstrates a degree of football control that i did not know was achievable by a small bird.  There was a mascot for Korea japan????? why didnt anyone tell me??? they are typically japanese  i.e. about 10000 years ahead more advanced than anything we came up with, i mean everyone else is still using organic mascots. Go SUPER COOL AWSOME FIGHTING ROBOTS!!!!  HAHA Lativa!!! they they actually dont suck, held the germans to a draw. anyone see the Italy/ Sweden game? 1-1 although the Italians played better, Maldini missed more headers than a 2 inch, headless, deaver form the pharoe islands! Now Italy might not go thru! GO SWEDEN!! GO DENMARK!!! GO BULGARIA!!!  On a slightly more Peruvian note, i went on a bit of an expedition shopping spree and bought lots of drink bottles and assorted tubes, also a waterproof cover for my bag and a nat style bandana (minus the pirate symbols) I have been experimenting with the best way to wear it (there are many) my favorite so far is the "west African malicia fighter" - I named it myself   ~ Adios

        World Cup Mascots   Yup. Heres all the world cup mascots. From 1966 to 2002, they're aaaaall here.    England 1966 - "World Cup Willie" Cool lion. Kicks ass, even today. Though that looks like a Union Jack. WRONG FLAG, IDJETS!    Mexico 1970 - "Juanito" Fat Mexican kid with oversized hat. I will say no more.    West Germany 1974 - "Tip & Tap" Strange looking rosy-cheeked Germans. Kinda deformed.    Argentina 1978 - "Gauchito" Strange kid that makes me think of Popeye. *shudder*    Spain 1982 - "Naranjito" Erm...its an orange. A fecking peice of fruit.    Mexico 1986 - "Pique" I don't know what the hell that thing is meant to be. But it has a cool hat. And is much better than the other Mexican mascot.    Italy 1990 - "Ciao" Wow. Lego really out-did themselves this time.    USA 1994 - "Striker" What a crap name. And look at it. I swear I've seen that dog on some crappy cartoon before.    France 1998 - "Footix" Its a French bird. In a blue jumpsuit. With a rubbish name. What were they thinking...    Japan / Korea 2002 - "Kaz, Ato and Nik" Now these guys have style. But they're also kinda scary...wouldnt like to meet them on a dark night...it'd blind you or something. Still, better than most the others.  So, there you have it. 2 remotely decent logos in about 40 years. Woohoo!

       As things stand, we only need a draw against the Croats to get through. But interestingly enough, if Switzerland manage to beat France, and we loose to Croatia, we go bottom of the group.  "If teams finish level on points, then the winner of the match between the sides in question will finish highest, or should they have drawn, goal difference, followed by goals scored, qualifying record for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA EURO 2004™, a fair play ranking and finally either a penalty shoot-out or drawing of lots."  This is quite strange...the first few ones make sense: goal difference 'n' all, but then it gets all screwey. Qualifying record for the 2002 world cup?! Thats fairly insane. Fair play ranking is even worse...that means one team could go ahead of another because they were more friendly. Drawing of lots would be incredibly funny. Unless it happened to us and we lost. But imagine that. Teams  drawing lots  to decide who goes through.   And all of a sudden, I want Latvia to start winning. This guide to the teams I was reading described the stereotypical Latvian fans as "Ice hockey fans looking for a change of scene". So yeah. GO LATVIA!

       Rite the way I see it now is that englands group now looks like this  France - 4 England - 3 Croatia - 2 Switzerland - 1  and group A looks like this,   Greece - 4 Spain - 4 Portugal - 3 Russia - 0   so assuming Greece beat Russia, they shud go thru on top and hopefuly portugal will beat spain that means that England hopefully will go thru in 2nd and face Greece which is a big improvement on spain.   Yey, but Croatia seem to have done a France on France and scored twice in 4 mins to equalise, sooooo, England I think, need at least a draw to go thru   CUMMON ENGLAND!!!!

       Well...maybe. We've still got a long way to go, but today, we beat off the Swiss 3-0. Wayne Rooney (youngest player to ever score in a European championship) got 2, one a great header from a Michael Owen cross, the other a great shot which bounced off the post, into the keeper, and back into the net. The match was rounded off by a really well taken shot by Steven Gerrard.  In other Euro 2004 news:  -France and Croatia play soon..like...in 2 minutes. It'd actually help if France won that, I think. -Portugal look like they might just survive after beating Russia 2-0. -I reckon Sweden will top their group after a 5-0 rout of Bulgaria. -And much more I'll post later. Must go watch the France game now.  Oh, but first: meet "World Cup Willie", the mascot from the World Cup in 1966!     What. A. Legend.  Oh, and...COME ON ENGLAND!!!

       Woo. French reading and writing today. They were in the afternoon, so I had complete freedom to get up late, not really do anything for a few hours except nearly be persuaded to wear a shower cap to the exam (don't ask. please, for your own sanity).  The exams themselves were piss-takes. The reading was just...reading...as would be expected...and mostly consisted of writing V's and F's in boxes. So challenging...The writing only had 3 questions, the first being "Make a list of 4 different types of transport". The other 2 weren't exactly much harder either. So thats another pass.  Walking home was pretty fun. Holly kept up her 'game' with Sarah, Charli and whoever else was anywhere near, with the punching whenever they saw either a yellow car or a soft-top. Things discussed included: -Throwing ones self in front of a car. -Whether being senile always happens to everyone when they get old. -How easy the exams were, and how fast time flies. -Those new-ish 'EuroMillions' draws. -Prom transport. -Prom clothing. -Spray paint.  Again, its probably best if you don't ask. Anyways, I got a free freezepop thingo *yaay!* and found this really random thing:    urlLink Hold the Button   - How long can YOU last?

       Today was pretty damn good. Both the Maffs and History exams went well, and Jack's impression of German Darth Vader still has me laughing. ("LUKE, ICH BIN IHR VATER")  When I got home I saw something pretty damn funny...next door's gazebo thing had been overturned in the wind and was sorta starting to come over our fence. Pics soon. But not now.  And today has a multitude of funny news stories! Heres the top 3 headlines: "South African Man Kills Designer for Criticizing Home" "Swiss Soccer Fans Pin Down England with Voodoo Campaign" "South African Government Launches Colorful Condoms"  Out of those 3, the first is funniest, heres some quotes from it.  "A South African man told a court how he hacked to death his interior designer because she criticized his decor, local newspapers reported on Tuesday."  ""We went through the house and I told her what I wanted. She did not make any nice comments about my place so I went to my garage and fetched an axe," the Star newspaper reported him as saying."  ""I killed her because she reminded me of an old school teacher whom I hated very much.""  "Da Silva told the Pretoria High Court that voices in his head had instructed him to become a serial killer, the Star said."  Shouldn't really be funny...BUT IT IS! Bwahahahahahaha!

       Its not fucking fair. England. 1-0 all the way till the 90th minute from a headed goal by Frank Lampard.  Then we bring on Hesky. Hesky gives away a stupid free kick which Zidane scores from.  James then takes out Henry, and Zidane scores the penalty.  I'm sickened. And I will leave the rest for Jack.

       OK! Its time for England's first game of Euro 2004, against the Frenchies. Chances are we'll loose...but oh well.   At least we've had some good news already today: The other 2 teams in our group, Switzerland and Croatia, drew 0-0 when they met earlier today, which gives England and France the better chances to go through. Yay!  Also, Spain beat Russia 1-0 yesterday, but Russia played well, and they might just end up knocking Portugal out (with the help of Greece).   urlLink The Euro 2004 official website  is actually really good, I suggest you all go check it out.  And now I'm off to watch the game, I expect you lot are too, and won't read this till its all over. Ah well.  COME ON ENGLAND!!!

       Todays title features from the front cover of this weeks "BBC Gardrens World Official Magazine". Where you get a free mini fork thingo. *sarcastic cheer*  Today was...interesting. Good points being that the time flew by, and there weren't too many people there.  Bad points being that I managed to slit my finger open on another damn rose plant, I had to scan through a  whole fucking trolleyful  of small cactus plants, and had to stop after every few plants to pull the fucking spikes out of my hands. Also, my first customer was none other than my French teacher. Then at the end of the day I was given a brush and assigned the wonderful task of sweeping the whole shop area. Which kinda did my back in. And took ages.  On the upside...Euro 2004 started today!  Theres only been one game so far: The host nation Portugal hosting the generally low-quality and funny-player sounding Greece. Portugal, being favourites to win this match by a long way, went and messed up badly. They lost 2-1: Goals coming from Giorgos Karagounis and a penalty from Angelos Basinas, then a last-minute effort from Christiano Ronaldo.  Not bad for Greece, this was their first even win in a major football tournament. Russia and Spain are playing in about 30 mins time (from time of writing this). So...good luck to Greece and Russia: hopefully they'll take out Spain and Portugal so England wont have to worry about them if/when they get through. WOOO!

And now theres only one exam left this week...if you can even call it an exam. Its more like...2 hours of crap. Yes, its the RE exam.   In other news, I'm gonna get back into the routine of writing parody songs. Ideas I've had so far include:  "Be Like That" (god knows) -> "Be Like Mat" or "Be Like Nat" "Into the West" (god knows) -> "Into the South West" (Bristol etc) "Politik" (Coldplay) -> "Politics"  I also wanna do parodies of: "Heavy" (Collective Soul) "Spanish Flea" (god knows) "Wherever you will go" (The Calling)  Send suggestions and ideas to the usual address...

       ^^^ Take advice. Do not speak of crevices in public.  Today was just French listening, which went fine. And I got to walk home with Holly and Charli. Who proved their lack of basic sanity by walking down the middle of the road debating who'd get run over first...hitting each other whenever they saw a soft-top or a yellow car.  Tomorrow: the joys of English LANG. And I'll probably walk back with those 2 again. Mostly for the comedy side, partly so I can get back in time for lunch and not sit round at Joes for hours looking through random TV channels.  Wooo!

       Woohoo! Another 2 exams out the way.  ICT was a walkover, I reckon I got 80-90% on that one.  Maffs went pretty damn well, probably 40-50 out of 70 there...I think I need 60-65ish from the 2 papers to secure my B. Yaaay!!!  Tomorrow will be ok, only one exam, and its French Listening. Which is neither time consuming or difficult.  Between exams today was funny. Spent most the time channel hopping at Joes. Watched some reeeeally funny channels such as:  THE GOD CHANNEL! Basically this black American on a stage saying REALLY funny things like "We hang out with the wiiiise men" and the always-funny "Are your friends friends? Or are they tests sent by the devil?"  BBC PARLIAMENT! Yup. There was Steve Webb (our local Lib Dem MP, YAAAAY STEVE!) making a really dramatic speech about council taxes 'n' things. At first it was on a close up shot, so you could only see him, and the guy next to him who looked worrying like one of my uncles. After a while it cut to the wide shot of the whole room. Which was when we burst out laughing. There were  3 other people  in the whole of the house of lords. 1. That guy sitting next to him who looked like my uncle 2. Some guy on the other side of the middle searching through a pile of papers and 3. Someone sitting by the door in a wheelchair. And to make it extra-funny, when it cut back to the close up, the guy sitting next to Mr Webb kept bursting out laughing at random moments. Quite funny, I thought.  US SHOPPING CHANNELS! These were the funniest. 20-minute ads for blow-up beds, with 2 really cheesy and stupid presenters with funny names. At one point, to prove how amazing their bed was, they got a gymnast to do a dance routine on one side, while someone else tried to sleep. The other person was bouncing all over the place as you'd expect, but of course when interveiwed said "I couldn't feel anything at all! I nearly went to sleep!". Then the REEEEEAALLY funny bit: they got some comedy wrestlers to use the bed as a crash mat thing. One of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life.  OK, this post is long enough so I'll stop there.

       OK, first post of 2 for today. This is the hockey-related one. The rest of the days events will be posted later.  It was certain to produce a winner: The Stanley Cup Final, Game 7.  In the end it was a nail-bitingly close match, Ruslan Fedetenko scored 2 for the Lightning, Calgary only managed one goal through Craig Conroy.  So the series ended 4-3 to Tampa Bay, and the Flames now have to fly all the way back to Calgary without a trophy to show for their year of hard work. They really shone in the playoffs, knocking out all 3 western division champions (Vancouver Canucks, Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks) to get to the final.   I reckon they'll do better next year, in the league at least.  But for the time being, congrats to Tampa Bay Lightning, the 2004 Stanley Cup Champions!

ICT should be a walkover, Maffs is a bit of a bugger. I need to get a B overall to make Mr Upward look stupid and all that. I think a bit of revision now and s'more at Joe's after ICT should get me through no problem *grin*  The week of hell has begun...

       Yeah. In all honesty, we're screwed. Unless we played like we did against Iceland yesterday. Lets have a lookee at the groups.  GROUP A Portugal Greece Spain Russia  GROUP B France England Switzerland Croatia  GROUP C Sweden Bulgaria Denmark Italy  GROUP D Czech Republic Latvia Germany Netherlands  OK lets see. Group A should be fairly straightforward, Spain and Portugal going through. Group B should be France and England. Group C should be Italy, then whoever wins the Sweden/Denmark fixture. Group D could be any of of the Czechs, the Dutch and the Germans.  After that, England face either Spain or Portugal (assuming those 3 go through). Which is a bit of a bugger, really. Oh well.  GO ENGLAND!

If we lose to the fucking Krauts this time............. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  First game against France?

Bahbahbah.  And this...heh. I'll leave you to make your minds up about this...  Eli (11:08 AM) :  so did you enjoy condemning yourself to hell? Ben (11:22 AM) :  you mean "how was work"?

       Up till now, today was slow. And way too hot. I'm so damn grateful that they put a fan next to my till. *yaaay*  I just read this really funny thing. Called: "Gaming skills you shouldn't use in real life"  heres some of the funny bits I can be bothered to copy.  (flying planes) "Airlines also get funny about other people flying their planes, and passengers tend to spend less on duty-free perfume if they hear "Stall, stall, stall!" and "Pull up, terrain!!" too many times."  (strafing) "Do NOT strafe the postman. Do NOT sidestep around the corners of buildings."  (winning the Tour de France) "No matter how hard you pedal, no matter how many water bottles you throw over your own head and face, the motorcycle cameraman always wins. Bastard."  That'll do for now. Maybe more stuff later if I can be bothered.

       Another post...forgot to mention that the Calgary Flames won last night, and are now 1 win away from the Stanley Cup. *woooo!*  Once again Jarome "Such a legend words don't do justice" Iginla played at an insanely high level.  Just 2 minutes into the first period, Martin Gelinas scored his 8th of the playoffs, only for Martin St. Louis to pull one back at the end of the period.   15 minutes into the second period, Iginla scored a helluva good goal, driving the puck from wide on the right wing stickside past Khabibulin, and in off the post, only for Fredrik Modin to level it up at 2-2 at the start of the 3rd.  Overtime was when Iginla really shone through. In a long shift for his offensive line, he managed to get his helmet knocked off, but carried on playing, feeding a pass to Oleg Saprykin, who scored to finish the game, and give the Flames the chance to win the cup at home in the Saddledome. Which they should win if they play like that again.  GO FLAMES!

       ok Nat   + WHAT THE...... ?????  + Actually the author of Alice in Wonderland is thought to have been on drugs at the time of writing - sorry Morpheus  + SILENCE SHOL'VA!!!! First of all his name was Seth or Setesh, set is just for lazy people   Traditionally yes Seth is the God of evil / mischief and the like He is linked to Loki the Norse god of mischief - but really he was just a sneaky little trouble maker, he cut Osirus into little pieces and scattered them along the Nile. I believe he was also responsible for the theft of Horus's eye. In short he was a bit of a jerk  Anubis has more to do with death and feeding hearts to big scary monsters and also looked wayyyyy cooler than Seth   You may have noticed that I am somewhat of a Stargate fan! In Stargate Anubis is the most powerful system lord ever known, commands a vast army and is feared by all. He is the prominant bad guy for 2 seasons, I believe only Apophis held that position for longer and he cheated by dying 3 times. Seth on the other hand, features for one measly episode, as the Goa'uld leader of a poxy little cult on Earth, he is swiftly killed   Anubis has a big ass cloak and no face and is partially ascended (VERY COOL) Seth looks like George Michael on crack  thus overall, Anubis is better than Seth , so there *rasberry*  + I forgot what else you said but i doubt it made sense   ~ Anubis - KICKS ALL YO HONKY ASSES AT EVIL !

       Yeah. I've just found a big section of PSP I'd never really bothered looking at before. And its got so much scope I could make crappy bits of artwork from them all fecking day. But in the meantime, I'll just post one or two   urlLink SAY IT WITH FLOWERS    urlLink ABSTRACT PEICE OF CRAP WITH A GOLF BALL   No offence to anyone with the first one.

       No news is good news! Yaay! My arm hurts from the rabies jab, my hand hurts from the psychotic cockatiel and my head hurts from the Maths revision. And I haven't even started on the Science yet. Oops.  Also there have been various recent discoveries in the field of BDF, including:  + Whilst Kaiba Seto is not a sweetie, Jounouchi Katsuya  is.  So there.  + Alice went through a looking glass. Upon trying this same experiment, our eminent scientists discovered that she was, in fact, on crack.  + Set made a better god of evil than Anubis. *blows raspberry*  That is all.    - BDF - the best damned jester in the blog.

       Firstly, you should go play this. Its kinda random but funny.   urlLink CLICK ME!   Heres some quotes for today  "As God said, love thy neighbour. Unless he's Turkish, in which case kill the bastard!" - King Richard IV, Blackadder I.  "...Theres a spider in my flies!" - Victor Meldrew, One foot in the grave.  OK. That'll do for now.

       I reckon Lynn goes at enough speed down our road...bloody maniac.  I have a good mind to (when I learn to drive) ram-raid Alan's garage or something. Y'know, just for revenge, fun and the sake of it.  Aaaaanyways. Heres something funny-ish I did: Some guy was saying something along the lines of "whats this, Ninja's gone sane? Wow, I better be on the lookout for flying pork on my radar".  So I made these: (if they dont work click the link to see 'em.

I did a bit of shopping for Peru and purchased myself a rather fetching Aussi-style wide brimmed hat (without the corks)   Ben, that sucks about your mum - hope shes ok  i've spent most of the afternoon wondering how sumone could get enough speed to even dent your fence in this road  anyhoo  Sayonara

       Hell. Today was just like...a steamy pile of horse shit in day-shape.  Mum was in a nasty car crash in Shropshire, head on collision with a speeding van.  Some asshole rammed our fence in their car. How they managed to be going at enough speed on our road is worrying enough. Also they must be blind and stupid.  And on a much lighter note the Flames lost 1-0 last night. So its 2-2, and could go either way.  Meh. I'm tempted to just go to sleep now and hope tomorrow is better. 'Tis just one of those days.

Maybe bubblegum alley. Maybe. We'll see. Maybe.   But yeah. Have fun everyone...I sure will. And I'll see y'all some time around mid-August, I guess.

Then desfrosted a load of freezers and made meself some&nbsp;good cash. Then I went and blew it all at the mall on a load of extra-large cookies, plus the Blackadder 2 + Life of Brian DVDs. Yaay.  &nbsp; And that was about it. I think I   really   need to get my badmin schedule running again. &nbsp; "Those are not feet!"

       Wow. They've upgraded this thing again. Let me demonstrate: &nbsp;      W   o  o  o  o   o !!!       &nbsp;  *Ahem*    &nbsp;  Today was...normal, I guess. Went to Cribbs again for yet more clothes shopping. Was SOOO DAMN CLOSE to getting a test drive in a limited edition Rover. Tried to win it by picking up loads and loads of the competition entry cards. But only managed to win 3 "Visa &amp; Team GB drawstring bags!". Oh joy.    &nbsp;  I did, however, manage to get a couple of&nbsp;Dead Ringers CDs, and found out that the full version of 3 kingdoms&nbsp;(chinese war novel) is bigger than LotR. And costs £25.98. Oh well.     &nbsp;  One&nbsp;eversoslightly interesting thing I learned at Tescos on the way back was that the person from North Carolina going into Y12 in the 6th form with us lot is actually a year older. But had to start the AS/A level course again because the US version has a completely different sylabus. Ha. A whole wasted year.

Gouldy: only you jer, only you Jer: I was chasing it's babies. Syn: rofl Jer: So it retaliated. Jer: It was pretty scary. TembreFe`ll: Don't chase babies! Jer: I wasn't expecting it. Jer: One minute I was the hunter. TembreFe`ll: Babies are not for chasing! Jer: The next, I was the hunted. Jer: It just turned around and started running at me instead of away :o Syn: That's probably a lot funnier in retrospect than it was Jer: Yeah. Jer: Scared me a lot at the time :P

       Woot. Had work today, and due to parents both being at work had to arrange alternate transport.  Plans of getting an early bus up to Cribbs then going back to Almondsbury foiled by me missing the bus. Went back home for a few hours. Bah. Caught the bus going direct to Almondsbury. Was so bumpy I doubted that there was actually any suspension at all. Stupid public transport. Bah.  Due to it being midweek there was virtually no one in store. Only 2 till monkies (me 'n' Sophie) but there weren't really enough customers to keep us busy most the time. So, nice, relaxing, and very. Very. Boring. Ahh well. Either tomorrow or Friday I get to go shopping. Erm, bah. Again.

       LONDON (Reuters) - A British man who accidentally shot himself in the testicles after drinking 15 pints of beer was jailed for five years on Tuesday for possessing an illegal firearm, a court spokesman said.  David Walker, 28, was arguing with a friend at a pub in South Yorkshire, northern England, when he went home to get his sawed-off shotgun, which he jammed into his trousers.    But as he walked back to the pub, the gun went off, blasting pellets into his testicles. Doctors later removed what remained of his testicles during emergency surgery.

       Boring coupla days. We got our car back, went shopping a few times. Oh, and I went to work. So...yeah. Boooooo-riiiiiing.  Peru group go sometime. As in, they've all gone off to school for a day, then they're going. Yay for them. Hope they all have fun. In a week 'n' a bit I'll be leaving for the U-S-of-A. For 3 weeks. So...this place is gonna be pretty damn quiet till August. Unless I can find a net cafe or something. And can be bothered to post something.  So...yeah. Most of today I was reading through old emails. Mostly between me and Nat. V funny, actually. One of her closing *things* instead of just "bye" or "see ya" was:  "Now I'm being herded off the comp like so many wild sheep...  Baaaa...I mean bye"  Mmmmm. Boring day.    Its a cartoon version of me! ...Sorta.

       ^^^. I just spent an hour locked inside the Marlwood car park.  We were playing badminton, as usual, and that asshole of a caretaker locked us and another family inside, before promptly leaving.   So what did we do? We tried to break through the gate. We tried to unscrew the hinges of the gate. We tried calling the caretakers house several times.  We even tried to open the fucking lock with housekeys .  In the end, we tried calling the police. Which was pretty damn embaressing, esp. as the person on the line was laughing during the whole fucking phonecall. After ages of waiting, we found out that no, they couldn't help us.  So we had to jump the gate and make our own way home. I swear, if I find that caretaker I'm gonna kill him. ARGHHHH!!!

       Bah. Haven't posted on here for a few days...mainly because...nothing interesting happened before yesterday. I mainly just slept in...walked the dog...wished the weather would improve enough for tennis or something...but bah.  Went food shopping yesterday, managed to get lotsa vanilla custard donuts, cookies and other assorted crap. And I got me a lotto ticket. Wooo.   After that, went to Cribbs to pick up some other crap, and managed to get Timesplitters 2 and Ratchet 'n' Clank for £25. Which isnt bad, seeing as that'd probably cost between £40 and £60 normally. Both games kick ass, by the way. Eeeeeveryone knows about 'splitters, but R'n'C seems to be a lil less well known. Lemme explain.  You play this lil squirrel thing who is a mechanic. He backtalks a fair bit and generally looks cool. (Em says "cuuute") His main weapon is a  giant spanner  which you basically smash stuff up with, which rules so much. All the other weapons you can get are pretty cool too, and most of them are bigger than the lil guy. Like...the 'suck cannon'. Its like...more fun than SSX Tricky. Which is a damned fun game.  But anyways. That should do fer now. Au revoir mes amigos.

       WOOHOO for Greece!  Before arriving in Portugal, they had never won a game in a major tournament before. As soon as the tournament started they made a big impression by beating the hosts Portugal in the opening game...then after getting through their group, they beat off defending champs France 1-0, then beat the Czech Republic 1-0 in the semis, before completely outplaying Portugal in the final (a re-match of sorts from the first game of the tournament).  So...GO GREECE GO!!!  Erm...what else happened today. Oh. The street BBQ. What a joke. Jack (apparently) got so bored he went off to stalk Emma Mullen instead. I watched the Wimbledon final (which Federer won in 4 sets, damn good match). Even the table football was boring. And everyone left to watch the football. Oh, and the Estonians won the world wife-carrying contest again. Erm, yay?  Bah. Even this is getting boring. So...I'm gonna go now.

       Work was...well...painful. There was the usual crapload of rose bushes to cut my fingers apart on. Then I had to 'help' this old couple by carrying a 70L bag of compost up through the car park and into their car. That did my back in...then it was lunch. Where someone had left an open bag of muffins in the staff area. Bwahahahaha. Free muffins. After lunch, some very annoying person bought over £200 of stuff, then paid for it  all in £10 vouchers . So I had to completely mark up 20 vouchers with the date, my name, my signiture etc, while still serving people. ARRRRGGGHHH. Other than that, it was a great day. And I managed to get a few more muffins at the end of the day, as did Joe. And probably everyone else who works there.  Somehow, that 17 year old Russian girl managed to thrash the living crap out of Serena Williams to win Wimbledon. (6-1, 6-4). Wooot.

       Can't...get...damn...Kenya...song...out...of...head...  Thats gonnae have to go on the music page someday soon. Which now has 12 clips. Wooo. Go checkitout. Link is on the right toolbar thing. Big purple button. Can't miss it.  Today was pretty damn good. Only *properly* got up at about 1pm, then went and played tennis with Joe. The tennis combined with riding there 'n' back, for some reason, nearly killed me. I'm completely worn out. And might fall off my chair at any moment.  In Euro 2004 news: The final (to be played on the 4th of July) is going to be between Portugal and Greece. Which is interestingly the same fixture as the opening game. GO GREECE (again). And I just had a good session of beating the living crap out of Warrilow at Nike Ole. Woohoo.  There was some pretty bad news, but I'm not gonna post it here. So if you really wanna hear it talk to me tomorrow. =P  Oh, and: The sites hit counter is going upupUP pretty fast. 74 hits in a day and a few hours of yesterday. And one of 'em was from Taiwan. *woohoo!*
