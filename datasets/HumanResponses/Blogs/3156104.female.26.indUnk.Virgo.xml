      Cicada Mania - so the first few weeks of May, the DC area is supposed to get the famous swarm of cicadas that rise from the dirt every 17 years.  Yes.  Apparently during this phenomenon (that happens ONLY every 17 years) swarms of crunchy cicadas rise from the dirt and populate the area to mate, eat, shed, and then die.  GROSS!  I don't know how I really feel about this.  I'm pretty grossed out.  Now I hear there are recipe's going around on how to prepare them to eat!   Here's a link to tell more and a recipe..... www.ubersite.com/m/31014

Ok now for the recipe....

Ingredients:
1 Cup Worcestershire sauce
60 freshly emerged 17 year Cicadas
4 eggs, beaten
3 Cups flour
Salt and pepper to season flour
1 cup corn oil or slightly salted butter

Directions:
Marinate cicadas, alive in a sealed container, in Worcestershire sauce for several hours.*

Dip them, in beaten egg, roll them in the seasoned flour and then gently saute them until they are golden brown.

Yield:
4 main dish servings

*this step may be skipped and you may go directly to the egg step instead.

ENJOY!

      Ok, it's been 10 days and I've just decided that I'm going to start over.  I swear - this type of commitment is just like the gym.  Today's story is going to be about my trip to the mall to buy an outfit for this wedding I have to go to on Saturday.  Well really it's more then that...It's 3 weddings...and I'm so lost in girlsville about what to wear that I could scream!  

Basically I spent the entire evening (5:30pm - 9:00pm Eastern) shopping at Pentagon City mall for the perfect outfit to wear to one or more of these weddings.  The only thing is - I didn't go in with a  vision.   I didn't have a clear  vision  of what I was going to wear at the wedding.  I could have gone with a nice spring dress or maybe black pants and snazzy shirt .....but then maybe black mini with snazzy shirt...or gosh even a classy trouser suit type thing.  Ugh!  So $113.39 later I came home with a pair of cotton khaki's, 5 thongs, and 2 bras.  NONE of which I can wear to this, or any other wedding.  (Well not as the outfit anyway.)  

I think I'm going to schedule some "me time" over the next few days to figure it out.  Then try re-shopping on Thursday.

      Huh...this whole blog thing really makes me feel vulnerable.  I'm not even quite sure that I'll tell anyone about this.  I decided to try it because I've had a few friends with them.  It's a neat idea - and I love reading thiers - but I'm not quite so sure people will really give a hoot about mine.  I'll think about it for a while.  Maybe see if I can keep it up.  I don't want it to be like a gym membership.

      Had a great day....

Woke up at my parents beach house (well I drove there yesterday and then woke up there today) and hung around the house a bit.  Then the Big C (Caesar) asked me to meet him and his brother down at his fishing spot.   Just when I didn't think you could get much further south in Maryland I drove 40 minutes to find him tucked away at a sweet little fishing spot in what I would call the deep deep south of Maryland.  Anyway - great afternoon.  Chillin in the back of his honkin-ass pick up truck with a Coors light and a really big (dead) Stingray.  I have pictures to prove it. 

I'm such a girl.  I totally fell for the "you look so pretty today" that came along with him handing me his big warm fuzzy sweatshirt to wear.  Ugh!  So nice.  Compliments + Coors Light + Stingray (dead) + warm fuzzy sweatshirt = A+ afternoon.  Still wearing the warm fuzzy sweatshirt.  I think it's gonna be mine now.....

      For my Memorial Day weekend I'm doing NOTHING.  I was in Mexico last weekend and I'm going to Highpoint, NC next weekend.  This weekend I'm just chillin'.  I had more then a few options to go out of town, a few BBQs, some parties, but all I can think of is reading a book by the pool ALONE.  So that's what I did today.  My friend Jen and her boyfriend are out of town.  They live in this super snazzy condo building where there are NO KIDS in the clean pool and a washer and dryer.  This clean pool has maybe 4 people at a time laying out so I can be fat in a bikini and not worry about 16 year old thin girls gawking.   NICE.  So I have spent today recovering from a  hang over by the pool with a book.  All while waiting for my laundry to dry.  My only house sitter responsibilities are watering the plants and giving the cat clean water & treats. I think I'm going to call this a vacation... 

I'm going to make Cicada flip flops.  Cory sent me this interesting article on 17 things to do with Cicadas:  

http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/05/29/tem_satlede29.html
 
Ok I have to fold now.  I'm going to think about the Cicada flip flops some more.

      Oh my -- it's been so long.  

Ok well the cicada problem is getting worse.  They are EVERYWHERE now.  Just this morning as I was walking from the front door of my parents house to my car I almost got hit by 3 of them.  The thing is that they are SLOW so you can usually dodge them unless you're flying around a corner or something.  The bottom line is I'm OVER IT.  I watched one poor Cicada cling for dear life to my windshield wiper this morning while on the highway.  He kept trying to get underneath the wiper so he could be blocked from the wind.  I was partly sad believe it or not.  If they aren't cicada-cide-ing then they are being squished by tires and I just can't take it any more.  Not sure how much more time this full cicada cycle will take but I think it's only supposed to last 2 weeks.  Pray for me...

What's with the gas prices.  It took me $30 to fill up my car the other day.  Not nice.  Not nice at all.

Just got back from a short trip to Mexico for my cousins wedding.  She got married at a mission near Rosarito, Mexico.  It's called La Califia I believe.  It was a sweet set up on a cliff overlooking the pacific.  Very impressive.  I did a lot of partying and really feel like I need a good detox.  I took a bunch of pictures.  Wish I could share some on here but I think that might be impossible. 

The weather in Mexico was actually cold. It was like 60 when we landed in San Diego on Thursday and not much warmer the rest of the weekend. I packed a suit case full of tube tops, dresses, shorts, and mini skirts.  I wore the jeans I wore on the plane and my cousin Dillon's sweat shirt the entire vacation.  I'm bummed about the lack of a tan but the trip was so fun I don't care. 

Cory if you're reading this my thoughts are with you and your bottle of pain killers.

      I'm really mad right now because I had a whole thing-a-ma-jiggy written and my f'ing computer froze.  I cannot repeat it all due to my current anger and frustration......  

Bottom line:

Hang over from yesterday was actually A COLD
Went to a fun yet sucky softball game filled with team spirit
Decided I should go to bed because I had too much "decaf coffee" at the game
Wedding planners are doing well...just met Mr. Wedding planner

Angry with my computer and going to bed.....

      I went to a wedding on Saturday.  It was for Pat & Sara who are the first ones to "go down" out of the group.  It was kind of weird.  Everyone looked so incredibly beautiful though.  All the boys who normally wear jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers all had on suits and coordinating tie/shirt combos.  It was great.  The girls all gussied up with thier shaved their legs for the event.  Pretty dresses and matching purses were the talk of the evening.  (I was in all pink.  Miss Piggy style!)  Anyway - today I am paying for having that much fun.  I feel like poop and I'm getting ready to crawl in to bed and watch a really really girlie flick.  So have to go....

      Cory just told me that I can add a comments section to my blog.  I did it successfully!  It was really easy actually.  I thought it was going to require a lot of reading and instruction - alas it did not.  Anyway...you are welcome to leave a comment.  But just be nice.  

I watched the movie Mystic River over the weekend.  I got majorly loaded with my friends on Saturday night and ended up getting super paranoid.  Eventually, after listening to story after story about their crazy college life, I went home and popped in Mystic River.  For some reason I thought it was going to be a drama - possibly a period piece - like Cold Mountain.  It wasn't.  It was intense or what I often call, scary.  I was not in the right frame of mind for this movie and I hate scary movies anyway.  I turned it off, sealed it up, and was determined to send it back.  Had I not been so paranoid I would have marched my ass down the street and immediately shoved the hideous thing in the mailbox.  The next day though I caught up with Mario and he talked me out of sending it back. He said that I should really watch it because it's good in a wiggin kind of way.  On Sunday,in the safety of my parents home, I finished the movie.  It wasn't quite as tense as I'd remembered it to be on Saturday night but it was wiggin.  I liked it.  Sean Penn always plays such off the wall characters but I find my self strangely attracted to the man.  Anyway I cried at the end - go figure.  Moving on.  I got another movie from Netflix the other day, Miracle. I was very excited about it when I put in the order.  I had been wanting to see this movie since it was in the theaters however just after I ordered it my friend Courtney decided to sit on a plane and pretty much transcribe the whole damn thing on his site.  (Site link in title - BTW)   Thanks a lot Courtney!  I'm watching it anyway.  One more movie to go.  I also watched Calendar Girls.  I know the boys will roll their eyes and tell me I'm a chick flick geek.  I am and I don't care.  For the girls out there that dig a little chick flick every now and then - this movie was a winner.  I thought it was cute and surprise surprise, I cried.  It was kind of a "You Go Girl" movie set in ultra conservative England.  I hope I can be that sexy and fun when I'm old, droopy, and wrinkly.  And finally - I had dinner with my friend Carrie last night.  She came over to see the newer renovations to my place.  We drank too much, didn't eat enough, talked for hours, renewed our friendship vows, and I've decided I need to infuse more Carrie in to my life.    She is one of the most  vibrant  flowers in my garden of life.  She's an apple I want in my basket.  She's ..she's...she's...she's going to read this today so I'm trying to be as smoochy as possible.  I'm done.  Oh wait...I'm daring to wear the white jeans again today.  I pray to the god of white stretch denim that I do not spill a colored matter on to my newly dry cleaned pantaloons.  Ok bye.

      Last night I went to Wolf Trap (website linked to title)to see Tom Jones with my Mom, my Aunt from North Dakota, and two cousins under 16.  I was asked if I would go to this Tom Jones concert because my Dad was trying to back out gracefully.  I agreed, knowing this would be good quality time for me to spend with my visiting family members.   I agreed to go but I have to say I was highly skeptical.  First of all I didn't even really know who Tom Jones was.  My Mom kept trying to sing me his songs over the phone - but it totally embarrassed me and left me begging for her to stop!  I also told everyone I know that was going to a GEORGE Jones concert...I was confused.  We had seats on the lawn and Mom packed free-range noodles and asparagus from Whole Foods for us to eat before the show.  We had wine - the works - it was great.  Looking around the crowd I realized that there were all these 50+ year old woman with panties in their hands.  YES they were  twirling  panties in anticipation for Tom Jones to come on stage! Eventually Tom came out.  Well...I finally realized that I had the wrong Genre....duh...this man was NOT George Jones and certainly not Country.   AND the panty twirling got worse.  One woman, with 15 pairs of panties strung on a big stick, was running up and down the isles - twirling away.  It was madness.  After a few recognizable songs Tom decided to take a break and chat with the audience.  So this is where I think the story gets good....    Some girl about my age sling shot her panties up on to the stage, hitting Tom on the chest.  He politely acknowledges her,  sniffs  her panties, and goes in to this dialog about how he can "never remember a girls name but you never forget  this ." (Another sniff) "THIS is like a fingerprint...".  I think the description of the panty smelling went on for a few more minutes. I've got to say I was most embarrassed.  Not at the thought of a 64 year old man loving the smell of a woman's panties.  That doesn't surprise me a'tall. I think it was the fact that I was listening to this old bastard talk about smelling panty crotches while sitting next to my 10 year old cousin Cody who blushed when I asked him if he had a girlfriend earlier in the night, and my 15 year old(raised highly Christian) cousin Megan.  Not to mention my Mom and my aunt were giggling like they'd just had THEIR panties sniffed on stage.    My my my...it was an event to remember folks.

      Today was the big Fathers Day tubing trip.  We had a great day and I am so tired now I could collapse. But we've still got steak grilling and beer drinking to do!  I must follow through with the entire itinerary.  Whew.....  but then I'll just pass out.  We drove 45 minutes to Butts Tubes, in West Virginia. (Link is posted to the title of this blog.  In theory you should be able to access the website by clicking the title....) We rode in a big bus to the drop-off spot where they left it up to us to put our tubes in the water.  We went first class and rented the cooler-tube so that we could bring along a few beers. The moment we set our tube in the water the sky got really cloudy.  The water was warm but when the breeze hit ya it was a tad chilly.  (My toes are still cold.)  I guess it's better then being 100 degrees and sun burned.  Either way it's been a great day.  And I'm going to sign off so I can peel shrimp, make a salad, finish my beer...and eventually take a nap.  Adios.

      First matter of business is that my guest book is on the most tippy top of my blog.  I've had questions about it's whereabouts.  It's free - so it's not quite as visible as I'd like it.  But it'll just have to do!

I got a new template for my blog.  I like it but it takrs all my  entries and squishes them altogether.  Now they look like big blog blobs.  Sorry about that.  When you change your template it takes out all the prior formatting. I'll try to write my entries with this in mind.  Using terms like "and moving on" so you can figure out when I switch topics.  And moving on...

Have you ever known anyone that was so saturated in their own self-induced misery that it was like they were suffocating themselves?  It's sort of like Eeyore on Winnie The Pooh.  It's the Eeyore phenomenon.  I wonder why they do that anyway.  AND FINALLY.   

Have a great weekend.  I'm going tubing with Dad and Robby.  Maybe I'll have a picture or two to post when I'm done.

      This morning on the way to work I saw a really old man (we're talking like 82) riding a crotch rocket motorcycle.  He was at a four way stop.  It was a black speed demon and he was wearing a matching black helmet.  The helmet was without a face piece thingy thus making it easy to spot his cute wrinkly face.  He was hunched over and driving  very  slowly.  Both myself and the cab driver next to me were laughing hysterically.  I desperately wanted to scream, "Go Gramps!" out of the window - but alas the moment was over before I could get myself together enough to roll down the window.  ....the joys of life...

I am putting together this meeting in San Francisco in July.  The meeting planners are a part of the "A-Team", which is compiled with all the Executive Assistant in the entire company.  I was told on a conference call yesterday that I'll be expected to wear a fluorescent green vest with light reflectors on it throughout the meeting.  The purpose of this is to be highly visible to confused attendees.  Sort of like a hall monitor or a crossing guard.  I'm upsettled (see word reference and origin in prior blogs) about this fashion no-no.  I fear that this horrid green apparel is not going to compliment my newly purchased meeting attire.  I think  not  that a fluorescent green vest with light reflectors will go smashingly with my Ann Taylor mini skirt, teal sweater, and matching high heeled flip flops.  Nor will it appropriately accent anyone else's outfit for that matter.  Pray for me...

I get to be the first one to see Holly's engagement ring.  Today - in one hour.  I hope I'm allowed to take a picture so I can post it.  I fear that this act may be considered "stealing ones thunder" but I'll try ....  Either way I get to borrow the convertible while she's vacationing in Florida this week - so I shant be too upset.  

I posted a guestbook.  I am a very proud blogger for figuring out how to do this.  Woo-hoo!  

Reminder:   Have you planned your Fathers Day activity yet?   If not you have 4 more days to do so...get on the ball!  I'm taking my Dad tubing for the day.  He doesn't know..it's a "mystery trip".  Our family has a tradition of taking "mystery trips".  When we were kids my parents would shove us all in a mini van and sweep us off to a childhood paradise.  We would sometimes have to sit in the car for hours wondering where we were going, hoping it wasn't an orphanage.  This is his pay back.  An hour and a half drive to go tubing down the Potomac with a cooler full of beers....an adult paradise.  Can't wait! 

Check ya later...sign my guestbook.

      Here is the Girls Night picture that I said I would attach in one of my earlier blogs.  This was at my "breakfast bar party".  Basically what this pictures shows is: A.  How dumb I am for not taking it in front of the breakfast bar itself  B. How  terrible  my picture phone is at taking pictures   C.  How drunk I was to think this was a good plan at all.  Regardless...behold....girls night..  urlLink

      I just ate a lime flavored tootsie roll... I don't get it. ...yuck...

I told Holly about my eggs.  The ones in my frige that insist on committing egg-a-cide.  She quickly said "You're not putting them in the egg holder in the door are you?  You know you're not supposed to use that. It's  pretend . It's only for looks."  Well no - I didn't know that.  After spending some quality time investigating it turns out that I was placing the egg carton in the compartment on the door where the BUTTER dish is supposed to go.  Thus the reason the eggs were flying out. Ugh...butter-shmutter...whatever.  

I just watched Eurotrip.  It was kind of dumb but I enjoyed it.  No...it was REALLY dumb and I enjoy it.  It had lots of boobs in it...and it actually had lots of European peckers too.  (This is  NOT  why I enjoyed it though - just an observation.) I just wanted an evening to come home, pop in a few movies, to detox and relax.  The movie made me giggle - I am satisfied - there you go.

      So a few things....

First of all I bought a pair of white jeans.  Yes, they are in this year so that's ok.   I chose to wear them today. The day of President Regan's funeral.  I'm starting to feel that it's  slightly  disrespectful.  I am not attending any of the memorial services or anything - but for some reason I feel a little bad about it.  Maybe it's because here in DC it's all anyone is talking about.

So I walk my white jeaned ass to the coffee shop on the corner to get coffee for myself, and spilled a whole cup of coffee on the floor.  A whole entire cup.  NOT SPILLING ONE DROP ON MY WHITE PANTS!  It's got to be a sign...but I'm not sure of what yet.  

My breakfast bar is finally finished.  Last night I had a breakfast bar party with the girls. (I will attach picture later.) It was fun...too much wine..but it was fun.  And I even COOKED for it.  Most of my friends know that I DO NOT cook.  I can't do it well and I hate doing it at all.  However, I successfully made 3 salads & pink lemonade (you may not consider this lemonade mixing "cooking" but it takes preparation and that is definitely "cooking" in my book.).  Just for this event -Wednesday night I slaved over a hot stove and boiled pasta for the pasta salad and studied my recipes to create all the other salads.  All the girls said they liked them so I guess they were good.  Either that or they are flat out lying which really wouldn't surprise me either.  

My refrigerator throws eggs at me.  Yes, it really does.  I have never dropped an egg in my  life  but since I bought my condo I have had TWO cartons of eggs fly out of the refrigerator, and on to the floor.  The damn thing may be possessed, it may be defective, or it may just hate me.  I don't know...but it throws eggs at me.  

The Last Samurai is my new favorite movie.  I was sad, mad, happy and  moved  during that movie.  It was great!  I am not even attracted to what's his face...um....damit... Tom Cruise ...but I loved it.  (I thought the head Samurai dude was hot though.)  

Big C is driving up from South Carolina to do an estimate in Richmond.  He said I'm worth the 2 hours of extra driving to come up and make Friday night happy hour.  I'm all smiles today....

      I TOTALLY just walked in on my cat pissing on my closet floor.  I am so pissed.  Do you think she's getting back at me for something?  We've been in this wet food war lately.  Maybe this is her way of getting back at me for not giving in to her hysterics.  I wonder if she pees all over when I'm at work???  I'm very upset.

      Well I'm in NC visiting an old friend from junior high.  The weather was better down here then it was at home I hear.  My girlfriend is quite pregnant, quite Christian (I'm leaving for church in 50 minutes) and as I am sure you can imagine neither her or her husband drink or smoke.   So I have reduced my consumption of alcohol (one six pack on Friday and one bottle of wine last night), cut back on bad words, and prayed before every meal.  In spite of these slight changes I have had a great and relaxing weekend.  Yesterday Kathryn and I went to the mall where I spent too much money and got our nails (mani/pedi) done.  Then we went to dinner and a movie last night while Kobe, her 2 year old, sat at home with the babysitter.  It was fun.  We saw Raising Helen, the one with Kate Hudson that just came out. Yea, it made me want to sell my condo, move to NC, have babies and go to church on Sundays.  It was either the movie or something in the water here.  (I've started drinking orange juice instead.)

      I think Caesar is turning in to the not-so-boyfriend-boyfriend.  This is the stage before they officially become your boyfriend - when one denies the fact that they really already are your boyfriend.  It's slightly upsettling for this die hard single chick (see definition of upsettling below).

 Upsettling:   A 50/50 mix between upset and unsettled.  Word Origin:  Holly Kichinko - Publix - April 2003.

I decided last night while dusting that I have a knick-knack problem.  But then I wondered - are knick-knacks a problem of a pack rat or do most girls have tons of knick-knacks?  I really need to get rid of them -- but somehow I cannot.  Either way the house is clean and the shit is dusted.  It's just so much more work when you have to dust 5 jewelry boxes, 8 bottles of perfume, a brass horse, a china cat figurine, and a multitude of picture frames.

      Ok just scarfed down a sandwich.&nbsp; I am so stuffed.&nbsp; I am in between conference calls and meetings about this damn move.&nbsp; Verizon SUCKS in this area by the way.&nbsp; Don't get me started!&nbsp; On a better note - I talked to Big C last night about why we "broke up".&nbsp; It wasn't all that eventful of a conversation.&nbsp; I'm not even going to get in to it.&nbsp; The part I did like was when he said, in his  very  thick&nbsp;Honduran accent, these few phrases.&nbsp; Well before I tell you what they are let me tell you what he was trying to say.&nbsp; He was trying to ask me why I was "beating around the bush".&nbsp; INSTEAD he said this.....&nbsp; "Jess, why you beating on the tree?&nbsp; I mean, why beat  on  the bush?!"&nbsp; He said this in complete seriousness.&nbsp; Arguing with someone is so hard when they use this type of phrasing.&nbsp; How does one not break out in to giggles?

      If I don't blog I will explode!&nbsp; First of all I've lacked on the blogging because I am so busy at work I could   die  .&nbsp; Ok ok ok maybe that's exaggerating.&nbsp; I am packing up my office (of 6 people) in an effort to get ready for our big move on Friday the 30th.&nbsp; I normally blog at work because it's when I get time to sit and think&nbsp;AND -&nbsp;I'm sober.&nbsp; I am setting aside the packing tape and permanent marker to blog while I eat my morning bagel.&nbsp; Ok moving on... 

Last night I went to the Gypsy Kings concert with my friend Jeff.&nbsp; (There are two Jeff's.&nbsp; This is my friend Jeff that I met on Friendster.)&nbsp; He had an extra ticket and let me have one.&nbsp; Thank you Jeff.&nbsp; I had  SO  much fun!&nbsp; Close your eyes and imagine an entire field full of soaking wet mud covered Latino men -&nbsp;dancing.&nbsp; Add two bottles of wine.&nbsp; That my friend is my version of heaven.&nbsp; If you haven't heard the Gypsy Kings - go now to research.&nbsp; Next year I am buying tickets for both nights.&nbsp; I am trying to talk Big C in to buying&nbsp; tickets for tonight's show.&nbsp; The lawn seats are sold out but we could get the more expensive ones (covered chair area) and sit on the lawn instead.&nbsp; He didn't sound to enthused.&nbsp; Something about being mad that I didn't go with him in the first place.... 

Ok so this brings me to my next subject.&nbsp; The Big C just moved in to an apartment down the street from me.&nbsp; He moved from Lorton (25 minutes away) to Alexandria.&nbsp; Not just to Alexandria but  to my neighborhood .&nbsp; Not sure how I feel about that.&nbsp; I think he's creepin... 

I balanced my checkbook on Monday and I'm broke.&nbsp; I'm accepting donations.&nbsp; 

God...I am almost done with my bagel.&nbsp; This means I have to wrap up so I can go and pack up stuff.&nbsp; 

I am getting a pedicure sometime this week.&nbsp; Maybe tonight.&nbsp; I think I'm going to keep having them paint flowers on my big toes.&nbsp; I will post a picture of my toe when I'm done.&nbsp; Gotta go.&nbsp; But wait....

Courtney and Cory made me take a test to see what Political party I resemble the most.&nbsp; Resemble might not have been the word I wanted to use there - but I'm hung over.&nbsp; It said I was Moderately Republican.&nbsp; Huh......

      Ok it's been so long since I've written a real blog entry.&nbsp; I have been gone since July 9th on a work/fun trip to San Fran and the surrounding areas.&nbsp; I want to write all about it but I fear it might take days and you'll get bored!&nbsp; I'll try to sum it up as best as I can.&nbsp; Cool? 

Friday, July 9th (Staying in Livermore with Serena&nbsp;and her daughter Tara)&nbsp;- Arrived at the Oakland airport at 12am CA time 3am DC time.&nbsp; I was pooped but Serena wasn't going to let me off that easily.&nbsp; She crammed me full of unwanted martinis until I collapsed at 3:30am CA time and 6:30am DC time.&nbsp; Ok...maybe they weren't so unwanted. 

Saturday, July 10th&nbsp;- slept in really really late and then headed down to the pool for a little swimming.&nbsp; Later we met up with Courtney and Brianna for some yummy Japanese steak house stuff.&nbsp; More martinis.....we eventually went back to Courtney's to catch up on old times although I fell asleep in Courtney's room singing "I had a little Turtle" to Tara until she fell asleep.&nbsp; Mind you this is not easy to do after having had a few martinis.&nbsp; 

Sunday, July 11th - Went to see Anchorman with Serena and her friend Matt.&nbsp; It was hilarious!&nbsp; I highly recommend it.&nbsp; Then I took my first trip on the bart train to the hotel I'll be working at.&nbsp; Just like the metro - but it's the BART.&nbsp; Matt told me what it stands for but I can't remember now.&nbsp; I also don't think it's the "BART train".&nbsp; I think it's just "the BART".&nbsp; I've had much discussion about this.&nbsp; Please comment if you know.&nbsp; 

Monday, July 12th - First day of work at the Hyatt Embarcadero.&nbsp; We were having our annual conference and I was one of 9 girls working to help things flow, i.e. handing out name badges, assisting people with issues, directing people to where they're supposed to be.&nbsp; Yea and they made us wear fluorescent construction vests with light reflectors AND head bands with antenna.&nbsp; The antenna were shaped like bright yellow suns.&nbsp; Nice!&nbsp; It was all worth it because I met Karla - my new work buddy. 

Tuesday, July 13th - work work work 

Wednesday, July 14th - work work work 

Thursday, July 15th - work work work - my work friend Michele came to the meeting on this day and I was sooooo happy!&nbsp; 

Friday, July 16th - work work work - had our big hoo-ha dinner/dance night with the company.&nbsp; It was super fun and we go to dress in "club attire". 

Saturday, July 17th - work work take BART back to Livermore to stay with Serena.&nbsp; My friend Stacey from high school came up to stay with us.&nbsp; I also met up with Heather - another high school friend.&nbsp; All the Cabrillo High school people went out to dinner and then most of us went out dancing drinking afterwards...fun! 

Sunday, July 18th - Stacey, Heather, and I all went for breakfast.&nbsp; Then Pool time!&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little while&nbsp;Stacey had to leave - so sad can't talk about it.&nbsp; Finally Sunday night we.....damn I think I forgot.&nbsp; Oh I passed out at 10 something from exhaustion 

Monday, July 19th - GOT A FACIAL AND A FULL BODY MASSAGE.&nbsp; I was in heaven.&nbsp; Heather, Serena and I all went to the spa!&nbsp; I've never really been able to say "I'm headed to the spa now..."&nbsp; Sunday night we went to say good-bye to Courtney and his girlfriend Brianna ( most darling girl ever! ).&nbsp;&nbsp;It was&nbsp;was so sad to say good-bye because&nbsp;I haven't seen Courtney's face since the day we graduated.&nbsp; He's still just as cute though. 

Tuesday, July 21st - my flight out. All went well until I got to Dallas and my flight was delayed.&nbsp; Yea, so I sat and had too many beers.&nbsp; When I woke up at 1:30am&nbsp;I discovered that one of my bags had been lost.&nbsp; Which one? The one I needed most of course.&nbsp; NOT the bag with 2 weeks worth of dirty clothes...no...the one with my toothbrush, make-up, brush, deodorant, hair brushes, and work stuff.&nbsp; Yea -- that sucked.&nbsp; 

So now here I am.&nbsp; Chad, my house sitter, completely made a pig pen out of my place.&nbsp; I knew he was a complete and utter slob when I asked him to do this.&nbsp; And in all fairness he did me a huge favor FOR FREE but dude....he left 2 full bags of trash sitting by the door.&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp; It stunk in my house like trash.&nbsp; GROSS!&nbsp; That and my cat barfed all over my house.&nbsp; So now I am off to clean.&nbsp; 

Courtney, Serena, Brianna, Stacey, Tara, Heather and even you&nbsp;David -- I miss you already!!!!

      I met a little person who I am going to call The Bagel Beggar.  I met her last night for the first time.  She is about 2 and a half feet tall and likes pink dresses and princess books.  She also tells me that her favorite princess is Sleeping Beauty.  Well today I woke up with a hang over and went to Albertsons to buy breakfast stuff.  Well this is when the bagel begging started.  I got the feeling The Bagel beggar had never had a bagel before because she begged me for bagels from the time we put them in the basket until just now.  The bagels are done toasting.  She's eating her bagel and I am now in peace.  I'll post a picture of the bagel beggar soon.

      I leave tomorrow at 6:30 for San Fran.  I can't wait.  I will be gone until the 20th and I'm not sure how bloggy I'll be when I'm there.  I'm not sure how much e-mail I can check either.   I hope to take some pictures to share.  I wish I had a damn digi camera.  It would make my life so much easier!  Anyway - I will be sure to capture my bloggiest of stories on paper to post when I return.  While I'm gone one of my best friends, Chad, will be house sitting for me. I am slightly worried - but he's doing me a great favor by staying here with my cat so I'll just have to get past that!  Hopefully I will come home to a house that's still standing.  Chad isn't known to be the most sober, responsible, tidy person on earth.  He's mostly harmless in that he likes to sit around, drink beer and watch the history channel.  But you just never know....I'll keep you posted.

I watched Secret Window last night with my friend Jeff.  I don't know that I liked it - the movie that is.  Watching it with Jeff I found to be quite lovely.  I guess I did like it but I thought it would be scarier.  I liked looking at Johnny Depp is what I liked.  He was kind of dirty throughout the whole movie though which was kind of weird but yet -  hot .   It reminded me of that movie Signs because it had a lot of humor in it.  I am also not a fan of movies that end  that  way.  Seems like a cop out ending or something.  I won't ruin it - but you'll know when you see it I guess.

      At my parents beach house we have a pair of Mute Swans living on our lake.  Apparently Must Swans are not native to the southern Maryland area.  Maryland had two Mute Swans from Europe that were brought her in captivity in the 60's and escaped.  Those two swans had many more Must Swans and now we have a large population of these Swans in southern Maryland.  (This was all just some history before I get in to my story.)  So we have a pair of Mute Swans living on our lake.   I've heard Swans mate for life but I now don't know if that is as cut and dry as it seems.   Mommy and Daddy swan had 3 babies this year.  All the babies died but one.  I'd say the one that lived is around 2 months old or about the size of a large cat at this point. Well this past week a  Bachelor  Swan came to our lake and decided he wanted the female Swan for his own.  The big feathered brute beat the daylights out of Daddy Swan and left him lonely and bleeding on the side of the road.  Then he proceeds to shack up with Mommy swan.  Suddenly Bachelor Swan decided that since Baby Swan wasn't one of his he did not want Baby Swan.  So he begins to beat Baby Swan badly.  Bachelor Swan breaks Baby Swans wing, plucks his feathers out & tried to drown him.  During all this domestic abuse our neighbor Linda happens to be walking by.  Out of habit she looks for Baby Swan and realizes that he's drowning as Bachelor Swan watched!  She screamed for help.  Myself along with about 5 others watched as she hauled a canoe across the road and took off across the pond to rescue Baby Swan.   I was  throwing small rocks in the water around Asshole Swan...I mean Bachelor Swan...to try to keep him from further harming the baby.  Linda reaches in and grabs poor little Baby Swan by his fuzzy gray neck and pulls him out of the water.  I was waiting on the side with a towel.  I wrap up Baby Swan and carried him back to Linda's house.  We rinsed him off with the hose to assess the damage.  His poor little wing was broken and the bone was sticking out like a broken pencil.   After some time Baby Swan ate some cracked corn, drank from the kiddy pool, and took a nap in the laundry basket.  Early the next morning a bird rescuer came and took Baby Swan (whom I had named Sven the Svan) The vet had to amputate the wing.  After his surgery, Sven was taken home to live happily ever after at the bird rescuers house amongst the other rescued birdies.  The End.

      Happy Late 4th of July!  This weekend was a crazy fun weekend for me.  I had a four day weekend which was much needed.  Saturday my friend Angela and I drove down to the beach house to have some fun.  We had a few drinks at the Tiki bar in Soloman's Island where we met our new best friends Tim, Jeff, and Don.  They took us out in Don's boat to water ski and go tubing  in our clothes .  (I got up on skis for the first time!!!)  We're adopting those boys I think.  Sunday we did more boating but with my family this time.  The weather totally sucked and we got stung by numerous jelly fish but alas we had fun.  By the way that whole thing about being able to get sun burned in over cast weather is quite true.   My brother bought fire works from the pizza man and lit them for my Mom on the beach.  (It was her 52nd birthday).  Monday we woke up sunburned and so sore we could seem hardly move.  The pain was merely a reflection of the massive amount of fun we had - so I know I didn't mind.  Angela and I  finished the weekend off hanging out at our new best friend Jeff's house. We drank a few beers, watched a humongo firework show, and listened to Angela talk about highly inappropriate topics.  It was a blast.  I'm sad to be back at work and still sore.  Leaving for San Fran on Friday.....can't wait!  I wish I had pictures to share.

      Ok so I have to write this really quickly because I am going to the beach house today.  First of all I dumped the Big C last night.  Yup - I gave him the boot.  Why?  Because he was a doughnut.  

Last summer I read this novel called Faking It by Jennifer Cruise.  It wasn't all that deep or anything.  It was your basic lay by the side of the pool and read, book.  But there was this one part in particular that I really took to heart.   The Doughnut/Muffin Theory is what I call it.  Basically she explains that some men are like doughnuts.  They are yummy and gooey and great looking.  They have that sticky sweet glaze on the outside but the next morning they are stale and gross and stuck to the side of the bag.  You can't really keep a doughnut over night.  A Muffin on the other hand is lumpy and bumpy and not glazed but can taste just as good.  And it's better for you.  Muffins almost always taste just as good if not better the next day.  Get it?

So the big C was a doughnut.  He was a  really  pretty package but just not meant for the long haul.  He was sort of a .... liar .  He was a really hot liar... really hot .  But a liar.  So I dumped him.  I'm on the loose today looking for another pastry!

The End.

This is my cheatin ass x-boyfriend Mario in Miami where he took his current girlfriend for the weekend. Before he got caught getting his "Lolly Pop" licked by a good friend of mine - the boy had no job & no money. He sure as hell wasn't taken me to Miami! The boy couldn't even take me to Burger King! After 6 years, and a misplaced "Lolly Pop", you'd think he'd at least have taken   ME   to Miami. I'm totally talking shit but he's really a good friend of mine. I'm glad he doesn't know my blog address though!!  urlLink

      Today I had 2 of our top executives whining in my ear over not having internet access in our new office yet. Like there was something I could really do about it.  Hello!  My business card says "Executive Assistant to the President of SunDance Rehab" not "Internet Technology wizard with nothing better to do then listen to you whine". This brings me to my next point. Due to the lack of patience I've had since I quit smoking and drinking I've decided to make a slight contract addendum to my promise of sobriety. I am still going to remain sober, per my earlier blog, HOWEVER I am going to have to have the occasional cigarette. I CANNOT no...I rephrase I DO NOT want to quit smoking completely, for fear that I will do bodily injury to someone in my office. I'd rather have throat cancer then be this irritated all the time! So I am going to cut back and only smoke when ABSOLUTELY necessary. Since I'm not drinking that should be far less smoking then before any how. Feel me?

Today I bought an $80.00 desk chair for my new office space. It rocks. Desk chairs are the foundation for which your inner most assistant-ness comes from. It is enormously important that your inner most assistant be comfortable, free to swivel, have good posture, type and ultimately assist. For one to have this healthy inner assistant vibe - ones keester must be propped up in the perfectly designed, ergonomically satisfying, faux leather (pleather) chair. All for $79.99 at your local Office Depot.

Last night I had 2 diet cokes at happy hour. Then I went to Jeff's to do shit loads of laundry while he drank beer(s). It was the test of all tests. My two calming agents: Bud Light and Dryer sheets. I am proud to report -- I took a few deep breaths and succeeded to NOT drink a Bud Light but a few cups of liquid Downey Fabric softener instead. No, that's a lie. I did not drink fabric softer. I didn't drink a beer either. Woo-hoo.

I'm trying to eat healthier: 1/2 of Karyn's egg sandwich on bagel w/large coffee (breakfast), instant oatmeal w/diet Sprite (lunch), and a salad w/low fat dressing, 1 peach and a sugar free Redbull  and one tiny little kit kat bar  (dinner). Not so bad. Tomorrow I'm on to whole wheat bagels with non fat cream cheese, plums, and a Lean Cuisine (maybe 2 Lean Cuisines) ALL with a cup of liquid Downey fabric softener - no I mean water .. bottled water.

I miss my friend Carrie. I sometimes wonder if I'll ever see her more then once a month like the good ole days?!

      Ok my attitude is a little better BUT I am dying for a beer. Ugh!! It's only been 2 days. Cory - you're right - exercise is the key. I am doing laundry tonight but maybe the big gym commitment will be tomorrow. I think I might have to smoke a bit....is that bad?

      So it's Sunday at 6:55 and I've been in bed all day watching movies. I have had a wild weekend filled with booze, friends and now sleep. Last night at 2am I decided to "dry out". I am going to pretty much stop drinking (and smoking) for a month. I realized last night that I couldn't remember the last time I was sober. I have a few nights this month that might require some social cocktails/champagne. I have a bachelorette party, a wedding, and a bridal shower. Other then that I'm on the wagon and the official DD. I'll let you know how it goes. I am going to get a bagel (thanks Liz) and watch the rest of Bad Santa. So far today I've watched Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights (yes, it was as bad as you knew it was going to be), The Perfect Score (not so bad), and now the rest of Bad Santa. After that I think I'll bathe and then go to bed. I have a fun week of work in my new office! I'll keep you posted on the no-drinking/smoking plan. Maybe I'll chart it somehow or something.....
