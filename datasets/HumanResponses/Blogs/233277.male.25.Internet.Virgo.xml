      So, our outsourced support in Bulgaria went down for 4 hours this morning. THAT was fun. Then I got an interesting call where this woman with an English accent (which I love more than anything so I felt the need to talk to her longer if needed) had an OE error, 0x800CCC19. She called 3 times and no one could figure it out. Well, yeah, it wasn't on our end and if they would have LOOKED UP the error, maybe someone could have helped her. I happened to know that one by heart, and I know that Norton System Works/Anti-Virus is almost always to blame so I guided her through uninstalling the last live update, taking all entries out of MSCONFIG, pretty much everything short of editing the registry to help her, and it actually worked. I miss doing that kind of tech work. I love figuring things out and troubleshooting. With this job, there's none of that. I technically could get in a lot of trouble for even helping her that far, but I didn't give a fuck at the time. I was feeling nice and I liked the way she talked. (I LIKE THE WAY YOU TALK...MMMMMHMMMM...POTTED MEAT...) Anyway, she sent in a testimonial about me...that was really cool of her. I don't get many of those.  So, when I was all happy about that my big boss called me for a meeting about the knowledge base. I went over the status of everything pending, he told me the CEO doesn't like the way I write documents and doesn't think I am doing a very good job. I explained to him that yeah, right now on the KB I'm doing a shitacular job because MY SUPERVISOR has me on the phones or email for half the day, and I am working on a launching product's knowledge base, not the one the CEO is checking, because the new project was supposed to be first priority. He said he knew and he just wanted to give me a heads up. I have about a billion things I need to do now, I'm not sure what they want from me. Should I clone myself? That's about all I can do in order to get anything more done. Shove it, I am working my ass off. As for him not liking my writing style, I guess he liked this one guy named Andy's, who doesnt even work there anymore. What's funny is ANDY COULDN'T SPELL, he put 2 spaces after every period (I HATE THAT), his grammar was hellacious, he liked to capitalize random words for no reason, and overall I have pretty much needed to rewrite every document he has ever written because it looks like a 2ND GRADER WROTE IT. This is what he is looking for? Fuck me running. If they don't like it, I'll move Kylie (my second grader sister) down here, and SHE can maintain their knowledge base. She'd actually do better than Andy. Talk about insulting my intelligence. What a fucking crock of crap. What I write is fucking GOLD compared to Andy's piles of English Gone Wrong, and it was also painfully obvious that English was not his first language. I'm not too sure about how much longer I can handle this job. You have to be from a foreign country to get any love around there, and I'm not even kidding. I'm a minority (being whitey with no accent) in that office.   Ok, no more work rambling.   Sara: Before I forget, you wouldn't be able to rip that  Curvature of the Earth (Slackjaw) CD you got that is now out of print that I CAN'T FIND ONLINE ANYWHERE...would you? *enter eyelash fluttering* If you can then I would request you upload that shit to my FTP. Which you still do not have a login for, I believe. But you can have one. Yes. Whatever happened to them anyway? Why would such a lovely album go out of print? Why aren't they playing in John Brown's basement? WHY?! Plus when Chris from IFD uploads Shannon Wright, you need to hear that shit because you will be eating it up, my lady. I know you will. One more question (I should have just emailed you), what was that song Marla used to sing about the cleaning cart? What was the adjective used for the cart? This popped into my head the other day and it is bothering me not knowing.

      So our little recording session went quite well, we even got so much together for France (all we ended up playing) We're thinking vocals, I got some ideas, ohhh so many ideas. So much fun, Chris and I drank Heinekens and smoked, and I don't know if it sounded good because I was inebriated (I still am) or what but HOT DAMN, some of these things I played overlaid perfectly and I didn't even mean it. Jason is mixing it tomorrow. I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED! We were all freaking out, how much just one part improved the entire song. Especially how I was mixing what I had in my head with stuff I just felt at the moment, it was fucking ridiculously spectacular. I'm posting it when I get the file. Yeah, I definitely have a melody picked out for the vocals. I'm going to write now. I should be asleep. What am I doing?  I wish I was making out to Jeff Buckley right now.

      I managed to be extra productive at work today. Right now I am going to showah, then I'm going to put my final touches on my parts for  urlLink "France"  and  urlLink "Days to Remember" . Mmmmhmm. "France" needs a hell of a lot of spicing up done, a melody at least. "Days to Remember," not sure yet. I'm nervous as all hell, but I really shouldn't be...considering this is a very low pressure situation.   So, apparently when I had my lip pierced, the ring wasn't big enough for the swelling and therefore the hole inside of my mouth migrated to the top of my lip. I went to get a curved barbell, so it pretty much is a vertical labret now, which is actually fine with me. I might let it close and get it redone, I have no idea. Too much money to invest in body art, for right now. I guess it is a common thing that happens, Ben from work told me that's why he took his out. Grr. I do like Chronic Tattoo in PB though, it's such a nice facility and the people there are awesome and extra helpful. I've been there to have quite a few things fixed that I got done out of town. Maybe I should just learn my lesson and go there in the first place. That would be too easy, my friends.   I'm trying to get Mike to take my bunny this weekend, I have plans to go to Yosemite with David for a shindig. I can't get a hold of him. I need to find someone to take her for a few days, because all of my roommates are going to Arizona. So, if anyone reading this would like to borrow the boom-booms for the weekend, let me know.

      Why do I think it's fun to post pictures of myself when I was 20 and depressed? Not so sure myself.  We went grocery shopping and I'm pms-ing so all I picked out was junk food. Really. Chocolate chip bakery cookies, a chocolate bar and some blueberry muffin mix. And in a moment of "maybe if I suggest dinner for Thursday, Jer will buy me chocolate silk pie..." He did and OMG I want to make it now. I also had chocolate milk. Mmmm. Chubbs McFattie.  Sometimes I wish I was just normal.   I don't know what normal is! Do you?

      Even though I look good in those pictures, I was so depressed in every single shot. Anything last summer pre late July I was suicidal and oh so full of glee!  STUNT 101 BI-OTCH!  That's the song I get in my head when I see the shot of Angelina and myself.   The old apartment is CLEAN & I NEVER HAVE TO SEE IT EVER AGAIN! EVER!

      AngelAt3AM: how good is your tuna radar? PetYourWolverine: lol PetYourWolverine: pretty good AngelAt3AM: so... tuna? PetYourWolverine: definitely not tuna AngelAt3AM: albacore? AngelAt3AM: same can, different fish? PetYourWolverine: probably that mutated fish that swam too close to the nuclear power plant   I bought (above the knee) skirts for the first time in years, and fake tanned my legs. So far the nuclear orange afterglow isn't really that bad. Sara and I went to coffee and she went shopping with me and told me what to get and what not to get. I love her so much, she was pretty damned honest. I mean, she even told me when one was too short. And seeming as how she is only attracted to women, I didn't think she thought one could be too short, so I definitely know I can put some trust in her advice. I think we have some different taste though, I absolutely loved one top that she told me looked like vomit. Haha. I'm really glad we are hanging out again and that our little misunderstanding/hurt feelings thing has been buried. She is definitely the female that I have bonded with the most with in San Diego. I would hate to lose that. She also took great pictures of the party we had about 2 months ago, and she gave me the doubles.   I think I might skip the gym today, since David and I hiked approximately 9 or 10 miles yesterday. Pretty hardcore, definitely the longest I've ever hiked or even considered hiking. I think I did alright though, I really thought I would be a huge wuss but I never really felt I couldn't handle it at any given point. I'm in much better shape than I assumed I was.   I feel oddly uneasy today. I am pretty much doubting everything in my life right now, it's pretty unsettling. I think I am going to do some of the organization tasks I promised myself I would do, practice for meeting up with Jason and Chris for the musical work we are going to do tomorrow, and try to write and sort out the shitload of garbage that is running through my head.   Yeah.

      "Police are on the trail of a nude cyclist seen pedalling through the streets of Paisley [Scotland].  The man has been seen several times riding through the Renfrewshire town wearing nothing but a baseball cap.  A Strathclyde Police spokesman said: 'Some people might giggle at the idea of a nude cyclist, but this man clearly needs help.'"  Hahaha....      More randomness....     Man, we were cool, haha.     Speaking of Science Teacher Obsessions... here's one of me writing on Mr. Logan's leg. Hurrarr!     Annnnd... the classic photo of Travis Kavulla that I will never let go away.

       urlLink What a headline!   You must all hear the following:     urlLink Cibo Matto - About a Girl    Yes, that's right, folks. A Japanese girl band covers a Nirvana classic. Pretty impressive, considering none of them speak English. But of course, it does not beat  " urlLink Know Your Chicken ."     urlLink Yogeshwor Amatya - Hoi Nana    I can't even explain this. It sounds like Krusty the Clown picked up another language and mixed in several instruments that sound pretty fucking bad together. I guarantee that this is a crowd pleaser. Stan apparently downloaded this on accident 4 years ago and just can't delete it. It's just too good.    urlLink Missy Elliot - Hot (Ratatat Remix)    Thanks to Torin for this gem. If you can't shake your booty to this... you just have no soul, my brother.   I am now on the phone with the biggest idiot of all fucking time. Maybe I am the biggest idiot for assuming he knew SOMETHING about what he was doing, but I wasted 20 minutes trying to get him connected to his email when HE'S NOT FUCKING CONNNECTED TO THE INTERNET. I really hate it when that happens, and it is (I guess) usually my fault for ASSUMING they are connected to the internet when ATTEMPTING to access their EMAIL. Grr!   I made the best vanilla nut coffee, I am going to drink the entire pot. I like working Saturdays more than any other day, because no one is here, I blast my music and just have a grand time with myself. I still don't like the fact that it is Saturday and I am at work, but working on a Saturday here is actually pretty nice.   And now for some of my old gems:      Kim sent that to me a while ago, I never knew about her bisexual side until recently. She also admitted that she thought I was really hot. (hahahaha) She really was one of the neatest people I ever met, and hilarious to boot. Plus, she threw the best New Years parties, I believe 90% of the hickeys I received in my lifetime were at those parties.       First of all, I realize how very pathetic I must have looked taking a picture of Mr. Truax on the bus on the way to Yellowstone. I am sure he knew I wanted him. If taking his classes for 2 years and smiling like an idiot at 7am for AP Bio didn't give him the hint, I'm sure maintaining a 99% in the class and staring at him did.      Wow. I am sure Sara will appreciate this one. John Dalke, Editor of the Great Falls High School Roundup in Disneyland, JEA/NSPA convention, I believe. We just thought these wooden things were fun to take picutres with, or climb on. It turned out that they actually SHOOT OUT FIRE. About 2 seconds after this was taken, a big flame shot out right where his head was in this picture. I think I nearly peed myself laughing.     Now, this picture is a classic. I believe Brent and I were wrestling. A litte history about Brent - everyone in my circle of friends wanted him, which was awkward. he flirted with everyone and I don't think he actually wanted most people he flirted with (me especially), but lord knows I wanted to hit that. Anyway, I loved this picture because it looks like we're doggy-styling, and also, Candice's hand is positioned in such as way that it looks like she is reaching for Nick's pants in the background. It's like an orgy.      It's an artsy dark photo of Sara's bother in Denver for the Bush show. Sara, I hate to publicly admit this on the internet, but both Heather and I thought Luke was pretty hot. Sorry Heather, I had to come clean.       urlLink DAVE  DREW ME!      Hahaha, God damn that's hot. ;) PS- Your new site looks fucking awesome, good work my dear.   Oh God and I found this on Dave's site, this was the best logo ever:      Teehee! Rob, Dave and a giant happy sandwich.      I love this picture so much. 15 and with braces, a photobooth, and my heeterhair.      This is definitely one of the cutest pictures I ever got of Kylie when she was a toddler.   OK, enough of that, you have all been bored long enough.   Wait one more!     OK.   AND:

        Does anybody else see a particular dairy product on my thighs? I DO. My thighs are so sick and wrong. SICK AND WRONG! And on my right side. Do I belong on the dairy aisle?  Fattie just came into the back room and made a flying leap onto the bed with a bed THUD. She's a vocal kitty, even when she doesn't mean to be. She's just a kitty.  I made chicken-rice-and black bean enchaliads last night for dinner. SO YUMMY. Wanna know what I made them with? Seriously, you must try this....Rice-A-Roni Mexican Rice flavor, a can of black beans, canned chicken, which I chopped up and took out the nasty dark meat, and enchalida sauce. I heated it all up and wrapped them up on tortilla shells and topped them with more sauce and cheese and baked until they were heated up and the cheese was melted. Yield: 8. Feeds: Jeremy, myself and our next door neighbor. Well, there is only two of us here and we don't eat that much...Well, I do and apparently it's causing DAIRY LEGS.   On the plus side of this terrible head we have been having, Jeremy and I have gone swimming a lot and I have the perfect tan (except the tan lines). If I tan anymore I will surly burn up. Then I won't be able to go to work....Hmmm....Speaking of work I am finally getting more hours next week, which is good because in 5 days I have to pay this place $300. Wednesday is payday! HOORAY!  I dreampt the other night that Jeremy's mom Linda died of a heart attack and nobody would call 911 or try to save her. I woke up thinking SHE WAS DEAD. Well good morning!   I always think I have more to write. I was watching something on MTV which had the Beastie Boys on it and they sang the one Kristen and I used to sing...MOM SAID ROCK IT TIL THE BREAK OF DAWN! I was also watching it while drinking so I was going hysterical. I miss Kisteen. I miss dancing to Allyiah with her and singing to DMX with her. :(  I think I just broke my chair trying to dance while sitting down...Uh-oh!

      Tonight I am going to try to get my DVD player to work. Then, I am going to the gym because my uterus feels like it is falling out and I need to take my mind of physical pain. Then when I come back, I'm going to smoke some fine herb. If my DVD player is working, I'm going to watch Viewphoria because I still like the Smashing Pumpkins, and I don't care what you think about that.   I also need to find out if MyPleasure.com has a return policy on vibrators. (Don't get the  urlLink Scintillator .)I'm guessing they don't. BUT, the last few times I tried to use it, I needed to put in the batteries BACKWARDS (what?!) to make it work, plus strategically hold the little speed adjuster thing otherwise it was going all over the place. Not what you typically want in a vibrator. That's ok though, because I still have a few trusty backup devices. I'm still sad though, because no device beats the pink vibrator. No other device. *sigh* I also found that I need to stop stashing sex toys underneath my bed, as people tend to look under it. Chris did the other night when I was cleaning because the bunny was under there. He didn't say anything, but HE HAD TO SEE THE STASH. How mortifying. Oh well, we hear each other get down all of the time because our walls are so thin, I doubt anything is too taboo anymore.   I hate having roommates sometimes, though. Alas.

      I feel pretty shitty/down today. I really have no reason to, I guess. The P is now out of PMS, yesterday was a great day, etc. Hmmmmmm.  HMMMMMMM. Maybe it is because i was up til 1:30 am looking for my time card and building access card and I still could not find them. This will be the death of me.    So, I got to spend nearly 3 hours at Planned Parenthood last night, that was fun. Especially this one girl who just had more fucking nerve than anyone I have ever seen, quite possibly. The waiting room (small) was packed and they were backed up with exam rooms so most of us were going in a few times, then coming back, waiting for an exam room. Well, this girl decided to eat a Lunchable and scream on her cell phone in the waiting room and just seemed completely oblivious to her surroundings. There is a big sign that says "NO FOOD OR DRINK PLEASE, THANK YOU" and "FOR PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY REASONS, MOBILE PHONES ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED IN THE OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION." But, no. This girl just decided it was time to stuff her face, and yell into the phone about some limo ride, a hotel that was $900 a night, used words like "hoochie mama," etc. Everyone was just staring at her, wishing she would shut the fuck up. But no, that went on for a good 20 minutes. Ugh. The fact that she was eating didn't bother me, it was that she was talking unnecessarily loud AND with her mouth full. So irritating. Why can't people just not be irritating?  Anyway, once I got in there it was boobiegrope-grrr-cold-speculum-swab-swab-swab, thankyoucomeagain. No horrible stories like, well, every time I've been to Planned Parenthood. I'm sure most of you recall the first time I went and the doctor told me she could tell I was "fertile right now." Out of curiosity I asked how she could tell just by looking, and then she took the swab she was using, STUCK IT IN MY FACE and said "See, look at the consistency of this coating on the cervix, it's very thick and sticky and this indicates..." FUCKING DISGUISTING. GET THAT CRAP OUT OF MY FACE. If something is on my CERVIX, that means IT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE CENTIMETERS AWAY FROM MY FACE. Actually that probably wouldn't freak me out now, but Jesus; I was 18 years old, scared, tense and afraid my mom would find out I was going there/having sex and it really didn't make me feel any more at ease having my own cervix juices in "warm liquid goo phase" forced upon me. Hahahahaha. Good God.   Random thought - Jason put some good live Pinback on my FTP, if you use it. Also in Matty's Folder of Cool (/shared), there's a ton of new shit including Velvet Revolver. I don't know why I am such a big fan of this project - I haven't really listened to or cared about Stone Temple Pilots in a long time, but I guess Scott's voice with a fresher sound gets me all up in arms. I'm enjoying the fuck out of it. If you do not already have an FTP log in,  urlLink email me.   Do you think it is safe to say that usually people who have similar tastes in music get along better, have similar personalities, etc.? I know this sounds kind of like a crack addict's theory, but for some reason the people who have come along in my life that I have deeply connected with on one level or another usually shared some sort of musical passion of mine. Maybe I take music a little more seriously than most. I have eclectic tastes so I'm not saying I am exclusive or elitist about it or anything like that, and some of my best friends have musical taste that is really no where near mine. On the flipside, I have met people with taste similar to mine that I ended up hating. I guess what I am trying to say is that music is at least a strong element in connecting with people for me. I am not sure if anyone else feels this way.   I really fucking hate explaining why I hate Michael Moore to any one of his bajillions of followers. (The following is not an organized argument, but a rant. Please stop now if you would like to save yourself.) People don't seem to get the point of why I hate him. His views are fine, many of them I agree with, or I find interesting or respectable, but his delivery of just about anything he has ever done has had a certain tone (which I cannot quite pin down) that just annoys me to the point of wanting to shoot myself. He comes off as a very arrogant, pompous being and I want to punch him in the face, about equivalent to the degree I'd like to stab Rush Limbaugh. This is not a matter of partisanship or not being liberal enough or being too conservative to appreciate his work - I simply think his work fucking sucks, and he fucking sucks, and I really have no desire to see anything he puts out, ever again. I think the only reason so many people love to lick his balls is only because he is the only one popular enough and getting out there doing what he is doing, which I can respect to a degree. But it does not change the fact that I fucking hate him and when I hear him talk, my ears bleed. So please, no one ever ask me why I hate Michael Moore, because I just told you and I do not want to discuss it again. No matter what you say, I will not be swayed, I have been exposed to enough of it to where I think I have a good grasp on his work in general, what you saw in it is not going to make it change for me, although if you want to explain why you like him that's fine - I'd love to know why you think what you think. But I will no longer discuss why I hate him. Accept the fact that I hate him. And you can say all of the cliché things that everyone else says : "Oh well the media is what gives him the arrogance that you see" etc, but I strongly disagree. It is carried out in his personal demeanor from what I have seen, as WELL as (mostly actually) in his work. Plus, none of you (I assume) know him either, and all you have to work with is from his work and what the "media" has told you as well, in one form or the other. So don't feed me that horseshit. Blaming the media is SUCH a lame way out of an argument unless you are blaming a certain form or specific media. When someone says "the media," that can mean anything. Even if you say something as specific as CNN, I can  work with that; but telling me that "the media" is feeding me bullshit is just not going to work for me, because the only way we communicate through this country is through media of one form or the other. Everything, I can guaranfuckingTEEyou, that you have come to the conclusion to about politics has been influenced by this so called "media" which you love to hate. To say anything otherwise is pure ignorance, and you should also be shot. It is such a common argument and it turns me off and makes me pretty much assume that anyone who uses such a generic out of an argument is not worth communicating or conversing with on such a topic. I actually wouldn't even MIND talking about why I hate Michael Moore but everyone I have discussed this with that likes him uses it as an open invitation to bombard me with reasons why I should bow down to his tubby fucking lard ass. No, I shouldn't do any of that, and neither should you. The "shock value" of his work is what makes him popular to the younger college crowd from what I see, and I've never really been attracted to any of that, now or when my mind was more malleable. I think there's several other ways to get your point across, and Michael Moore's so-called "documentaries" are not the method I prefer. Period.   And I am done ranting.

          From a Bad Analogies list I saw recently, there were a few that reminded me of my fellow, um, hankerers? (What are we called anway?)  For April: "His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like underpants in a dryer without Cling Free."  For Rob: "Bob was as perplexed as a hacker who means to access T:flw.quid55328.com\aaakk/ch@ung but gets T:\flw.quidaaakk/ch@ung by mistake."  For Myself: "The politician was gone but unnoticed, like the period after the Dr. on a Dr Pepper can."  For Tyson: "He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience, like a guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it."  Heather's analogy pending.

       Brian: I was discussing yesterday, with my associates, the origin of the term "dyke", any thoughts? Me: they block the cock Me: which is somewhat of a barrier, like a dyke Me: that's my reasoning Brian: hahahaha, that's an A for creativity Brian:    Dyke   This term for a lesbian is a clipped form of bulldyker, an American slang term that dates to at least 1906. The clipped form dyke doesn't appear until 1931. The origin is unknown, but the fact that bulldyker is the earliest known form by several decades limits the possibilities significantly.  Douglas Wilson, in Comments on Etymology, Vol. 31, No. 9, May 2002, outlines an interesting hypothesis. He speculates that it may be from Boadicea, the Celtic warrior queen who led the ancient Britons in battle against the Romans. Boadicea's name is also commonly spelled Boudicca or Boudica--forms which can be easily corrupted into bulldyker. The metaphor of an Amazon-like warrior queen for a man-like woman is clear. Boudicca's true sexual orientation is irrelevant (and impossible to determine after two millenia); what is important is the image and the metaphor. Wilson suggests the appearance of the term at the turn of the 20th century may coincide with a renewed interest in the story of Boudicca. A famous London statue of Boudicca in a chariot was dedicated in 1902 and Queen Victoria's death in 1901 invited many comparisons with past English queens, including Boudicca.  Wilson is not the first to make this leap. Judy Grahn suggested in her 1984 book Another Mother Tongue that Boudicca may be the inspiration for bulldyker. But Grahn suggests that that the term dates to Boudicca's days, which is completely untenable. The term is recent, even if the source of its inspiration is old. (Note that the Boudicca hypothesis is speculation. It's interesting, but speculation.  The word is apparently unrelated to dike, meaning an earthen bank used to hold back or control the flow of water, a dam. This sense of dike dates to the 13th century and probably comes from the Old Norse dik.     There is your tasty bit of lesbian knowledge for the day.

      You know what I miss most about working in a stuffy, cubicle-filled office?  Screwing with people in the breakroom.  Somehow I'd always end up talking with a friend in there when some stranger would walk in to get some water, and I'd launch into the end of a sentence like I was talking about something crazy.  "--so then I was like 'No, it's Step Kick Turn Kick Step Step Kick Turn *SPARKLE*', and I told him if I didn't see more sparkle next time he's off Team Burlesque."  "--name of the position is Niagra Balls, but honestly it felt like a slow trickle."  "--naked and reading Maya Angelou.  How about your weekend?"   "--fit about, ohhhhhhh gosh, about fifteen, but of course it depends on if the pants have an elastic belt and how much they wiggle around."  "--who gives a shit?  Who.  Gives.  A.  Shit.  Nobody gives a shit.  I don't give a shit.  Rest of the family doesn't give a shit.  Why should we give a shit?  Anyway, that's how I told it to her.  I had to.  Just.. pisses me off.  I don't.. I don't know--is your Grandmother like that?"  Especially funny when you could tell they heard it when they smiled and turned away or unintentionally looked over before catching themselves doing it and hurrying out of the room.  But maybe it's a funny story they brought home or to a party.

      Well there ya go, Kristen. Even the picture you put up there matches the one on the article.  I went swimming today and didn't put sunblock on my boobs, so they are now red and white. If I had blue frostbite somewhere, I would be all set for 4th of July. It being 92 degrees outside, I don't think that is going to happen.  We live next to two old people who are very nice. We offered to give them our empty boxes because they are moving into a new condo here in about a week. So we just stacked them up on their porch and it saved us the headache of dealing with them. About 20 minutes ago the doorbell rang and the lady brought us a vase of red and white carnations. The people are so nice out here...A lot nicer than living next to the old trailer trash bitches down on Cleveland Avenue.  I LOVE CHUBBS MCFATTIE AND YOU SHOULD TOO!

      Lol. That title is a result of me, dehydrated, sick and very exhausted. Why? Because at 1am last night Jeremy says "let's just finish unpacking the entire apartment." So we did. From 6am-3am yesterday, we moved and unpacked everything we own. The cat loves it here and pretty much everybody in this building is old. Like grandma and grandpas. I thought they would hate us, as most old people do not want to live next to two young "punk as kids" as we're sometimes refered to. Everybody was so nice and they were all "Welcome to Woodhaven! You're going to love it here!" like it was a resort we had checked into for the weekend. Very nice.   On the other hand, it was 95 degrees yesterday. And again today. I know I didn't drink enough water and I didn't get enough sleep so a little flu-bug (as my mom would call it) has set in. Lovely.   On to pogo.com because I can actually PLAY games now! HOORAY!

      I was going to exclaim, "KRISTEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS FINALLY WORKS AND _______ IS THE GREATEST PASSWORD!"   I was this close to revealing my true password identity.   The only thing I have to say today is that when someone tells me they like my shoes I should just say "thank you!"   When someone says they like my shoes I usually say, "Oh, they smell REALLY awful."   And then I go on a tangent about how I sometimes wear them in the rain to walk dogs and the soles are made of wood so the odor is trapped and turn my feet into corpse flowers.   It's a good thing no one's telling me they like my underwear, right?   Because then I'd have to go on a tangent about how penicillin gives you yeast infections.

         I've always wanted an Olsen bobble-head. That's kind of what she looks like. Poor thing.   I guess she's not the only ex-Full-Houser in the news recently, with Uncle Jesse and Rebecca Romijn STAMOS (that was for you, Sara. Ok, one more time. STAAAAMOOSSSSSSS!)splitting up and all. Hey, what ever happened to Uncle Joey? Was he in any movies or anything after that? I think I definitely would remember seeing a movie and saying "HOLY SHIT, IT'S UNCLE JOEY!" Of course, nothing beats Bob Sagat's cameo in Half Baked ("I used to suck dick for coke!"). Oh yes.   They really need to do an E! True Hollywood Story on the cast of Full House. I know I'd care. They should throw one in for the Golden Girls, too. Wow, now that I live where no one watches TV, I should really start catching some GG reruns. I know I'd try to watch it when I lived with Mike, but it was met with a firm "I don't fucking think so" every time. DAMN IT! I know that I am not a bad person for enjoying the Golden Girls, because I know Amanda and Heather loved it, too. THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND! TRAVELED DOWN THE ROAD AND BACK AGAIN...YOUR HEART IS TRUE, YOU'RE A PAL AND A CONFIDANT *boom-boom da da boom, boom, boom* AND IF YOU THREW A PAR- ok, I'm done.    Oh, and if the picture in my blogger profile isn't nostalgic, I am not sure what is.   I love how when Heather sent me Kristy's wedding pictures, she named this one "HERE COMES THE BUNG!"     AWWWWWWW. I still don't get why she is getting married, but that's ok. She did it. Good for her. I think. I swear to God, if/when I get married, I am having an elaborate-to-the-nth-degree ceremony just so we can really all party hard. Not that anything is wrong with small, private ceremonies. But I recall my mother saying that when I do get married, it is on her. Open bar, my friends. Open bar. OPEN MIC.

      ...but, I drink my own urine. Is that necessary? No, but it is sterile and I enjoy the taste."   Dodgeball was probably the best fucking retarded comedy since Zoolander. I was highly impressed. I want to share this with everyone. I want to go see it again, it was  that  freaking great.     Now  my throat is sore. Fabuloso!  I must be going through some serious givememidolplasebeforeiyellatyouandeatallofyourfoodandyoutooifnecessary today. I imagine this will get even worse throught the week. Word of warning to anyone this may effect. Lack of nicotine should really put a holyshitwatchout spin to the entire bitchfest, and I have no idea why I am running my words together. I always feel weird getting hormonal. It's almost like I am the Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer; except a cavewoman, and not a lawyer. I get hungry, and needy, and horny, and just...not in control of myself. Grr baby, very grr.    Rob, give me a good idea for a semi-elaborate recipe idea for this week. You are the only domesticated male friend I have. And make it vegetarian; I recall you usually leaning that way, anyhow. I'm very demanding of you, I just realized this. I'll take pictures of Boomer in a cape, I promise.

      I pulled out some old De La Soul yesterday. Mmmmhmm.   I just slept for 14 hours. I feel...gluttonous. Also, well rested for the first time in a while. So perhaps it was worth it. I always feel bad about skipping out on plans though (as in the 2 I skipped out on last night). It makes me feel like I am a cop-out and therefore no one wants to invite me ever again. Or, I could just be paranoid. I set my alarm for 8pm, but I must have snoozed right though it. I remember waking up briefly at about 2am with the Boomer's ass in my face. I forgot to put her in her cage before I crashed, but she didn't rape and pillage too much of my room.   I also just reformatted my laptop, because Windows decided it was time to hate. Windows loves to hate me, we've had several run-ins with each other. So, everything is gone. I suppose anything too important is on my webspace, I usually back anything up I know I cannot lose on there. Shit, I lost Office 2003. Wait - I have the CD. Ok, enough of this stream of consciousness crap. I just hope I didn't lose the Macromedia MX CD Rob sent me, as I love to dick around with Dreamweaver. Speaking of which, Rob - I don't like this template. I am changing it. BOO.

      I can never think of anything nice to have as a user name. Twilight_Chubbs is really the best I can do. That's sad.   I am so sleepy from packing, but thankfully it is almost done. I can't wait to get out of this dump and decorate the new place. I wish I had more friends that could come over and see it. We bought a new blender, which will be used for Margaritas only. Smoothie maker my ass, it's a Margarita Maker.  I talked to my mom last night and she wants to go to Hardin for July 4th. Hardin is some small hick town somewhere in Montana. She wasn't sure weather to go or not so she said to herself "I am going to be like Heather and just get in my car and go!" LMAO. My mom is so adorable.   Kristy is getting married today. I talked to her last night and she said she is just excited to get it over with. Lucky her. She got $500 from my mom and dad (along with new sheets), a pearl necklace and earrings (REAL pearls) from my grandma along with some cash, I am sure. Her and Eric are going to Yellowstone for their honeymoon. Hmmm. Gysers, how romantic...and perverted.  I don't want to work today. Anybody want to go for me?

      One more thing -  Uh Huh Her  isn't exactly what I thought it would be. I was ready for some raw PJ action (like I read in reviews)...but it just doesn't turn my crank. Lyrically I like "The Slow Drug" more than any other song, I guess melodically "You Come Through" is definitely the strongest, but the rest is kind of ignorable. I'm highly disappointed, I suppose it could grow on me but I've only been anticipating this album for a fucking eternity. Blow me, PJ. BJs from PJ.    GinWomenBlues: O.  MG. GinWomenBlues: I need this CD. GinWomenBlues: http://www.marked4sale.com/asseenontvshop/monsters_of_rap_cd/ GinWomenBlues: I totally forgot about "Knockin' Boots" by Candyman.  *AND*  Snap's I Got A Man.  Holy.  Moly. GinWomenBlues: OHHH IT'S A TWO DISC SET. PetYourWolverine: lol PetYourWolverine: WHAT'S YOUR MAN GOT TO DO WITH ME? GinWomenBlues: hahahaha GinWomenBlues: I'm not tryin ta heah that, see PetYourWolverine: I GOT A MAN PetYourWolverine: Sara loves that PetYourWolverine: hahaha PetYourWolverine: holy fuck PetYourWolverine: Tennessee - Arrested Development PetYourWolverine: this is gold GinWomenBlues: Hell yeah! PetYourWolverine: You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo ? GinWomenBlues: I don't want to know know PetYourWolverine: fo' sho sho. GinWomenBlues: (that sounded so gay.  I'm having a gay day) PetYourWolverine: (me too, yay) PetYourWolverine: (we got rhymes galore, yaw yaww yawwww yawww yaw FLIPMODE) GinWomenBlues: (*jazzhands*) PetYourWolverine: (lol) GinWomenBlues: I'm not sure how one would whisper jazz hands.  I'd assume it'd be like us somewhere where you shouldn't laugh, like a funeral or a church, and you look over at me and I do a really small jazzhands so I can watch you turn purple trying not to giggle PetYourWolverine: At the next funeral I go to, I am definitely whispering jazzhands.

      I am trying to think of who will want a log in to post on this. I guess I will just leave an open invitation to anyone who comes across this. If you're incredibly cool, maybe I will consider it. Email me: succexxy@gmail.com. Oh, and I have a buttload of Gmail invites, if you or your ginuea pig would like one. Rob, you are also assigned to think up a kickass design. Or I could just rip one off, like I always do.   I hate to move around again, but my domain was fucking out of control. Anyone who reads this probably already knows how many times I have moved pages, switched domains, etc.   Mike and I decided we will go see Dodgeball together on Monday, since we both have the day off. I almost fell off the cross trainer laughing when I saw the trailer, so I am hoping it will be good. I want to hang out with him more often and make sure he's ok and whatnot, but I honestly do not have a lot of time to invest in that right now, as harsh as that may sound. It's not like he does either, I think his new schedule is Tuesday-Saturday, 2pm-11pm. I don't think a schedule gets much worse than that.   I'm trying to get some of my shit together and achieve some sort of sense of organization. Not necessarily organization of my possessions. For example, if you look at my VHS collection, everything is alphabetized. I think someone said something to me about that a few weeks ago and was laughing hysterically. Is that really  that  abnormal? I admit when I did that to my 200+ CDs back when I was at the U of M and also went as far as labeling them with my name, that may have been a little overzealous. But damn it, alphabetizing is NOT A CRIME.   Anyway, the first priority is to get some sort of long term plan going as far as school is concerned. I have several options here, so it is going to be a hard thing to decide on. I think I need to actually sit down and think but nothing about the subject for a while, weigh it out and stop hitting the issue with splotches of thought when the subject comes up or I feel like it. I guess I am a little bit secretly ashamed that I am not finished yet, so it is somewhat embarrassing. I'll just need to suck it up and fucking do it, though. Don't get me wrong: working in tech support jobs and floating through life for almost the past 2 years hasn't been a horrible experience. I think I've had quite a bit of fun along the way. I learned a lot; not only about this field of work, but about life in general. I seem to seesaw on this issue, though. I don't think I have a level of satisfaction about how my life is going that I had at one point before. On the other hand, I am much happier than I was when I think I had the highest level of productivity. I'd like to achieve and maintain a high level of both. Hopefully it shouldn't be as difficult as I think it is going to be, especially since I am pretty much a completely different person than I was even 2-3 years ago. I shouldn't get worried about it, realistically. I was planning to get the rest of my gen ed credits out of the way at the local community colleges. I don't want to be bored either, though. GAH. Maybe I can finish my gen eds and get the hell out of San Diego and find some sort of calling. That sounds like somewhat of a plan.   I would also like to really work on playing the violin again. I'm talking about going all the way - private lessons, practicing regularly and getting to be as good as I used to be (better actually) so I can actually join an orchestra. I think my brain needs this kind of stimulation - or at least I know I strongly miss it. There really is a void where that used to be for me.   This along with paying down my debt, exercise, diet, quitting smoking, etc seems like a lot to try to reform at once, so I'm going to try to plan it all out and take additional time if necessary. I just feel that for the first time since I moved here, I don't have any negative distractions to keep me from pursuing these things. I think Mike always secretly cheered for me to go kick ass and conquer everything I wanted to do, but in a way I think he was afraid of that, so he was hindering me in a lot of ways. I might "wander" or something. Bah. Yeah, I'm such a wanderer. I need an icon that rolls its eyes right about...now.   On a not-so-serious note, I just went to the bathroom and one of the toilets had a bunch of paper in it and it was pretty gross looking, so I attempted the "duck-and-flush." BAD IDEA. Water went flowing everywhere, it was out of control. I had to open the tank and rip out the stopper to make it stop, then find a way to clean up all of the water. Which I didn't completely do, but at least it's a tad bit better. What a day.   I think I have had...20 hours of sleep this week, total. That's pretty fucking horrible, but it has been worth the inconvenience. David and I had plans to eat, be productive and go to bed early. It turned into eating, talking, napping, drinking, talking some more and Celebrity Jeopardy ("Words that end in 'amburger'")until I had to leave for work.   Hopefully I'll have some sort of balance when it comes to that next week. I think today after work I'm going to take a serious nap and check out a few things happening. Some guys from work invited me to a party which should be cool (very funny, smart people in general) and Stan is also having a shindig. I am thinking I may partake in a bit of both, especially since some of my boys from Speak With A Geek will be there. I miss them so.  marcus a shogun: OMG  urlLink RODEOHEAD  PetYourWolverine: lmao marcus a shogun: IS THAT NOT THE BEST FUCKING THING EVER TO ARISE FROM THE HAND OF MORTAL MAN PetYourWolverine: I think I peed all over myself. marcus a shogun: thats going on every mix cd i ever make from now on until the end of forever PetYourWolverine: "god loves his children. 10-4" marcus a shogun: YES!!!@(&*^ marcus a shogun: BEST FUCKING PART marcus a shogun: i was gonna quote that to YOU marcus a shogun: BUT YOU DID ME FIRST marcus a shogun:

      ...because I better think I am the shit if I can pull this off on top of working full time:   Total: 13 credits   Monday / Wednesday (which will be my new days off):  11am-12:20pm  120 - Economics: Intro to Economics (3.0)  12:30pm-1:50pm  110 - Sociology: Contemporary Social Problems (3.0)  5:30pm-8:30pm 131 - Biology: Into to Biotechnology (4.0)   Thursday:  6:30-9:45PM 107 - Philosophy: Reflections on Human Nature (3.0)   You know what? If I'm going to do something, I'm going to go all out. I am not going to go to Miramar Fucking Community College for the next 3 years going part time. It's time to get this show on the road, baby. That will give me a total of 30 credits under my belt (which is nothing and embarassing), but that also means if I just push myself to 15 for the Spring/Summer sessions I could actually be DONE and apply to transfer to work on my major at UCSD (if in San Diego) by THIS TIME NEXT YEAR.  I just hope this doesn't ruin my life.   I was going to take more Math/English, but they are prerequisite classes and I'm waiting 'til next semester to do that.  Mmm. Wish me luck, classes begin 8/30 and go til 12/18.   I apologize if I go insane in advance to any of you who are closely interconnected to my life.   But no, really. I should be able to handle this. That still leaves me plenty of nights to hang out when needed. At least I am taking all of them out on Monday/Wednesday and then I have Thursday night taken as well. No big deal. I can do it.   I've been lazy for way too long. I've had enough stimulation/enjoyment for a while. I don't see it as being unhealthy or unrealistic to try to push myself. The last time I was this busy, I lived off ephedrine and coffee and looked like a crack addict. Let's hope that doesn't happen again.

      Your friend Rick who recently moved here messaged me on MySpace.  Is he as awesome as he appears to be?      Also, I've realized that my job pretty much only requires me to say no.   "Can I do this?"  "No."  "Can you do this for this customer?"  "Hmmm...no."   "He's yelling at me, can you take the call?"  "Nah."  "But!"  "No!"

      I never know what to write for the title, so that's what you get. Deal with it.  I haven't worn makeup for nearly three days. Today I put on eye stuff. My complexion is actually clearing up. This may be a start of a new thing. If I don't wear anything on my eyes I really have no face. We'll see how this works out.  I want to drink out of a straw like you wouldn't believe. Sucking is not allowed when you have stitches.  I don't want them to come out and I don't want dry socket. I am not too aware what dry socket is but I have heard that it's painful!

      It occurred to me today, when some guy at work (whom I’ve only talked to once because he asked me “Why are you so quiet, acting like you’re too good for everybody?”) said “What’s up, legs?” that I should probably not be so nice and easy going when it comes to such commentary from people who are obviously giant ass fucks. I don’t want to be the typical female who cries about every little comment who comes her way, but I DO take a lot of shit from people, I HAVE taken tons of shit from people in the past. I can think of at least 3 situations from past jobs where I should have slammed a motherfucker with a sexual harassment lawsuit, no questions asked. Frankly, I really should not put up with it when it is obviously highly inappropriate. Yeah…going to work on that. Who cares if I am known as the ice queen? Don’t call me legs and scan me up and down like a fucking pervert, you fucking creep.

      Okay.  I really can't decide if I should move to San Diego or San Francisco. Here's what I'm thinking:  San Fran is a much more urban type of city. I would have trouble keeping my new truck there, and I've never really lived in a crowded city like that. There is a lot of animation industry, which I want to go into, and the school seems like it's good, and in a really central location. But something about the city doesn't feel right to me, just off the bat.  San Diego is a much more relaxed city, and it's much more spread out. I'd be able to have my truck there with no problems. The school isn't as central, but it's in a pretty good area. I could also probably live a little more inexpensively, as far as getting an apartment, etc. The animation industry isn't as booming, but certain companies ARE there, that are very interesting, such as Rockstar Games, Sony Online, and Midway.  I would obviously be more comfortable in San Diego, but would I be cheating myself out of better opportunities? Am I just backing down from the "real city" because I am afraid of the crowds? Should I push myself to broaden my horizons? Which would be better for me, in the long run?  Any thoughts?  ...

      (That song always reminds me of the Saved By The Bell episode where Jess takes speed to get through her studying and she sings "I'M SO EXCITED, I'M SO EXCITED, I'M SO...*sob*...SCARED!")  So I called the admissions office and talked to the residency clerk. I really got lucky, because I was planning on having to go down there again with my paperwork to prove I've been a resident. But she just asked me if I lived here a year, had my licence/registration, filed for taxes in CA, etc. I said yes and she just said "Ok, well I cleared off the flag on your ID, you'll be charged resident fees now. Anything else?" No... but I love you. I. Love. You.   I'm going to go down to the counseling office sometime tonight to get some guidence on what I might want to take, and I am supposed to schedule my classes tomorrow. Hurrah!  HURRAH!   HURRAH! I'm going to finally do what I came down here to do in the first fucking place!  Heather: It's fitting that last night I dreampt Snoop Dogg went down on me Kristen: lmao Kristen: how was it? Heather: Pretty good! Kristen: hahahahaha Heather: I was on a table! Kristen: where at? Heather: I don't know. Some weird hotel

       urlLink Kristen's Ultimate Pole Dance Mix   This is really  quite  the hilarious compilation that I came up with, here. It may seem odd, cliche or sometimes even unfitting to the purpose of a pole dance mix. We are all our own judges of sexy, no?   Mind you, I had a  very  scientific approach to making this mix.   1. I heard the song. 2. I imagined a pole. 3. I imagined dancing with, or caressing, or sliding up/down the pole. 4. I imagined the song at  the same time  as dancing with, or caressing, or sliding up/down the pole.   Also, most of this is extremely (and I mean  hardcore -extremely) nostalgic. Nostalgic to the point of nausea. Heather and Sara will most likely be the only ones to really get a kick out if it. If that's how it is, then hey...I pleased a good audience.   Enjoy.   (Edit: I lied. "We Be Clubbin (Eye of the Tiger Remix) is just hilarious and reminded me suddenly of Candice. I am not sure if I could pole dance to that.)

      This was the last thing I have heard a person say...from the gas station attendant in San Juan Capistrano. I always have something weird happen to me in San Jaun Capistrano. If it isn't a scary gas station attendant, it is someone backing into my car in a Taco Bell drive-thru, etc.   It took about 3 hours to get to Long Beach; mapquest estimates one hour and 40 minutes. Not too bad, it helped that I was able to stay in the car pool lane for a majority of the trip. We grabbed dinner, I dropped Captain Koala off, and called  urlLink Jedd  because I was feeling up to hanging out and felt almost 100% better.   So I get to his place, he insists we are seeing Napoleon Dynamite. We almost get there, and he says, "HEYYY, shit I forgot, you have to smoke this stuff with me, let's go pick it up." I can't remember what it was called, but it was 27% THC. We met up with his friends Chris and TJ (whom Jedd continually called "Peaches") and smoked. And let me tell you...no one was going anywhere after that. We had a hilarious discussion, though the subject matter seems to be escaping me. I remember Jedd talking about a fly going into his nose when he was still in the Philippines at age 7, and he tried to blow it out and it was bouncing from a "bungee chord of snot." We wandered over to Denny's (I had the biggest craving for hot chocolate) and I can't believe it but they now have a Cinderella Slam.  Cinderella...slam.   Yeah, nothing intelligent was actually discussed, but I laughed the entire night and had a blast. Jedd also had a fascinating story about a drunk man he helped rescue who's entire foot was dead for 4 days once they found him...the tissue and everything, and it smelled like "rotting flesh, urine and feces." He said it was like a rollercoaster of all things putrid, and he was unable to eat for 3 days afterwards. GROSS.  By the way...Long Beach is (cartman voice)IN THE GHETTOOOOO!!! Never been in scarier areas in my life. Maybe I'm naive, but that was pretty fucking scary. We took 30 minutes replacing my headlight (since I became paranoid and refused to drive home without it being fixed). Now, a headlight should not take 30 minutes to replace with 4 people...but it did. With a pair of pliers and the light of my cell phone display, we managed.   Now Playing: DNTEL - Anywhere Anyone  And...I'm spent. I feel lucky, healthy, lovey, and still a little bit high.  And something else, but you have to guess what it is.  I'll give you a clue... it's not "kitty."       Get out of my head. GET OUT OF MY HEAD!

      Jeremy's pain killers make my stomach hurt. My tooth make my mouth hurt. It's not a win-win situation.  Tomorrow at 2pm I will be getting a tooth pulled. Not too nervous about it. I am not looking forward to having gauze in my mouth, but oh well.  Absessed fun for all.  MESSY FACE!

      Oh boy. Something is very, very wrong.   I felt a lot of back pain yesterday but didn't really think about it twice. Just due to, uh, physical activity, ovaries, whatever, I assumed it was no big deal. Then it started feeling like I was being poked with stabby guns...then I literally passed out on my bed around 6:30. Dave called and I told him I'd have to skip out, especially since I realize this pain because it is all too familiar and has happened before. Definitely my kidneys. I'm very dehydrated, I'm trying to drink water but it really isn't helping much. My body also decided it would like to vomit (what little I had actually eaten that day) around 8pm, really helping out the dehydration issue.   I guess I just wore myself out to the point of something this unrelated happening. I jinxed myself completely...I was just telling Mike the other night about how healthy I had been and how I haven't really been sick in ages.   I really have no idea what I am going to do. I can't go to the ER or the doctor, I don't have any health insurance. I guess I'll call my mom and see what John has to say about it. I don't feel too bad right now, just the back pain is there and I felt capable of going to work. I just feel a little out of it, I guess. I don't know if I should still drive to Long Beach or not, Dave said to call him and tell him this morning so he could catch the train up there. I'm just scared because my mother has always emphasized how if something is wrong with your kidneys, you need to get it taken care of immediately, or you can die.   Yay, death.  Rarrr.

      ...but ever since I wrote out what I need to do, it seems to be much less complicated.   Tonight, I am taking Dave Sherburne and the boys to Dave & Busters. I will ride the vibrating snomobile (OH YEAH!), play skeeball, and get royally fucked up.   Ok, maybe not get fucked up. I'm driving.   TSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  Tomorrow I am taking Dave to Long Beach to catch his flight back home, and Jedd declared since I am in the area, we need to hang out. My itsie-bitsy Jeddie! I am excited. Pawty-all-de-time.   Wednesday is "band" practice...which means I need to find time to actually practice before then.   I have to see my Shanna at some point...  (Yes, I have ownership over people. Shut up.)  My headlight is out. My car insurance expired. I have $60 til Tuesday because I JUST made a budget and I was stupid this month about money. Kick myself later...fix it now. Catching up is the hard part. My mind keeps seesawing over the idea of getting another job just for a month so I can get caught up...ugh. If anyone has an easy job for me I can do from home; like data entry, phone sex, whatever, you let me know.   You all know I am joking but, yeah... me doing phone sex. Wouldn't that be hilarious? Especially since I am almost incapable of talking dirty, I get embarassed. It really doesn't make any sense, since I am so vulgar otherwise. I just know whenever I have tried I get this "Oh no..should I have said that? I shouldn't have said that. Should I have? Oh no! BOY, IS MY FACE RED!" dialogue going through my head. Hilarious, yes.   PUT YOUR HOO-HA IN MY HEY-NANNIE-NANNIE! (That's courtesy of Mike, one of my favorites.)  I could donate plasma...I haven't ever stooped to that yet, although all of my friends have and they said it was no big deal. Donating eggs makes you bank, too....but I heard that's not good for you. Plus, it would be weird knowing there were little redheaded amazons running around. Freaky deaky. Although, maybe they'd just be amazons; the redhead trait in my family has always skipped a generation.   I found my old psychiatrist's business card in my purse, which is odd since I haven't seen anything of the sort in 2 years and through cleaning out my purse. I found it to be a little bit karmic, even though I don't really believe in karma. Anyway, I just wrote her this 3 page letter about how much ass she kicks and what I have been up to. It's actually really nice, and I think it is well written, I just should have done it a long time ago. Hopefully she feels the love when she gets it.

      When we were at dinner last night I noticed some perve things on the menu. Some were right in your face; Honey-Dew-Me and such. I liked The Big O and Spreader. Spreader was one of my favorites. One of the desserts was called MESSY FACE. I pointed it out to Jeremy and said "that's what you're gonna get tonight!" People heard and thought HE was the one being nasty and they blamed it on him. Fun times. If I remember correctly, I think Frankie Doodle has a very nasty menu in the way they describe things...Maybe Sara will remember!   &nbsp;

      So I decided to make zuchini bread because I had some extra zuchini. Yes, easy enough right?  Instead of vanilla, I accidentally put in MAPELINE! Instead of cinnamon, I accidentally put in NUTMEG!!  Upon further inspection of the cabinet, I discovered that I had no Vanilla at all, but I did have Cinnamon. It was just on the wrong shelf.   However, I tasted the batter, and it actually seems like it might be good. I'll let you know.

      Our neighbor asked if we would watch her schaunzer this weekend. So we are and I am also burning her daughter's CD collection. At the moment I am really stuck on Nsync. Ahhh. The memories. The biggest Nsync fan I have ever met was Kevin. I should have really known he was pretty damn gay and that it wouldn't work out at that moment.   Anyway, Jeremy and I have now been together for an entire year. Today is the actualy anniversary of when we met face to face...yesterday was the anniversary of meeting online. We're proof that meeting on the internet and having sex on the first date doesn't mean that it won't work! DAMN IT IT HAS! People are still shocked we met online.   So tonight I think we're going to The Onion for dinner with the rest of the Costco food court since they are celebrating Pizza Week being over.  I celebrated the last two days by being sick to my stomach and very dizzy....6 Tylenol later I feel better!

      David's friend Rahul sent him  urlLink this song , and you must all hear it. Definitely the most hilarious thing I have heard in a long time.  P.S. - There's more creations I found  urlLink here .   Last night David and I were making dinner (specifically, stuffed mushrooms)and I was making this sort of sauce that was supposed to go with it. It was supposed to be processed but David was limited to a blender, so I put everything in the blender and started it. Nothing was actually being blended. So, I add the milk that the recipe called for, thinking it would help. Then milk starts oozing out of the bottom of the blender. I realized I didn't even put the blade in the bottom, and crap is going everywhere because I DIDN'T EVEN ASSEMBLE THE GOD DAMNED BLENDER! Other party fouls included dropping cheese on the floor and cutting up onions incorrectly (but that is nothing new, I think David is convinced I will eventually cut off my own hand with my lack of knife safety skills).   I smell like a genius!  I guess the lesson would be: "Don't drink and cook." But really, what kind of lesson is that?   DOLPunkGuy: the only thing i love about my job is ringing up land-o-lakes stuff PetYourWolverine: OH MY GOD DOLPunkGuy: because my little lcd says things like "LOL BUTTER" PetYourWolverine: that happned to me at 7 eleven !!!! PetYourWolverine: YES! DOLPunkGuy: or "LOL 4 BUTT" DOLPunkGuy: hahahahaha PetYourWolverine: I kept my receipt! DOLPunkGuy: isn't that awesome! DOLPunkGuy: hahahahaha PetYourWolverine: yes! DOLPunkGuy: the first time i saw it DOLPunkGuy: i fucking died DOLPunkGuy: i was like "LOL BUTTER!!!!!" DOLPunkGuy: and started cracking up DOLPunkGuy: and the lady i was checking out looked at me like i was a cokehead PetYourWolverine: yeah I forgot to get some at the store and we were making something that needed it, all they had at 7Eleven was Land-O-Lakes stick butter PetYourWolverine: and they gave me my receipt and I cracked up DOLPunkGuy: hahahaha DOLPunkGuy: it's the best PetYourWolverine: oh man  DOLPunkGuy: i'm glad i'm not the only one amused by that DOLPunkGuy: that's kinda weird/scary PetYourWolverine: yeah i'm surprised you brought that up, random! DOLPunkGuy: i mean, who else notices shit like that?  Just fucking freaks. Just fucking freaks, like me.

      to Oprah.  I was at the gym yesterday, and I can't help but read the closed captions on the television. Oprah is always on. She had on a woman who wrote a book about women and alcoholism, and I believe the end of the interview ended with "Being a stay-at-home mother is the hardest job in the world." The audience exploded in applause.   Are you fucking me?  I'm going to the gym now, and I think I may just close my eyes through my workout and try not to fall on my face. Or stare out the window.

      So, this guy I used to talk to online a lot when I was like 17-18, just in casual conversation hit me up on AIM for the first time in years the other day. He writes for the Sci-Fi channel and had other such projects as technicalvirgin.com, that's all I remembered. Anyway, he decided just to tell me that he was married now and that there is a character in 2 of the latest books he wrote in the Star Trek series that were inspired by me.   Now, I have always sort of wished I could inspire someone for film, music, books, etc. But a Star Trek book...wow. And someone I barely know/remember? Wow. I'm not sure what to think about that. But now I guess I'll have to pick it up, just to see exactly how I was inspiring or what this character is all about.   Also:   Check out the caliber of professionalism the technicians I supervise apply to their customer response!     I apologize for not doing it yesterday, but we were understaffed and the customer queue was huge. I left it for the end of my shift and gave it to a sales person who promised to do it. I'm not working today, but i logged in just to check if it was done .. and it wasn't so i did it today ( i guess the sales person is not interested in having you as a customer ).I've spoked with [name] so don't worry.    and:    I see that you were impatient and called today to have 2 years added to your domains. Lots of luck!   I received the call about these and apparently my boss is suspending him for 3 days.   Ahhhhh. Lovely.

And in other funny news, when Tyson was out riding his bike, he came back to the car and found this left on the trunk:     Can we all read that? That's almost as good as the time I found a postcard with a loon on it where Peggy from elementary school was talking about her love for Chris Grimshaw. If for some odd reason I still have that, I'll take a picture of that too.

      David sent this to me:    I was just finishing up a piss, when in comes [insert coworker's name here], who sidles up at the urinal next to me.  I say 'How's it goin?' and he sighs heavily and says, "No blood in my urine would be a good thing."  I say, "Well, we'll leave it at that."   Hahahaha. This is the same individual who sat by us when we went to the Padres game on the 4th who talked about trying to impress girls in competitive eating events, and almost getting his band's song about a famous competitive eater onto ESPN. Riot, riot I say.   I found my bikini. Hello, pool! You're gonna get served, and then it's going to be ON.   I really want to skinny dip sometime soon.   David, make it happen.

      (At first I thought that song said "What's your take on Paxil daddies," and I was all excited because I thought I was the only person who ever used that term.)  So, Starsky & Hutch was mediocre. The shining moment of the movie was Will Farrell's character, which was a prisoner with a hairnet and a dragon fetish. You really can't beat that. I also loved that they played that Skyrockets in Flight song in the car at one point, and then David discovered that it was a real song and not made for The Anchorman. Oh man. Fucking adorable. :)   I also saw Bad Santa. I think the best part of that was when the bartender hit on Billy Bob's character and explained how she was raised Jewish and was restricted from Christmas activities, and that him in a santa suit turned her on and it made her feel naughty. So she banged him in his car while screaming "FUCK ME, SANTA! FUCK ME, SANTA!"  hahahahahah, oh fucking christ eating key lime pie. Oh, and also when he said (while doing some other chick) "Oh, oh, oh yeah, you're not going to shit right for a week."  In response to Justin telling me "You never take any pictures of anything but your fucking face," I took  urlLink this picture.  Enjoy, motherfucker...I hate you. PS - my milshake is better than yours.   It's ok to reference that song now, by the way. Because I think it is dying out. It's just like how I can say someone has "dumps like a truck, truck, truck" because no one plays the Thong Song anymore.   At about 2 am, being too hot to be under the blankets and too cold to be out of them, I woke up completley frustrated about not being able to sleep. David was here, and he wasn't getting any sleep either. To help the situation, Chris and Brian were fucking TALKING TO THE FISH IN THE FISH TANK and I wanted to go out there and whack them both on the head with a giant stick. Why? Why is it necessary to talk to the fish in the fish tank when there are people trying to sleep across the papper thin walls in this house? Also, my rabbit decided it was time to jazzercise and throw around her bowl in her cage. I am going to get her another clip-on crock so she can't do that anymore, or possibly just put her cage outside. That might be the best solution.   I think I really shocked my roommate Chris the other day. I think his jizz-tasting-like-pepper story came up again in conversation, and he started talking about how he can taste multiple things on women and how he has been told that women can taste coffee on him and that it's disgusting. All I could really reply with was, "Just tell her to shut up and swallow," and everyone listening almost died.   What?!  Ok, everything I just wrote had sexual connotations. Someone needs to brainwash me so this can stop.

      First of all, let me tell any of you who are considering ever moving to San Diego...don't live in Mira Mesa. Every part of my body is sweating. I think there's internal parts of my body that are sweating. Everything is sweating. Apparently, when they developed this area in the 60's and 70's, it didn't get as warm as it does out here right now, so they figured building air conditioning systems wouldn't be necessary. Now I guess with global warming and God only knows what else, it's 95 degrees out here every fucking day for the past few weeks. Dying. At least I was smart and picked the downstairs bedroom, as opposed to the upstairs one.   Oh,  urlLink here  is something I found to be entertaining.  Last night I saw Dave and his little posse he brought along. Giant jokes ( I am the giant, har har har ) were cracked the entire night, and Dave gave me the  Attack of the 50 Ft Woman  poster I have wanted for a very long time. And I am borrowing Season 3 of Sifl & Olly to burn. YAY! We had Thai food and at the place we went it was free desert night. We also watched the new network comedy "Quintuplets," which was quite possibly the worst television show I have ever actually sat through in my entire life. I guess it was funny to sit there and bash it. There were also about 5 billboards around town that only say "Nighttime ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" with a picture of like an elephant or ape howling at the moon. Dave kept asking if we could go to the zoo, and I told him it was too late. Then he would point to one of the billboards and say "YOU'RE LYING, LOOK! IT SAYS 'NIGHTTIME ZOOOOOOoooOOOOOoooOOO!'" Haha.   I decorated my room some more, but I think I might be going overboard.   April, you do realize that this is quite possibly one of the greatest pictures of you of all time, right?     And Sara... urlLink Grace  is easily one of the most adorable infants I have ever seen in my life, and I have seen more babies than most people my age... so that's saying a lot.   I have come to several realizations over this past week about a lot of things, as a byproduct of writing and writing and writing AND WRITING for hours upon hours. Not all of it has crystallized enough to really talk about in detail, but I am pretty sure I want to go to school for Biology. Goal: Medical Research. The response I've had has been mixed when I have brought it up to a few people, but I don't really give a shit. My mother was really supportive when I told her about the ideas I had, which is good. I'm sure John is too, I don't see why he wouldn't be as it took him 15 YEARS and 5 different Universities before he finally found out what he wanted to do and became a doctor of Internal Medicine. (He also has a degree in Psychology, which is hilarious since he is probably one of the most mentally abusive and depressed human beings I have ever met in my life). I just think it is a goal that is definitely challenging enough for what I would want, the job itself would be productive, innovative, and stimulating to me...from what I know about it. I would (of course) like to talk to some people in the field to find out more, as well. But I think starting out with Biology as my major would be SOMETHING, I'd also try to focus a lot on Chem/Physics since my background in those areas is pretty bare.   I think the hardest thing for me along the way about finding out what I want to do is the fact that I know I could do anything that I wanted to do. That may sound pretty conceited and presumptuous, but I know I could. No one ever had to tell me that for me to realize that. I have known that since I was a very young girl.  Tech work has been great for the past few years. I have learned a lot and gained a lot of skills that I wouldn't have gained by continuing with retail management, or not working at all, etc. However, at this point I think there are too many things about it that are way too tedious and old already, and I can't think of any particular area to study or that really produces any interest for me. I think that continuing with the company I am with now through the time I am here or until I find something better is a good thing to do. I will continue to build experience that I can use to continue to work in the tech field until I can actually start working in areas that have to do with my final career goals.   So, yeah. That is what I have decided for now. I guess it may sound odd to anyone who knows me really well because it isn't exactly anything I have talked about pursuing in any detail, but when I weighed out what I was looking for and what all of the different areas I was considering had to offer, this outweighed everything by a landslide. This is the most I've had in front of me that made any sense. I'm going to grab on to it, and not let go. For now.

      Starsky and Hutch is out for sale today. I never saw it in the theatre (odd for me, I know) so I am going out to rent it now. NOW I say!   Did anyone see it and think it was completely retarded in a bad way? If so, speak now.

      I'll make sure to take several frightening pictures like last time. I'd post them, but I was really fat and I don't like looking at them. hahahaha.   OK FINE.    urlLink I'll post the one I took with Chris.     urlLink And this one is just really really horrible, but Dave's face is priceless...so you have to look.    Speaking of me being fat, urlLink  here's Morgan and I ...and SURPRISE!!!! I WAS FAT!  And that was my horrible short hair, as well. A little grown out. Wow, did I regret that.    urlLink Oh man, I need to stop looking through old files.   We'll take some non-lardy-Kristen pictures this time.

      I'm often sad about that the fact that here in the big city no one on the street bothers to look me in the eye or say hello.  &nbsp; When you're walking past someone you have&nbsp;a 5 second window of oppurtunity to smile or say something polite.  &nbsp; Who cares if it's "My, isn't this day beautiful?" when it's raining, you don't have an umbrella, and you're slinging a plastic bag full of wet dog crap mixed with grass in your hand?  &nbsp; Just say something!  &nbsp; But then sometimes I take it all back.  &nbsp; I take it all back when I'm walking a pretty dog who doesn't have to poop on a truly beautiful day and a man stops to say hello.  &nbsp; "What kind of dog is that there, hm?"  &nbsp; "That's an English Springer Spaniel!"  &nbsp; "An Enspanol Springlish, hm. I once bought a dog for a lady down the street there, hm. She was 94!"  &nbsp; "Oh, neat."  &nbsp; "Yeah, she died and then the dog died 3 month later, hm. It died of starvin' to death, hm."  &nbsp; And then he just walked away.

       urlLink This  is exactly what I needed.  I'm going to punch you in the ovary. Right in the babymaker.      It's SO HOT! Milk   was a bad   choice!   I listened to Franz Ferdinand and actually enjoyed it today. I listened to almost nothing but that album for 2 fucking months and I was so sick of it. Now it sounds good again, hooray! I also just downloaded Take Me Out (Daft Punk Remix). I'm not even going to tell you what that sounds like, you have to find it. RIDICULI.

      where Rob had decided that instead of designing webpages, he was going to make unique messenger bags. He gave me one that had some sort of tropical bird (perhaps a toucan though I'm not sure) and it had red feathers glued to it.... though last time I checked, toucans didn't have red feathers.&nbsp;He was using the bags to make romantic gestures, as in, "I give this bag with love." &nbsp; There were other things going on, but obviously this part was so strange that it's what I can most easily recall. Feel special, Rob, feel special.

      Why am I not tired? I should be dying right now.   Stan: "You're walking funny." Me: "No I'm not." Stan: "Oh God, yes you are." Me: "Shut up Stan, just shut the fuck up, I am walking just fine." Stan: "God, I hate you."  I discovered that I can parallel park like a fucking champ while stoned. (I can't parallel park  at all  otherwise.) I can also jam out pretty hard to Le Tigre.   Work is sucking already, this is going to be a long weekend.   There's a tech in Bulgaria who AIMed me with his screenname that includes "silverchair." So, I started making chit chat about Silverchair since they were my favourite band at age 15. So funny. He talked about how angry he was that Daniel Johns is putting off the "new album" for another Paul Mac collaboration called  urlLink The Dissociatives  (like their former project "I Can't Believe It's Not Rock!"). I asked him why he was angry and he said "I hate electronic music." Yes dear, but your buddy icon is also a LIMP BIZKIT icon. I need not discuss music with you any further. Besides, I can't Believe It's Not Rock! was fucking awesome, I don't care how lame or gay that makes me to any of you. "Staging A Traffic Jam" is the best. So there.   I used to hate most electronic music, because all I ever heard was candy raver garbage. Lately I have been hearing a lot that I like...I guess I was just underexposed.   If any of you have FTP access and now can't log in, you need a new username and password. The company was charging me for extra accounts even though I should be able to have up to 50 on my plan. Whatever, I cut it down to one login so if you need it, lemme know.

      I found a portable cd/mp3 player at Target for $30. THIRTY DOLLARS! And it's Audiovox, which is semi-shitty but not all that bad, I guess. I just couldn't stand not having music in my room, and I also needed something for the gym. Hooray.   I went to lunch with Mike, and he paid me the part of the deposit we got back. Apparently we weren't supposed to get back our deposit at all, it had the wrong apartment number on it when they sent it to Mike. Hahaha. Ooops. Well...it is cashed now, motherfuckers.   He also told me a pretty bad story about this chick he met at a bar in PB. Apparently she was with a friend, and she was flirting with him so he was buying her drinks, they talked for like 4 hours, she was "really hot" (who knows though, he did date ME) and she kissed him on the cheek before she left. She also gave him her number and told him they should do something the next day, and they made tentative plans. So he calls her, and she tells him that she is sorry, but she "has a boyfriend." OUCH. TSSSSSSSSSSSSS! OW! TSSSSSSSSSSSSS! OW!   In relation to your last post Heather, who was the stupid girl you dated for like 2 hours in high school? I remember her name was Kristen but she went by some other name that sounded floral...what was it...OH! DAISY. God I hated that stupid bitch. She was so braindead. About as much as Sam(antha) Baiz, who my sister continues to hang out with to this day. WHY GOD, WHY?! Such a dumb ho.   I'm actually rather surprised I haven't done anything with anyone on the female side of the fence up to this point. I've never even KISSED a girl, which everyone I know (gay or straight) seems to have done but me. I guess Sara and I grinding on the dance floor at Bad Kitties sorta counts, but not really. No, it actually doesn't count at all.   Rob just told me that some anarchist message board linked to this blog re: Rob's Daily Show appearance. Uh oh. I didn't know this was being eugooglized. I'm going to have to do some meta tag editing up in here.   GinWomenBlues: So they searched.. for.. like.. "anarchist+daily show+ed helms+dude posting about interview experience in weblog that barely mentioned his name+women's underwear"

       Last night my friend Kelli (coworker)&nbsp;and her finace' Eric came over to play games and have some drinks.&nbsp; We started playing Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, and after discovering that Jeremy and I know pretty much everything about each other and Kelli and Eric know nothing (and they are the ones getting married), we started drinking some margaritas (YUM! Blackberry is the BEST). In the kitchen while making chili cheese fries Kelli told me she is a bit of a closet lesbian. I asked her if she would ever sleep with Britney Spears and she said maybe and she told me she felt a girl up and kissed one but that's all. I told her I had a girlfriend in high school, but we never did anything except hold hands and we only dated for about 2 days. More drinks later, Kelli looks at me while we're sitting at the table and says "Heather, you're so sexy!" This would have all been flattering except Kelli is extremly unattractrive and the thought of doing her makes me ill. Imagine Travis Johnson saying this to you (for all you Great Falls High fans out there). Yea, makes you queasy. Then I get up, ready to puke to make some more drinks. She says to Eric "Do you think Heather is sexier than me? Is her ass nicer than mine? I wish I had a waist like hers. Heather, you're so hot!" AHHHH! Jeremy, on the other hand, IS GOING HYSTERICAL. Later on that night, Kelli asked if I wanted to go into the closet with her. Um, no, thank you. So yea. No, I will not have sex with you.    &nbsp;  Jeremy took me to the batting cages yesterday. So imagine me, the big ditz standing there with a ball hurling at me. I ACTUALLY HIT SOME OF THEM! I did a lot better than I thought I did. Jeremy fouled one off his leg onan 85 mph pitch. I stuck to the 25-30 mph cage, thank you very much.     &nbsp;  I want a HOT girl to come have sex with me. And Jeremy. Thanks. Do you know anybody?   Am I shallow to want a HOT girl?

      All I have to say is:   What a beautiful fucking day!   PS: This is why I think April is the love of my life:    I've decided I will settle for nothing less than homemade smoothies and cuddling while listening to sad female soft rock. Enough of this banging heads, I have a tattoo watch me play guitar, let me spank you and call you Captain Kangaroo while you shove pine cones into your butt upside down kind of guys.    PS - Thanks for The Faint, Torin!   And I uploaded Damien for anyone who wants to listen to male soft rock.   Did I ever explain the weird connection and fucking hate and malice I have for Mazzy Star's "Fade Into You?" I explained this to David the other day. I think I have had at least 5 (five) ex love interests/boyfriends put that fucking song on a mix cd they made for me. FIVE. FIVE of them including that fucking song. Now, I'm no whore, and 5 is actually a large percentage of people I have ever dated or that I was interested in. I am actually thinking of using that as the ultimate judge on whether it just might not be "meant to be." David didn't do it. I think he might in the near future, out of spite. But now I think that, which means I expect it, which means maybe he won't.   Hahahaha. Someone smack me with a 2 x 4 before I go loopy.

And she drank that wine. And while wine would easily get her drunk more than any other boozy in the land before a baby was but a twinkle in her eye..... post-baby birthing.... she. is. drunk. After a big glass and a half.  &nbsp; &nbsp; But I highly reccomend the J. Book...somethingortheother out of Washington. Who knew WA could have wine I'd like. &nbsp; I raise a glass to you all.

      Why can't anyone in this God damned world fuck their ideals, fuck their philosophy, and just fucking give a shit for another human being for one second? People are selfish by nature. You are not a unique fucking flower becuase you choose to be selfish. What really tests a person is their capability to stop being selfish in certain situations.  I seem to be the only person on this God damned planet who makes any sacrifices for anyone lately. Everyone else is too fucking busy thinking about themselves. Don't get me wrong, I spend plenty of time thinking about myself; but when someone comes and talks to me or has a problem or just wants to vent, it's time to stop (for oh, maybe even 20 minutes) and not think about myself for a tiny fraction of my day. Sometimes people just want to vent and don't necessarily have an objective, and you should just fucking listen and shut the fuck up. No one wants your fucking advice unless it seems relevant to the situation and you have it readily available to offer.   Sometimes, people just would like to know that someone out there listened and understood what they said. I haven't felt like anyone has truly fucking listened to me in fucking eons.   Fuck everyone. I declare that I should move to a desert island and live in total isolation. With my bunny.

      If things pan out well, I'll be getting all my dental work done in September. And by dental work I mean getting all but six of my teeth yanked out to be replaced by dentures. Yup. Those things grandma washes in the sink at night. A plus? I will have a nice smile, no more pain and I am sure my over all health will improve. Oh, and they are going to knock me out for it, and that's nice.   So I went to Cash & Carry and bought myself some Peach Jet Tea. MMMMMMM. So tasty, especially when I can make it at home instead of paying $3 at a coffee stand.  Kelli, Jeremy and myself went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 again last night. I missed a lot in the first one (being that I don't follow politics a lot, there was a lot of info, and I was very tired). It made the funnier parts even better.   I finally cleaned out my car from when we moved nearly a month ago. We had a broken chair that had been hanging out in the backseat of my car. It found a new home in the dumster. I am not so sure if I am allowed to put a chair in there, but I did.   I was coming home from the store earlier and I found my old CD's from back when I first started burning them from the internet. One of the songs "Ladies Night." Ya know, with Missy Elliot and the dead chick from TLC and Lil Kim. The line that cracks me up "I just met this motherfucker last night." That was the line Jennie and I refered to Jeremy since we boned on the first night we ever met. It's almost been a year!  HEY! HEY! Bryan White is on TV. So hot....   Mmmmmm...MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. I remember when he was going to have a concert in Great Falls and Kristy bought us center 3rd row seats for my birthday. HOW AWESOME IS THAT!!?! Every now and then they would joke with me and say "Oh! He canceled! HAHA! Just kidding!" AND THEN HE REALLY DID CANCEL THE CONCERT (scheduling conflict).   And I cried for two days.  All the people that work at Fred Myer's are total assholes. I have been to two sepereate stores today and not ANYBODY was helpful...more RUDE when I was trying to figure out how to use the self checker thing. Fucking stupid whore. She started yelling "TAKE THE BAG OF ICE OFF THE YELLOW PAD!" What yellow pad? I don't see a yellow pad!   I Love The 90's is on and it shows me that I really do Love The 90's.

      So, I went through my 15 minutes of "training" for my new weekend manager thing. It was basically:  -Reboot the dedicated servers if requested -Tell people to get to work -Check voicemail -Check these 10,000 email addresses, and be careful because the CFO is monitoring them  I wonder what she thinks of this whole thing, since she hated (or still hates) me. I guess Scott (supervisor Scott) was the one who recommended me because I can "lay the smack down" and "maybe something will actually get done on the weekends [with you there]." rrrarrr. Whatever. Still no response on a pay raise/when my days off are. If they boost me to $17-18 an hour, this might just be worth it. But I doubt that will happen. I'm also compiling a huge progress list for the CEO, I'm at home on lunch eating soy cheese on wheat bread with hummus. HUMMINAH. SO I'm not fucking off at work. Yeah, I know you assumed that.   This week has been weird. That's all I have to say about it to the general public. And I'm so poor, I'm returning the stuff I bought at Victoria's Secret this weekend so I can... you know, live for the next few weeks.   Tomorrow Rob is on the Daily Show!!!!!! I'm even making David come over and watch it with me.   PS - When you're making nachos, don't think you're buying sour cream, and then come home with  cottage cheese .

      This. This is the cutest thing I have ever seen a living creature do, and I finally captured it on camera.      BOOM-BOOMS IS CLEANING HER CUTESY FACE WITH HER WIDDLE PAWS!!!!   I have considered naming her Falafel, like I wanted to from the beginning (and Mike told me it was dumb). It's much more feminine, although I guess Falafel doesn't have a sex; it is a food, for Christ's sake. But "Boomer" is definitely masculine (since I thought she was a boy when I got her). Hmmm. Vote?   Oh God. SO cute. Why must bunnies be so cute?   PS-  urlLink You are a fucking cunt.   PPS - Scott is deciding to talk to me again, talking about how he hasn't been laid in 2 months. I told him to go OD on some ecstasy again and choke on a dick. I feel good. Damn good.   PPS - Rob, if you saved the NinjaStrike photo, you should post it in memory.  PPPS - It's like 1000 degrees and I just feel like some lemonade and afternoon lovemaking.

      I just read an email forwarded that is originally from the CEO that included the following (I am pissing myself with joy):   I want to share with you that I am impressed by the KB maintenance.  All of the new recently introduced features are well covered. The documents are thorough and relatively well written.       Relatively  got me all pissed off initially, but this is the only nice thing I have ever heard come from him; so I guess I can take this as a compliment of sorts. Plus, the grammatical errors in the following just make me think I should ignore that comment:   This is not just my opinion but the statistics are confirming it as well. The daily usage steady increases and is in the range of 450 to 500 unique users per business day. More than 60% of the customer ratings are positive (75 and more points) for the last month.   Please send kudos to Kristen and the other contributing authors for the persistence, prompt response to customer's inquiries as well as for the prompt coverage of the new technologies we introduce.    Awww yeah. That kicked so much ass, I can't possibly explain how much I needed that. I have felt like an ignored piece of useless shit at this job up until this moment.

      Now playing: Dabrye - This Is Where I Came In  PS: Torin. Wagon Christ. Wow. You are a fucking God, my man. I really wish I had something to turn you on to, but you just keep turning ME on (to music), and I'm selfish and don't want to reciprocate. Actually, I just have nothing. Jason did upload Hot Snakes, it is interesting, you may dig. Or anyone else who wants to...it's FTP'ed. PEED.   You must all see The Anchorman. It is over-promoted, and yes; it looks retarded. In fact, it is extremely retarded. But I laughed very, very hard and I think anyone who has the same taste in stupid movies as I do will highly approve of this "film." Plus, you'll wake up with that fucking sky rockets in flight song in your head, as David and I both did this morning.   I forgot my mother's birthday. Oh, and:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY SARA!!!   I saw the most spectacular  urlLink thing  at the mall this past weekend. If two giants can sit on the SuperSac and be so comfortable that afternoon lovemaking just seems to be absolutely appropriate, perhaps even "called for," I think it eventually  must  be a future purchase.   I really need a second job, but I don't want one. This really fucking sucks. I guess I just need something to get me somewhat afloat so I can start to have everything be manageable again. And I need to stop shopping. Rent here is also just fucking ridiculous, but I guess there is not a lot about that I can do right now. Chris is also so lenient, I guess that makes up for some of it. I'm a few weeks late even paying him. It's just time to get frugal or something.   Monster.com, here I come. (PS - If you have any resume writing tips, please  urlLink look at mine  and talk some shit. I really have never written a decent resume...I suck. I may be able to write, but somehow resumes never made my "FORTE FORTE FORTEEEE!" list. I really should have accents on resume and forte. But guess what? I don't give a ... thing.   urlLink anxious tension    urlLink please forgive me if i take you for granted   I think there is an exploding dog illustration for just about every emotion I have ever experienced. I heart that  urlLink site .

      Kerry-Edwards:  urlLink Sometimes, it's just meant to be.   Last night I met up with Sara, her girlfriend (Melissa) and a few other people I didn't know at Hamburger Mary's in Hilllcrest. Which is homosexual central, for those of you unfamiliar with San Diego. I was waiting in the parking lot for Sara, since all I had was a $20 and it was $10 for parking (christ). In that span of time, a bum managed to yell, "A skirt... I LOVE IT!" to me, and someone asked me if I sold weed. Do I look like I sell weed? Apparently, I might.   I ended up drinking too much, and not being much of a conversationalist; although Melissa really seemed to want to talk to me, since she had heard so much about me. Too bad I was fucktarded the entire night. Leanna came, she's adorable. She told me she would only come if I told her what I was wearing. Then she tried to sit as close to me as possible, so that "people might think we are together." The best part of the night is as follows:  Leanna: "Sara, how did you tell Melissa you loved her for the first time?": Sara: "I wrote it in the fog on the windshield one night." Me: "Awwww." Sara: "...while we were FUCKING!"  I believe Melissa was in the bathroom at that point, I don't think that would have gone over so well. There was also a lovely male couple sitting across from us who were having the most boring date I have ever had to watch. They were both just staring around the place. I don't think I heard them say a word to each other the entire time.   I also had to stop by Stan's to pick up an "herbal" purchase. I made him watch more Celebrity Jeopardy, and also probably managed to offend Ed multiple times, as always. I do love that I was there for what is quite possibly one of the best "Ed" moments of all time, Stan and I discussed this the other night.   Ed (who sounds like the dad on the King of the Hill, exactly): "Yeah, last night I gave my girlfriend 57 orgasms." Me: "Oh, really? How did you manage that?" Ed: "I dunno man, she just kept coming." Me: "Interesting. Ed, do you know where the clitoris is?"  Ed: "Yeah." Me: "Ed, where do girls pee from?" Ed: "Uh...The clitoris, right?" *everyone within a 5 mile radius bursts into laughter* Me: "How on earth would a girl pee from her clitoris?" Ed: "Well, they call it the little penis, and guys pee out of their penis and...fuck, I don't know...shut the fuck up, you guys" *Ed storms out of the room*  I also got laughed at in a big, big way last night driving home. I was semi-stoned, and listening to Outkast's "Prototype" on full blast, singing along on the top of my lungs and making hand gestures and everything. I didn't realize that the car full of 20-something males next to me was getting the show of their lives. Then I was thinking, "Hey, where is that laughter coming from?" looked over, and saw the band of brothers having a good chuckle. Oh my.

       weirder baby girl For some reason beyond my control, I haven't heard from you form in quite some time. It got a little warmer today, and much warmer tomorrow. Mom is at her moms now. I am glad the week is over. I only have to work 3 days next week. Mom to Lincoln at end of the week, so I will be by myself again. I still don't like going to those things. I will play with my wood or something.  Love dad   I just love the last sentence. My dad is going to play with his wood...when my mom is out of town....In the garage, mind you.  I feel like utter shit emotionally, mentally and physcially. Like, not good enough. Blech.  On the other hand, Rachel and I went to Cash & Carry. What do they have there? Bottles and bottles of Margarita mix in TONS of yummy flavors. They had peach. So I bought some. Rachel bought a box of 400 straws and gave them to me. We have a lot of straws. And 16 ounce cups. And Rachel also bought Mango Jet Tea. They were out of peach (I cried a little bit).   I wish I was in Seattle. I would give anything to be on the Space Needle at 4pm on a nice afternoon with the breeze blowing while Jeremy takes pictures of every angle there is up there.  Come play Wheel of Fourtune with me on MSN. I'll kick your ass.

      GinWomenBlues: Retards, or as I like to call them: God's Little Mushrooms, can do lots of things  Well, I feel a lot more confident about my playing skills now. I was much better in tune last night, both Chris and Jason agreed it sounded MUCH, much better and my structure of what I was playing made a lot more sense (but it's still not all there yet). And that was just with a little bit of practice; I can only get better from here, I guess. The microphone we were using was dying and was having problems, so this weekend we're probably going to make a pilgrimage to Guitar World and see what I can find as far as a nice little clip-on mic. Then Jason is going to come over and set up my computer with all of the right software, show me how to use it, etc and I can record from home. HOT. This whole thing will be a process, but I have enough inner confidence that we have similar enough tastes and creative ability to really make something pretty cool out of all of this. If not for anyone else's benefit, at least we will gain experience and like what we did. Plus, we all get along famously, it's really weird since that doesn't seem to happen to often with me and new people. We really need a bassist and a drummer, though. Fuck. This could be my opportunity to learn bass, but I am way to poor and out of time for anything like that.   Is it natural to be starving all of the time if the calorie counter burner thingie at the gym says I burn 1000 calories per session? I assume this much. That, or I am on my way to being a fatty.   I guess Sara's newish girlfriend told her to leave last night when she called her a "bleeding-heart liberal". Now that, my friends, is funny. We're going to get together for din-dins tonight and talk some politics, I guess she wants ammo for next time. Not that I could give her too much, but since I am at least able to stay in the same room as most liberals, maybe I can contribute something.   I actually find myself not really caring as much about a lot of the conservative ideals I held pretty strongly for a long time. I guess it is a matter of seeing the bigger picture and not focusing so much on petty details. I'm still not exactly sure where I stand on everything, I'm trying to be open-minded. Blah.

       My Interview on The Daily Show   by Robbie B.   (For those not wishing to read all this crap, I'll most likely be on The Daily Show next Thursday night.  Please check local listings for times and pizza coupons.)  Yeah, so I just got back from my interview with  urlLink Ed Helms  from The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  Naturally I thought to 'blog' about it because I 'hear' that's what you 'kids' are 'into' 'these' 'days.'  It was fun!  The subject of the piece is going to be about &#60;politicaltalk&#62; the "Free Speech Zone," a 1,300 square foot area built to house protesters in the hopes of giving all the expected 50,000 of them a place around the Fleet Center to exercise their first amendment rights.  Sure.  Here I thought all this time the Constitution granted inalienable rights and freedoms to citizens under any circumstance falling under the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness... I suppose I  may  have missed that clause where said rights can be lawfully enclosed within 20 foot metal fences. &#60;/politicaltalk&#62;  So Scott, another activist with The Bl(a)ck Tea Society I'm involved with, meet Ed and his assistant Kathy and some local freelance videographers in the middle of this paved section, sit right on the gravel, and get to the interview.  And I have to say if I and the other activist I was with don't end up looking like complete idiots AND communisits, it'll be a miracle.  But like I told most of you already, if The Daily Show wants to ridicule me in front of millions of people, I'm totally okay with that.  So Ed launches into the questions, some absolutely ridiculous, some mostly serious until he would interject something weird into our response.  I think I was responding to how some civil liberties were curtailed in lieu of Convention planning when he made little devil horns and was like "Anarchy!"  At which point you realize so many people interviewed for these segments on The Daily Show smile and nod when the correspondents do something completely bizarre.  I was thinking, "Do.. I laugh at that?  If I laugh then they'll splice that into some other part.  If I don't do anything, well, then they don't have to do any splicing and I look like an ass."  So you kinda stop and smile and go, "Heh.  Heh heh.  Um, yyyeah."  So it was about 20 minutes of pretty normal questions, a few funny parts, and even a few parts where Scott and I were able to give really clever answers.  Overall, I think Ed was kind of let down that we were stereotypical "SMASH THE STATE!" anarchists; I even wore my bestest suit.  So at the end of all that I'm thinking, "Not too bad.   Might even pull off looking not stupid on a Daily Show segment.  Wow."  Now, normally they would have two cameras going, one to record Scott and I while we answered the questions and another to record Ed while he asked them.  But they only had one.  So they had to setup the camera again behind us while Ed asked all of the questions again.  Which is both very strange and very hard to do.  It's strange because we don't have to answer them again.  So Ed is sitting here asking these same questions while we literally just sit there and stare at him.  It's very hard because he asks the questions again about 10 times each, and each time is a little different and a lot sillier.  At one point he sat there like,  "So, uh, guys, I don't know what you have against America, but lemme tell ya being in a free speech zone and all, I might have to exercise my right to kick your asses.  Now, guys, maybe you hate America but I don't, and I might have to exercise my right to kick your asses.  Guys, pfft, here in America we value free speech even if it comes in zone form, and if you can't respect that maybe you'll respect me exercising my right to kick some ass.  Your ass.  Right now.  Whoa, hey there, UNamericans.  Maybe you don't like exercising free speech in a free speech zone but that don't mean I can't enjoy exercising my right to... plaster you.. all over this.. zone.  Guys."  And you have to sit there and not laugh through that.  Which is extra super with pickles hard for me because I'm one of those people with the mental disorder that makes Oompa Loompa songs run through my head during moments when I shouldn't be laughing.  So not is a Daily Show correspondent, an assassin of comedy, rifling off questions while red midgets are singing to me.  Doopa dee doo.  We finished up with some random shots of Scott and I walking along, and then Scott, myself and Ed walking along as Resevoir Dogs style for filler and such, and that was that.  Overall though, wicked cool and I can't wait to see how absolutely horrible and stupid I look on the show. :)

      FINGER SUICIDE     Oh my God...       As Kristopher Schau and his band Cumshots were in the middle of their concert; a young couple entered the stage, stripped and had sex.  ...  The young couple, Tommy Hol Ellingsen, age 28, and Leona Johansson, age 21, are members of the environmental organization «Fuck for Forest.» They have sex in public in order to put focus on the rainforest.    urlLink See photos and video    Yeah, you did it all for the Rainforest. I must admit, I would be interested in learning more about this "Fuck for Forest" organization. Oh shit, they have a  urlLink website  and everything.   Well, looks like the boys and I are going to record tomorrow. I would have been great if I practiced or wrote anything since the last time we got together, right? Well, since i have been little miss social butterfly (which is not my style at all, when did this happen?) and haven't spent a night alone in God only knows how long, I just didn't get around to it. I'm going to have to blow off Sara + Dinner + The Labyrinth tonight. I am bummed. Well, maybe I can squeeze her in.   Morgan, you rock so hard for uploading that shitload of Sifl and Olly MP3s.   Torin put up some Mum, can't wait to hear that...I'm bringing over all of the Arab Strap I could manage to download for Chris (band Chris) tomorrow, that should make him giddy as a schoolgirl. Maybe this time we'll do more music than watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force, drinking and smoking. I swear - no smoking this time.   This week for work has been kicking ass, I am getting a ton done now that I have made an outline and a plan of attack for the massive amount of never ending work to be done. People are actually looking at me as an admin now, which is kind of exciting. I'm not longer that "new girl who took over the KB." I have a name, and I have a position. Wow.   Dave Sherburne, don't you dare bring me that Hello Kitty vibrator. I'll cut you, and I won't take you to the choo-choo plane. Actually, my secret plan when you come and visit this time is to kidnap you, and stuff you in the bunny cage. Oh, and is The Evil Guy From The Crow coming, or not? Tell him that The Pretty Ogre says "hi."

      My head.  Hungover would be a good word to describe me right now. Yes...that's the word.  Yesterday was pretty great overall, though. David and I went to the Padres game, they played Kansas City. He had a coworker that sat near us who was pretty funny, There were some pretty good plays, the Padres won, and we got on the JumboTron. You really can't beat that. Except for the fact I am fatally sunburned..which I will get over eventually.  Then we went back to my place, because apparently Adrian was having a big barbeque. This barbeque ended up being everything but big, plus the only people that came were Chris's mother (and Chris wasn't even there) and these 2 incredibly hick-like friends of Adrian's with their twin boys. The boys were adorable but I felt strangely bad for them. They seemed to be really curious, really like they had a lot going on upstairs for kids their age, but their seemingly incapable parents made me angry. Very angry. We're talking 100% trailer trash here. Which wasn't the problem, but when they guy started talking about how he beats his kids, I just started feeling really uncomfortable and I even challanged him about the reasons why he would hit them if they were in trouble for hitting someone else and he didn't seem to have an answer. I don't know. I just have enjoyed surrounding myself here with people who are un-hick, I guess it made me feel out of control of the situation or something and I just couldn't handle it all that well. So, I got incredibly smashed, and a little stoned. I pent David and myself in my room to escape hickland and we talked for what seemed to be a really long time, but who really knows since my sense of time seemed to be lacking. I do remember everything we were talking about seemed to be really fucking hilarious; however I don't remember falling asleep. Apparently I fell asleep in a stange pose that I seemed to hold for 2 hours. I had my hand mear my mouth/chin like I was deep in thought, my other hand was on my other arm which seemed to be pointing towards my watch like I was in an ad for the watch, and one of my boobs was apparently hanging out. He said it was "Sexy, yet sophisticated." Hahahahaha. I'm such a fucking dork.  Excuse me while I down a pot of coffee.

Ok, I would see Britney if I could feel her up. And I think watching Courtney Love would be semi-entertaining, in a train-wreck sort of way.  I also think it is time for my annual update of... *drumroll*   Who I would switch teams for      Not a classic beauty, but something about Sofia Coppola is just way too fucking hot.

      I actually think I started rambling to David last night about some of the stupid shit our little trio (Sara, Heather and myself) would do in our teeny-bopper years. I forgot Tony the Tiger, but just thinking about that brought up like 20 great stories. I'll need to make some chronicles of some of the shit we did.   I've decided that no matter what you are talking about, you can almost always make a reference to a Celebrity Jeopardy skit. For example: David and I were shopping yesterday, and he mentioned that Marlon Brando died. What was my reaction? Laughter. LAUGHTER. Because all I could think about was John Goodman, (as Marlon) stuffing his mouth full of  pistascios, talking about dogs that are trained to catch frisbees in their mouths in Tahiti. I would even go as far to say that if we're not talking about something serious (or possibly even when we are), a Celebrity Jeopardy reference comes up at least once every few hours. I thought it would get old, but so far it just keeps getting funnier. Do you think it will get old?     Nah.   I am also enjoying catching up with some of the Family Guy episodes, seeing as how I really haven't seen very many. Good shit, good times. Especially when taken along with a caucasian. I should explain what that is, but I won't. I'm just kidding...but not really.  Chris has 3 gigs of Sifl & Olly episodes, I will put a listing of what I have later and I should have enough space to put one up at a time. So, if you have any requests, let me know. This collection does include  The Pandas Are Coming .      urlLink  Chester: Some people say I'm like, you know,  bacon in the morning. Olly: What? Chester: I don't know, cracklin'.   I guess I am late to catch on, but Röyksopp's  Melody AM  grooves my world.   Sara, you'd appreciate this: As I was riding to work today, there were several orange cones knocked all over the place on the side of the freeway. I suddenly had flashbacks of "radio show John" (which I will refer to him as since I can't spell his last name). "THEY WERE CONES!!!" I'm sorry, but that man was quite possibly the most of a laff riot (as Torin would say) I have ever had the pleasure of talking to. I would have tried to hook up with him if it weren't for the whole statutory rape thing.   Which also reminds me of one of the best things I have ever heard as of lately:  David was telling me how his dad's friend said, "Saying a girl is too young is like saying that it's too nice of a day outside."  Other quotables:   Rob: "Does David have a Goliath?"  Dave: "I keep MY vibrator under my copy of Little Women. And it is giant."  Steve: "Hey Nick, when's the last time you shit your pants? I guess I was around 10 or so...bad mexican food."

      ... and not the Madonna video, either.  Whenever we played Truth or Dare as kids, it was just "Truth" because nobody wanted to pick dares like "eat dog food. lick this old sock," etc. And it was usually a multiple-choice question.  So here, for old times sake, this would have been a typical question:    Whose babies would you most like to have?   a. Adam West of Batman b. Mark May (a weatherman from Great Falls who was rather Santa-like.) c. [insert neighborhood kid here]'s Dad d. Tony Danza  or......... E. Tony the Tiger.

      Ok, so the same 2 sales guys keep hitting on me... when they invited me out for the 4th, I made sure to mention this time that I HAVE PLANS with MY BOYFRIEND. Now go away. Shoo, now. GO AWAY.   Oh, and I messaged this guy who got fired recently from my job to say hi and I felt bad he was let go, turns out I found him on MySpace through a mutal friend. He sent me this:   A+ was killing me on the installment plan. Don't stay there too long.   Anyway, the cycles of death and rebirth, stability and chaos, ignorance and enlightenment, they keep on doing their dance. I just try to keep dancing along.   I wish I had known you were a stoner! I also wish that you weren't "in a relationship" so I could shamelessly hit on you, seeing as you're not a coworker anymore. Ahh well, wish in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills up first ;-)   Thanks for addin' me. See ya!.      Ha. LIKE YOU DIDN'T SHAMELESSLY HIT ON ME WHEN I WAS YOUR CO-WORKER! I swear to God, I was there for 2 minutes on my first day and he came strolling on over, making chit chat. Taylor told me to ignore him, or get used to it. I can at least count on Taylor to break it down for me, right away.   PS- I'm not a stoner.

      This new Janet Jackson is terrible. At the radio at the movies last night said it would "have us out of our seats and dancing in the asiles!" Nobody danced. Nobody even sang along.  Last night Jer & I went to Faherheit 9/11 (I'm sure I didn't spell that right). It  really  made me wonder  how and the fuck  this guy is a president of ANY country. It's really sad how many people really don't like him. Isn't he supposed to be somwbody we admire, look up to in times of need? They showed one mom who's son died in the war (I have to admit she was a bit melodramatic about it OR her son had just died extremely recently) and a lady called her a bitch for not liking Bush and told her to blame it on the other guy. Well yea, it is their fault (being that their fire shot down the helicopter he was in) but who was the guy that called them to war that really shouldn't be happening? Put his two slut daughters over there and kill them and see how he feels.   ANYWAY, on a lesser note they should be bringing us a new dishwasher today. The apartment complex called and then when I awnsered they hung out. Hmmm. So we'll see.

      Kristen,  urlLink This  reminded me of your tech-girlness.   I used to have the picture saved of you groping the cardboard Angelina, but now I can't find it... I must be the only person who doesn't have a photo w/ her, which is weird.

      So, this needs less reverb and definitely a re-record when I am not high and actually in tune, but here's  urlLink France  featuring Kristen-who-hasn't-played-in-years-isn't-it-obvious. Also on the little key change parts, I found that I really didn't know what to do with myself and it is pretty apparent. There's some stronger moments, and I guess it is something for a first run. I also think the drum track needs turned down. Or less symbols, or something. Basically, this song needs a root canal.  Also, The Postal Service's "Nothing Better" is possibly the cheesiest song of ALL TIME. Right up there with George Michael's "Careless Whisper."  I made out to Jeff Buckley last night, and you didn't.  And you don't even want to KNOW what happened when Neutral Milk Hotel came on.  I'm working on a pole dancing mix. I will post it later.

         I would have never thought of doing that.   Rob and I are both making mix cd's.   GinWomenBlues: Yeah, I think my tape is getting more like 'Twilight years slow dance on the patio' while your's is more "I did not come all the way to Ibiza to NOT have sex on the beach.  Now lose those pants, buster." GinWomenBlues: Obviously we'll have to combine them and release a two disc compiliation PetYourWolverine: yes PetYourWolverine: Mine can be called The Love Below PetYourWolverine: or Speakerfuxx GinWomenBlues: Mine can be called "Please Forgive Me for Forgetting our Anniversary Three Years in a Row" GinWomenBlues: oh oh oh GinWomenBlues: Temple of the Dog - All Night Thing PetYourWolverine: temple of the dog reminds me of mike GinWomenBlues: ah nevermind GinWomenBlues: A shame to lose songs that way.  I should listen to nothing but the Eagles and Jefferson Starship while I'm seeing someone PetYourWolverine: hahahahahahahahaha GinWomenBlues: Of course, that would probably make for shorter relationships :-) PetYourWolverine: undoubtably GinWomenBlues: "Jefferson Star--UH.  I think I left something in my car, Rob."  "Sure, baby."  "Yyyeah.  Be right back."  *screech* *vroom*

      Here's the story:  -Mike (ex-boyfriend) used to work for a company named Printable.  -My friend Justin got a job at Printable in October.  -Mike was of course fired from this company in the summer of 2003 (and I then started paying for everything for a period of 3 months, but that's not the point.)  -Joe, Mike's boss, fired Mike and no reason was given in particular, he just didn't get along with him. -Justin told me the position that Mike had is going to be open shortly because a woman is leaving that I actually met before. -Justin sent me the qualifications and the only ones I don't meet are having a degree, the other one I do not meet (SQL) is on a "desired skills" list.  -Apparently hardly anyone has a degree there and he doesn't know why the requirement is on there. -Joe read my resume and wants me to interview on Monday. -Apparently Joe remembers who I am, his commentary only included "Kristen seemed way out of Mike's league."  That's mean!   Anyway.   If I can land this job, this would pretty much be the end of my money worries and if I do get it, I will be so fucking thrilled I will probably be screaming and jumping and dancing for a period of multiple hours. (Mike made $50,000/yr in the position I am applying for.)  However, my expectations are low. I don't expect to get it, but I do interview well and I think I have a decent shot. But, my attitude towards it is "meh." If I get it, that's fucking fabulous. If not? Oh well, I tried. I do know that the work there sounds fun, interesting and something I could really enjoy. I also had a huge fight with my mom about the helping with the school "not helping/oh sure we'll help/wait nevermind" thing, and we FINALLY came to the conclusion that they WILL help me pay for the 7 credits I am now registered for and with books. This means I can drive with car insurance! Fabuloso. So, it all worked out and I am incredibly, incredibly thankful they decided to do it, and I just pray to whatever God that may be out there that they don't change their minds again.   My legs are dying. I discovered that running outdoors is much different than running on a treadmill. David and I jogged about 4 miles at Miramar Lake. I was a slowpoke, too. I think I'm going to start alternating going there and the gym so I can be a little less bored, and also so I can actually jog more than 1/2 a mile without stopping to walk because I have a cramp...eventually.  I probably made the best dinner I have made since I started cooking again, too. Asparagus-Potato Soup and  urlLink Spinach and Mushroom Lasagna Roll-ups with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce . It really rocked, if I do say so myself.   Stan is trying to get me to buy a Playstation 2 so I can join the SOCOM gang he and a bunch of our friends have going. I'm sorry, but that's just way too nerdy for me. Actually, I am sure I'd love it - and that's what I am afraid of. I'd end up wasting 4 hours a night talking to Stan in my headset and shooting people.   One thing I realized is that I must detoxify myself from the MJ if I am going to be going for this job. A week of drinking lots of water and sweating it all out is in order, amongst other tricks that might actually work.   LOOK AT MY CUTESY BUNNEH! SHE'S SUCH A WIDDLE FATTY!      I'm a fat bunny!     I eat my ear!     ROAR!

      They just increased the price per credit to $26 (from $18) which means I can't afford to pay for my books with that much extra tuition which means I had to drop 2 classes. By the way, the price per credit has tripled in the 2 years I have lived here.   You know what? I heard from a lot of people that paying my own way at this age would "build character." That's the biggest crock of shit I have ever heard in my life. Has it helped me build my own maturity and experiences? Sure. But it hasn't built any "character," unless you want to call me being crotchety, breaking out in stress rashes, being completely jaded and bitter as "character."   I guess I need to just chill out and have realistic expectations of myself. I knew that the way I had my schedule would prevent me from finding a new job, because who will give me mondays and wednesdays off? That's an odd request. So I have classes at night Mon-Wed. Mike is helping me with the job thing, apparently he just landed one for 60k/yr and has had a lot of contacts in his search process, so maybe he can help me find something nice and cushy. Monday-Friday, like 6-3 like I have now? maybe a few more bucks an hour? Then I'd be set.

      So, I went to Chris's to practice, and we actually came up with a lot of good potential parts for songs, but the parts don't go together (no matter how hard we tried to make them just do it) so I guess we have a string for multiple songs. We also ended up fucking around, but the work/social ratio was much lower this time, we got more done I believe.   I can't forget these topics brought up:  -Moth heads -Cockroach Concentration Camps -Robert Smith is an Art Fag -Black Bush   Before that, I watched most of the Butterfly Effect. Now, I hate Ashton Kutcher..but the premise of this movie looked interesting, so I rented it. Hmmm. Probably not a good idea. Don't get me wrong, so far it is really interesting and actually quite good but there's subject matter that is mind fucking and it's just a lot of shit I avoid thinking about. So yeah, Butterfly Effect = Maybe you might want to check it out. I don't know. Not as bad as I thought it may be, as far as quality goes.   After practice Rick and Misha invited me to hang and play Scrabble and smoke. So, I got really lost but made it over there finally.  Indeed, we smoked and watched Aqua Teen Hunger Force and just hung out and talked. No scrabble, that was way too coherent of a thing to be done at that point. The quote of thr night when Misha said "Hey....now, these teddy grahams are chocolate flavored wheat. Now, why don't they make wheat flavored chocolate? That's not very fair." He also had epiphanies of who I was and realized he had read my Blog years ago because of knowing April, etc. Anyway, they were great fun to hang out with, many props to April for knowing good people. Now we just need to fly YOU out here.   File> Import> Winners  I need to go to bed. Tomorrow holds shopping, cooking, running and somethinging.

      I forgot - I was on a 40 minute phone call with a man who was a clown at work today. He spent the entire call explaining the life of a true clown; talked about some sort of college reunion, went on and on about San Diego, etc while I was setting up his domain. His name was Garth. Garth, the clown.  He also has this up on the front page of his site:     Klownin' with Whoopie.  Wow.  I thought this was too classic not to share.

      I'm feeling the love today, my friend  urlLink Brian  sent me this:     This reminded me of you. Nothing shady about it, nothing to be alarmed about. Just a bittersweet passage I thought I'd share:   "Like so many sacred stray dogs and cats, people come in and go out of your life, and the ones that are the farthest away sometimes seem to be the closest to your heart."   That made me think of you. Which I might add is not admission of love or lust or anything of the like; just that, I gather from the almost sub-conscious reflection, you are a welcome part of my life and I very much enjoy our friendship.   Alright, well this email is getting all gayed up, so continuing, it also goes on to say:   "Your home is your castle until one day, quite inexplicably, it becomes your prison.  One day you see a girl who reminds you of another girl who reminds you why you're still alone."   I just thought it was a powerful bit of writing, especially coming from a dry-humored nutjob author like Kinky Friedman.  Makes me realize that he could move the world if he was serious for more than a single out of context excerpt from a single paragraph on a single page - if he wanted to be, that is.   hahahah. Awwww. I love men's emotional interpretations. "This reminded me of you, BUT I AM NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU, PLEASE DON'T THINK I AM A PSYCHO I AM JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING NICE. PS - I'm not gay." Yes, I know. And I appreciate it. I think I often times don't tell my close friends how much they really mean to me. While it may not be very important or even necessary, it is always great to hear.

      So, last night I go to the gym. I leave my light on in my car, but catch it within 30 minutes when I am gazing out the window. When I am finally done, I get in and it won't start. Grrreaaat. So I figure the battery is just drained and I spend another 30 minutes working out, because this has happened before and if it sits it is usually just fine after a while. I get in again. Nope. It was also making the weird CLICKCLICKCLICK sound from the problem that was supposed to be fixed by when my starter was replaced, then when my battery was replaced and then when my alternator was replaced (grand total: $1,100) but the PROBLEM IS OBVIOUSLY STILL FUCKING THERE. I could have BOUGHT A NEW FUCKING CAR with the money I spent in repairs if a bunch of STUPID ASSFUCKS didn't keep misdiagnosing the problem!   Here's the plan:   - Get the ugly half-assed temporary dent fixing thing sanded and painted - Get it detailed - Sell that fucking piece of shit  Yeeeah. Then I'll get my MINI COOPER.   Bitches.  Oh, if I jiggle the steering compartment up and down, it will start now. Lovely.   I really can't handle my car dying on me right now. I can't have that happen. No. NO. Can't happen.   I talked to April's friend Rick for like an hour last night; seems like a really down-to-earth, smart guy. He also loves the MJ! We're going to try to hang out soon. I need to replace lame friends with cool friends. Mmmhmmm. He did ask me how we met, April. I think I avoided those unnecessary details...you know like, it was a Dashboard Confessional Message Board. I got to hear cool stories about teaching inner-city high schoolers in Chicago, including one about a kid who called him a "faggot." He heard him, asked him to say what he said again so he could hear him in front of the class (thinking he wouldn't because he didn't want to get in trouble), and so the kid screamed, "I SAID, YOU'RE A FUCKING FAGGOT!" Hahahaha. He said "Yeah, I had to give him props for that. He was reprimanded, too...but, I did give him props for that."   I felt like renting a romantic comedy last night, so I got Along Came Polly. It was actually pretty fucking funny, especially when Ben Stiller knocks down a giant 20 foot sculpture of a lady's leg with a rabbit head on top at an art gallery. I literally laughed for 5 minutes.   No one has come to visit me from back home. I'm starting to get GRRR-ANGRY. I would really love to see my sister (Jaren) again, even though she's a ho. I love her, no matter how ho'ed out she is.

      Yea, work has been putting me in a nasty mood. I had to open Espresso today. 6am-2pm. That's bad enough but there is  nothing to do  for 6.5 hours of the shift. You brew coffee. You wait on customers. When the pots run out, you make more. And now we have THE RED LIGHT SPECIAL (aka: Happy Hour) from 10-11 and then from 4-5. I hear RED LIGHT SPECIAL and then I think about the TLC song about doing the nasty. I just call it Happy Hour. Well that's fine but my boss wants me to get on the intercom EVERY 5 MINUTES OF THE ENTIRE HOUR and annouce it. So I have to say lame things like  "ATTENTION TIDYMAN CUSTOMERS! HERE IN THE ESPRESSO BAR WE KNOW IT'S HOT OUTSIDE AND WE HAVE SOME THINGS THAT CAN COOL YOU DOWN!"  Blah, blah, blah. I would love to say  "ATTENTION TIDYMAN BI-OTCHES. GO HOME. WE DO NOT WANT YOU OR YOUR FAT ASS CHILDREN SHOPLIFTING FROM HERE. THANK YOU AND PLEASE DO NOT RETURN TO THIS STORE."   I really want a new job. Mary (boss) pisses me off. Nuff said. I have to get on the INTERCOM of all things! NOT THE INTERCOM!  I really need a vacation and I think knowing that you're going to get one just makes it worse. I just wanted to stab people today.  Well, Seattle tomorrow. Next week!? MONTANA! HOORAY!  AND MORE IMPORTANTLY: The Spokane Chief's 2004/2005 Schedule comes out on Thursday. I am sure I am the only one that cares.  HOCKEY! HOCKEY! HOCKEY!  So I had the radio on the other night and a rap song from last summer comes on. I remembered some of the words...I think it was "Shake Your Tailfeathers." I flipped it to country and it was a Diamond Rio song from WAY BACK IN THE DAY. We're talking like, 1991. Something like that. AND I KNEW EVERY SINGLE WORD. "Norma Jean Riley" is the name of it. The second I heard it I was back in Kristy's old bedroom in the dark just lying around listening to her radio and trying to name the song and artist before she could. Speaking of "going back" I went to Wal*Mart today and in the perfume aisle they had a sample of Sunflowers and I was INSTANTLY back in Sara's bedroom in Great Falls. Funny how stuff can do that to you.  Anyway, I was being pretty last week and took a self photo.   urlLink 071704 001.jpg   It's my user pic on my MSN Messenger. Sara noticed that I am giving the finger. I didn't even know I was. Excellent!  I was having a shitty night last night so Jeremy played a very old Seaseme Street tape. It's of Big Bird singing something like "There's only one you! Oh look around it's true!" Lmao. :)  Now Playing: Nsync "It Makes Me Ill" OLD SCHOOL BABY!

      This was one part of  urlLink a song that I found to be hilarious  when watching Midwest Product last night, which was actually the best performing group of what I was actually able to catch of last night's show. It also reminded me of Dave Sherburne joke that only we seem to laugh at, which is "Hottie at the bank HOTTIE AT THE BANK!" The origin of this was related to some story about how I loved going to the bank (I was what...16? 17?) because there was a "hottie" that worked there, and he was hot because he looked like Trevor Goodchild which is a fucking ANIMATED character from Aeon Flux.  I will never stop being weird.   Also, I remember now that I really loved Aeon Flux. I should hunt down any torrents that might be out there and snag some episodes. The animation was so bizarre, sexual, stark, freakin' beautiful. And the plots were always all kinds of fucked up, but I remember really getting into it.      SPEAKING OF AEON FLUX...Charlize Theron is to star in the movie based on the series coming out in 2005. I read about it just now, and I read some people argue over how Laura Flynn Boyle should have been chosen. HA!   They have a point.

      I sent am email to my boss telling him I effectively resign from my "weekend supervisor" "promotion."  These fucking Bulgarian techs are so fucking rude, so fucking stupid, and so disrepectful, it blows my mind every single day.   Kristen: well if outlook isn't blocking it in mail rules Kristen: that's a problem with outlook Kristen: not us Wendy: kristen listen to me....she have blocked the e-mail from our WEB mail too Wendy: it is our problem Kristen: well, then send a ticket to the postmaster. I don't know what you want me to say to you if you won't take my answer.   "Listen to me?" Yes, I did listen to you, and you're fucking wrong like I said before. If the customer really did block it in webmail, it wouldn't come through. And if they know what they were doing and blocked it in Outlook, it really would never ever come through, it would be impossible. I know what the fuck I am doing. And of course, the postmaster is going to get pissed and ask her why she is sending shit to him and he will tell her the same thing I just told her.  Why don't you do what YOU want to do and stop asking me? That's all any of you do anyway!   I also was told at least 3 times this weekend that I "had" to take a call when I was either busy or I know the tech could handle it without escalating it. No, I don't have to do anything. YOU listen to ME. It is not YOUR job to tell me what I have to do, it is my job to tell YOU what YOU have to do.   I basically said I have no incentive to do this, I was hired for the KB at a starting wage and I request to continue to work on the KB at a starting wage. I have no interest in getting crapped on (my exact phrasing) by technicians in another country when there is nothing I can do about it over AIM, in having one of the most undesirable schedules possible, in not having enough time to do what I am responsible to do in the first place, in being yelled at by customers, etc without some sort of incentive. I will not be placed in the same position that I have been placed in at virtually every company I have ever worked for. I will do what I am supposed to do for what you pay me. I will not do any more unless you pay me more. I am happy doing what I am worth, and I'm sure some other fresh young face will be willing to take a beating...but I am not.   Pass.  I'll probably get fired and be completely fucked, but you know what? I don't give a rat's ass. I'm done.

      Last night was actually pretty fun. I came home from work, worked out way too hard, crashed in my sweat-soaked state for about 3 hours and then got ready to go out to the Whistle Stop becasuse it was Lora's sister's birthday and they were rounding up people to go. So, Shanna and Justin and I ended up talking for most of the night, it just kind of happened that way but it was a lot of fun. Justin and Shanna discovered they were both from Santee, so they had many Santee stories to share...and those are always hilarious. And of course, everyone there was on MySpace. That place is an epidemic. Hey, I have no problems with it...I've met several great people from that little life-sucking site. More than even my history with MakeOutClub (don't make me go there).   Today is:  -Work -Gym -Christian's going away party (noooooo!) -Dabrye/Twine @ the Casbah  Wooooooooo.  I am thinking of just going to PJ Harvey by myself. I can't think of anyone who really cares even remotely as much as I do about seeing her, and fuck the money, I need to see Polly Jean.
