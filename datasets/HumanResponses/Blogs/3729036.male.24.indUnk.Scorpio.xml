      I feel like new born coming into the world for the first time.  The only difference is that I'm a lot bigger then a newborn, and I'm not crying.  At least not yet.  This is my first blog, and I'm not really sure what to write.  I've read my friends entries, and they always seem witty, and interesting.  I have this feeling that mine will be bland, and drawn out.  I've been told that your supposed to write about your days, and interesting things that happen to you.  Let's try that out first.  I'm pretty sure you've heard of the phrase, "I partied like a Rock Star last night!!!"  I was saying that last night, in between bites of my 7-11 sandwich, once I got home from the late night of drinking.  This morning I woke up feeling like crap, and noticed that part of my sandwich was still in my hand.  I started thinking, and realized I don't think the "Partied like a Rock Star" phrase really fits anyone else, but Rock Stars.  I mean think about it.  I didn't get into the top club for free.  I wasn't sat in the private VIP section where the groupies just line up behind the rope, just hoping I'll make them the star of my next video.  I wasn't showered with drinks or gifts.  I wasn't treated like a Rock Star at all.  I think the reason why you say that is, because when you wake up the next morning you feel like an old out of work Rock Star.  Your head hurts, your body is shaky, your ears are still ringing from the loud music, and you have no money.  So I guess in a way I don't want to "Party like a  Rock Star" anymore...  But it's so much fun the night before while your out there isn't it...=)  I was in rare form last night.  I drank like it was going out of style.  Normally that wouldn't be a big deal, except for when the alarm went off this morning at 7:30 only hours after I went to bed.  That was when reality kicked in, and knew I had to go to work.  No sleeping in, no sitting around in my boxers trying to recall just what the heck I was thinking taking that last shot of Tequilla, and then screaming like banshee.  It was time to get back in the grind.  I can't do it anymore.  I used to be able to drink all night, and actually function normally the entire next day.  I would even go out the next night.  I hate to say this, but I'm getting old.  All I can think about is sleeping when I get off work.  Oh well, I guess that's what I get.  No use crying over spilt Bud Light.  I went to the Ranger game last night with some of my friends, and some co-workers.  It was a lot of fun...well at least the inning and a half I actually watched.  I love baseball, but I just don't have the attention span to sit in the compact chair and watch.  Warped Tour is this Saturday...That is one blog I'll be interested to read myself the day after.  I can't wait.  I went last year, but only got to stay for a little bit, because the girl that went with us almost blacked out.  I mean come on, how inconsiderate can she be.  I wanted to stay, the sun wasn't bothering me.  Just joking, I was pretty hot myself, and I was worried about her.  It was just a bummer to have to leave early.  Not this year though.  My friend Derek and I are going to stay for the entire thing.  I'm bringing plenty of cash and smokes.  You can never carry enough smokes.  I hope to see you there.  I think I've rambled on long enough.  I feel like I'm supposed to be writing this for entertainment purposes for other people.  I think I may have failed this time on that level, but I really enjoyed writing this out.  It is kind of relaxing.  It is also kind of scary to see what I've done written down and documented.  For those of you that read this, thank you for sharing these few mintues with me.  For those of you not reading this.......  I wanted to give a shout out to my buddy Natterbug...you rock thanks for getting me to do this.  I also wanted to shout out to CrookedToes...thanks for entertaining me when you didn't even realize it.  I'm out like a fat kid in Dodgeball......
