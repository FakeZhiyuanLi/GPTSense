      I was having a conversation about politics while in Sweden over the weekend when the topic of citizens salaries came up. I was asked whether this was taken seriously as an issue over in the UK. Not at all, I answered. No, its not considered plausible over here at the moment either, she expanded. I explained that I meant it is not considered plausible, it is not considered, has not entered the zeitgeist in any real way. Citizens salaries are as foreign as  sil  and  saltlakrits .   This is one strand I want to explore over the next couple of months – I certainly don’t have the credentials to claim any authority in matters of macro-economy, but I have some enthusiasm for the topic and I’d like to push the boat out a little bit in terms of what is generally brought to this debate (right wing: large welfare state is intrinsically bad, with reduced independence and freedom; left wing: tendency to drift towards utopianism and rejection of local optima - ‘good enough’ solutions).   Today I just want to link to a beautiful post from a site I’ve never read before, but it hits on one of the key issues more eloquently than I ever could. It touches on themes long noted in the human decision-making literature, about the discrepancy in economic measures of utility and choices about how much things are worth to real people. The clearest example is that the value functions that you can plot to describe the reward got for a reward in resources are not straight but curved -  the subjective worth of a resource tails off as the amount becomes greater.  More than this, it deals with the battle between two American Dreams, both of which can plausibly be described as Global Dreams on this 21st C ball of mud. Better still, it’s not much longer than this plaudit here.  urlLink Go check it out.

      I've bounced through various sites on the blo-gotohell-sphere for a while now; blogs have replaced Usenet and message-boarding as my preferred mode of venting and inescapable time drain. I'm going to push content of my preferred kind, try and bash this into something of my liking, cut it down to a size that fits me. So far, no comments facilities, and the same tired design, but as I see it style should follow content, while comments utterly depend on it. Hopefully the embryonic beginnings of some essays should pop up in the next week or two, supplemented by links to the hot-shots who could do this in their sleep, and occasional links to those who appear to actually be doing so.

      Just put up a link to a pretty average poster I did on ageing and temporal memory.   'Pretty colours, but damned if I can zoom in and read the text!'  That's ok with me; there's no real butter on that bread.   By the way, if anyone is surprised that I've changed my speciality, well, tell me about it.  Pediatric Gastroenterology?

      This post will continue and give some temporary closure to the topic I opened up a few posts earlier. Due to a trip 9 time zones away I have been shamefully derelict in my posting here - in part because this behemoth was half done and giving me hell for too long. As anovice, I'm learning that ambitious posts shouldn't be left hanging until you know you can follow up. Learning....  To recap: Resisting specialization is to pit yourself against an inevitability, ingrained in the world as deeply as money.  Aiding and abetting this unwelcome proposition is a deeper one: perhaps specialization is intrinsic to how we are able to cope with the world.  ‘There are too many ideas and things and people, too many directions to go. I was starting to believe the reason it matters to care passionately about something is that it whittle the world down to a more manageable size’ Suzan Orlean from ‘The Orchid Thief’, from ‘Adaptation’.  These "sweet,sad insights" that Kaufman finds so compelling are a little awkward. They could imply I've been painting myself into an unenviable position - fight culture  and  human nature – and you can’t be loving those odds.   I’m still taking the odds, and here’s why.   I think on one front we’re being misled. We think that to go places in life it’s vital to be at the top of whatever you do, and doing so requires unswerving dedication. The trouble is that often what counts as an acceptable life goal is driven by what is pumped over our horizons, into our living rooms, and may have rather less to do with what would make us happy, if we were to take stock a little.  On the other front, we have the more intimate sentiment of Orleans statement. I think this is, to an extent, driven by cultural motivations of the sort I’d like to unpack and pull apart (Front A). The idea that if you take more than one road you won’t get far enough along any of them; a sense that destinations matter whilst journeys do not.   But it goes further than this, to the concept of imbuing life with your own essence by choosing a prism through which to view it, a perspective to make sense of the world of, a personal culture within which to value things rather than a multicultural position in which everything is equally well and good and so more or less meaningless. I confess to feeling a strong identity with this, whether it be romantic self-delusion or no. I am sure for myself that the world is so extraordinarily complicated that it is essential to ‘make yourself a world’ in some sense, fashion an umwelt as some kind of starting point for inquiry (which includes re-examination of the central premises when appropriate).  However, I don’t feel that such a personal culture need be so narrow to propel someone into the study of only one thing, or the pursuit of only one kind of excellence (or, closer to my point, content with the pursuit of several competencies). For me it could and should be an outlook, but an outlook that is nonetheless broad. If it is a monoculture it should be wide and reflective.  This needs ending here, for now – I’m going to return to this from time to time to try and flesh things piece by piece. I guess the sign-off point to make is why this position isn’t superficial and obvious. Surely, one might ask, being great at many things is obviously better than being great at one thing? If you can study two things and excel then this outperforms studying one; a trivial point. But I would argue that this, which is pretty much the standing definition of polymathy, is a wonderful ideal to keep in mind. But in the real world we should be equally happy to consider ourselves as adequate, and improving, in a number of areas, even if the girl from your year at a school is top-dog because she’s been pursuing one from day one. I’m not a polymath, but maybe I’ll get there. If not, no regrets: how can you regret casting wide as well as deep?

      This is the first part of a (probably) 2-post essay on life, whether it happens to you while you're busy making other plans and if so whether your plans should have outlined contingencies dealing with that eventuality, perhaps using some kind of worm-hole embedded in the cover-sheet.  I went to a very driven school, and at an early age it drilled into us that distinction could and should be ours. Pragmatic and results orientated, their advice was more “reach for the cash” than “reach for the stars”, with the expectations that we should firstly excel in our exam results, then translate that into real capital, status and regard. This unswerving emphasis was tempered by my family; my mum firmly believed that money did not buy you happiness, and that success in whatever domain made us happy was the right kind of success. Once you found your  urlLink special purpose  you were set.  Despite this rosier formulation (and I thank god I had the mother I did) I spent a large part of my school life, and beyond, filled with misgivings about my future. The thing was, I couldn’t find a special purpose. I didn’t have one thing I was good at, or one thing I loved. There was no use in waiting for one to reveal itself either: my problem was not a dearth of options but an excess leaving me with a paradox of choice.   I want to be clear here. I am not saying I was great at everything. Clearly untrue – at school I sucked at languages (embarrassing when you are mixed race from an obstensibly bilingual background), found visual art totally beyond me and was generally clumsy. I’m also not suggesting that the things I was good at I was great at. My ‘problem’ was being pretty good at a number of things, enjoying them all in various ways, without a particular calling to invest myself in one at the expense of the others. This was a pragmatic and a principled aversion. On the one hand, I  couldn’t face doing maths for three continual years and then throw the rest of my life into it. On the other, I didn’t see why anyone should have to do so. Why is it such a good thing to specialize, I wondered- why throw away the nuanced perpective afforded by a wider background?  I call it a problem, and problem it is, in many senses. We all know that from school onwards we need to be showing visible and directional progress if we have a hope of doing anything in our lives. I remember being warned before starting my PhD that if I was not to continue in academia, possessing it would actually be a hindrance as it suggests a lack of direction. Doing something productive isn’t good enough – it needs to be the exact right thing.  I think you can see a sense of this in the  urlLink 1/4 life crisis  that’s being documented over the last 3-4 years; while some of this is down to free-riding and a lot more to the unattractive shape of the job market (telemarketing or charity street team representing ‘opportunity’ in the 21st C), I’m certain that people who like me are without a calling find themselves firmly on the pointy bits of a dilemma of choice. And stay there.

      This summer will see the launch of a  urlLink new kind of Coke , which should shake people out of their daily stupor with its radical notion of a soft drink with less calories. Yes, less calories. Who would have thunk it?  To be fair, it is selling itself as having "that great Coca-Cola taste"; that would firmly distinguish it from Diet Coke then. But I'll leave final arbitration to my brother, kingpin of the coke-drinking world. If he'll switch then they're on to a winner.

      The guardians  urlLink Bad Science  section is a real joy, one I've got to check more regularly. The  urlLink current  story focuses on perennial favourite Kevin Warwick, the Derren Brown of Artifical Intelligence research. Only Warwick doesn't follow his pronouncements of the preposterous with a half-hearted stab at demonstrating them. Technology is the future so in the future we will all be technology. QED. So read, but make sure to shield your monitor from involuntary snort damage.

      Via Crooked Timber, this   urlLink story  of the treatment of the Japanese hostages from Iraq on their return home is uncomfortable and for me a little bewildering. I visited Japan last month, expecting to encounter a rigid, stratified social structure, but finding people accessible, friendly, and warm. I made a number of friends, found myself discussing partners and home life with a senior Professor, was taken to visit a friends' well-to-do mother in law and was treated far more inclusively than I expected. The social mores were certainly distinct from the west, and etiquette (including a fair amount of deference)  was fairly pronounced, but the structure seemed to be as much focused on communal endeavour over individualism, as it was on hierarchy. Thinking on it it's not so surprising that the public reaction was so disapproving.  The criticisms are telling:   "Yasuo Fukuda, the Japanese government's spokesman offered this about the captives' ordeal: "They may have gone on their own but they must consider how many people they caused trouble to because of their action."   Effectively, they have done wrong because they embarked on a project which is not Japanese: they have pursued individualistic goals (admittedly these goals are concerned with helping others, but being active in Iraq would likely appear random and capricious to the public at home) which have now caused problems for Japan, as well as shaming it. My impression is that in Japan concepts of shame and honour are not purely elements of bradaggio and cred (though I'm sure that for many, from salaryman to yakuza footsoldier, this so; the world turns on its similarities as well as differences) but are deeply involved with the notion of community. If so, this would explain some of the level of vitriol - regardless of the public's position on Iraq, regardless of opinions of whether their actions within Iraq were positive or negative. It's not Rachel Corrie-style 'traitor' hatred, or anger that their presence or capture endorsed the war.  Simply, it is that very visibly, these people endangered themselves and compromised Japan for distinctively non-Japanese, self-centred goals, and this is shaming.   Weird. I totally disagree with this, but understanding it prevents me feeling angry. I'm just sorry for the former hostages: what a thing to come back to.

      A very dear student took it upon herself to gather information, statements and materials to support a nomination for our faculty teaching award. For me. In a sense the attempt was futile: the award is intended for those staff members who have contributed ten or more years of teaching, whilst I've only been doing my duties for two and a half years; moreover, I'm a graduate student who runs tutorials and an experiment-class unit, not a lecturer. Needless to say, I didn't get it.   Still, I'm blushing: I received an email today from the committee, saying they understand me to be   "the first postgraduate student involved in teaching to have been nominated for this award since its inception" , that they were "extremely impressed by your nomination" and that "With or without this award, you clearly are an outstanding teacher and we are very fortunate to have someone of your calibre participating in the teaching programmes in the Department of Psychology."  Blush double blush.  The nicest part of the whole thing I already got actually - I saw a copy of the nomination before it was submitted and it was amazing how nice people can be about you. I'm quite bad at receiving compliments and I kept creasing up in mawkish embarrassment when reading it. It makes you want to go around hugging people but I know that really they're not expecting anything more than a grin of gratitude. A pint or two, maybe. And a pony, but thats it.  So thanks above all to Anna for putting time and effort better spent revising into making me look good.

I get to play an expert, and in an area I have very little expertise (the topic is attraction, so I could argue I have a lot of introspective knowledge to bring to bear... oh yes. I only own a tv so I can gaze at myself in its burnished surface.). Good experience for later life, surely.  And yes I have been worryingly prolific today. I have a stinking cold and don't feel like drawing out a skeleton of a PhD thesis today, thanks all the same. Instead, you get what I want to say with all the snot filtered out.

      I found out yesterday that the drug lord of Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro's most prominent and largest hillside favela  urlLink was killed   last week, following a week of bloodshed between rival gangs and police within the shanty town. Luciano Barbosa da Silva, or Lulu, who ran a criminal system moving cocaine and other drugs from Columbia to  all of Brazil and beyond, was shot to death at 26, an age and cause not untypical for males within the favelas of Rio to find their life ended.   I was in Rio last summer and visited Rocinha with a tour group that specialised in showing outsiders the reality of favela life. It was a highlight of my time in Brazil, in which I saw the enterprise and will that these people had to have to build their homes from scratch up a hillside, maintaining their utilities andsolving their own crises, be they blackouts, fire or whatever, using systems they cobbled together and the limited expertise they shared between them. The houses were good and solid - generally put together by manual labourer and builders using the left-over materials from jobs that were allocated to workers as a rewards - but the town, unplanned, had only a single winding road through its centre, with warrens of alleys providing the only movement. It wasn't scary to be there, although I saw how it could be, and we visited schools and art-and-craft initiatives designed to keep kids learning and away from the lure of easy money as look-outs, and later runners for the drug gangs. We also heard a story of corrupt cops launching a robbery on the town post office, only to be repelled by the gangs rejecting this presumption onto their territory. There was some limited hope within that place, where people were poor but not starving and begging like I had presumed, where there were local doctors and commerce and determination, even if it was overcast by the awesome influence of the drugs and the gangs.  Now Lulu is dead, an event sparked by the invasion by the former Rocinha boss Dudu (Eduino Araujo), and a power vacuum is open for exploitation. Dudu is considered a particularly cruel gang boss with sadistic methods, and the residents see this as only a negative development: "The people here have been living in fear of Dudu returning". While he is the catalyst for the current situation, the favela problem has not been adequately dealt with by successive administrations, while the school system fails over and over again, with underfunding leading to strike leading to erosion in any confidence in schooling the poor youth may have had. I'm sorry that an ever-precarious situation just slid twenty feet closer to the edge.

      A quick thought from "The Blues" before I lose it.   I was fascinated by how so many Blues lyrics are criticisms of the man dressed up as paeans to the woman: My baby don't treat me no good; she take all my money, shirt on my back etc. It resonated with another cultural practise of relocated black culture, the capoeira of Brazil. According to some research of this ritual/dance/martial art it was a way for slaves to train themselves for defence against their masters, cloaked in the innocence of a dance pastime, complete with instruments and chanting. These trappings became deeply embedded in the practise, until they became essential to it (although subsequent developments have led to mutliple approaches to the practise of capoeira, notably the formation of the  Regional   school - more formal, more martial-arts like than the looser and more expressive   Angola  form). I've been playing capoeira myself for about seven months now, having first been properly exposed to it in Brazil in what I thought at the time to be a pretty gruelling session - now I realise they were taking it real real easy on us. I've since learned that this pretty little meme is actually disputed by a lot of capoeira historians. It appears implausible to claim that all the different components of capoeira - the berimbau, pandeiro and all the other instruments, the ritualistic elements and songs all arose simply as cover for its functional aspect of self defence. Besides, there is evidence that cultural expression like singing/dancing was itself repressed in any case. What capoeira seems to be is a curious amalgam of all its incongrous aspects, a game that is a fight, a fight that is a dance, a song that is a ritual. So in one sense the parallel is less striking than I could have claimed. Nevertheless was interesting for my white ass to see another example of the expressive means that were born out of being the powerless man in a strange land, and their common origins in ancient practises on a vast distant continent.

      We’ve had Freeview for a couple of weeks now, and ooh, do I feel the benefit. Eternal Digital TV and Radio in a box for one (modest) payment is a nice deal, and as both media got such bad reception on our standard aerial it has freed us to be a normal household, squaring our eyes and soothing our brains with on-air chat. Huzzah! On top of that we do get a few new channels, mostly bunk but some news, and the 2 digital-only ones from the BBC. BBC4 is really living up to my expectations at the moment, highlight of the past week being Martin Scorsese’s episode of “The Blues”, which managed to convey the significance of these early figures reverently but honestly, even for a novice like me.  Through last night's viewing I stumbled across a format for a debate show unimaginable ten years ago: Dinner with Portillo. It’s a testament to the extent this man has transformed himself that he can be portrayed as the host of a meal for a disparate group of personalities, with heterogeneous political positions, nodding sagely and mediating between extremes rather than acting as one. Or at least, that’s how appears.   The show last night, ‘Education’, was purportedly about “the ethics of opting out of state education”, of whether it is defensible for people to send their kids to private schools, even if they are progressive and advocates of the state system. An interesting question to me, someone who went through private and state education, with good and bad tales of both. My mother was progressive; did she go against her ideals by allowing me to opt out of the state system? And if I were to choose the same for my kids in the future, where would that leave me? There are nuances, conflicts and contradictions in this decision that merit discussion, and did receive some on the program. Discussion of private education cannot go on without some recognition of the current state of the alternatives, and accordingly the talk opened into the problem of substandard state schools, the difficulties that minority kids face in bad schools in sink areas, the imperative felt by hard-working poor to propel their kids upward and give them the ladder that was never afforded them.   Unfortunately, as time went on, the nuances were swallowed up by increasingly heated partisan claims by a couple of state-haters, Melanie Phillips and Chris Woodhead.  The latter used to run the school standards monitor OFSTED; both are columnists for right wing newspapers. The Daily Mail was our newspaper when I was a kid (don’t ask) and Phillips a regular in it, and one of the more regular stomach-turners: well articulated but brimming with vitriol and contempt for whatever her subject was. The whole point of the paper seems to be engendering in Middle England the sense that they are the most wronged species in all of Christendom, that variously the  poor, women, immigrants (constantly) and state workers are  urlLink lucky duckies , every one – and she has mastered that. Him, I know less of, but anyone, regardless of experience, who claims that state education will always failed, on the basis that we haven’t made it work over the past 30 years, is getting no gold stars from me. Bad boy, back of the class!   He proceeded to advocate the introduction of a voucher system for everyone, to spend on state or private education, and let the market improve things as the state isn’t capable. Prof Ted Wragg, education commentator, began to take him to task, as the only specialist defender of the state system who made any real input (Lisa Jardine, another UK professor, was billed as a ‘passionate advocate of state education’ but apart from her opening statements her input was fairly limited), at which point the Phillips ratched up the antagonism, accusing him of considering himself the only authority to make decisions about education (he didn’t), and then accussing him of shifting his story when he clarified what he had said. The debate had completely been reframed from whether we should feel guilty about using private education (which had been dealt with maturely, and generously toward those like guest Trevor Phillips who did use private education while still wanting the state to improve)  to an argument that the state should subsidize private education and that the public should give up on trying to change state education.   How had this occurred? The makeup of the guests certainly contributed: Frances Gumley-Mason (an independent school head); Susan Greenfield  (a peer and celebrity scientist who had very little to say despite her verbosity); Trevor Phillips  (chairs the Commission for Racial Equality), on the show in part as a parent who sent their kids to private school; these people were never going to lambast private education. Introduce two media-savvy guests with a strong agenda to push, and make sure your two state defenders are both academics (allowing the elite and patronizing smear to be employed) and have some history in the system (Wragg has advised on some parliamentary commissions) and you can push and pull at the boundaries of the debate – except, of course, that a capable host will pull things back on track. Right?  Portillo was pretty restrained throughout, and I will readily concede that he was good in the format. If a charge was evaded or a question ignored, he would often pause proceedings and  re-present it for consideration. He did this in a relaxed manner, and his shadow did not fall too heavily across the show.  And yet he was quite prepared to let the show be hijacked by partisans with an agenda to push that was tangential to the proposed content. As I say, you can’t discuss private education without reference to state education and its limitations. But the discussion swept away from a discussion of the moral status of ‘buying’ a better future and to one too large for the program, on whether the state system is a failed experiment and the virtues of market driven services. Portillo seemed content enough with this, intervening at times but only to reformulate questions or push them further. The esperated Trevor Phillips took issue with this, well aware  of what was going on, and bemused that brought on to discuss choosing private education he was forced into defending state education from these attacks. Net result is vouchers got heavy mention (if not true discussion), an expert pronounced state education a failure a few times; pretty good salvo for conservative education policy, all told. So I guess how good Portillo was depends on your perspective.

      I'm not about to go and see the movie, but this is damn funny:  "I just found myself puzzled, given the sorry reviews, by what the various critics had been expecting, and what kind of reviews they would have hoped to be able to write... ('For the first Scooby Doo movie, they did the cartoon with live actors. This time they have thrown off the shackles of neo-realism, and Cassavetes-like, use the riders of the Mystery Machine to explore the inner monster within each one of us, making the statement 'And I would have got away with it too, if it wasn't for those meddling kids...' one that applies, unerringly, to us all -- from the children we were to the monsters we have become....' Or possibly, 'In the latest film, Monsters Unleashed, Scooby Doo has become an idea, an abstract aspiration for Samantha and Eric (Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent ) as they walk the deserted beaches of an abandoned holiday resort, both 'haunted' by the daughter who, we come to realise, may be dead, or may merely have gone to live in Poughkeepsie, leaving behind only an empty and frayed dog-leash from her childhood...')"

      I’m going to answer this poser by splitting it in two - why the name? and why the site? – and I’m hoping they will segue into one another without requiring a textual assault course.  I’ll begin with the name. Names don’t matter in the big scheme of things – this is my band’s desperate mantra – and yet I am drawn very much by sites that project a bit of colour with their particular tag. To be honest, this blog began a bit ass-backward with the name inviting me to find a use for it; poor punnage often finds its way into my songs and humour writing kind of cries out for it, but as it swam in my brain I developed an attachment to it, and began to find some reasons to consign it to a more permanent place. Namely, the blog that then existed, like its putative name, in the waters of my think tank - less swimming than swelling and threatening to burst out if I didn’t relocate it fast. So the reasons:  Firstly, it’s a place. I like the idea of the blog as a place. From  urlLink the american street  to  urlLink Billmon's bar  to  urlLink Harry's Place , the conceit that these are places you visit with their own particular climate is one I find useful and value.  A nominally geographic description of blogtopia (and the wider net) is a pretty good level of description, for me at least, and one that that allows me to engage a bit more fully with the whole thing – we’re visiting sites for crying out loud, not melding with a concept. The concept of community on the web has got a whole lot better since the approaches have been a bit more embodied with a user-friendly sense of place, and I applaud that. Come visit the coop. See? It almost seems real. I also find it kind of fun to imagine how various places might fit together – if you could imagine a blog neighbourhood, who would you find on the corner of your street? I’ll come back to that later. Suffice to say that if it were so this would not be near any gleaming megalopolis in the centre of town, infused by traffic and exuding class. You might find it halfway up the hillside, favela style, self made and while a little ugly, undeniably solid. That’s the aspiration, and for better or for worse, that’s the way my mind works.  Secondly, it’s a joke. Again, that’s the way my mind works. Funny is good, and even when you are being serious funny can be good. It might be redundant to claim Bill Hicks as a formative influence (even average Brit-flicks do it) but its true – I got into his stuff about 2 months after he died and he opened my mind to comedy as a weapon, comedy as an eye-opener, comedy as power. Clearly he wasn’t the first, or even best, in any of these senses; I’m even now hopelessly behind in my appreciation of the domain. Just that he got to me first, before Prior, Bruce et al. The best comedy can make my head hurt, see me chew the walls or cry. So comedy should be able to come anywhere.   Third, it points (in palsied jerks) at a political component. Just to spell it out I am happy to be considered left wing, liberal and progressive; I think it is disingenuous to put yourself on the fence when you know where your heart is on many social/political issues. If saying so denies me the moral high ground of saying “I’m a purely independent thinker, and I arrive at every decision on purely logical grounds” then so be it. (Must be a major achievement to have removed yourself from every assumption and bias that the real world [and the human mind] offers and proceed from a disinterested, god-like position – but hey, you said so, so it must be true.) Having said that I don’t agree with left-wing consensus (there! That was the blogs first real joke) on everything, which is unremarkable, as no reasonable person adopts any stance totally uncritically. Where I differ I would typically argue that my position is more progressive, or aims to be. I’m prepared to be swayed on these things, as with anything, but expect a good few bouts first. (also on reflection I should add that I freely take all the politics in my diet, rather than having some force fed to me; it may be that if I had to put up with SWP manifestos and cries of ‘splitter!’ I would scale down my affiliation. As it is, I think it fits me fine.)  Fourth, as a credo, it suggests that things should not be taken too seriously on the web. Flaming, pettiness and aggressive behaviour is often documented  (and can come from either side of any dichotomy you care to throw up). That the internet has come to be a place for people to argue, persuade, pontificate, rhyme and joke is a good thing, and worth saving. Games of ‘who’s the troll’ are not. If I try keep myself civil, and give open invitation, I hope everyone will keep their game similarly high.

      The question of ‘why the blog’ might be answered by coming back to the idea of the blog neighbourhood, a case of definition by comparison.  Of course, it isn’t the case that any blog topography, or blogography (I hope to god I didn’t just coin that) could be straightfowardly mapped onto a 2-D surface. If we were seriously looking for commonalities and differences in multi-dimensional space, I suspect we’d throw up our hands and despair (unless we were serious statisticians, in which case we would be having serious fun. Seriously.). This is as it should be - if this was just Echnide of the Snakes with less feminism (and as if I could write like her) then what would be the point? But in the spirit of multi-dimensional blogography (ie the spirit of pure geekiness) here are the coordinates you might find me on, if you care to look:   Politics:  Sure, progressive as mentioned, probably a heady mix of US UK and international. The reason for US being partly its undoubted pre-eminence in world affairs, partly that my blog-reading is heavily biased that way – if there is a UK Pandagon, then I haven’t found it yet.  Personal:  I’ll try to keep this low, and only when relevant. This isn’t a venting system – I have a patient, doting girl all too willing to hear me whine. (In other words, watch this space.)  Comics:  Like many blogs I have a strong interest in comics (none of my own due to meeting the devil at the crossroads and selling him my  talent  for dividends of my soul, which I blew at the dogs). Will link to online content. Will comment on comics and appraise other commentary. Will ponder Dave Sims insanity. Will pay ya soon Harry – just advance me a little more for the sure thing I got in race 2. Be a pal.  Science:  As a scientist in training it occupies my mind a lot of the day. While the minutiae of research would bore anyone to tears (I’m misting up as I write this) there are topics that I think would be appropriate for general consumption. I will write up theoretical issues I think are cool (mainly in psychology), practical and ethical issues that I think non-scientists should be more aware of, and obviously science-tinged news is especially fair game.   urlLink Canoeing, swimming, killing - no, no killing.  But pop culture and recommendations will get a look in. What, I think my taste is good – it must be true!  God bless us every one.

      Met  urlLink Richard Corfield  yesterday, an oceanographer and keen promoter of science to the public. He participated in the ICA (Institute of Contemporary Arts) program of scientific dialogue with the public, Cafe Scientifique, and the discussion was wide and fun; I was quite suprised when it was announced we were out of time, especially as several of the topics were just beginning to run.   Principally, I learnt about HMS Challenger, on a mission undertaken by a science-naval collaboration to chart out more knowledge of the oceans, and additionally collect more evidence to assess Darwin's thesis of selection which had been published some thirteen years before. The course of their voyage led to wonderful failure: it had been predicted that the bottom of the ocean would be composed purely of ancient throwbacks (the engine of selection was seen to be enviromental change, and the ocean bed was considered a 'silent landscape' in which the enviroment was constant, meaning no evolutionary pressure to change); instead, they found countless new species. Then, unexpected success: missing links isolated in the Antipodes which gave support to natural selection. Alongside this, they charted the deepest waters, sparked understanding of the patterns of heat and exchange from the oceans to the continents and much more that couldn't fit into my groaning head.   I also learned about  urlLink Methane Hydrate , which becomes frozen in place between water molecules given the right conditions, forming massive deposits on the ocean floor. It's release from the ocean produced massive warming 55 million years ago, an event which could have been cataclysmic if not for the burgeoning algae who arose to consume the masses of CO2 released. What it did achieve was the change in climate that allowed mammals like us to appear. Pertinent to now, energy interests are looking at how to tap into this massive energy resource. This is beyond the stage of investigating feasibility - it can be done and the issue is how to do it safely. If Corfield is right, then this is going to happen well within my lifetime and will represent an effectively unlimited energy source. Something I'm going to want to learn more about...  Beyond this, there was an interesting debate about public promotion of science, which is something I'm very into. It seems to be a hot area at the moment; I hope you'll see me in it one day. Finally, related to the Lomborg post below, Corfield writes about CO2, Kyoto, and scientific responses to the problem  urlLink here . Check it out; it's totally accessible, and he gives props to John Wyndham. Come correct!

      John Quiggin posts on the  urlLink Copenhagen consensus , a project of Bjorn Lomborg's to attempt to prioritise the problems developing countries face. Lomborg is the author of "The Skeptical Environmentalist", cautioning the environmental lobby for overstating their case. It came up yesterday in a discussion among intellectual giants, or more accurately a natter over a yard of ale with a bunch of old school mates.  The post is as ever worth a look, but better yet is his essay on Lomborg's cost-benefit analysis of Kyoto "or something even grander". It's  urlLink here . It's charges include: Overestimation of the costs of Kyoto by large factors His analysis turns out to "reduce the value of costs incurred in 50 years time by a factor of around 10", from what a standard calculation of the rate of discount would produce. "Lomborg ignores ... completely" the ecological costs of climate change Reliance on those economic experts who support his view, without consideration to those (numerous) who do not.  and there more....  of course, you needn't take this at face value either. But let's all keep informed.

      Eldan writes about his  urlLink dissatisfaction with political writing : by others, and by extension by himself. Read it all, but the key point is:  "even if I could write something eloquent and soundly argued that would really be persuasive to a reader with an open mind—there would be no audience for it, and it feels like a lost cause. All I'm doing by writing about politics is effectively wearing a badge, that will irritate some people and signal to others that I'm part of their tribe, and I can't be bothered any more. "  As a consequence he is shutting down active political commentary, while still keeping the door open to writing on political process. He remarks “I can't imagine anyone will really miss my rantings here, but if I'm wrong do tell me.”  Consider yourself about to be told. Ahem.  I think it’s clear that any media source you care to pick does indeed reduce into an echo chamber of some or other set of dimensions. The dailies do it, the distinguished periodicals do it, the blog-continents excel in it. Hell, the man on the street does it too. No-one is objective, and not enough strive to be. Nowadays it’s accentuated in my eyes due to the number of outlets mushrooming, through cable channels but particularly the internet, where thousands of voices professing to be honest, uncoloured and free from the stain of editorial slant reveal unashamed, jaw-dropping bias. It was easier before when I could just blame the owners of big bad media. No such luck.  It’s easier now just to turn sideways and let it slide past.  Yet every person able to well-express themselves, and truly willing in their attempt to eschew reflexivity in favour of a balanced and critical appraisal, is a good voice amongst the sorry chaff. In my opinion Eldan is one of these voices; if not, he’s certainly getting there. For me, the problem is another that he specifies: when I attempt to condense my thoughts into precise words I can too easily become mawkish and winding, often at the same time. I imagine it’s akin to a hierarchy of needs - once I can express myself better I will begin to have issues with whether my expression is actually useful. I think that give or take, he has got to this second stage; and reasonably enough, he is taking on the issue: is there any point if no-one shifts opinion due to what they hear?  Firstly I will take on that assumption. While it’s true that most columnists, bloggers and other vendors of opinions are pretty much entrenched (and bear in mind that there are exceptions; even the devout can become the laity, and vice versa), I think there are many people whose opinions, on a variety of issues, are not set in stone. The rather faceless ‘man on the street’ I introduced earlier (lets face it, he was basically a straw man on the street, wasn’t he?) is really a multitude, and within that you’d find plenty genuinely interested in what other people think about x, y and the proverbial z.   Also, there are certain issues which don’t necessitate a set reaction from each political persuasion, but can elicit diverse responses.   Secondly, even if no-one were to shift, self-expression clearly has an intrinsic value, and I’d argue that political self-expression is particularly valuable. We should entertain and share our opinions on aesthetics (I liked this film, I hated that book) and our immediate social environment; fortunately, most of us do. Politics is easier to duck (one of the dinner table taboos) in our day to day communication, but due to its complexity and importance it is an area where we need to devote resources if we are ever to become rounded, and avoid becoming echo-chambers ourselves. I spend too much time watching public figures I dislike mouth off, and growling inwardly: “Idiot! You’re wrong, and I’m right.” It’s when I actually have to cash out the cheques, and express myself in some way, that I find where my own biases lie, and revise my own opinions accordingly.  Following from this, I would add that a properly functioning democracy should rely on its citizenship being aware and articulate. As a consequence, one could see, if so inclined that expressing oneself politically, even to no-one in particular, is a responsibility we can be proud to carry out.   It should be clear that while the impetus of this post was the decision by Eldan, that its equally about myself and my personal notions about why this is worth doing; it’s also about you, you whover reads this. So for the next paragraph, take Eldan and referents to such  as a term denoting Eldan, me, and yes, you.   I'd like to see Eldan continue talking about politics. I certainly don't think he should feel obliged to, or feel that political events should ever dictate a response (I don't think his silence on an issue is likely to be harmful), but if he feels like articulating where he stands on any issue, then that’s enough to shoot on and do it. The argument above asserts it’s good for Eldan (cohering his value system) and good for society (leading from the first point).  On a personal note, Eldan, it's certainly good for me. I’m also wandering the same broad ballpark that you’re in, maybe in the bleechers whilst you’re in the dugout (excuse the terrible American sporting analogy but seeing as Eldan is in the States ‘jumpers for goalposts’ is not legit), but thereabouts, with an interest in the world, hope that it will be better, untied to ideology but interested in ideas. Hell, I’m curious about how you are wending your way from a to b, and if there are any tigers there. Eldan, I’d love to be discussing this over a beer with you, but distances make that a tall order. What? No, not you! You expired from the terminology a paragraph ago. Haven’t you been listening at all? And why the hell would I be addressing myself? Jesus!

      I just stumbled across a site called the Stopped Clock, well written politicalish stuff.  urlLink This  was nice and so I'm linking.  sample:  "The mistake behind these reviews essentially boils down to "I agree with this author, so this author must be right". Sometimes the author has thought about the subject more deeply than the blogger, and perhaps the blogger's thinking has been shifted by the book. But the uncritical blog entries at issue don't even suggest that much thought has occurred. This is not to suggest that the ideas endorsed are necessarily wrong - but such a nicety is of little consequence to the blogger's agreement or endorsement."

      Just want to hand out some praise for  urlLink Scott McCloud's site  which I've been frequenting like a red-hooded child in a Nicholas Roeg movie - not all the time, but enough to matter. It's a pretty usable site, and McCloud is an innovative figure in comics, which might lend it relevance to the non-converted. He puts a lot of content on-line nowadays - click on 'On-Line Comics'to view them - and a lot of his formats are pretty unusual. Try   urlLink 'My Obsession With Chess'  , for example. He enthusiastically champions new formats like this, and I've just read today the second part of 'The Right Number', which has a really satisfying interface that is aesthetically interesting (zooming into each panel to the next one), that he makes the most of. McClouds work is often a little cold, detached, which may not be to everyone's taste, but I quite like that outsider-narrator thing, and it's impossible to deny his talent and application of imagination.  He is also doing something else fairly new; selling content via the web for 25c a pop. It's done via  urlLink Bitpass , a system where you essentially buy vouchers for your account (as little as $3), which you can then spend in a variety of places. So far I've spent 50cents on The Right Number 1 & 2, and 75 on a audio-short story by Tom Gerency; currently downloading a Mark Twain audio-story for a buck. I'm quite happy to pay these prices for on-line content, although admittedly it is a novelty now, so I may scale down to only the stuff I really want. But especially in the Right Number case, McCloud as a jobbing artist needs recompense for the considerable work put into this quality item, and its media requires it be online, or at least computer based. So it's good there are these systems in place to deal with small payments (I'm not about to put my credit card details in every time I want to glance at part of a comic story).  Enough plugging, except to balance my touting of McCloud by lauding  urlLink Dylan Horrocks . I haven't been able to get my hands on Hicksville, his highly rated graphic novel, but dearly want to. What I have read is his intelligent analysis of what comics are: a topic that interests many in the field butis generally only equated with McCloud himself (for the unacquainted McCloud published Understanding Comics, and further to that Reinventing Comics, the first particularly seen as the definitive work on what the art and medium of comics is actually all about). Horrocks breaks down the rhetoric of UC and suggests other ways of conceptualising the whole shebang, which are actually a little closer to my heart.

      John Quiggin at CT (and others in the comments) turn over  urlLink the ticking bomb problem  regarding torture. What they find underneath is that even if the situation could somehow legitimise torture under some ethical system, this does not necessitate dispensing with punishment for the torturer. If the situation were somehow severe enough to call for torture of an individual, it would also be severe enough to call for punishment of the applicant, even if their intentions were wholly good.  "Torture is wrong, but..." is a step into pragmatism that lends it a conditional legitimacy. Torture should not be treated as a last ditch tool in our carry-case. Even if the hypothetical situation arose, if a moral agent stepped out of bounds and committed the unconsciounable, it would have to do so aware that this isn't merely a 'Break in Case of Fire' operation: it's playing with the devils fire, with all the consequences that brings.

Here's the gem:  "And then, there are the condoms. What do you think of when you hear the word Trojan? Possibly, you think of the heartbreaking scene of farewell between Hector and Andromache, when little Astyanax is frightened by the nodding plumes of Hector's helmet. But probably not. Probably, you think: Trojan horse. So consider the context. There's this big...item outside your walled citadel, and you are unsure whether to let it inside. After hearing the pros and cons (and seeing some people eaten by snakes), you open the gates and drag the big old thing inside. Then, you get drunk. At the height of the party, hundreds of little guys come spilling out of the thing and sow destruction, breaking "Troy's hallowed coronal", as they say. Is this, all things considered, the ideal story for condom manufacturers to evoke? Just asking."

      Tom at Idiolect  ruminates  on  this  piece of research on awareness of being stared at. We’re talking ‘6th Sense’ here, people. Hairs bristling on the back of necks. Mind to mind communication. Bruce Willis, meandering with his best haunted expression (do you see what I did there? Perversely fitting, no?)  He’s generally unhappy about the fact that this was published, given that the authors do not present any possible ways of connecting the findings with our understanding of how reality works. I’m more optimistic, and think that, absent outright falsification or methodological error, it’s a good thing it was published, small effect or no.  It calls to mind the Maharishi effect, which I was vaguely aware of for some time but got a thorough schooling in through Robert P Abelson's excellent  “Statistics as Rhetorical Argument” . This is my favorite book I’ve read this year, and I’m heading for a re-reading sooner rather than later. Abelson recounts this remarkable finding, wherein The number of people performing transcendental meditation correlates with reduction in car accidents, lower crime rates, and incidence of fire. He takes up this example a number of times, in which the major study  1   got complex but significant results and appeared to follow its own methodology to the letter.   Of course, a result like this is going to be controversial, and rightly so: there are huge implications for science as well as national policies (mandatory meditation anyone?), so its damn important that this be right. As the research was published, every Tom Dick and Hermione with an inquiring mind was free to pore over what was done, and see if anything was wrong.  Sure enough, an explanation was found, and you will be unsurprised to hear it did not require the rejection of materialism, nor a consequent global rise in guru-republics. The problem lay with the non-random distribution of number of meditators across weeks used to match against the meditation periods. Higher numbers of meditators were available at holidays, weekends and the like and these calendar effects were trackable and produced an alternative explanation for the correlations.  It’s a good thing the Maharishi effect research was published, even though it turned out to be wrong. Why? Because it wasn’t obviously wrong: the confound they uncovered was not considered by the journal, and so presumably was not standard practice in the field of (hmm- psychological epidemiology?). It was a problem that had not been clearly classified as a problem.   When deeply unusual and, lets say it, unwelcome (from the point of view of the scientific community) research comes along, it galvanizes people to focus ever-harder on methodology, in a mass-game of spot the confound. Once the confound is spotted, it raises the quality of future published work, as it shouldn’t get by without recognizing and overcoming the issue. It has a hint of working with paradoxes in philosophy, but with an overtly empirical bent: “This can’t possibly mean what it says it means – so which of the inferences [or methodological steps] are unsound?”  Of course, if a confound really can't be spotted, and the result proves to be replicable, then this is an equally important reason to consider it. It might suggest that we need to be prepared for a paradigm shift in that scientific domain, as current theory simply cannot account for the genuine empirical findings. Or, perhaps more worryingly for the scientist, we might need to consider that our tools are not right for the job: either current scientific method or the human capacity to undertake and appraise it simply  can't cope with everything we throw at it. Both would be radical results, but that doesn’t make them taboo. I don’t know of anything out there that seems likely to be taking us down that road though.     1  Orme-Johnson, D.W., Alexander, C.N., Davies, J.L., Chandler, H.M. & Larimore, W.E. (1988).

      Some working in academia have a bone to grind about publication. Others could wave at least a couple at you, and there are those trying hard to fit skeletons into outsized mortars. The publication system sucks.   One major concern is the peer-review system. Many feel that it is vulnerable to poisoned attacks by referees who have an interest in work not being published; that it allows work to be assessed by those who consider themselves above such things, don’t apply themselves to the task, so filter like a one-holed fishing net.  Moreover, factors such as sex and national language of author affect publication likelihood, different referees show agreement “little greater than chance”, and the whole process is extremely conservative and causes great problems for unconventional projects to ever see the light of day.  You can see more of this, and one suggestion for an alternative,  urlLink here  (2 page pdf, quote taken from page 269, may not be available on all servers).  Another concern, one that I prioritise over the previous, is that of the whole ‘publish or perish’ culture of academia. This certainly affects some fields more than others, but mine – psychology – is steeped in this attitude, which rattles from the hot dogs with hefty grants down to students like me.  urlLink This  paper highlights the concern that the everyday student has. Note it was written in 1983 – to me, this is the good old days. Suffice to say that the problems have become ever more systematic. It’s still pretty timely, though. See this:    This pressure to publish--and to publish as often as possible--directly interferes with the kind of research advocated by Maddi, McGuire, and the others: research that is multi-dimensional, longitudinal, collaborative, and relevant to life in the real world. Indeed, the Publication Manual points out how "we become content with rapid, mediocre investigations where longer and more careful work is possible" (1974, p. 22), Publish-or- perish as a guideline for untenured faculty has now become something of a mania even for graduate students. How else, we are told by our professors, will you find a job? It's a jungle out there, and a list of publications to flesh out the curriculum vitae is supposed to be our first line of defense. It doesn't much matter what we publish, or whether we actually write anything original or useful or thoughtful: what matters is how long a list of publications we can present to the Search Committee of whatever institution we hope to work at.   From everyone I’ve spoken to on the subject, this still appears to be the state of play.  I’m lucky in having a relaxed and supportive supervisor, in that while he’d e very happy for me to accrue papers (as would I), it’s not considered the primary aim of  what I’m doing – I’m here to complete a set of research and write a thorough thesis (and learn a few things along the way). For many other students I know, there is a pressure to publish as much as possible; I’ve been introduced to the concept of salami slicing your thesis – working out how many discrete components you can reduce your work to, in order to maximise your publications. This is undoubtedly detrimental to the ease of access to academic information: five studies essentially establishing one phenomena in various ways are far better presented together, allowing continuity of writing and far less redundancy, than as five different papers that have to prehash, hash, and rehash the same preambles, and may take slightly different tacks in their articulation, impeding a reader from getting their teeth into whatever story needs to be told. Moreover, as mentioned, it’s an impediment to certain types of research, which simply can’t be reduced to free-standing components.  It’s a disheartening climate, as it privileges publishing over all other pursuits. Teaching is what they make you do while you’re trying to get that paper in to  Nature . Research groups and collaborations are a means to an immediate end, rather than opportunities to wrangle with assumptions and open conceptual horizons. It’s quite appropriate to have indexes of performance based on visible outcomes – and clans of researchers navel-gazing interminably without any goal is obviously of no consequence to anyone, except the odd piece of lint – but the focus entirely misses other ambitions the universities should keep in mind – furthering knowledge as well as creating it; providing an environment in which research students, who are effectively apprentices – can learn, make mistakes and explore, rather than serve as a publication and citation engine for the upper echelons.  Worst of all, it produces work that is just good enough. Who would polish their work beyond what is asked of them, when they could be moving on to the next paper? Well, luckily, I think a lot of researchers do, as certainly there are other pressures and incentives than the publication imperative. Certainly, as the Fox paper began with, those who are entrenched and secure, with tenure or masses of funding, are freed to explore other avenues at the paces they can specify. But certainly, the young researcher is in a squalid trap, not least because the candidates far outstrip the places available at every rung of the career ladder.  [EXTRA:  this little baby on  urlLink academic fraud , interesting in its own right, throws up something which is not hugely rare – the “stamp of approval” authorships  where a big hitter puts themselves on a paper they’ve had no real contact with – only presumably to massage upwards their publication rates. So I guess its a problem which envelopes everyone on the ladder. For a less serious, although I hesitate to call it fun, situation then you can look at the whole  urlLink Erdos  obsession amongst the biggies.]  So what are the alternatives, if any?  We could prune away at the bad points of the publication system, and in this there are no shortage of ideas.  The Della Salla paper ( pdf above) suggests the use of sponsors, who assess your work and decide whether they’d be happy to attach their name (and reputation to it), at which point it then goes to committee; there is an idea of referees taking on prosecutorial and defense roles, and possibly add incentive to performing these roles successfully (‘acquitting your client’ gets you brownie points in some way). The allocation of refereeing has been criticized, so perhaps a system that engaged in a bit of reciprocity, where researchers can build up a bank of review-me credits by themselves reviewing others, would get everyone involved in the process with a fair incentive (a bit like some of the P2P file-sharing systems, where you have to keep your upload and download ratio within some set of boundaries).  Many of these possibilities seem worth pursuing to me; the system as it stands is no-where near optimal and these are fairly pragmatic solutions. Most don’t require a universal decree to get rolling: you just need one or two respectable journals modify their submissions criteria, and then crucially for the system to work (and be seen to work) to observe the practise spreading. I’m turning my head now, so someone silly can shout ‘Meme!’   There. But I’d like to engage in some fanciful discussion of  long-term alternatives. Alterations to the peer-review process  such as those above don’t really seem to make much of a dent in the problem of publish-or-perish, although perhaps revisions to employment criteria, made in parallel to these, might help somewhat. I’m interested if we can imagine a system, say five, ten or thirty years on from now, that would allow the positive aspects of the publication system to continue (access to scientific findings, filtration of poorly produced science, rewarding of research activities) while minimising the negative (quantity of output as a measure, limited selection of individuals acting as a filter, biases against unconventional work).  I’m looking for answers, so I guess I should give my take on what might be a future direction.   Increasingly, the web is being used to publish scientific information. I’m convinced that in years to come we will be seeing this as the preeminent way to get hold of all academic information. My hope is that we will see journals eventually dispensed with altogether, with all information freely available and hosted either by individuals, university sites or research groups / special interests. I would argue that all scientific information, irrespective of quality, should be available within the same milieu, with no sharp division between journal-published, good science, and non-journal, questionable science.  Without filters operating, this would leave us in the unenviable position of being trapped in the morass of innumerable studies, with no way of navigating between them and no way of checking the science was done correctly. To avoid this, a peer review system would still exist, but one that is far more open and nuanced than the current one. Work to be published should be sent to research communities, in a manner akin to posting to a newsgroup: the suggested article, alongside the raw data and possibly copies of the program themselves would be posted there. The material can then be reviewed by everyone – probably having to go through some sort of gating system to ensure it is actually adequate to be considered (to avoid the wastage of many people looking over unacceptable work) , and following this  being available for comments and ranking by their peers – a genuine peer community rather than one or two anonymous figures. A key element of this is that the work gets printed anyway (as work is hosted personally, not by the research community), but the ratings the work accrues can be used in literature searches, such that good work is preferentially selected over poor ones.  The bottom line with the ratings would be how useful the article was to the researcher. Usefulness can come in different forms: an article might put a persuasive case for something already fairly well established, or could turn common understanding on its head; it may progress theory very little but contain an ingenious methodology that could be turned to other methods, or carefully reveal lacuna in dominant models, whilst failing to offer an alternative. The ratings systems could represent this, meaning that a student looking for innovative techniques or one trying to get a sense of the theoretical landscape have those tools at their disposal, as adjudged by the entirety of the relevant scientific community. The way in which these communities should be composed isn’t entirely clear to me: should it be essentially self-selecting, decided by consensus (like a club), or through a board with applications? Certain of these options lean this system closer to the closed methods it attempts to displace. Nonetheless, it still would provide judgment by a far broader range of individuals.   I suppose one might why the community would bother to do this at all?  I think this would be an odd criticism, given that the academic community is based on progress via understanding what other people are doing, and then doing it better (or contrary). If you are presented work by someone in your area, it would be strange indeed not to react by reading through it, sifting the useful from the useless and inspiring your own work. This, after all, is why seminars and conference presentations are not played to empty chairs: scientists want to know more about their area, so they can do it better. This would simply add a formalised feedback component to the back of these existing practise – feedback that could be later reviewed according to the individual paper’s “impact factor” (ie the number of citations that this particular paper has accrued)  thus giving a prestige incentive to be fair and not miserly. If everything is transparent, it is very dangerous to be biased.   I should add that I think that basing the rating of the article on how useful it seems to the peer group seems a good way to make sure that basic/non-applied research is still of some definite service. It meets the criticism that certain types of research are privileged due to their fashionability rather than  any real contribution to understanding (as numerous critics of imagin work would put – I’ll cover this soon)  - if no-one can say that it’s helped them progress their own ideas or techniques, then the research will sink to the bottom. That’s it in a nutshell – I might have had more to say but its gone with my now certainly lamented journal…. anyone care to raise me on this one?

      Attempting an update of my CV, particularly for Public Engagement with Science type jobs. My first stab at a profile is a bit clunky. Any thoughts?   I am keenly interested in promoting science to a wide audience. For modern progress to continue, we need to attract new people into the sciences, and to ensure we are equipped to deal with the novel situations such progress always throws up we must provide the public both with accessible knowledge of the scientific facts on the ground, and, equally, the ability to bring scientific thinking to novel situations. Through my teaching, I spend a lot of getting students to apply systematic scientific reasoning to unexpected experimental results; via scientific training and public presentations I have learned to tell a story over outputting facts. The scientific community continues to teach me its processes, and I hope to promote them internally and externally.    Sentence 2 is particularly nasty, methinks. I've had to ruthlessly compress to fit with my 1-page criteria, so any advice should bear in mind I can't unpack these sentences at will - they can't be much longer than they are. Doesn't mean they have to be there at all, of course...

      I discovered this week that my work computer is defective – it’s been compromised from the outside by nefarious folk with nebulous intentions. Luckily I had the opportunity and presence of mind to back everything up when I began noticing abnormalities. I actually did this with my  urlLink iRiver , and it’s worth noting that for this purposes it’s definitely superior to the brand leader: disa went thru a similar spat recently and  backed all her music up on her office-mates iPOD, only to find that the critter is unwilling to drop it back again. An anti-theft strategy that really punches holes into its utility (for an illuminating discussion on this face spited by needless nose cutting, see  urlLink here ). Today I moseyed to work with my bag half-open – the zip pops when it’s too full – and I have a strong worry that along the way it ejected my journal, full of piping hot knowledge.  I’m hoping to add a second Phew to the post, in the event I return home and find it staring at me from my bedroom floor, but damn! I really have lost my memory – it’s as much that externalized in scripts, notes and mnemonic aids as the stuff inside the noggin, an argument elucidated in  urlLink Being There , Andy Clark’s great book about the concept of the embodied mind  that entered cognitive science sometime in the late 90s (I think; others – notably Eldan – know much more about this than me, having only incompletely read it as an undergrad). Obviously I study the noggin somewhat more, but the truth of it isn’t lost on me. Unlike, I fear, my journal.  So I’m internet/email crippled (I can get basic messages now via my hotmail, but no big attachments, and for that I’ve got to go to a shared room on another floor. The indignity!) and without all my productive notes made this year. So expect extreme erraticism.

      We had our postgrad departmental conference at Cumberland Lodge a few weeks ago. It’s a highlight of the year, based in scenic Windsor Great Park, and offering good cooked meals, huge baths, and table tennis. I co-organized the trip for 2003, where we shook up the format with a series of contentious debates:   Is any phenomena truly psychogenic?; Is permission always a prerequisite of involvement in research?  [mainly animal ethics];  What bearing does evolutionary theory really have on psychology?; Does science have all the answers?     Oh, the shouting! Oh, the finger-pointing!  Oh, the sacrificing of hens on the prince regent’s bed.      Love it.  This year the charming Disa and the also-charming David put it together. The topics?  Psychological education – is Psychology a single unified discipline?  What is a psychological law of nature?  Peer-review – the best possible option?  Who sets the scientific agenda?   Good meaty stuff, as I’m sure you’ll agree. I’ll be posting on a few of these – I made a few notes at the time and I’m trying to translate them into a human language. Quaking with anticipation?  Oh stop it, you.  Wait – that was sarcasm? Bitch.

      At one time  urlLink bemused  at punks being politically active, the big man at Harrys place  finds the whole  urlLink festival thing all a bit too much  - especially the notion that liberal, Guardian readers might be there. According to comments,  he’d prefer a  “smokey basement punk club”;  it’s unclear what music preference the politically minded can have without risking a derogatory bashing at some point or other. The reason this is worth bringing up is that from the description I’ve painted here, you might think said blog was right-leaning in question: bash the Guardian, act baffled that punks are anything but a joke minority, etc. But no! This is the new left, formally distinguished from the old by their support of the Iraq war; equally easy to spot by their obsession with criticizing, deriding and generally hating on anyone else who is considered left-wing. – see these two blog topics:  urlLink  Trots    (sounds like a trip to the toilet eh? I guess that’s the point) on the bankruptcy of  socialism and this on  urlLink  The Left , more of a mixed bag but still largely negative stuff. There is no such topic on the Right, (update - there is one on  urlLink Anti Fascism  but it's extremely thin -  4 posts, the earliest in May, suggesting an afterthought) which seems surprising for a liberal UK site at a time when we are seeing the rise of the BNP and the emergence of the UKIP. These parties do get a mention, but generally in terms of how they are akin to the ‘extreme left’: they are a handy way to smear and criticize other people you   really   have a problem with.  It’s a shame because I like the site well enough in several respects – there are not enough UK sites I find readable or relevant ( urlLink Matt T ’s blog is an exception, just added to my blog-roll – deftly written, and the guy can handle statistics in a way that conjures envy in me); I like group blogs, which is why the Coop has fleshed out the flock, at least nominally; and I do think some aspects of what they are focussing on – extremes of the left wing being dogmatic and unreasoning, and potentially harmful – is a good thing. But my god, if you’re the policeman of the left must you model yourself on early 90s LAPD? If the response to left-wing knee-jerks is to jerk right back, nothing is achieved, except a damn good  Cossack dance.   One theme that was strutting in these circles for a while that really, really got on my tits was the one about how concerns about attempting global democratisation  were basically racism in a woolly jumper. I wrote something about this just before Japan, so it’s a bit late to be posting, but this is still being bandied about – as recently as yesterday, where a program on Radio 4 (the Moral Maze) saw these notions being raised again. So here it is:  It’s amazing how certain camps are prepared to trot out the remarkably flimsy straw man that the anti-war crowd have a distinctly colonial sheen about them, with the suspicion that ‘these sorts of people’ can’t be expected to govern themselves in the same way we can. In one sense, the thing has legs, but the rest is on all back to front.  Among those with misgivings about the current state of Iraq there is genuine concern about the transformation attempted. This is not a distrust of the Arab capacity to find democracy. It’s an awareness of the difficulty of sweeping revolutionary change. It’s something any good progressive-minded person should have cut their teeth on in the progression from naïve idealist to pragmatist with ideals. Looking at major 20th Century sweeping changes to the cultural landscape, you can see that the successful ones were remarkably circumscribed vs the big ones. Leftists can be proud of civil rights, extensions in the franchises, child welfare laws. They should be ashamed of the seizures of total power and attempts to redraw society utterly that has coloured and twisted the notion of progressive action. This should be bread and butter to the self-styled ‘new left’, as they revile the adherence to Marxist principle and starry-eyed idealism seen in the big left-wing institutions of the UK today. If they could turn it in toward themselves,  they might recognise that that their zealous commitment to the Iraq project, with all its embroiled ambitions (from domino theories to transforming the entire middle east, to flypaper strategies for transforming the fight against terrorism into a conventional and finite land war) reeks of the same simplification and dogmatic commitment to project.  We all, if we call ourselves left wing, want to change the world for the better (not to imply this is exclusive to the left, but it is a prerequisite of being left-wing). However, not all of us are naïve enough to assume the world is going to skip along with our aspirations. What is being attempted in Iraq is a radical change. Perhaps the prowar left would argue that it is one that will always be radical, and so is wholly necessary. To which the follow-up, and critical step, would be to ascertain whether the proposed plan accounts for the scope of the problem in question. Will there be intricate planning for multiple, complex contingencies? Do we know what the short, mid and long term goals are and have we weighed a cost-benefit analysis? Could we do more good with the same resources elsewhere, or at less risk?  urlLink  Some people   did the job, and they found the proposals wanting.  That’s the issue at hand, not Saddam-loving or Arab hating. I hope such claims will die down once people realise their ridiculousness. But I’m not holding my breath.

      A: Gives a Brain Wave!  Oh yes. You know it, I've hit paydirt. A web site that seems perfectly pitched at me:  urlLink Neuroscience for Kids . Joy. I'll alert you to a piece comparing  urlLink Neuroscience research to "Survivor" ; which gave a 2000s spin to a well-recognised fact:  To stay in the television game, survivors must avoid being voted out. One way to avoid banishment is to gain "immunity" by winning an immunity challenge... For scientists, immunity is tenure.    Quite. The similarities end at some point:   Neuroscientists are not competing for a million dollars.   No shit, sherlock. Only, if you're a neuromarketer....  What's a neuromarketer? I'll tell ya tomorrow.

      For the most part I have no problem with evolutionary psychology. Sure, I’m not a believer in all the arguments it puts forward. And sure, a portion of the work has been sloppy, in the early days (the vilified Sociobiology period, as documented  urlLink here ), and increasingly, I feel, in the recent output. But I’m quite happy to tie myself to the position that evolutionary forces have shaped the brain and behaviour in organisms, and consequently are well worth studying. It’s natural that I would: much work in neuroscience and psychology proper is tacitly underpinned by this notion, and to fail to recognise this would hamstring a serious investigator of brain and behaviour. If a sub-discipline wants to focus on these issues a bit more closely, then that’s fine with me; get some right, get some wrong, but get it out there for us to puzzle over.    At the moment, I do have a problem with evolutionary psychology.  I have a problem with it because it has shucked its safety harness and pounced into the public arena: being an unusual beast, it attracts spotlights and attention; being trained well it captivates onlookers with its dynamic flurry. One consequence is that evolutionary psychology and its trappings have firmly re-entered the arsenal of right-wing justification, and continue to perpetuate the mindset that rationality is bequeathed solely to the modern right. The agnosticism towards politics that seemed promised in the new wave of Evolutionary Psychology has been jettisoned in favour of extensive engagement with these issues. The most visible work in which this can be seen is Steven Pinker’s   urlLink The Blank Slate     1  , which actually purports to excise “anxieties about human nature”(p139), but somehow manages to steamroll into every political issue it can find. Invariably, the only sector that comes out well is the secular right.  It might appear odd that a book which damns the politicisation of the scientific issue of nature-nurture, and vocally attempts to neuter it, could be so preoccupied with the social and indeed, political, implications of that same issue. But Pinker is an excellent writer, and the book is structured in such a way to allay even the critical reader’s suspicions. From the first few sections concerned with the history of ideas of human nature, and some of the science which conflicts with these ideas, he then moves to the nightmare implications that are so often thrown up by critics (won't we all have to become racists?). He compellingly and dispassionately exposes the fallacies that plague thinking about human nature (using the Humean maxim -you can't get ought from is- to illuminate how selfish tendencies would not undermine ethics; explicating what determinism really means, and whether genetic determinism would be any worse than environmental determinism), and shows that these issues ultimately bottom out into political and ethical arguments, rather than scientific findings.  By the end of this, with any conscientious, rational reader firmly on side, the book turns from these extreme and worrying issues (determinism, eugenics, racism) onto contemporary ‘hot button’ issues; we are informed that in these cases science  should   be utilized, as we need a good cost-benefit analysis of what is going on.   As one of these readers, revisiting for the second time, I feel like a man beguiled, ruefully clutching his head the next day as he figures out that the other camel being lame, blind and toothless, doesn’t make this one worth the forty shekels. Hitler, Nietzsche and deep pessimism about humanity were hovering about human nature – but now, they are vanquished! And our saviour merely asks that we consider installing these new sentinels: Hobbes, Hayek, Burke. We are told accepting genes and biological bases to the mind doesn’t require accepting the bogeymen, but it is strongly implied that if we are going to be scientific about it we ought to pack up our Rousseau, Locke and Kennedy. To me this book is disingenuous. Pinker as vigorous corrector of misunderstanding does, largely, a wonderful job.  However, to sandwich in his viewpoints on hot button issues, he leaves the lab and slumps into the armchair, making arguments that where nominally solid are not reducible to science, or else not reducible to the scientific knowledge we currently have. They are at times intriguing and possibly compelling, but they are ultimately polemic and not an expression of the current scientific state of play.   I’m going to visit this book a few times over the next few weeks, try and build a concerted critique of its political aims. This is part of something I’ve been wanting to get off the ground, under the title of “Science is not a right wing tool”, or some such. Too often I see science and rationality touted as if they are the province of the right, and the left is dominated by dogma and blushing nonsense. I’d like to serve as some sort of corrective. For now, Pinker is target No 1 – not because I dislike him; I have read most of his books and enjoyed them all; I’ve paid to hear him speak and find him engaging, and he (and much of evolutionary psychology) were what drew me deeply into my studies in the first place. I’m tackling him because I’m frustrated that so much can be, as he hopes, “coolly analytical” (p xi), whilst his “positive thrust” (ibid) is so untempered and undoes, to my mind, what the real task of the book should be: to say everyone, regardless of belief, should get on board the science train.      1  Pinker, S.

      I’m rather desensitised to the horror of football ( urlLink two   urlLink teams  I was waving for go out on penalties, the  urlLink other  underperforming horribly, as always) , but my senses were understandably pricked by a heartening story on that warmest of topics for any english liberal: right-on footie.   The beautiful game – real football, Brazilian style –  urlLink  is coming to Haiti  , and a gun amnesty is being combined with ticket distribution to make “I’ll see you in the stands” shift from a dark threat into an expression of peace.   I wonder if they scale it: an Uzi for a single seat, bazooka gets a family ticket and so on; the team could take a bullet back as a grave memento. Guns are a  urlLink serious problem for Haiti  (I wonder, where it is in the world where guns do not constitute a problem), and it's heartening to hear the current PM Gerard Latortue say:   "A few Brazilian soccer stars could do more to disarm warring militias than thousands of peacekeeping troops"  I’ve written before, a little, about the problems Brazil faces, especially  urlLink with regard to its urban poor , a problem too long ignored – now a third of Brazilians live on  urlLink less than $1 per day , and there are mixed signals about President Lula – popular with investors but criticized at home for slowing reform. My limited knowledge yields me a limited faith in him – I think a huge country with huge problems has to be treated carefully, and those who I met in Brazil who were most hopeful for the future seemed the most grounded – the middle-aged aerospace engineer I met on the plane back, the family we stayed with – so we might see slow, but real improvement on the ground (the eternal optimist in me shines bright today). Regardless, when you scout around a little more, to countries like Haiti, Honduras in the Americas, or Sierra Leone, Guinea (priority countries on the  urlLink Hunger Map ) you realize there’s bad, and then there’s bad. Even if it seems largely tokenistic, it’s warming when a country with plenty problems of its own puts out a hand to another.

      No title, as I'm wholly contrite about my lack of action. I promised you neuromarketing! Sorry, folks, but tomorrow has been a Vitalstatistix kind of phenomena recently. Hiatus will no doubt continue, as I will be going away in a week: there are reasons, namely getting involved in this  urlLink unspeaking cool project , trying to mutate the thoughts on evo-psych and politics into a coherent article, and busy workness.  However, when important things rear their head, I always step up, so consider this your friendly link to an important piece of  urlLink research on scary films . Needless to say, I was underimpressed: Researchers spent two weeks watching horror films like The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Silence of the Lambs in pursuit of the formula.   Two weeks? Fuck off. Thats a couple of popcorn marathons (and I bet they weren't watching 14 hours a day, either). I have severe suspicions about their sampling methods - not the quantity (I admit, you could watch a fair heft of films in two weeks to give a moderate sample) so much as representativeness. If they just took visible movies that made it to the mainstream, they'd certainly miss all the international horror (with very different takes on fear), low key burners like Paperhouse (I assume to god they included Jacobs Ladder, but even that ain't guaranteed) - and what about  urlLink this shocker?    Stefan.  Stefan!!!   (apologies to those whose adolescence was not incomprehensively stricken by exposure to a rubber dinosaur and a grown man acting as a child. And not in a  urlLink Jack  kinda way.)
