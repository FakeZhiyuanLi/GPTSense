      Hello again, welcome back to: " Dark Days, Dark News, Dark Matters - Part 2 ".   :o)     DARK NEWS     "Yea, though I walk through The valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil; For thou art with me; Thy rod and staff comfort me still"     Â©  The King James Bible, The Old Testament -  Psalm 23 : v.4   I should have known Sunday (June 13) was going to end badly, when it started out that way. I woke up that morning, um, actually, it was the afternoon, as it was after midday, to a spider on the wall. I'm terrified of spiders. Especially big hairy ones with long, long, long hairy legs. I stumbled out to the kitchen, turned the computer on, (there are priorities, after all, and " urlLink Dark Matters " was due to commence in fifty minutes.   :o)   ), mooched around for a bit, turning the kettle on, etc., then finally grabbed the can of fly spray from the cupboard and crept back into my bedroom to spray a gallon of it on the poor unsuspecting thing.  There was a topic on the Dark Matters radio show that afternoon (Saturday June 12 in California, USA) about men being made irrelevant.   Well, I'm telling you, that it's at times when these BIG hairy spiders get into my unit, which is actually more often than I like to think about, that I'd be more than grateful for a big strong bloke, unafraid of spiders, to get rid of the thing without killing it.   :o0 And then, when I get bad news like I did that night, it's at those times, when I wish that there was a bloke around to cuddle up to. Ah well...   :o)     Anyhow...   I was minding my own business Sunday night, watching NCIS on the TV, and eating an Oreo cookie (seriously), while sipping at a cup of green tea with jasmine, when the phone rang. Now, NCIS is one of those neat new TV shows that I've been enjoying, it's sort of a spin off of JAG, I think. Although JAG is better, really, but this is still fun. And the Oreo, well... let's just say that I gave into extreme temptation. I've been trying to give up sugar, and did for a little while, but I succumbed to the sirens lure that evening while shopping, and gave in to it.  Ah, well... there's always tomorrow... but, I'm digressing...  It was mum on the phone, and I did my shocking usual when someone calls me up during something I'm watching that's distracting my interest. I two thirds listened to what mum had to say, and one third listened to the TV and almost, almost missed the... "I've some bad news to tell you..." and the unspoken, "so pay attention, dear", part of the somewhat one sided conversation at that stage.  Have you ever had one of those moments when your brain goes into complete rewind? Where everything screeches to a halt, and then you rewind over what the other person has just been saying, whilst jumping to all sorts of conclusions at the same time about exactly what the information they're about to impart is all about... Well, I had one of those rather long confusing moments, before I managed an intelligent... "Uh, what?" Mum definitely had my full attention after that. Or, mostly anyway, as my brain had gone into a momentary tail-spin.   Some background info before I go on :  I have one aunt on my father's side, her name is Wendy. She's only about 49 years old. Sadly, she has cancer, which has spread though her body. She's fairly bright at the moment, but we're not really sure how much longer she has left, or whether that time is measured in months, or a few years, although we suspect months.  Aunty Wendy and her husband Alex, (they've only been married for about ten years), visited my family in Mudgee, (a country town in the Cudgegong Valley, in the Central West of New South Wales), a couple of weekends ago. It was a surprise visit, so unfortunately I didn't know about it until the afternoon they arrived, and as I live here in Sydney, was unable to join in the family reunion. I was a bit disappointed but, c'est la vie, as they say.  Alex was not a well man himself, and was on his way down to Sydney to have a minor operation to repair something in his oesophagus. After that, they were heading inter-state by car, to a conference in Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory. He'd had a stroke a year or two back, that he managed to recover from, and it's been a bit doubtful as to whether or not he'd survive Aunty Wendy by much time, as his health wasn't all that great either.   Getting back to last night :  Needless to say, in light of Aunty Wendy's cancer, and the fact that she's not been well, my first thought was that she'd died - so soon - and I felt my stomach drop away. But... to my stunned surprise, it wasn't my aunt mum had the bad news about.  Sadly, something went wrong during the minor operation Alex was having, and he died while in recovery. Apparently he started having trouble breathing, and when they did a tracheotomy, he haemorrhaged and died. No one really knows why just yet, the hospital has to investigate. Aunty Wendy is devastated, needless to say.  The terribly sad thing is, that Aunty Wendy is dying herself, and now won't have her husband by her side in the difficult months to come, with whatever they might bring for her. She also lives in Tasmania, which is three states away from the rest of the family, so mum and dad can't be with her in the coming months. Something mum and dad are really feeling acutely right at the moment. My other two uncles (dad's brothers) live in Queensland, which is even further away. She does have a large circle of friends in Tasmania, though, so I really hope they'll stand by her in the coming months, and help her to get through this, and whatever else is to come. Aunty Wendy is a really strong lady, though, and I know she'll cope with this with her usual poise and strength.  But... what a truly terrible thing to happen, especially at such a time!     :o(    It was all a bit depressing, so I ate another few Oreos, drank my green tea with jasmine, watched the end of NCIS, and started to write part one of this three part blog for Sunday June 13, 2004.  More to come soon in: " Dark Days, Dark News, Dark Matters - Part 3 ".   :o)

       G'day from Australia folks! :o)   My name is Christine, and this is my very first time at attempting the blogging world. I figured it was time to join in, as there always seems to be so much going on in my brain these days and maybe having a web blog is a good way to express myself.  Before I go on, I'd like to thank both  Vicki Ecker  and  Don Ecker  (of UFO Magazine, USA -  urlLink www.ufomag.com/blogs.html ) who have been a truly great inspiration to me for creating my own personal Blog Spot, through reading theirs... especially Vicki's.   Thank You both! :o)    I'd also like to thank  Dwight Schultz  as well, whose passion and conviction when expressing his feelings and opinions on any given subject is so great, so awe-inspiring and so wonderfully inspirational!   Thank you, Dwight! :o)    I've called this first set of 3 postings " Dark Days, Dark News, Dark Matters " for very valid reasons, which will reveal themselves as you read my post. I've had to split it into three parts as it turned out longer than I thought it would. Below here is Part 1, just for now, and I'll try to do Part 2 tomorrow and Part 3 as soon as I can get it finalised.   DARK DAYS     The Light shines in the darkness And the darkness has never put it out!     John 1 : 5  (The Good News Bible - The New Testament, Gospel of John)   PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN   It's been a sad week in world affairs, especially with the death and burial of former  urlLink President Ronald Reagan  last week. I've been thinking a lot about him this past week, and about my life during the years he was in office.  In 1981, when Ronald Reagan first stepped into the office of President, I was only 14 years old, or thereabouts, and an Australian born resident and citizen, so the Reagan years sort of passed me on by, really. I knew of him, of course I did. I remember back then feeling curious and intrigued that a Hollywood actor had become the President of the USA. Impressed also. I didn't really think about his politics much at all, it never really occurred to me to do so.  Australians, especially the media, are not usually all that tolerant of politicians in general, and American or British ones in particular. The press here has often had scathing things, or satirical things, to say about US Presidents and British Prime Ministers, as well as our own Prime Ministers over the years. President Reagan was no exception to that trend during his years in office. I grew up during the Reagan years surrounded by that sort of press propaganda, although a lot of it went over my head most of the time.  Then, last week, I spent a bit of time reading about President Reagan, and his time in office, and listening to some of his old archived speeches, and learning about those years. I also listened a lot during the week to the positive and respectful things people had to say about him on various US based radio programs.  Of special note to me were the wonderfully respectful and thoughtful things the following radio talk show hosts expressed about President Reagan, and I want to thank them for their inspiring and educational insights:  urlLink Dennis Prager  and  urlLink Michael Medved  on their respective radio shows on  urlLink KRLA870 , and also to Dwight Schultz & Don Ecker on their fabulous radio show,  urlLink Dark Matters  on  urlLink Reality Radio Network  on the internet. What all these men had to say was enlightening and educational, and it all made me not only think deeply about things, but to feel terribly sad as well. Sad, because there are so many things I never knew, and so much still to learn, and also to re-learn, about this great man and former President.  Some of President Reagan's speeches can be found  urlLink HERE  on the C-Span web site, and others can be found in  urlLink THIS  article on the CNN web site.   NANCY REAGAN   I want to say here that my heart goes out to Nancy Reagan. She's an amazing woman, who quite obviously loved and cared about her husband very deeply. Her grief at the interment ceremony in California was so vivid and so heartbreaking, I just cried. In fact, I can't help having tears in my eyes as I write this, and see the image in my head of her children holding her and comforting her at that moment of parting with her husband for the final time. I've not yet in my life had to feel the deep loss and grief of losing a husband, but I have felt the deep loss and grief of losing those I love, and my heart and my soul simply aches for her at this time.  When I think of what Nancy Reagan did for Ronald Reagan, of how she stood by him, and nursed him and cared for and loved him to the end of his days, my soul aches for the pain she's going through now, and for the days she has ahead of her as she strives to deal with her grief and her loss. I extend to her my deepest, deepest condolences, my thoughts and my prayers.   THE PRESIDENTIAL FUNERAL CEREMONY   The funeral ceremony in Washington DC for President Ronald Reagan was just magnificent. It was the most beautiful, most amazing, quite incredible service I've seen in a long time. It was extremely moving, and by the end I was moved to tears by the touching respect and glorious music throughout the service. It was a fitting and appropriate send off for a well loved and truly great man.  I haven't yet watched the interment ceremony in California (it wasn't aired on Australian TV, sadly) beyond seeing the various clips featured on our news programs down here. They showed a lot the clip of Nancy and her children by the coffin; a snapshot which makes my heart deeply ache. I plan and hope to catch up to the entire service on C-Span on the internet during the week, and will come back with some thoughts, probably.   A PERSONAL RETROSPECTIVE   My grandmother, on my mother's side, suffered from progressive dementia and cancer of the bladder. She ultimately died of cancer in December 1996.  I'd lived with my grandmother for almost eleven years, and in the final years of her life helped to nurse her, until the day she died. I don't like thinking too much about the night grandma died (at home). It was terribly confusing and traumatic. She died in my arms, to my absolute horror at the time. The anger I felt afterwards was so strong... too strong in many ways... and then the grief that followed... I can't even express...  To see someone you love, especially with all of your heart, suffering and in pain. To watch them dying by slow degrees day after day. To feel that helplessness of knowing that there is little or nothing you can do to prevent their slide down to the end. To feel anger at God for stealing away the last precious years of a wonderful life, from a wonderful person. To learn to forgive not only yourself, but God also. To learn to finally let go, and let God take care of your shattered heart and soul... all of that journey can be soul destroying.  Having said all that, I'm a better person for the experience, and if I had the chance to go back to that point where I made the decision to stay on with my grandmother, I'd still make the same choice. I might do some things a little differently to what I did, but I'd still stay with grandma. She needed me, and I wasn't going to abandon her in her time of greatest need. I loved her too much for that. I learned many valuable things about myself during those years, and they changed me in many ways. It was a getting of wisdom. A re-birthing of the soul.  Let me leave this blog here, just for now, with the following verses from the bible:    Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.     1 Corinthians 13 : 4 - 8   (The Bible, the New Testament - New International Version)  (* Note :  1 Corinthians Chapter 13  in its entirety is actually the full scripture. The above verses are just a part of it, but really the entire chapter is relevant to my blog here).    God Bless you and keep you always, Mrs. Reagan!!!

                  I have this theory - either I'm in the process of building up one heck of an immunity, which will keep me wonderfully free of colds and flues and so on for the next several years... or... I've seriously annoyed someone 'up there'...      It has to be one or the other, I figure.      Personally, I hope it's the former, but... one never can tell...  * grin *       Yes, I have it AGAIN - the Dreaded Lurgi or, to be more precise, the FLU, to be a little clearer with my word choice.      I'm not sure where the expression Dreaded Lurgi came from originally. A couple of popular radio personalities here in Australia used to use it to describe the Flu, or anything of a similar nature, on a morning breakfast show I tuned into regularly many years ago now...  :o)       Back in May I had the Flu pretty bad, thanks to a girl who sat next to me at the office. It spread from her to three other members of the department, before striking me down. It took me three or four weeks to fully get rid of that. Then a couple of weeks back I was hit with a Kidney infection, which left me ill for about five days, and took just over a week to clear up, mostly... and then... and then... aaarrrggghhhh...  :o)  a guy I've been working closely with in the office picked up the flu, and passed it back to me mid last week, and my poor immune system, which had been badly weakened already, couldn't cope. Within a day, I was sick again, only this time... Bronchitis, or to be more accurate, an upper and lower respiratory tract infection.      Oh... joy to the world!  :o)       I didn't go to work today - I spent most of the day wishing my ribs and head didn't hurt so much when I coughed. That and feeling really, really, really guilty about taking a day off, especially when we are so very busy and understaffed.  * sigh *   :o(       Anyway, I've decided to play the "Pollyanna Glad Game".      Things to be 'glad' about (thankful for):-      It's just the flu, after all - it will go away.      It's not West Nile Virus - so I will survive.      It's not Mad Cows Disease - so I'm not going to go any more insane than I already am.      It's not Cancer - I will actually live.      In fact - it's not any life threatening disease.      It's not even Pneumonia.      It's JUST the FLU!!!      Get over it!!!   :o)       Of course, having said all this, I have wondered from time to time why no one actually ever clobbered Pollyanna whenever she played the 'glad game'.  * grin *  :o)        But, that's enough moaning from me...  :o)       And... if I might steal a phrase from Michael Medved...        Upward and Onward !!!   :o)       More soon...      Christine...  :o)    Sydney, Australia      July 26, 2004

      Actually, my Birthday was back on  APRIL 26 , however, last week I received a lovely belated Birthday gift from my younger sister,   Pauline  .  In the fabulous little package from my sister were three CDs.   1 ).    Music from the Motion Picture Gladiator    2 ).    More Music from the Motion Picture Gladiator    3 ).    The Passion of the Christ original Motion Picture Soundtrack   All of these soundtracks were on my most wanted list, so it was really wonderful to receive them.  Sadly, I haven't had a chance to listen to any of them at this point, though, as I've been a bit sick since last Wednesday with an infection, so haven't been in the mood to listen to anything much, (although, I DID listen to the Dark Matters radio show this week - July 11 - which was excellent as always). However, I plan to remedy that in the next few days, as I'm really looking forward to hearing these musical scores.  Soundtracks from movies are a particular love of mine, the more powerful, the better, musical score wise.   :o)   I also like those with rock 'n roll oriented soundtracks as well, and those with soundtracks featuring music from the mid to late sixties through to the early to mid seventies, in particular.  There was also a cute card in the parcel featuring a picture of a big fluffy grey and white dog lying in the grass, and a little bird sitting on a blade of grass near its head.    Written in it is :     To Dear Christine, Happy 30th(?) Birthday (we're the same age now - they always mistook us for twins?) Enjoy!! Don't go deaf!! Lots of love, your loving (choke, cough) sister, Pauline. xxxx 2004.     History :  My sister is 11 and a half months younger than myself, (she was 36 in 2004, I was 37 in 2004 - both of us were born in April - Pauline on the 6th, myself on the 26th), and as kids we were more or less the same height and size as each other, although Pauline's hair is darker than mine.  When we were little kids, Mum also loved dressing us in the same outfits when we went out - usually of different colours, but of the same cut and style. So people often thought we were fraternal twins. As we grew older, of course, we objected to the practice of the same outfits, and that all changed, naturally.  We were also in the same year at school for a little while, until the school decided to keep Pauline back a year because they thought she was too young for the higher year, even though she was having no trouble with the lessons at all, and is in fact the most intelligent of all us three girls in our family. Go figure, huh?! Having said that, it actually worked out better in the long run, though, as Pauline made lots of great friends in the lower year, some of whom are still good friends with her right up to this day.  Anyway... and the whole " 30 " thing...? * grin * Well, that's a bit of an in-joke of mine, really. Every year on my Birthday when people ask me how old I'm turning, I always say...   30  . So far no one (yet) has laughed hysterically at the response, although I suspect that eventuality is not far off - I might have to raise it to " 35 " soonish.   :o)    LOL >  I don't tell people I'm 30 in order to hide my age - as I have no problem with people knowing how old I am. It's simply that I have a bit of a strange, off-beat, sometimes obscure sense of humour. Usually I wait to see if people will realise I'm pulling their leg and if the penny drops first, and then I'll tell them my true age. I tend to especially tell this to those people I've been saying it to for some years, who've forgotten for the moment what I told them the previous year. * LOL * That's always fun. I do look at least several years younger than my chronological age, anyway, although I feel about a hundred years old sometimes.     :o)     Going deliberately off track now..:   There was some great music on the   urlLink Dark Matters   radio show again this week - but I can't place all the musical scores. Although they are familiar. It was a treat hearing Sergeant Pepper's, from the Beatles, though - as I'm a huge Beatles fan from way back.   :o)     Anyway, that's all!   :o)     Christine    The Land Down Under

       HAPPY 4th of JULY, 2004!!!   To all my American friends, and to all American's everywhere, from an Australian, I'd like to wish you all a very, very...    HAPPY, PEACEFUL & REFLECTIVE 4th of JULY!!!       May God Bless you all !!!  :o)     Here below is a picture I found depicting the flag raising by American's at   urlLink Iwo Jima   during World War II.  In light of the War in Iraq, and in honour of all the brave young men and women who are serving over there, and who are risking, or have lost, their lives for their respective countries in that conflict, I thought this photo would be an appropriate tribute to their courage.    urlLink        urlLink http://www.iwojima.com/raising/l721flag.gif     urlLink http://www.iwojima.com     This 4th of July...  Let's remember those who are giving their lives to make ours better and safer.  Who are giving their lives to help make those of the Iraqi people better and safer.  Remember our armed forces personnel.  Regardless of our political leanings, they deserve all of our honour, and all of our respect, wherever in the world we come from.  For those of us who don't serve, or who have never served in the armed forces, we need to, even if just for a moment, put ourselves in the place of those who do and have...  Could we be as brave?  Would we?  Whichever way our feelings fall in regards to the war in Iraq. Whether we support the war in full, or in part, or are against it. Whatever we think and feel... please let's all come together to respect, honour and acknowledge all the courageous men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and any other part of the world, for their commitment to us, to our countries, and to the world at large.  Salute them!  I know that I do, and always will!    Christine   An Aussie, from the Land, not so far, Down Under!   :o)    July 4th, 2004

       DARK MATTERS     There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable...  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.    Quote:    urlLink Douglas Adams .  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series).   At last, here is the final part to this posting. I can't believe it's taken me so long to get this finalised.  This is on to a much lighter note now!  Why have I called this  Dark Matters ...?  Well,  Dark Matters  is a fabulous radio show that airs via  urlLink Reality Radio Networks  every Saturday night between 8 pm and 11 pm PST (California time) in the USA, or, 11 pm to 2 am EST in the USA. It can also be heard via Satellite, for those with a link up via that method.   urlLink  Dark Matters   is hosted by two great guys called,  Don Ecker  (Director of Research for  urlLink UFO Magazine , past host of UFOs Tonite and Strange Daze radio shows) and  Dwight Schultz  (Former co-host of the Strange Daze radio show, star of The A-Team [Captain H.M. "Howling Mad" Murdock], Star Trek The Next Generation & Voyager [Lieutenant Reginald "Reg" Barclay], as well as featuring in many other TV shows, and movies, etc.)  Here's an advertisement for the show:-       The show is basically, in a nut shell, about whatever it is the guys want to talk about. Most particularly, things that aren't generally touched upon by the mainstream media, especially those things that could be construed as "Dark Matters", or those stories often over looked by the mainstream media.  Topics have included, for example: UFOs and Ufology, the paranormal, serial killers, remote viewing, science, technology, advances in outer space, Mars, Saturn, politics, religion, the war in Iraq, terrorism, and much, much more.  You can also phone in (wherever you are in the world) and e-mail the show with questions and opinions.  Every show is a surprise each week, unless they have a special guest coming on, in which case Don usually announces it ahead of time, but even then the conversation with the guests can go anywhere.   *(Note: I'll add in a list of some of the past guests soonish)*   Those who are interested in the  Dark Matters radio show  can also catch up to past episodes of the show care of Steve Melching's   urlLink Archive On Demand   for a subscription of about US$7 per month. Or, you can purchase tapes and CDs of the shows. The CD's come with a full month worth of shows. You can find out more about the Dark Matters tapes and CDs and Archive On Demand from   urlLink Steve Melching  , who handles the archives and the sale of the archived shows.  There's also a web site (created by Cynthia Boris) for the radio show called   urlLink Dark Matters Radio  , as well as an internet forum/companion (also created by Cynthia) for the radio show at Yahoo Groups at  urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Dark_Matters , where people can discuss the topics raised on the show each week, as well as other assorted dark matters.  I started listening to  Dark Matters  back at the end of February, but it's actually been going since January 10, 2004. Why I wasn't listening from the beginning is a bit of a convoluted story.  You see, rampant forgetfulness had a lot to do with it, as did a measure of being a trifle thick. All my own fault. I saw the show advertised last year on a  urlLink web site devoted to Dwight Schultz , and was really excited to hear about it, as it sounded like a wonderful opportunity to hear Dwight talk about his interest in UFO's, etc., as that was something I had been wanting to experience for a little while. Then I thought,  but how can I listen here in Australia, when the show is all the way over there in the USA?  In other words, I omitted to read the fine print that said, "available on the internet at..." DUH!!!   :o0   So, anyway, I was a bit of a sad vegemite (person), for a bit, thinking I'd never get to hear the show myself.  Meanwhile,  urlLink Cynthia Boris  (Mistress of the Dark Matters) also did post e-mails about the advent of the show on a couple of the A-Team fan fiction forums I'm subscribed to, as well as on Mig's   urlLink Dwight Schultz forum   at Yahoo Groups, and I did read the notices and file them in the special folders I have to store emails I want to keep from each forum.  Unfortunately, I had some health problems in January and February, and between that, and an extremely hectic workload, I didn't get back in to look at any of those archive folders at the emails I'd saved, in order to refresh my memory for what was there... and... well...  Actually, come to think of it... there really isn't any valid excuse at all, is there, really?     :o(   Guess, the main thing is that I am listening now, and enjoying it all very much indeed. I have also purchased CDs of the shows I've missed. It's not quite like listening to them live, but it's been fun catching up to the missed shows, that's for sure.  The day I first listened to the show, on February 21, Cynthia had posted a message to the Dwight Schultz Yahoo Group, while the show was airing live, saying that Dwight had just been talking on the show about meeting Franne (Purple Gimp) from Israel.  Franne had the great good fortune to meet Dwight at a convention in England in mid February. Dwight was talking on the show about that convention, what he'd been doing, and the people he'd met there, and was astounded and delighted that someone had come all the way from Israel just to meet him.  Cynthia also provided the link to the Dark Matters radio show at Reality Radio Networks in her posting. By some stroke of luck, I was online woking on my computers when the post popped up on Mig's Dwight Schultz forum, so I hopped right on over to Reality Radio Networks, managed to fire the connection up, and so was able to listen to the last half of the show.  That show aired on February 21, 2004 and I've been listening ever since!   :o)    Not only have I enjoyed the show very much, it's also been very educational. I think I've learned more about the world, about politics in the USA, about UFOs, in fact about a great many things in the six months I've been listening to the show, than I have in my lifetime, or, at least, in many years, anyway.  I've also read books I might never have considered before, and broadened my horizons considerably.   urlLink Richard M. Dolan's   "  urlLink UFOs and the National Security State Chronology of a Cover-up, 1941-1973 (Volume 1)  ", is one such book I'm currently reading, which was discussed by Don and Dwight. Richard was also a guest on the show as well one week, (February 28, 2004), and is a very impressive man to listen to. This book of his is well informed, well researched and put together, and very intelligent as well  I'm now also listening to the radio programs for   urlLink Dennis Prager   and   urlLink Michael Medved  , that air each weekday on   urlLink KRLA-870  . Two people I didn't even know existed before Dwight read, aloud on the Dark Matters show one week, portions of an  urlLink article written by Dennis Prager . Now I listen to the radio programs from both these gentlemen as much as I can manage. I find them very enlightening as well. I don't always agree with everything Dennis and Michael have to say, but pretty much most of their views coincide with my feelings on any number of issues, etc.  There's this, and there's more, but that's enough waffling from me... for now.   :o)    Besides... I have other things I want to get onto talking about... such as the fact that we appear to live in a world gone mad, helped along by a largely dominating liberal (left wing) mainstream media, who seem to have forgotten who the bad guys actually are... but, that's another rant, for another time... although, hopefully sometime soon!  See ya!  :o)     Christine... :o)   (of the Land, not too far, Down Under!   :o)   )
