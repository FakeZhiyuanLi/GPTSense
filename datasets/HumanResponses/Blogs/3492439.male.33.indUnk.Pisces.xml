      Remember when you were a kid and you envisioned a life of unfettered freedom and adventure when you grew up and were able to do whatever you wanted!  Well, usually something happend along the way that derails those grand concepts and pulls our soaring thoughts of adventure and freedom to a screeching crawl. Adulthood becomes a routing of working for all-too-often unsatisfying jobs simply because we need a paycheck to pay for this thing called life.  Well, not specifically life itself, but the trappings therein-- houses, cars, food, utilities, clothes, and perhaps a boat if you are lucky.  And oh yeah, and that's not even considering the child equation which is a veritable money abyss in its own right! hehe At any rate, we work to support all these things which we consider to be "our life."  It's odd how our identity becomes completely dependent upon, in many cases, these jobs that we do to support these lives of ours.  I mean, without the job that brings the paycheck there is no house, no car, no paying the utilities, and sure as hell no nice boat or mid-life crisis Corvette!  If we dislike our jobs, we feel hollow that what we do not like (or hate in some cases) what has paid for all this stuff and it kind of feels meaningless. So, what do we do,  go out and aquire MORE stuff to assuage those empty and hollow feelings.  In turn, ensnaring us further in the trappings of these "machine" jobs to stay afloat and pay for all these "things"  It is truly a vicious circle!  In college I remember reading an article for a psychology class that referred to this syndrome in respect to employees a many meat packing plants.  The work, cutting and viscerating carcass after carcass is such horrible and mind-numbing work that the companies compensated (read: kept the employees attached to empty, mind numbing jobs) by doling out relatively high wages that would allow the employees to buy nice luxury items like the boats and cars to assuage the emotional emptiness induced by their "machine" jobs. Well, when you think of it,  aren't many of us in that very position?  We work for huge, impersonal companies which lack emotion and true humanity, and we perform often mind numbing and dull jobs. We are trapped, trapped in a machine that knows we are hooked and can't leave because we need to pay for those wonderful "things" in life.  Why do you think jobs check employees credit reports? (they do, not all, but many).  If a company sees that an employee has accrued large sums of credit debt they know the employee will not be in a position to leave their job.  Thus, the company does not have to offer any liberal annual pay raise at evaluation time because it is almost a given that a severely indebted person will not leave their job.. And again, the machine has us.    So, what do we do?   I am not sure.  I can tell you this, however. I was once considered "homeless" when I lived in Las Vegas after I lost my apartment and resorted to living in a tent along the beautiful shore of Lake Mead.  As I camped out in a small tent I had very few possessions, all of which fit in my 1984 Mazda RX7!  As I watched the sunsets dance across the lake and ate what little I could scroung together for food,  I felt amazingly happy, for I was free from the entanglements of the civilized world-- rent, bills, car payments (my car was all mine!), mortgage.  Few people would consider those conditions admirable or desireable,  but I can tell you there is a tremendous feeling of liberation in the elemental life..  Enjoy  :-)

      It's been raining a lot here in Rochester this spring.  I probably shouldn't really bitch because according to the Weather Channel and other portals of weather insight, it looks like a lot of the U.S. has been besieged by curiously turbulent weather thus far in the spring of 2004.  Unfortunately for Rochestarians, every weekend since the end of winter has had atleast one rainy  day, with many weekends a complete rainout.  I swear, we have even had a few weekends where the rest of NY is completely dry, but a mass of rain hangs right over our area (Rochester and the 'burbs) and kicks out the perpetual sogginess.  I pull out clumps of hair when I look at the weather radar and see those seemingly chronic green blobs right over our area.  Yeeees! It was so rainy last weekend that the port-o-potty used by the builders in our new housing development started to float off it's little wooden skids to ala smelly Noah'a ark!    The dampness is so persistent that my poor little garden gnome has developed a nasty case of athletes foot.  It's crazy, man. But, alas there is hope, or a chance of hope.  This weekends forecast was calling for TWO nice days of weather.  However, late this afternoon I heard that yet another  mysterious storm system (this time from the south.  Thanks Dixie folk!)  MAY encroach on us yet again.  For the sake of my garden gnomes fungus laden ceramic feet,  and the poop-ark,  I hope we are rain free!  We'll see...

      After admiring them for 15 years, I picked up a Mazda Miata this past March.&nbsp; It's an old bugger, a 1992, but one of the BEST first generation Miata's built (because mechanical problems of the first few years were resolved with resounding success!). After a few years of getting to know each other,&nbsp; I can say that I really love the little car.&nbsp; I hope it's not too bothered by my presence because I have been spending a lot of time with my butt plastered in that dang driver seat! A few years back I had a 1980 MGB and when I drove the Miata I was instantly amused by the familiar feel, except in a more refined (read: reliable) nature.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, the old Miata still bumps and shudders over rough pavement and railroad tracks,&nbsp; but it has a distinctly "connected" feeling while driving.&nbsp; The car is elemental and mechanically simple which lends itself to the similarities to my old MGB.&nbsp; Not to mention the gauges, replete with the old familiar green gauge lights,&nbsp; harkens back to the little British beast.&nbsp;  Driving this car makes me feel like I am in a little ski boat speeding across the water, except of course,&nbsp; I am on land&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a really cool feeling to have that top down and the breezes against your face, especially on a nice clear night of driving.&nbsp; If you have never experienced driving a little convertible roadster, definitely try to put that on your "list" of things to do in life if you can, you won't regret it.&nbsp; I know that crusing along on a back country road is on my short list of FAVORITE sensory experiences in life!  Go cruising&nbsp; and have fun&nbsp; :-)

      DNC is in full swing this week and what&nbsp;I have heard only reinforces my intent to vote Kerry/Edwards-- Coherent concepts of balancing and preserving military strength while using is PRUDENTLY,&nbsp;&nbsp; eliminating tax cuts for businesses that aggressively ship American jobs overseas (while providing tax benefits for businesses which preserve and grow American jobs),&nbsp; and pursue the restoration of American pride and respect amongst our global neighbors.&nbsp; These are sane, coherent ideas that make sense to any reasonable person.&nbsp; These are ideas that make sense to me. It's time for George Bush to leave.&nbsp; He stole the office of presidency,&nbsp;&nbsp; did not execute the responsibilities of the office in a reasonable manner, and continues to propagate lies concerning John Kerry and the democrat contenders.&nbsp; It's time to kick the bum out. I hope anyone reading this will investigate the concepts and principles of Kerry/Edwards and embrace the cause to restore America!  &nbsp;
