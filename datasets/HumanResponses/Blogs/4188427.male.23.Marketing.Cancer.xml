      Hello there. I’m sorry to those who have been following my blog for the delay in updating. I was a bit busy for a few days handling a few cases that was really tiring to settle. Now I have the time to continue this blog. My friend has just return from his trip and he says that his hometown in Alor Setar , Kedah already have a broadband connection. He was dissatisfied with the broadband provider in our area for we only received negative statements from their customer relation department. I’m saying department because every time we asked someone at their dealership we were given the following answers:  1.	We cannot confirm. 2.	Where is that ? 3.	I don’t know. 4.	come back at a later hour.  When we call them up on their customer service line we also get the same answers. I do think they have rehearse it pretty well.  On to something on a lighter side. Yesterday I was on leave so I went for a little shopping trip with my brother. I’m thinking of buying a new pc coz my old one is already on the verge of giving up. The options that is there in the pc market today is remarkable unlike the time when I first bought my pc. I’m thinking of getting an AMD XP processor running at  3.2GHz with 512MB DDR RAM, ATi 9200 SE 256MB DDR graphic card, 160GB 7200 rpm hard disk (Samsung) ,combo drive and writer 21 inch monitor and all of that just to play Doom 3. J  Ok enough rambling for today tomorrow is a different story.  Until then happy day to you

      By that i meant my pc.After a thorough reformatting and installation of Windows ME my pc is up and running.It's a bit slow , maybe because of the anti-virus, firewall,spy scanner and adware scanner that i have installed.I'm currently downloading the current windows update because my accounting program is still wonkey.i hope that the update will fix the problem. The weather here is bad today it rained and i was caught in it while riding my bike. i'm typing this blog shivering for my job only ends in a few hours time.Life goes on i guest. yesterday i did what i think the longest working hour that i have ever done in this field since i accepted to go into this occupation.I did a 12 1/2 hour work marathon and i'm really tired this morning when i woke up.On thursday that is on the 19th i will be going to Ipoh for i'm needed there to take care of a few things.

      I’m fighting a losing battle with the virus. All of the anti virus program that I have used were defeated in their quest of eradicating my pc from the virus which I now think is maybe a new variant of the avril-lavinge virus. I have dug up information on the original virus it has the same traits except that the one that infected my pc has additional execution code. I’ll be sending a sample file to Symentec for a review and hopefully a fix or update of virus definition for Norton anti virus. I’m thinking of reformatting my pc so that I could start a fresh. It has been a long day for me and I’m really tired by now. Tonight I will be resting and backing up my hard disk. I’m trying to find any files that were not damage by the onslaught of this virus. Thank you for reading. Have a pleasant day.

      I'm a computer literate person but today i've think i've done the most stupidest thing that someone like me shouldn't do. I accidently let the avril lavinge virus into my pc. Without an anti-virus my pc is good as dead.Tomorrow i'll bring my emergency hard disk to work to repair the hard disk that was infected.Now i'm using another pc in my office to write down this blog.According to Trend Micro's homepage the avril lavonge virus is still a threat to a lot of pc.It disabled my anti virus program ,spyware scanner and pop up blocker by deleting the .exe files of the programs and disabling the regedit function of windows.I'm really angry at myself :( it also block the accouting program i'm using by asking me to allow it to update my activeX files.I really hope Windows will come up with longhorn faster or they will lose a user for i'm alredy thinking of getting an apple pc either be it the imac range,ibook,powerbook or the power pc.i've tried using an apple pc before and i've been to a few conferences and i am impress by the attitude and working ethics of Apple Computer.They listen to their customers and incorperate the tools and updates that eases the customer to use their OS unlike Microsoft that forces user to use features that are (a)not user friendly (have ever tried to arrange your songs in Windows Media Player 9),(b)ugly(try to make a good presentation using Office Powerpoint) and last but not least nobody want to use (here an example,My Briefcase). Compare to Mac OS X (it's pronounce Mac OS ten) Microsoft Windows do look dated and sad to say it, it's totally crap. That isn't even geting close to the reason i'm so angry with windows.Why can a company that suppplies almost 90% of the world operating system to computer can't even update their operating system before a weakness in their system is being exploited by those who just love wreaking havoc on other windows users.It as if the staff at Microsoft only works when there is a weakness that is reported to them and if there isn't any then they just sit back and wait. About longhorn the heralded replacement to the win9x family,it is expected to arrive in 2006-2007 and that is still 3 years to go.It is said that longhorn boost better security features,a much friendlier user interface,a more stable enviroment and blah,blah,blah like i haven't heard of it before everytime i upgrade mi windows or reinstalling it because it deleted it himem.sys file by itself. For the upgraded features you would have to own a 4GHZ pc.Yes i didn't type it wrong it needs a 4GHz pc with at least 512 MB of RAM.That means the rest ofus who couldn't afford a $GHz pc will not be able to enjoy the so called improvement of the new WIndows Operating system.What a cruel world. I think i will be paying a visit to the Apple store near my workplace in a few days. until then thank you for reading and take care till we blog again.

      Hello again. It has been a terrible morning for me for I’ve had another fight with mum. Sometime I feel like moving out of the house but there are things that wouldn’t let me to. I’m already 23 have a good job and she still treats me like a pre-school kid. On to more bad news. I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression. The doctors have prescribed me medication but they say medicine can only go so far and the real cure would be inside myself. If this condition keeps going on I think I may just end up in an asylum. If that happens I will be happy cause I know in there I will never be able to hurt anyone. Last night dinner with my friends have confirm and came up to some palatable solutions to my problems. My problem is I’m really bad with approaching some one that I am fond of and telling her that I love here. I’m trying collect enough courage to ask her to come back to me. With the support of all of my friends I’m going to Terengganu and ask her to accept me back. Some of you may called it lame but I just can’t lose her for I fear the same thing will repeat again just like it did with Erda.  It’s really noisy in the office today because there are some construction work going on beside my cubicle. I’ve put my headphones and crank up the volume listening to Pachabel – Kanon in D dur. The song opens up in a very dark and sad  kind of sound but it moves up to a more cheerful mid and ending. I'm going for lunch now i hope anyone who reads this blog will give me a comment i really appreciated it.

      My boss have left Malaysia on his way to China for a business deal. I’m in charge now and what a day it has been today. I had to settle a few unofficial duties this morning but nothing to difficult except that my boss gave me the wrong directions and I spent about 2 hours just to find the bank. Yesterday evening my mother handed me a letter address to me that she received earlier today. It was about my study loan. Apparently it is time for me to pay up. I didn’t have a grudge about it only that I didn’t finish my studies before and I thought the loan had been canceled. Guess I thought wrong. So I went to the bank just to check up on the account and I found out that the balance of the loan was there sitting in the account gathering interest for all these years. The amount was ok I guess.             It has been raining for the past hour now. Not a downpour only drizzling the type of rain that I hate because it causes the road to be very slippery. I’m having dinner with a few of my friends. We have some matters that need immediate attention to be discuss. I’m getting tired. Today was a hectic day and tonight will be along one. I hope that I can be financially independent one day so that I don’t have to worry where to find money and just worry where to spend it. J
