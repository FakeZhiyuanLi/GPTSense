      I havent been on here in awhile..been pretty busy. I guess. But not really like i have a life. hahah obviously not if im sitting here at 12 19 am and on a friday night. I hate my life. all my other COOl friends are probably hooking up in bars. im sitting here just counting the cars. not that cars come down my road very much but if they did i would probably go count them. but instead im sitting here"on the couch" watching the the south park reflection on my dave matthews poster. bored off my ass. but high so. its ok. im thinking about watching my Ryan Adams DVD..he is the greatest man...besides ive seen the episode of south park already...not exactly fun...nothing much is very funny these days ..not really sure why..i have grown accustomed to being depressed..which isnt a good sign...but it gets old just putting on this mask thinking everything is ok. but deep down you really want to do is scream your head off...am i practicing good self control or is it that i am slowly hurting myself until i cant fall anymore and lash out irrationaly at the closest person near me at the time of 15 yrs of aggression, resentment, hostility come out..God I hope not. better off to keep it to myself..because most of the time its me at fault not anyone else and it sucks...im tired of being at fault..or thinking im at fault..and even when im probably not at fault i feel like i am because of been raised by a person which did no wrong and I was always at fault no matter what. im 24 yrs old and im still always at fault. on a brighter note Ryan Adams is the greatest.   Go on little girl feet twirl, go and make him smile, go on like the rumbling drums in the march of time and when the father meets the dad it was be something better for the pain. But you will always be the same  --Ryan Adams  Tomorrow is another day Hopefully it wont end this way Im tired of being alone and sad and having to pretend i am glad  Maybe one day it will be a diferrent way I dont know hopefully soon Kind of like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon Pretty as can be One day that will be me.    So ya never know Keep your head up, just go with the flow. Next time you will run the show and dictate how it will go  i dont know rambling on.

      Before the curtain finally closes The last scene of the night Ill take my bow  the lights go dim and exit stage left Now you are the only one left  while you are picking up the roses pick up my heart  i think i left it right from the start maybe it was closer to act 3 i dont know who cares which one it could be Its all over  Before the curtain finally closes Ill take my bow As the lights go dim I exit stage left You will be the only one left  I gave you all i had to give You just throw it back in my face Im sorry i wasnt good enough but making you happy was just too tough Im not taking all the blame for this curtain call Im not the only one at fault You had the starring role  As the crowd applauses your performance I take a bow  The lights go dim I exit stage left You are the only one left.  while you are picking up the roses pick up my heart  i think i left it right from the start maybe it was closer to act 3 i dont know who cares which one it could be Its all over  As the crowd applauses your performance I take a bow  The lights go dim I exit stage left You are the only one left.   (this is my TRYING to write)
