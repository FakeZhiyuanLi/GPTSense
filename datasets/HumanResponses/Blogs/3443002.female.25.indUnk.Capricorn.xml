      went to a yoga class on tuesday in monrovia.. didn't think much of it but then on wednesday my thighs were so sore! it's much better today though.. last night i made baby back ribs.. they were tender but a little too salty! next time i would definitely put less salt in the dry rub.. also made a pasta salad with corn and tomato which was actually really easy and good.. leaving for sf tomorrow morning bright and early!

      started going to 24 hour fitness in west covina last night.. it is much nicer than the one in pasadena downtown (aka the dungeon) and there's about 4x more machines.. the girl that was teaching the "hip hop" class wasn't that good though.. it felt more like aerobics but i guess we did get a good workout.. gonna try out pilates tonight!

      went to fry's yesterday to get some memory for alex's laptop.. the fry's in city of industry is surprising new and non-cheesy.. also got some napkins and gifts at target.. chilled at home reading in-style.. and then went to stone grill for dinner.. finally tried one of their steaks on the hot stone.. yes they put the slab of meat on a piece of really hot stone (much hotter than the sizzling platters) so it cooks while you are eating it  yum .. also had some borscht and ovaltine (instead of horlicks).. then went to speed zone for a few runs at the go-kart track and time crisis 3.. still love that game.. had my apple black tea at tea station with the best pearls.. soft yet chewy and slightly sweet.. too bad the tea kept me up pretty late!

      the ajisen ramen in san gabriel finally opened! it was super crowded but so yummy! i felt bad for the restaurant next door who had zero customers while ajisen had a line out the door with a 20-30 minute wait.. the waitresses and cooks were standing there looking to see what the deal was.. afterwards, we went across the street for dessert because hui lau shan was having a 99 cent special for their coconut sago.. MMM.. what a steal!
