      When you're out there looking for that perfect person keep these things in mind. People change, no matter how hard they try not to. As you grow older you mature, and with each new level of maturity come different ideas, different needs and wants. The person who was perfect for you at twenty could be the person you hate when you're thirty-five. You have to find someone who will grow with you, change with you, laugh with you and cry with you. A person who fills in where you lack, a person whom you can fill in for when they are lacking. But what about the perfect person, you ask? They do not exist. Even my bf  was not perfect because  There are no perfect people, only people who are perfect for each other.

      I had just gotten out of college and having my first job. I was working full time. One day I was standing at the reception chatting with my friend and I turned my head to see a man seating in the area. As I turned to ask my friend who he was, she told me that he is applying in the company.   Days passed and looks were exchanged from time to time, but nothing was said. Then one day he asked me, "Whats your name?" We started talking about life not knowing that my feelings for him began to grow. We both started to exchange e-mail and chat.. Later as days goes by, I ask him if we can have dinner or something? With a surprised tone he accepted my invitation. We went to a restaurant in the mall and talked for what seemed like forever. I havent felt love for him right away plus the fact that he was a man I didn't know anything about. As we started talking I looked into his eyes and realize hes such a nice person. After dinner he ask me if he can bring me home and its pretty fine with me... thats the first date? huh?  Shortly thereafter, we started to hang-out. We ended up in any places heheeh. . Sometimes, It was the weirdest thing though, we really didn't say much, but I walked away from that moment feeling like we shared a million words. It was fun being wiht him...   The next few days I was so nervous because I didn't know what to expect next. Then out of the blue he confessed to me that he "like"  me...  well...  I dont know how to react but I got flattered when I heard that.  He gave me a flower and in the card he wrote "take care! from fridays friend... " because our first date was in fridays..  My heart just grew so much love for him. I knew at that moment that he was a angel sent to me from above. Of course I had to go buy him something to show him just how much I cared for him. But I just dont know what to give.... and infact I dont want him to think Im beginning to like him.   It wasn’t but a few days later that Joel confessed his love for me, and the feeling was mutual. One night we talked and he told me everything about himself and that night I felt closer to him than ever before. In our conversation that night he told me he might be leaving soon because he has no reason to stay here... I told him not to... I am here.. I am his reason....  Our relationship kind of fell into place after that, and here we are months later more in love than ever. I still feel like I'm in a dream. As the days go by my thankfulness to God gets greater for bringing me what I can say with no doubt or regret, my soulmate forever.  Good things come to the those who wait. It's hard I know, everyone has had their share of lost love and heart break, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. My light’s name is Joel P. Tan. He has given me the strength and the belief that dreams do come true.  Cathy

      In the history of my life, he was my wheel, my Pearl Harbor, the bomb, my most important discovery. Even after two years, I could never take my eyes off him. I only ever look at the sky like that. "I want for nothing," I'd tell him. "You are the one," he'd tell me. We'd declare holidays for any reasons whatsoever - because it was Friday, because he'd gotten a bonus, because it was hot outside, because we simply deserved it, whatever. We'd hide like guilty children under the blankets when I would call the office to say I was ill. He'd try not to giggle and it felt like we were playing truant.   In the morning, we'd awaken, he'd sit up, cross his arms above his head and stretch, his back long to me, white sheets falling away from him like wrapper from an expensive jewellery box. Beyond him, the city rises towards the sun, and the blue sky, like him, stretches tall like the skyscrapers framed by the emerging morning. Oh I truly love it!!   It was difficult to say, "I love you". There is no greater commitment than in those three words. But, with him, I could tell it so many times. Other times when he was fast asleep and snoring gently, I'd tell him. I guess I couldn't stop myself from feeling it.   One time after making love, I lay on top of him. "Heavy?" I asked quietly. "Nah" he would say. Even if he doesnt know, It was one of the most exciting feeling in the world....   Looking back, I think about how funny it was the way we slept together. It's just that I didn't realize then how well we fitted into place. He took the right side of the bed and I took the left.   In most of my friends relationships, they would discuss which side each of them wanted. In more than some, they surrendered their preferred corner and rolled over to the other side. But with this us, it was never discussed. We simply fell into place. I wonder now if he noticed it.   On some nights, as I watched his sleep, silent save for his breathing, he would suddenly wake up, his arms finding me through the blanket and he would gently hug me as i roll over his side.  He set the standard to which every other man in my life was measured. And no one measured up. I'd miss him even while I was with him. Sure, there's the passion of the nuclear fusion between two people, and there's the happiness of times shared, and the excitement of discovery and rediscovery. But to be content is where it's truly at, like a cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows.   We never ran out of words, Even when we shared our fears. I feel the sensations that actually come with these conversations that enhance the quest for the search for someone..something. These little soirees of mind and body. This millieu of relationships and encounters of passions and understanding. A mutual "feel" of what is good and right for you and them. Feel the relationship. The affair. The conversation. The communion of the senses. Yours. His. Mine.   I could never replace this feelings anything in this world. And this is having him here with me...   CaThY
