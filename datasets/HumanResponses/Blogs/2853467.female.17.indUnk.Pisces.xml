      wow what a busy day i had! after school i went  home to drop mere off and then i had to come right back to wait in the traffic to get to band at 4. right after that i had to rush home and change for softball. i was about 45 mins late. lol. we lost our game anyway. make it, both our games. my team... is... not the greatest.  today i went to the special olympics assembly. it was very moving. i cry a lot in movies, but i didn't let the tears roll this time. almost did though.. came pretty close. but i didn't want anyone to think i should be up there. lol JK. heh.  my brand-spankin-new-marcy-made-word-of-the-day is..... llamasexual - a freak of nature attracted to llamas of the same and opposite sex.  joke of the day (before today) on same sex marriages: "God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve" -Erin Kirby  dream and i had an interesting convo today on if we can use curse words in our engilsh homework: DreamboatSupreme: Can we put curse words in the Catcher conversations? Marchica03: dream!? what a question Marchica03: i'll let you be the judge of that you dumbbunny Marchica03: *dumb@$$ Marchica03: you still love me?? DreamboatSupreme: Yeah. DreamboatSupreme: Seriously. [you know dream wants me] Marchica03: i think written cuss words could be held against you in a court of law.. or a parent-teacher conference DreamboatSupreme: Darn. DreamboatSupreme: I already wrote a lot. Marchica03: darn? Marchica03: how weak! DreamboatSupreme: How can you carry out a convo in CITR without a curse word? DreamboatSupreme: Seriously! [then i asked if she'd say something funny so i could quote her] DreamboatSupreme: I can't just come up with random funny comments. Marchica03: ahhh but see you are dream, almighty curser [this convo has been edited to protect the retards, uh conversationalists identities. i do plan on using dream's last comment against her in a court of law, aka school setting. lol]  anyways i love dream! thats what i wrote on the band room chalkboard next to nanana. i've never written on the board before. it was scary. i still haven't progressed to using the chalk yet but i'll get there. eventually. now i need to concentrate on the special olympics. no i am not an athlete. lol! i swear! i get to work in the tent. that implies shady, so i'm excited! woo hoo! no shutz and shade and hotdogs all in one day!!  i think i might go to Dracula tomorrow after i fix my grandma's computer. i hope its scary! (  well i'm gone like butter on waffles.

      hey sorry about neglecting you guys. i really do love you all.  anywho solo and ensemble saturday went great! when asked: "how did you do at S&E?" i said :"good" he siad: "you got a good? haha!" uhh no.. i got two superiors!! yay! for me and i think i'm going to state!! woo hoo! boy that will be nerve racking!!  well the rest of the week has been ok. tuesday i sat in and sightread with symphonic band. no sweat. today i had jazz band and we finally got to improv! yay!! and soon i have to leave to play with the church bands again.  i've decided that maybe i am a gamer at heart. i'm obsessed with spider and csi so i've been trying new games to satisfy me. i'm not to much into the space, futuristic kinda stuff. i like shoot em up, mystery kinda stuff. so if anyone knows of any good games for me to try out just email it to me. so far i've tried diablo, ace ventura. post mortem, and a few others i can't remember.  lately school has been getting a lot tougher!! ahh! in math, engineering, physics, history.... i dont think i can hold onto my As much longer.. and the stress is killing me! maybe thats why i'm becoming addicted to gaming. lol.  i heard a joke today. kinda cute: "If your car is bigger than your child's bus, then you know something's wrong" something like that i think. get it? the short bus? hehe we love carina. she rides the short bus!!! lol! its her buddy icon too.  well i'm using mozilla firefox and it rox, uhh rocks. hehe. there goes my preppiness sneaking out again.   the voices are gone now, so i'm gonna go. uhhh to myself: "is it ok if we stop blogging?" myself: "no never my precious, false, tricksy hobitses!!"

      ahoy thar maties! welcome to the land of no-math-homework! unfortunately i had some english and engineering homework to ruin my night. and thats the way the cookie crumbles.  it sure is late so i won't stay long. just wanted to leave you with some good yo mama jokes:  Yo mama's so poor she went to the Four Seasons but could only afford three. Yo mama's so fat she sat on a rainbow and skittles fell out. Yo mama's glasses are so thick that when she lookes on a map she can see people waving. Yo mama's so dumb, her favorite color is clear. Yo mama's so dumb, she thought a quarter back was a refund. Yo mama's so fat, that every time you smack her butt, you can ride the waves!  Yo mama's so fat, she's the reason they declared world hunger.   ok some of those we pretty corny, but you gotta laugh. i really do love my mama. she tries so hard and does everything for me. she buys my food and clothes and sooo much more.  at our softball game, this girl said the only reason she wore jeans over her uniform was because her mom told her not to. i said that's a retarded reason - i love my mama. she hates hers. i dont see how that is possible.... its kinda sad.. this girl and i continued to talk and she told me she doesn't think that giving birth is anything special - everyone can do it. ok now her ignorance was really pissing me off. its kinda sad that she doesn't appreciate what her mom does for her. i know her mom and she's pretty nice. i'm glad i love my mom. i really am.  alex came over today and we found a ton of voltures eating a huge dead turtle in our backyard down by the lake. like the sick pyscho i am, i took pictures. then we went out front and he showed me his new dirt bike!! sweet! it goes up to about 40 mph!! then he invited his friend Eli over to show us some skateboarding tricks. i can't skateboard for the life of me.  anyways yo mama's so dirty, she uses bleach to take a bath. good thing i used soap. lata playas.

      man i've played so much music today, its coming out my ears. or is that ringing a bad thing?  the engineering test was definitely not what i nor anyone else expected and i studied the wrong things...when i was studying i was like ahh those wont be on there, they are irrelevent to what we are doing, thats just extra info, the test will be to make sure we understand the concepts. boy was i wrong... hopefully i made above a C or maybe even a D... hehe  i wonder how people put their pictures on their mouse pads. i sure would like to know cuz i'm getting tired of looking at this stupid line of crows sitting on a telephone wire. very entertaining. yes indeed.  well i brought my electric guitar to youth ensemble practice for the first time. i really liked acoustic better cuz i could actually hear myself. adult ensemble was a big bummer cuz i had to leave early and didnt get to play much.  FYI : call me at WHYGOKU. its my home phone. or 9WINK8. or WHYINK8. i was bored. nuff said.  speaking of which... bored.com has some really cool links. that is if you are bored.   my kitty is so fat and cute! she looks really evil right now! you should see her. shes giving me that eye... *:shiver:*  sure am glad we haven't had history homework in awhile. probably just jinxed us didnt i?? hehe. i feel so guilty falling asleep in class, but everyone else was asleep too. except hogan.. predictable.  gee whiz sure has been fun talking to you. aren't you proud of my honest attempt to avoid the torture of studying for the math test? i think i will study soon with hopes to lessen the torture in the near future of actually taking the test.. and then failing... lol.  my fingers want to keep typing to stay warm, but my eyes are blurring out, so i'm gonna go hit the sack.  word to your mother, my home dog.

      ahh feels like monday, but alas, its not! tis sorrow that pains my heart.  thank the Lord today went by fast. and not so bad. i'm pretty tired. tomorrow is gonna be a big day for me though...  lets see.... well after school i usually would have jazz band, but they cancelled it, so i'll have brass choir instead. and then at church i have to play guitar for the youth ensemble and then bass for the adults. and then i get to go rehearse my solo with my pianist. thats a lot of music rehearsals for one day!!  i'm a little nervous about my solo because i haven't really practiced it too well. but i have faith that it will all come out okay in the end. and if it doesn't then life will still go on (and i will eventually marry a hot celebrity hunk!) i hope thats your philosophy too, minus the hunk part.  but even so, i really do like saying: doink. boink. donk. bong. yes, i am bonkers. hehe funny to say that too.  later bros or whoever-you-are-so-i-don't-come-off-as-offensive. :-b (that was a joke mere. i luv u and yes, you can take the credit for doink... alllllllrighty then?!)  peace out people

      opps, was yesterday valentines day? oh well! i woke up early for softball, then came home and took a nap around three and didn't wake up til nine this morning. i think this  18 hour nap   is new record for me and possibly the world. if my mom hadn't woken me up, i probably could have kept going. and honestly, this was the first time in awhile that i haven't fallen asleep during the sermon this morning. (i hope my mom doesn't read this...)  so anyways i did get a box of chocolates, earrings, and a ring. so it was cool and yet stagnantly typical. why do we even celebrate valentines day? ok yay some saint was special. is it really necessary to go all out for your loved one on one day? heck no! if you love that person enough, you should show them that everyday with the little things. i mean i know i would enjoy flowers and chocolate, but seriously what woman out there needs them to know she's loved? her hips don't need them and neither does the kitchen table.  my dad and i went shopping today! and i bought myself a 17" monitor! woohoo! and to go with it as an early birthday present a 256 mb 8x AGP graphics card!! you know you're jealous! sweet! i just told smarterchild. lets see what it has to say....  Marchica03: i just got a new monitor SmarterChild: You just got a new monitor? Ha!  Marchica03: makes you look fatter SmarterChild: Makes I look fatter. Funny.  you can always count on smarterchild to create some irony.  one female to another:  "MonkiePunkie: I LOVE VICKI. SHE'S MY LOVER" that would be my sister talking about vicki, her lover who is spending the night tonight! vicki hasn't spent the night the past few weekends so we've really missed her.  well, i'm not feeling so hot. allergies are really killing me since i didn't take my pills since i was asleep. ahh the price to pay for decent sleep.

      today sure was fun! TGIF!  we read our sonnets in english which was great fun despite my sonnets sucking. this was definitely the highlight of my day as we munched on junk food and candy. craig sniffen wins the award for greatest sonnet which is dedicated to his valentine, Mr. Schutz. craig cut out hearts and glued them to a pi, which was very appropriate. oh man this is great! read it:  "Sonnet 3.14159265358 by Craig Sniffen  This man is the exponent to my log. Michael Schutz, in the wind I hear his name. His cheerful face brings lights to the fog. With no other man I have felt the same  His conic sections are the bees knees. He swooned me with the words that he wrote. When he is near, my heart he frees. With great lust, I want his sweet asymptote.  The time is timeless, I want more. I want to see his major axis. Yet, different age of root one-forty-four. Our love would be scorned by the masses.  With his hair side-combed and his khaki slacks, When it comes to great men, he leads the packs. "  pardo deemed it unappropriate so he didn't read it all, but andrew recorded it and we should be able to watch it soon.  too bad i cant go to the talentshow. i have to go practice my solo with my pianist and then i'm off to babysit some kids. joy... lol they're cute.  slash, dash, and i'm out.

      ahh friday is so close i can smell it! i'm sure the thought just makes you giddy, doesn't it?  my sister found a some voltures tearing apart a really cute squirrel. i told her to wait and i'd grab the camera in a very sarcastic tone. and then she says: "yeah! put it on your website!" so thats what i plan on. lol. you can check out the pics probably sometime over the weekend. beware, its gory. she made me run around the neighborhood to take more pics of the dead squirrel!! we found some guts and fur on the ground and i took some fur as a souvenir but my mama made me toss it. lets make this clear though, she is the  SICK  one, NOT ME. lol ok it is me.  well today was the last time i'll ever "program" my schedule at Gaither! i know i'm overly sentimental, but i cant deny my true pyschoness.  well i did do something nice today:   babyphat3953: thank you so much marcy...you're my life saver!!!!!!!!!  oh yes i know, i taste like artificial fruit.  well i'm out like a fat kid in dodge ball. (thanks for the line vicki/mere)

      hey bros! do you ever wonder about the validity of fairytales? neither do i.  boy, schutzpoo is really having trouble copying the correct answers to the transparencies! how hard can it be? it's not like he's actually finding the latus recta of a hyperbola.  in english, i no longer sit with alicia so its a little boring. okay, incredibly boring. even if i still didnt understand all of alicia's jokes because of her massive vocab i still found them funny. (Alicia i miss you!!) and sonnets?! what do i know about love? how can i write a poem about something i've never really felt before?! man that class is whacked.  man history is pretty interesting. at least it is sitting next to jake. he always has something to say. and even if its not funny, its still funny. but man that class has a lot of work. i'm thinking aaa is giving us busy work just so it seems like we are in an AP class.  physics isn't bad. mea, you scare me and you entertain me. lol. (i told you i'd write it) i got all the questions right on the wkst, but i missed all on the back. pretty ironic because the back was easier.  i dont think most of the class will finish experiment 6 in engineering tomorrow. at least thats what i'm hoping since i know i can't finish it tomorrow.   computer electronics... that sure is an interesting class. nothing new to learn. they are taking the computers away from us because some of the parts are being stolen! how great is that?! "man i just stole 256 megs of some really slow @$$ memory! wonder if i can get a buck fifty for it!" i have to wonder if maybe the crappy stuff isn't being stolen at all. maybe mr. neely misplaced it! ha! that would be great!!  but it is sad that people would want to steal such wimpy memory and small hard drives.  my lesson of the day: learn how to say no to black people bumming rides off you.  unfortunately, i haven't learned it yet.

      Hey sometimes I wonder why people blog. Now I'm wondering why am I writing this?  Good Question...  And now I have to ask, why are you reading this??  Well, enough with the questions silly, you're reading cuz I have a lot to say and you know it's gonna be good.  Just got back from a softball game. Sadly but typically we lost. But hey, we played hard and I have two battle wounds to prove it.  School sucks. As usual. Although, I really, really, really enjoyed my hour and half nap. It was uncomfortable in that small stinky desk, but at least it was sleep. My sympathies go out to those stuck writing the FCAT thingy. hehe It's nice to be old.  Mea told me a good joke today. I have to remember to tell Nevsimal to add it to his collection:  "How many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?"  "None. It's a hardware problem."  I can't believe it's only Tuesday... I'm so ready for Friday. C'est la vie. And the music goes on. Or rocks on. Which ever you prefer. (Name that song! Represent, DC fans!)  Thanks for reading my very first blog. Yes, I know, it's a bore. Did I ever tell you you're my hero? hehe (If you can name that one, I salute you.)

St. Peter replied, 'It's based on what you've done. when you preached, people slept. when he drove, people prayed.'"  haha heard it from an old guy at my dad's concert last sunday. (which by the way went well)  so anyways you megolomanics, you're no elvis. so get over yourselves and i'll see ya later.

      woot woot! i woke up at 10 this morning! must suck to be younger. hehe. i'm looking forward to sleeping in again all though i will hardly notice since i go to bed so late. lol.  the first half of the softball season is over (thank God) and our record was 2 and 10. that's 2 wins. anyways we won tonight. the bad part is that some freshman took my position... ;-( its not like we are a great team anyways lol. i'm hoping for all stars but i doubt it. maybe next year.  yesterday Vicki came over and we had a random photo shoot. vicki put on mere's uniform and we did some crazy stuff. if you'd like to see the results of our crazyness  urlLink click here .   i remembered a good joke from Alicia Ore. its great: "what do gay midgets come out of??? a cabinet"  school is getting so much harder! ahhh! i can't believe aaa gave us sooo much freaking history homework all due on thursday, test day. thankfully schutzpoo didn't have time to give us homework and i won't be seeing him tomorrow. unfortunately, that means he gets to double the homework load on thursday.  well its really late. i think i'll change the date on this post so no one (my family) can have evidence against me.  did you hear they found traces of water-related minerals on Mars? there was life there and i know it. i am the last of my kind. the last of the Martians. peace out earthlings.

      hey ya'll! it's been awhile.. i know.. i'm lazy...  woo hoo Opus is tomorrow and jazz band is playing the song with my solo!! well it's more like a counter solo... lol... brian has the solo and i just play in the background, but hey! i play!! please come! april 30 7pm @ van dyke united methodist! its probably too late to come now though for my future readers.  i'm worried about wind ensemble because we've just learned two brand new pieces in 8 days and we aren't doing so well on them. but oh well... it's just a concert.  ap exams are coming up and i'm a little nervous about them too. ohh well. life goes on. it's just more expensive. lol.  tomorrow after school we're going to sam ash because the repair guy thinks mere's flute has the wrong mouth piece which makes it out of tune. and vicki is buying a brand new openhole flute!! and i might buy a guitar or bass from vicki if she gets a free one! yay! this was the first year in several that i haven't gotten a guitar for my birthday.... it's ok.. i'll accept it two months late and i'll pay for it too. lol. i'm thinking i want to decorate one of my guitars with stickers or paint... besides i need a new bass cuz the neck is cracked real bad from when the robbers left it out in the rain a few years back.  mathematically yours, (noo) dorkishly yours, ? (nah).... ahh ha!  dreamalicously yours,     ~ME~ :-)

      ahhh nothing better than skipping a whole day of school, is there? now i have a ton of make up work to pay for my leisure.. darn that karma!  we had an awesome time on vacation in west virgina! i took a lot of pics and movies that i plan on putting on my site soon! that is, after i've caught up all my make up work...lol.  at the airport i was "randomly pre-selected" for a search. i had to take off my shoes and let them shake me down while they looked through my bags by hand. my family got to watch along with the millions of other people. i swear i'm innocent. at the other airport i was choosen again. you don't think i look like a terrorist do you? my mom was the one with a pocket knife key chain!! she "voluntarily" handed it over. what are the chances of a random selection of millions include me twice? i think they are age profiling me... maybe it was the hoodie but i difinitely don't resemble an Iraqi ( i hope ).   time for homework! nighty night kiddos!!

      yay! boy school sure gets stressful when you are only there two or three days a week like it's been for me for a while and next week too. i know i shouldn't miss so much school, but its fun. lol. you know what i'm talking about right? i hope...  speaking of hope, i heard one of my old favorite songs today: My Only Hope by Switchfoot but made famous by Mandy Moore in A Walk to Remember. i love that song!!! i ought to record it one of these days. its so beautiful!  anyways i'm still obsessed with Spider Solitaire! it totally rocks! we even put copys on the laptops with Win 2000 cuz we love it so much. i can't stop playing! lol!  Islands of Adventure was pretty awesome yesterday! The Hulk Tour was the coolest by far! too bad we didn't get a chance to ride Jaruassic Park! well its 11:54... time for another day. this is me, signing off - so long. lol

      it's good to be back, but we sure did have a blast. we won quite a few trophies and Tina won one for her solo in October! Six Flags was a little small but it was fun. I love rollercoasters! speaking of....  Wednesday i get to go to Islands of Adventure with my physics class! yay! well i've have quite a lot of make up work to catch up on, so i gotta go soon.  yay for dream! she guessed the song and she has claimed her prize! candy!! yum! I really love the old Bond movies. but i can't decide.... Pierce Brosnan or Sean Connery? hmmm probably Pierce... what do you guys think?? i'd make it a poll, but no one ever takes those things.   the pillows are whispering my name and my kitty's crying for me so i g2g homey g dawgs. peace out.

      finally the school year is coming to an end. this year was great. in fact, awesome. my life is really turning out to be great. hope yours is too.  i've learned a lot and come along way in many areas. i've made quite a few accomplishments and become an expert on certain things that would blow your mind. yeah it's a crazy life. i still have a lot more to learn though.  i'm gonna miss my junior year a lot. this summer should be pretty fun though. even though i will be gone most of june, i promise to keep blogging from north carolina.  i love this one song and i never knew the name of it till jake and dana helped me figure it out. smashing pumpkins - disarm. it makes me feel sad and i guess thats how i should feel looking back on what i'm leaving. but then again i'm going towards something far greater.  i've decided that i will adopt Socrate's philosophy permanently: "A intelligent man is a man that knows he knows nothing". how true is that? men do know nothing. women are sooo much smarter. lol. jk. but seriously i do know nothing. nothing of God, the cosmos, or how we exist. life's amazing. enjoy it. and peace out.

      everyday of this week it felt like friday and now tomorrow it will actually be friday!! yay! fridays just don't come fast enough.  well today i got another new cell number. i really hate prepaid. i wish i could keep my number. its soo not fair. stupid cell phone companies...  my mom got back from her buisness trip this evening! it was hard to get myself and my sister up and going at six o'clock this morning. ahhh. can't wait for the summer. sleeping til 2 30 sure is the life. lol.  anyways my classes for next year are all pretty much up in the air right now. showcase? jazz band? ap music theory? engineering? computer electronics? ap calculus bc? all of those classes are offered once so they're bound to conflict. also i probably didn't make showcase and band classes depend on who the new band director will be. only time will tell.  school is winding down and i'm wondering will i be sad on the last day? probably not. i just want school to be over with so i can have some fun and some sleep. speaking of, it's time to sleep. nighty night.

      i can not wait any longer for school to be done and over with. please Lord, let the summer come soon! just when classes seem to be winding down, new material and new units are introduced! dont forget tests too! OMG!  in engineering, we're doing this DNA lab which is insane, especially because half the class wasn't there for the lectures due to AP exams. and then he expects all the softmores to explain everything to us step by step. its crazy!!  so anyways instead of homework i have  been fiddling around with my site and blogger. i added a new menu to my site and a profile to blogger so check my  urlLink ">profile  out!! i really love this new blogger interface. it's soooo much better than all those loosers who use LiveJournal. LJ seems to be getting a pretty bad rep about boring unendless ranting. well maybe i do too, but at least i do it fashionably. lol. i saw an article in the paper about blogger today. i haven't found the time to read it yet though.  tonight was THE night! if you dont know, then go find a knife and put it through your heart because tonight was the One Tree Hill finale! OMG!!! (JK about that ya know)!! Haley and Nathan got married! Deb and Keith slept together and then her husband caught her. then while he was signing the divorce papers he gets a heartattack!!! good show, good show. what's so bad about teen soap operas anyways? i hear you scoffing at me! lol  last week was the season finale of the O.C. i was a little disappointed in that it wasn't too much of a cliff hanger. oh well.  i made a really good joke today. you had to have been there. now i pity you cuz you can't hear it. lol. ever wonder if laughter could cure cancer? me either. lol. and i dont wanna find out.  sooo all my shows are going to be reruns so i guess i can devote more time to updating my site and chatting with you people who are "theoretically supposed" to be reading this.  i'm thinking of writing a song with funny lines from my favorite movies, so if you have anything to add, please tell me. here's some: "run, forest, run" "its goooooood" "an african or a european swallow?" "second breakfast"... see if you can name those. heh. byes.

      all year long we worked extra hard in AP and what do we get to show for it? an exam grade. woo hoo. we should get money or something for all those history worksheets.   i know i haven't written in awhile, but obviously it's because i've been very busy studying. lol. i've been working on my site although the changes and future plans are not evident to you guys.  i cant wait for the summer. in the summer the computer is my very bestest friend. oh wait. its my bestest friend now too i suppose. it never stands me up or says no (although we have had our share of ups and downs). i always win our quarrels because alas - i am the one who has hands to unplug it. i built this guy over Christmas vacation and i must say, i'm happy with the results. at times i complain that the cpu is too slow but i know my comp has a good heart. our bonds grow stronger with each game of spider solitare. lol.... ok i'll stop now.  so anyways a Wrinkle in Time the movie is on tonight so i must quickly type five essays in five minutes so i can go watch it. yeah right, i know, i type slow. lol.  we get a new band diretor next year. i dont know if that a good thing or a bad thing. i guess we'll have to see. optimism - the goal of a perfectionist.  toodaloo my friends. hopefully i'll add more entries this month. i know i've kinda slacked off lately.

      the statement above is true. quite frankly i did enjoy ignoring my blog. but with ignorance comes abandonment. not only did my blog suffer, but also my site. so i've revamped everything! woo hoo! hope ya'll have fun wandering the dark corners of my mind... well actually, i don't really have any dark corners, maybe just a couple dim parts.. lol.  anyways, i am so happy that i got my radio.blog to work on the first try! it is soooo awesome! people, you should be listening to it right now!! maybe i should add the javascript to my blogger templates so you can listen while you read. ahh whatever, no one cares.  i also got a whole bunch of other cool stuff to work on my site: online counter, refresh counter, page load timer, adlibs, quizes, countdowns, logs, aim profile, random quotes, my anti-tablecloth society, and my favorite, a page dedicated to Mr. Schutz. It's not that I like him or not, or that he's a good teacher or not, it's just that three years has been a long time full of funny jokes. i don't wanna offend anyone, but rather give them a laugh but showcasing some of my friends' stuff. ahh what the heck just go  urlLink take a look  and laugh will ya? and if you happen to have anything else to add, feel free to let me know!  so where have i been? where have you been is more like it! i know you don't read this as often as you should. and yes, i hear you whining, "why don't you write more often? then i could have something to read?!" and blah blah blah. ok. i'm writing, you happy? wanna keep you people happy! geeze-oh-peezo! (hehe did i spell that right?)  so i've been out of town to the Montreat Youth Conference for a week and then to Maggie Valley for a week. other than that i have been working non-stop, ok maybe not, on my two online courses: personal fitness and economics honors. they sure are fun. at least i am only wasting five weeks of my life on them and everyone else has to waste five MONTHS for each course!!! haha!  don't forget to check out my new  urlLink site ! i'm going to post some pics of my trips soon. well as soon as i get caught up in my classes. ttfn you hooligans!

      yo!! just got back from three envigorating games of laser tag at Qzar!! i kinda sucked at first since i missed the briefing and i haven't played in almost 5 years! the last time i was there was in 7th grade for i think it was the Darrow twins' birthday party.  the last game i was TOP SCORER! wooo hoo! 14,000 points! my first round i got 7700 which sucked. anyways i ended up with a total of 65 hits to the other team!! they only got me 38 times! my hit ratio was pretty low considering i took 382 laser shots in 15 minutes. one thing that helped was that i hit up their base twice. mere hit it 7 times and didnt go after anyone and she came in second, so i think the base HQs give you mega bonus points.  yesterday we went to UNIVERSAL STUDIOS!!! it was awesome!!! the Revenge of the Mummy is definitely my favorite ride! the Terminator rocked and so did the jet ski show! MIB was ok. we didn't have time to ride Shrek... :-( but we had a blast!  i think today might have been my last day at Shriners. i dont know how i feel about it. i liked it better than last year. i dont think i'll miss it too much. lol.  school is coming waaaay to quickly. me sad. hopefully i'll wake up to shop tomorrow, which is in reality today lol bc it's 3am. tomorrow we are going with our youth group to stuff backpacks at Legends Field. and on Sat we get free tickets to the game. i'm babysitting on Friday, so i think i'm pretty busy. which is somewhat unfortunate b/c i need to read more of my summer reading junk.  hasta la byebye suckers!!!

       yay! i finished a week of band camp alive!!! Kajannae was there.. and i have a new freshies, Jessica. she's learning pretty quick. Friday really rocked! section leaders and officers filled up water balloons for the water balloon fight and we got to shoot squirt guns at the others during the drill down.    bad news:  sun burn !! we went jet skiing today and now my sunburn is in the shape of my life jacket!   good news: getting to be a pro at tubing off a jet ski! today was the first time i've ever fallen off. at the end of one ride, my dad swings the jet ski around to a stop so i can jump off and swim to shore, and once he did it so sharp and fast that i flew off the back and   skidded   on the water on my back for at least&nbsp;10 feet or so! it was awesome!!    i know i haven't written in a while. it was pretty stressful to cram in everything on my online courses. oh yeah, those turned out good. i got a 100% in economics honors and a 97% in personal fitness.   speaking of courses, i went thursday to get my schedule changed and that was a pain in the  @$$ . everything i want is during something else i want! so it looks like i'm going to be a TA and in law studies and sociology. not exactly what i had in mind, but it'll work.   yesterday i finally got my senior pictures!! i went way back in may and we sat in the waiting room for about 3 hours till they closed, so i'm glad i finally got it over with. after that i went to my cousin's baby's 2nd birthday party! Kate is getting soo big and cute!!   well this week is going to be really busy. tomorrow i'm going to the section leader's band practice. on tuesday we are going to   UNIVERSAL  ! we haven't decided about IOA or universal studios. i've been to IOA  waaay  too many times, but i would like to take my whole family there.    &nbsp;  so my sun burn is really killing me. hope you're chillin and feelin well. (PS - i'm really impressed at all my new posting options - hence the colors and stuff)

      i just got back from my first real rock concert, and it was totally awesome! i've been to hundreds of brass band and orchestra concerts, but never the real fireworks-streamers-blow-your-ears-out rock concert!   mere and i were wondering about the opening act and we couldn't find any info on it, so when it came time we were totally thrilled that it was EMERSON DRIVE!!! how awesome is that?! i got a lot of pics and movies of both bands and i plan to post them on my site when i get around to it.  the cool thing is.. my mom came home from work and told us her bank gave her some left over tickets in their box seats! so we got free $100 club seats and all you could eat and drink!! let me say this though, i did not take advantage of the open bar... lol. anyways, i can't wait to get my hearing back.  good news: going to the beach again tomorrow! had an awesome time at a parentless concert!! going to a plant sale tomorrow!!  bad news: falling behind in my online courses. rescheduled my senior pictures the same time as my cousin's baby's 2nd birthday party and they live in atlanta!  things just seem to go from extremes, don't they? anyways i'd really like to go see Incubus at the Forum in september and i think if i can get those club seats again my parents might let me go, despite the "stuff" that goes on b/c it's railed in.  i should've gotten a cowboy hat to bring to the concert! anywhooo, g'night y'all! hallar at yo ma!

      been busy upgrading everything - firefox .9, cutenews 1.3.2, new links page, ... just about the only thing that hasn't been upgraded is my grades... lol. i'm having trouble focusing on my online courses, imagine that. surf the net for the almighty wisdom, or... work on my economics homework??   funny-quote-taken-out-of-context of the day: "Unfortunately, most people don't like it when you tell them they're wrong, and will call you names upon trying to convince them. Simply by telling the truth you will make yourself unpopular, which puts you on the same level as politicians, and I don't like that."  anyways, i have been thinking about my site...hmm, still thinking.. ok. well the thing is, i like themes. they rock. i want to make a really good one for my site, but i dont know exactly what everyone else would like to look at. i know we cant all agree. i guess i should just do what i want and express myself through the art of web design. (i know, that was corny. hehe) previously i've starred my favorite rubber froggy, Hershal. he used to be on my menu and be your cursor over links, and he still is my favicon, although you can never see those things in IE!!! more recently i've had my candle monkey, Roofus, guest star on my news page. at the moment, i have a pic of my guitar as my header with lyrics to my fave song, Let that be Enough - Switchfoot. but those themes i guess are old, so here's my new idea:  my favorite show is I Love Lucy! i'm thinking of buying ilovemarcy.com! and then i can make an i love lucy theme! too corny? maybe. but it sounds cool right? original? yes maybe, i think i've lost my mind. ok then, i'll see if roofus.com is available. maybe i'll make a poll about the new theme.... i dunno what do you think? should i poll you? now i'm polling you about what i should poll you about! now that's desperate.  speaking of desperate, i've just run into fred durst's xanga journal! crazy stuff man. he is sensitive and poetic. who wooda thunk it? not i!  anyways blogger has been really nice to me and offered me to beta test gmail! so email me now at marchica (at) gmail.com. the shower is calling, so i bid you adieu my fellow bloggism-readers.
